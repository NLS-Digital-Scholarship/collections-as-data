Introduction
Britain 1979 is the thirtieth official handbook in the series
prepared and revised each year by Reference Division of the
Central Office of Information. The contents are based on
information available up to September 1 978. The handbook is
widely known as an established work of reference and is the
mainstay of the reference facilities provided by the British
Information Services in many countries. It is distributed over¬
seas in a limited free edition and is on sale by Her Majesty's
Stationery Office throughout the world.
Britain 1979 is primarily concerned to describe the machi¬
nery of government and other institutions, together with the
necessary physical and social background, and to show the
part played by government in the life of the country. It does
not attempt an analytical approach to current events.
The factual and statistical information it contains is com¬
piled with the co-operation of other government departments
and agencies, and of many other organisations. Sources of
more detailed and more topical information (including statis¬
tics) are mentioned in the text and in the Bibliography
towards the end of the book.

THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
Britain, formally known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, constitutes the greater part of the British Isles, a group of islands
lying off the north-west coast of mainland Europe. The largest islands are
Great Britain (comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland)
and Ireland (comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west
are the Isles of Scilly; off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is
fringed by numerous islands and to the north-east are the Orkneys and Shet-
Tands. All these have administrative ties with the mainland, but the Isle of Man
in the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and France
have a large measure of administrative autonomy and are not part of England,
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.

Care should be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they
refer to England, to England and Wales (considered together for many adminis¬
trative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which comprises England,
Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern
Ireland) as a whole. United Kingdom statistics and other data occasionally
include the Isle of Man, 588 square km (227 sq miles), and the Channel
Islands, 194 square km (75 sq miles).
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old observatory at Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost point
of Northern Ireland is 8° 10' West. It is just under 1,000 km (some 600 miles)
from the south coast to the extreme north of mainland Britain and just under
500 km (some 300 miles) across in the widest part. There are numerous bays
and inlets and no place is as much as 120 km (75 miles) from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are shallow—usually less than 90
metres (50 fathoms or 300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental
shelf. To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges
2

Topography
abruptly from 180 metres (some 600 feet) to 900 metres (about 3,000 feet).
These shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing
grounds as well as breeding grounds for fish. The North Atlantic current, the
drift of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads
out over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The
effect of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite its small area, Britain contains rocks of all the main geological periods.
In general, the oldest rocks appear in the highland regions in the north and
west, and the youngest in the lowland areas in the south and east. This is mainly
the result of persistent slow sinking over many millions of years in the south and
east accompanying the formation of the deep North Sea and English Channel
sedimentary basins.
Beneath the lowland areas in the south and east of England lie the younger
rocks. The harder chalk and limestone formations stand out as ranges of low,
grass-covered hills (rarely reaching 300 metres, 1,000 feet, above sea level)
separated by clay vales of rich farm land. These younger formations rest on an
old volcanic foundation present at a depth of a few hundred metres under much
of central England. This volcanic foundation, containing the oldest British
fossils, comes to the surface as craggy hillocks in north-west Leicestershire.
At greater depths beneath southern England lies the continuation of the older
rock formations of Belgium and the Rhineland.
The south-western peninsula of England, mainly the counties of Devon and
Cornwall, is composed of very old slate and sandstone formations into which
has been forced a large mass of metal-bearing granite whose outcrops now
form most of the high ground such as Dartmoor.
Still older rocks form most of the mountainous and hilly terrain in Wales,
the English Lake District, the southern uplands of Scotland and the southern
border counties of Northern Ireland.1 These rocks were subjected to com¬
pressions 400 million years ago which folded the strata and turned muddy
sediment into slate. In Wales and the Lake District thick volcanic formations,
eroded by rivers and Ice-Age glaciers, form spectacular mountain scenery.
Carboniferous limestone formations form the Mendip Hills, south of
Bristol, and the Pennines range in northern England. In Scotland similar
strata of a partly volcanic character underlie the midland valley. These and
other carboniferous strata contain the coal measures which were the founda¬
tion of British industrial expansion. The outcrops and shallow seams of coal
which have now largely been exhausted were found on the edge of the pilains
and up the valleys leading to the high land. Most of the present deep coal
workings lie underneath the fertile lowlands. The continental shelf under the
North Sea contains large, exploitable quantities of oil and natural gas.
The Scottish Highlands are built from very thick formations of crystalline
rock, now deeply eroded, which was deposited between 1,000 million and
500 million years ago. Far older rocks, including the oldest in Britain, emerge
from beneath the Highlands on the north-western seaboard of Scotland and
in the Outer Hebrides, forming barren and rocky land. On the mainland of
Scotland a cover of red sandstone between 800 million and 1,000 million years
old has been partly eroded, leaving imposing isolated peaks.
Extensive areas in Antrim in Northern Ireland and in the islands of the Inner
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 1,342 metres (4,406 feet); in Wales,
Snowdon, 1,085 metres (3,560 feet); and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District,
Cumbria), 978 metres (3,210 feet). The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve
Donard, 852 metres (2,796 feet).
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
3
Hebrides are composed of volcanic lava flows which erupted 50 million to
60 million years ago when the North Atlantic Ocean was in the process of
opening out. The lavas and the roots of the volcanoes which fed them are deeply
eroded into wild mountain scenery.
The landscape of Britain is mainly the result of cycles of uplift and erosion
in the past 25 million years, culminating in the last Ice Age. Around 750,000
years ago great glaciers built up in the mountainous areas of Britain and
Scandinavia and spread out as ice-sheets into the lowland areas. The moun¬
tains and the valleys were formed by the glaciers while the ice sheets deposited
. a thick blanket of boulder clay, gravel and sand over the lowlands north of a
line from Bristol to London. Large lakes of meltwater held back by the ice
gradually dried up, leaving deposits of sand and silt. Throughout much of the
country the blanket of glacial debris affords soils of great fertility.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, parti¬
cularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of the highland area often reach the
coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the coast of south-west Wales;
the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the coast of Cumbria; and the vertically
jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides. Even
around the lowlands there are striking contrasts. In some parts the soft,
white limestone—the chalk—forms white cliffs as at Dover and in the Needles
off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the south and south-east coastline
have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern coast of England between the
Humber and the Thames estuary is mostly low-lying, and for centuries some
stretches of it have been protected against the sea by embankments.
The marked tidal movement around the shores of Britain sweeps away much
of the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of
the short British rivers1 valuable as natural harbours.
Climate Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. The prevailing winds are
south-westerly and the weather from day to day is controlled mainly by a
succession of depressions from the Atlantic. The weather is subject to frequent
changes but to few extremes of temperature. Although the winds are largely
determined by those of the eastern Atlantic, occasionally during the winter
months easterly winds may bring cold, dry, weather which, once established,
may persist for many days or even weeks. During the summer months the
Azores high pressure system usually extends its influence north-eastwards
towards north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course,
often passing entirely to the north of the country.
Winds South-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an easterly
direction the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south-
westerlies although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the
spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may
differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography. Winds
are generally stronger in the north than in the south, stronger on the coasts
than inland, and stronger in the west than in the east. The strongest winds
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only about 354 and
338 km (220 and 210 miles) long respectively; those in Scotland (the Tay and the Clyde)
about 188 km and 170 km (117 and 106 miles) long.

usually occur in the winter; the average speed at Lerwick, Shetland Islands,
varies from about 29 km/h (18 mph) in January to about 19 km/h (12 mph)
in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of London,
the average speed varies from about 15 km/h (9 mph) in January to about
12 km/h (7 mph) in August. The stormiest region is along the north-west
coast with over 40 gales a year; south-east England and the east Midlands
are the least stormy, with gales occurring on about 2 days a year inland and
on some 10 to 15 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level in the west the mean annual temperature ranges from 8°C
(46°?) in the Hebrides to ii°C (52°F) in the extreme south-west of England;
latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The mean monthly tempera¬
ture in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges from 3°C (°37F)
during the winter (December, January and February) to i2°C (54T) during
the summer (June, July and August): the corresponding figures for the
Isle of Wight, in the extreme south, are 5°C (4i°F) and i6°C (6i°F). During a
normal summer, the temperature occasionally rises above 30°C (86°F) in the
south, but temperatures of 32°C (90°F) and above are infrequent. Minimum
temperatures depend largely on local conditions, but —10 C (i4cF) may
occur on a still, clear winter’s night in inland areas. Lower temperatures are
rare.
Britain has an annual rainfall of about 1,100 mm (over 40 inches), while Eng¬
land alone has some 830 mm (about 33 inches). The geographical distribution
of annual rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the
Atlantic, the mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain
than the lowlands of the south and east. Between 3>800 and 5,000 mm (roughly
150-200 inches) of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon, the Lake District
and north-west Scotland during the average year, whereas some places in the
south-east of England record less than 500 mm (about 20 inches). Rain is fairly
well distributed throughout the year, but, on the average, March to June are
the driest months and October to January the wettest. A period of as long as
three weeks without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to limited areas.
The distribution of sunshine shows a general decrease from south to north,
a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During May,
June and July (the months of longest daylight) the mean daily duration
of sunshine varies from five hours in northern Scotland to eight hours in the
Isle of Wight; during the months of shortest daylight—November, December
and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a
day in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and two hours a day on the
south coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter. Fogs have become less frequent and less severe as a result of changes
in fuel usage and the operation of clean air legislation. In London, for example,
the frequency of dense fogs in winter is about half what it was 20 years ago.
Many parts of the surface of highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with
the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of
Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valleys and the plains where soils are deeper and richer;
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

Fauna
villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of heath and forest, almost the whole
of lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except
where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage
has been developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation the
fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and part of East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably covered
the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands, forests
of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moorland.
In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively diminished
and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry Commission
in the past 50 years, woodlands now occupy only about 8 per cent of the land
area, d he greatest density of woodland occurs in northern Britain, in some
parts of south-east England and on the Welsh border. Yet much of Britain
appears to be wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees.
The most common trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine
and birch. The number of elms, especially in southern England, has been
severely reduced since the late 1960s by ‘Dutch’ elm disease.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton grass
in the wetter parts. About 82 per cent of Great Britain however is used for
agriculture (including rough grazing land) with most of the prime farming
land in England. The amount of land in urban use is less than a tenth of the
amount of agricultural land.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or fences and,
especially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a
pattern of contrasting colour. The removal of hedges to facilitate mechanical
farming has resulted in a more open landscape in certain parts of the country.
The cool temperate climate and the even distribution of rainfall ensure a
long growing season; streams rarely dry up, grassland is green throughout
the year with many wild flowers from spring to autumn; in most years there
is scarcely a month without some flowers in hedgerows and woodlands.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of the rest of north¬
western Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals,
including the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct;
but red deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands
and on Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in
Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow deer (which
are probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks and are wild
in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen; there are
foxes in most rural (and many semi-urban) areas, and otters are found along
many rivers and streams. Common and grey seals may be seen on parts of the
coast, though not usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include mice,
rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey much more
numerous than the native red), hares, rabbits, weasels and stoats.
About 460 species of birds have been recorded in the British Isles. Some 200
species breed; the rest are regular migrants to, or pass through, the country, or
are casual stragglers. Visitors to Britain are often struck by the abundance,
6
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
variety and tameness of song birds in towns and villages. The pigeon, blackbird
and chaffinch are widely distributed but sparrows usually predominate near
houses. London and some other large towns have huge flocks of starlings which
congregate to roost on buildings, especially in winter. Most species of birds
have maintained their numbers over the last few decades, owing to their
success in adapting themselves to man-made surroundings, and in London
there has been an increase in the number of species breeding as a result of the
improvement in the environment brought about by anti-pollution measures.
Some large birds, on the other hand, have tended to decrease, but several
species, such as the osprey and the ruff, have re-established themselves after
disappearing from Britain in the nineteenth century.
Many species of gulls and other sea birds nest around the coast, and gulls
may regularly be seen feeding far inland; some nest in inland sites such as
gravel pits and sewage farms. The drainage and reclamation of marshlands
have diminished the natural habitat of ducks, geese and other aquatic birds,
but the survival of such species is largely assured on the nature reserves and
bird sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
About 30 kinds of freshwater fish are found, salmon, trout, pike, roach,
dace and perch being widely distributed. Stocks of trout, rainbow trout (an
introduced species), carp, tench and roach are frequently supplemented by
iatroductions for angling purposes. In a number of rivers measures to control
pollution have resulted in fish becoming more numerous. In the Thames in
London, for example, where pollution levels have been reduced to a quarter
of those in the 1950s, over 90 kinds of fish have been found, compared with
only one in 1958.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Most British
reptiles and amphibians are indigenous but at least one, the marsh frog, has
been recently introduced from continental Europe. Ireland has no snakes.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects. Among the largest
are the rare swallowtail butterfly (8-10 cm, 3-4 inches) and the stag beetle
(6 cm, 2| inches). The insect fauna is less varied than that of continental
Europe and lacks a number of common European species. With modern
methods of pest control, extensive insect damage to crops or timber and
serious outbreaks of diseases spread by insects are not common but there is
some anxiety that chemical protection against insects may be reducing the
population of creatures which feed on them, and of their predators in turn.
These and other effects of agricultural chemicals on wildlife are the subject
of special safeguards.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit Britain are descended mainly from the people
who inhabited the area nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were
the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after
settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating
their language and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in 1066.

early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen,
including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English, Scots, Welsh and
Irish. Over most of England and the lowlands of Scotland the language which
soon came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Corn¬
wall, the Isle of Man, the highlands of Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not enable any precise estimates to be made of the
size of population or of the extent or direction of population movement until
the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the
end of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about 2 million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century reasonable contemporary estimates
put the population at about 6| million. The main factor in this gradual
growth of population was a slow natural increase, with high death rates and,
in particular, very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration from
the continent of Europe has been an influence at certain times and immigra¬
tion from Commonwealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century there is relatively plentiful
and reliable information about the British people—their number, sex,
age, geographical distribution, births, marriages, deaths, occupations,
language, and family structure. Most of it comes from two main sources: the
regular flow of statistical information based on compulsory registration of
births, marriages and deaths, and the periodic censuses taken regularly every
ten years since 1801 (because of war there was no census in 1941). The last
census was in 1971; the next will be held in 1981.
Britain’s estimated mid-1977 home population was 55,852,000 (see Table 2,
below). The populations of the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey and associ¬
ated islands are about 56,000,72,000 and 53,000 respectively. In 1975,1976 and

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Birth Rates
Mortality
1977 for the first years since records began (other than in war) the population
fell slightly. This trend, common to much of western Europe, is mainly the
result of a sharp fall in the birth rate (see below). Births in 1977 jus^ ou*>
numbered deaths but the direction of net migration, as in other recent years,
was outward.
The total population of New Commonwealth and Pakistani ethnic origin
(including children born in Britain and children with only one parent of
such ethnic origin) was i-S million in 1977, about 3-4 per cent of the total
population of Great Britain.
Now that population growth has, for the time being at least, stopped, many
official policies, such as those on housing, the planning of the new towns and
the supply of school teachers, have been re-examined in the light of the impli¬
cations, for the short term, of a static or declining population.
Projections for the future suggest that the traditional increase in population
will continue, though at a much slower rate than was expected a few years
ago. Britain’s total population is expected, on 1977 estimates, to be about 56
million in 1986, 57-5 million in 2001 and 58-3 million in 2017.
The country as a whole has a population density of about 229 people to the
square kilometre (593 per square mile), but in England the figures are 355
people to the square kilometre (920 per square mile), and in London 4,411
people per square kilometre (11,432 per square mile).
Annual births have fallen by some 33 per cent since the mid-1960s. The birth
rate has declined from 18 live births per 1,000 people in 1966 to ii-8 in
1977, an unprecedentedly low figure. The most recent information suggests
that the fall in the birth rate may be coming to an end. The number of births
in 1977 was 656,000 (compared with 980,000 in 1966), of which about 10 per
cent were illegitimate.
Several factors may have contributed to this change. Family planning, par¬
ticularly the use by women of the contraceptive pill, has become more wide¬
spread, and sterilisation of men and women has also become more common. An
appreciable proportion of pregnancies outside marriage and of pregnancies to
older women are ended by legal abortion.
There are indications that the proportion of childless marriages may be
increasing a little, and for marriages which do produce children there is a
continuing tendency for the interval between marriage and the first birth to
be longer. The numbers of third and later children born have fallen sub¬
stantially. The biggest falls have been in the births of third and later children to
manual workers, but the pattern is similar for all social classes. A rise in first and
second births to professional families appears to be an exception, but may be
due to an increase in the number of families in those groups.
The fertility of women born overseas, particularly those from the Irish
Republic, the West Indies and the Indian sub-continent, was higher on
average in 1971 than that of the indigenous population, but has since been
falling. The population of New Commonwealth and Pakistani ethnic origin
contains a larger proportion of young people than the indigenous population
and so contributes disproportionately to the number of births.
At birth the expectation of life for a man is just over 69 years and for a
woman it is nearly 76 years. The corresponding expectations in 1901 were
48 years for men and 52 years for women. The improving health of the
population has mainly had the effect of increasing young people’s chances of
reaching the older age groups. Life expectancy in the older age groups has
increased relatively little.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
9
Migration
The general death rate has remained about the same for the past 50 years,
at about 12 per 1,000 population, but this figure takes no account of the
ageing population, and at every age there has been a considerable decline in
mortality—particularly among children and young adults.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising
standards of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical
facilities, improved health measures, better working conditions, education in
personal hygiene, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the
strain on mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from tuberculosis is a tiny fraction of what it was in the mid¬
nineteenth century, and mortality from acute infectious diseases in infancy
has virtually been eliminated. The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants
under one year old per 1,000 live births) was 14-5 in 1976; neonatal mortality
(deaths of infants under four weeks old per 1,000 live births) was 9-9; and
maternal mortality was 0-13 per 1,000 live births.

The mortality from each major cause often reflects factors directly linked
to occupation and the wide variations between the life patterns and living
standards of the different social classes.
Traditionally Britain has a net outflow of people to the rest of the world
(net loss by migration between 1871 and 1931 for instance was about 4
million) though there have been exceptional periods—in the 1930s when there
was a considerable flow of refugees from continental Europe, and in the late
I95os and early 1960s, mainly the result of a large influx of people from
the West Indies and the Indian sub-continent.
The traditional pattern of migration in Britain has been maintained in the
past few years.
Between 1967 and 1976 Britain lost about half a million people by migration:
10

and Divorce
Age Structure
Distribution of
Population
2*6 million emigrants and 2-1 million immigrants; in both totals about a third
of the people were returning to their country of origin.
There are about 6 per cent more male than female births every year. Because
of the higher mortality of men at all ages, however, there is a turning point,
at about 45 years of age, at which the number of women exceeds the number
of men. This imbalance increases with age so that there is a preponderance
of women among the elderly. In the population as a whole there are more
than 105 females to every 100 men.
Marriage trends since the 1930s have been towards a higher proportion of
people marrying and an earlier age pattern. The proportion of the population
of Great Britain who are or have been married has risen from about 52 per
cent in 1939 to 59-4 per cent in 1976, while the proportion of single persons
in the population aged 15 years or over has fallen from 33-3 per cent to 23’1
per cent. This change has been due mainly to an increase in marriage rates
among men and women in their late teens and early twenties although recent
years suggest that the trend towards early marriage may not be continuing.
The average ages of people marrying for the first time in 1976 were roughly
25 for men and 23 for women, compared with ages half a year younger in
I970-
Changes in the law and social attitudes have made divorce easier, and the
number of divorces in the 1970s has increased sharply. In 1976 about 10
decrees of divorce were made absolute for every 1,000 married people in
England and Wales. If current divorce rates were to continue, the proportion
of future marriages which would ultimately end in divorce would come to at
least a fifth. The average age of people at the time of divorce in England and
Wales is about 38 for men and 36 for women. Remarriage rates among younger
divorced people are high, and births in remarriage are likely to become a more
important component of total births in the future.
The estimated age distribution of the British population in mid-1977 was
roughly as follows: under 15 years, about 22 per cent; 15-64, 63 per cent;
and 65 and over, 14 per cent. Some 17 per cent of the population were over
the normal retirement ages (65 for men and 60 for women).
The changing age structure has for the time being produced a balance
between those who are primarily producers of resources and those who are
primarily consumers that is more unfavourable than at any time since the
early 1930s. This ‘dependency ratio’ of children and older people to the size of
the population of working age is, however, projected to fall from 67 per cent in
1976 to 58 per cent in 2001. This will be the result principally of the decreasing
proportion of children in the population.
Perhaps the main feature of the changing age structure is the increasing
number of elderly people, reflecting birth patterns in the early years of the
century and the final decades of the nineteenth. Between mid-1970 and mid-
1977 the number of people over the normal retirement ages rose by 8 per cent.
Proportionately there was a particularly large increase in the number of
people aged 85 and over, 20-5 per cent over the same period.
The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that of all
other parts of Britain. The distribution of the British population by country,
is shown in Table 2 on p 7.
The standard regions of England, sub-divisions of the country used for

the population lives in a belt across England with south Lancashire and
West Yorkshire at one end, and the London area at the other, having the
industrialised Midlands at its centre. Other areas with large populations are:
the central lowlands of Scotland; north-east England from north of the
river Tyne down to the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the

English Channel coast from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely populated
areas are the eastern fringes of England between the Wash and the Thames
estuary, and the far south-west. The seven major metropolitan areas which
have been denoted as ‘conurbations’ in successive population censuses accom¬
modate a third of Great Britain’s people while comprising less than three per
cent of the total land area. They are: Greater London, Central Clydeside, Mer¬
seyside, South East Lancashire, Tyneside, the West Midlands and West York¬
shire. Most of the mountainous parts including much of Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland and the central Pennines in northern England, are very
sparsely populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
widening. There has been a geographical redistribution of the population from
Scotland and the northern regions of England to East Anglia, the South-West
and the East Midlands. The proportion resident in Greater London and most
of the metropolitan counties of England has recently been falling. People,
particularly the young and skilled, have tended to leave city centres and
conurbations, although such migration may not necessarily mean a change of
job but rather an increase in the distance of travel to and from work.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
was spoken by 21 per cent of the population (some 542,000 people) aged three
years and over at the time of the 1971 census. The Welsh Language Council, an
12
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Immigration
Control and
Nationality
official body, promotes the use of the language. The Welsh Language Act 1967
affirms the equal validity of Welsh with English in the administration of justice
and conduct of government business throughout Wales. The number of
bilingual schools is increasing. In Scotland some 88,000 persons in I97I>
mainly in the Highlands and western coastal regions, were able to speak the
Scottish form of Gaelic. A few families in Northern Ireland still speak the
Irish form of Gaelic. The Cornish variety of Celtic is no longer effectively
a living language, although there is a revival of cultural interest.
Some of the country’s ethnic minorities have their own languages, normally
as well as English. Among the Asian community, for example, the most usual
languages are Punjabi, Gujarati, Bengali or Urdu.
Immigration into Britain is controlled by the Immigration Act 1971. The Act
confers a right of abode—and exemption from control—on citizens of the
United Kingdom and Colonies who are connected with Britain by birth,
adoption, naturalisation or registration or are children or grandchildren of such
persons, on citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who
have been resident in Britain for a continuous period of five years, and on
Commonwealth citizens with a parent born in the United Kingdom. Those
having this right of abode are known as ‘patrials’. In general, others wishing
to enter Britain for employment must hold work permits. Exceptions are.
Commonwealth citizens with a grandparent born in Britain, certain permit-
free categories, and nationals of European Community countries. The
dependants of work permit holders and of those who may enter without work
permits may also be admitted.
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, people born in the United King¬
dom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a ship or aircraft registered in the
United Kingdom, or a territory which is still a colony, are, with insignificant
exceptions, citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth. Citizenship
may also be acquired: by descent from a father who is himself a citizen
otherwise than by descent and, in certain specified circumstances, from a
father who is a citizen by descent only; by registration, for citizens of
Commonwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor children
and for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies; in
consequence of a United Kingdom adoption order; and, for aliens, by naturali¬
sation. The requirements for naturalisation include five years’ residence in the
United Kingdom or Colonies, good character, a sufficient knowledge of English
and the intention to reside in the United Kingdom or a colony. The require¬
ments for registration are similar except that most Commonwealth and Irish
citizens settled in Britain by 1973 have the right to be registered after complet¬
ing five years’ ordinary residence without satisfying any other requirement.
Over 27,500 people acquired citizenship by naturalisation and registration
in 1977.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizenship
by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another country
(although he can lose it automatically if the territory from which he derives it
becomes independent); nor does a woman who is a citizen of the United King¬
dom and Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to a foreign national.
Indeed, a citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship against his will except
in very exceptional circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisation
or registration as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is,
however, at liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the
nationality or citizenship of another country.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
!3
Homes and the
Environment
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens and, as such, enjoy
full political and civic rights if resident in Britain.
The Government has suggested for public discussion various ways in which
the law on nationality might be changed.
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
This section gives some points of general interest about household structure and
social characteristics in Britain as a background to the information given in later
chapters. It deals with topics in very broad and informal terms and many
exceptions apply to the generalisations.
The way of life of the people of Britain has been changing rapidly throughout
the twentieth century. As in many other countries underlying causes include
two major wars, a lower birth rate, longer expectation of life, a higher divorce
rate, widening educational opportunities and technical progress, particularly
in communications and transport and a better standard of living. One of the
features of the change in social attitudes has been the development of a more
informed tolerance of others’ behaviour and an unwillingness to penalise
individuals with particular problems. Relationships between the generations,
.too, are changing, and young people are more ready to criticise traditional
values and institutions and to seek greater influence in shaping society.
The following account applies primarily to Great Britain. Many of the
same factors are at work in Northern Ireland but their effect is modified by
both the Province’s history and the emergency of recent years.
The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live in private households (in families
or on their own). The remainder include residents in hotels, and people in the
armed services and in educational or other institutions. Of approximately
27-5 million married people at the time of the 1971 population census about
25 million were estimated to be married couples living together in some
I2'5 million separate families containing some 46 million people, the remainder
living either on their own or with other persons or families, except for a small
number living in institutions. Nearly 8 million of the families, comprising
32 million people, contained a married couple and their children or grand¬
children. There were, in addition, 1*2 million families consisting of a parent
living with children or grandchildren. About half, mostly women, were
bringing up between them about 1 million dependent children j the rest were
living with adult children or grandchildren.
The average size of households has continued to fall progressively, from over
four persons in 1911 to 3*i in 1961 and 2'8 in i97^‘ ^ is estimated that in 1976
21 per cent of households consisted of one person only, 32 per cent of two,
17 per cent of three, 17 per cent of four and 13 per cent of five or more. However,
about half of the small households (one or two persons) contained a person over
60 years old while of the remaining 40 per cent about half were older people
and couples whose children had left home, and the other half consisted of
young couples.
Four British households out of five live in houses rather than flats. Terraced
housing, most of it built in the early years of the present century, still provides
accommodation for over a quarter of all households. In inner urban areas,
which have increasing priority in the Government’s housing and planning
policies, slum clearance and redevelopment have been major features of
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
14
post-1945 public housing programmes, but, with help from public funds,
the modernisation and conversion of sub-standard housing has increasingly
been encouraged as an alternative to clearing and rebuilding. Emphasis in new
building is on low-rise, high density layouts, often incorporating gardens or
patios. Nearly half of Britain’s housing stock has been built since 1945.
The main housing development of the past 50 to 60 years, however, has been
suburban. Many British families now live in houses grouped in small
terraces, or semi-detached or detached, usually of two storeys with gardens,
and providing two main ground-floor living rooms, a kitchen, from two to four
bedrooms, a bathroom, and one or two lavatories. Many such houses, built
in the 1920s and 1930s, are located in ‘ribbon development’ along main roads,
but recent patterns have involved housing estates set back from the main
thoroughfares with amenities such as health and community centres.
Housing standards are continually improving; some 93 per cent of house¬
holds in Great Britain have exclusive use of a bath or shower, and 97 per cent
sole use of a lavatory—high percentages by international standards. Most
housing built nowadays is centrally heated. About 54 Per cent °f British house¬
holds have a telephone, 56 per cent have the use of one or more cars, 49 per
cent some form of central heating, 88 per cent a refrigerator, 71 per cent a
washing machine, 22 per cent a deep freeze and 3 per cent a dish washer.
Over half of all families now own their own homes, though half of these home
owners still have further repayments of mortgages to make. Most of the other
households rent an unfurnished house or flat either from a local authority
(an increasing trend) or from a private landlord (a falling trend). People in
unskilled manual jobs are more likely to live in rented accommodation,
particularly local authority housing, than people in non-manual occupations.
One-third of all families move house every five years.
An important influence on the planning of housing and services has been
the growth of car ownership. Greater access to motorised transport and the
construction of a network of modern trunk roads and motorways have resulted
in a considerable increase in personal mobility and changed leisure patterns, as
well as changes in the design of housing and shopping areas. Most detached
or semi-detached houses in new suburban estates have garages, and out-of-
town shopping centres, frequently including large supermarkets, are often
specially planned for the motorist and offer an alternative to shopping in the
centres of older towns. The 32 new towns and the ‘expanding towns’ (generally
seen as one of the most successful achievements of British planning since
1945) have set high standards in accommodating people and traffic.
The growth in car ownership has brought very great benefits but also a
number of problems, notably, in many towns and cities, increased congestion,
noise and air pollution. Public transport, too, has been affected, and many
services have been reduced or eliminated, especially in rural areas. The people
without access to a car include those among the poorer sections of the com¬
munity, or the elderly or infirm; mobility allowances help the disabled.
Priority to ensure the maintenance of the remaining essential public transport
services is a feature of the Government’s transport policy, and special fare
concessions are made for groups such as old age pensioners and invalids.
In a densely populated modern industrial society there is much scope
for conflict between the need for communal facilities and the desire to
preserve existing beauty or places of historic interest, and between potential
users of a new service and people whose way of life is threatened by the need to
accommodate it. As a result the activities of the established amenity societies,
such as the National Trust and the Council for the Protection of Rural England,
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
15
The Economic
and Social
Pattern
are supplemented to a growing extent by those of groups formed expressly to
safeguard the amenities of a particular area and to publicise the views of the
people they represent.
Growing public concern about the dangers both to health and to the natural
environment which can be caused by the disposal of industrial and human
waste, by exhaust fumes and by the rising volume of noise is reflected in the
appointment by the Government of a standing Royal Commission on Environ¬
mental Pollution, a Clean Air Council and an Advisory Council on Noise.
Voluntary societies include the National Society for Clean Air, the Noise
Abatement Society, the Keep Britain Tidy Group, Friends of the Earth, and
the Council for Nature.
Marked improvements in the standard of living have taken place during the
twentieth century. Nonetheless considerable inequalities of income and
wealth, among them regional disparities, remain. The gap between social
classes in such matters as infant mortality rates, educational progress, working
conditions and ill-health remains wide. There has been a long-term tendency
to a reduction in the proportion of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, and
an increasing number of people in professional or managerial occupations are
children of manual workers.
The working population comprises nearly half the total population. For a
long period an increase in real earnings was a principal factor in British
working and social life. Between 1950 and 1975 real personal disposable
income1 more than doubled to ^41,625 million, an average annual rise of 4‘4
per cent. It fell by about 0-2 per cent in i97^> and by about 1 per cent in 1977.
The combined effect of the tax system and the receipt of transfer payments
and direct and indirect benefits in kind is to redistribute incomes on a more
equal basis. Changes in the distribution of income between the late 1950s and
I974_75 were not very pronounced, but there had been an almost continuous
decline in the share of the top 5 per cent of income recipients from about
20 per cent of income before tax in 1959 to just under 17 per cent in 1974-75,
accounted for largely by the drop in the share of the top 1 per cent from about
8 per cent to 6 per cent over the same period. (The fall in the share of the top
1 per cent since 193^39 had been about two-thirds.) The share of the bottom
20 per cent had increased between 1959 and 1975 from 5-3 to 6-2 per cent.
However, more recently during a period of inflation and wages restraint when
the standards of living of all income groups have been falling, those of higher
income groups have tended to fall more, and customary differentials between
higher and lower employment incomes have been reduced.
There is very little knowledge about long-term trends in the distribution
of wealth, but such estimates as there are show a substantial fall in the
share owned by the richest people in the community. In 1975 about 24 per
cent of personal wealth was owned by the top 1 per cent of the adult popula¬
tion, and over 76 per cent by the top 20 per cent. The value of state pension
rights has an especially marked effect on these figures; it lowers the share of
the top 1 per cent by a third while the share of the bottom 80 per cent of the
adult population is increased by two-thirds. The proportion of personal wealth
held in the form of physical assets rose from less than a third in i960 to almost
50 per cent in 1975, reflecting especially the increasing importance of dwellings.
There has been a marked decline in the relative importance of company securi¬
ties in the composition of personal wealth.

The Role of
Women
BRITAIN 1979: an OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The volume of consumer spending in Britain has increased little in the past
two or three years, after allowing for inflation, although there were signs
of growth in early 1978. Over the period 1970-76 there were significant
changes in the pattern of expenditure. Consumers’ expenditure on food
remained fairly level, but that on alcoholic drink, particularly wines and
spirits, increased substantially. By contrast, expenditure on tobacco in 1976
was below the 1970 level. A large increase in spending on radio and electrical
goods was mainly due to people buying colour televisions, and well over half
the television broadcast licences are issued for colour sets. Expenditure on
television rental, too, more than doubled, while that on admission to cinemas,
theatres, spectator sports and the like increased by about 15 per cent.
Some 11-5 million visitors to Britain in 1977, a record number, spent a total
of ^2,179 million. This expenditure has increased dramatically, and, although
little is known about visitors’ spending patterns, it is likely that most of the
increase was on meals and accommodation and on items such as clothing and
footwear. It therefore presumably helped to keep up real expenditure levels
when spending by British residents was, at most, rising slowly.
The general level of nutrition is high. The movement towards a greater use of
convenience (including frozen) foods, and imported foods in the 1960s, has been
partly offset by a reversion to a slightly less expensive diet. The last 20 years
or so have seen a gradual decline in total food supplies per person, which is
regarded as consistent with reductions in physical activity and the greater
proportion of less active people in the population. The trend is common to
most developed countries. A greater willingness to try unfamiliar foods has
given rise to a wider availability of imported products, as well as to restaurants
serving the national dishes of other countries.
Over the period 1966-76 total consumption of beer (Britain’s most popular
alcoholic drink) rose by 32 per cent; that of spirits by 100 per cent; and that
of wine 114 per cent.
The greatest social changes have probably been in the economic and domestic
lives of women. Almost all theoretical sex discrimination in political and legal
rights has been removed.
The changes have been significant but, because tradition and prejudice can
still handicap women in their working careers and personal lives, major
legislation to help to promote equality of opportunity and pay has been passed
during the 1970s.
At the heart of women’s changed role in society has been the rise in the
number of women at work, particularly married women. As technology and
society permit highly effective and generally acceptable methods of family
planning there has been a decline in family size. Women as a result are involved
in child-bearing for a much shorter time and, related to this, there has been a
rapid increase, which is still continuing, in the number of women with young
children who return to work when their children are old enough not to need
constant care and attention.
Since 1951 the proportion of married women who work has grown from
just over a fifth to a half. Compared with their counterparts elsewhere in the
European Community, British women comprise a relatively high proportion
of the workforce, about two-fifths, but on average they work fewer hours,
about 31 a week. There is still a significant difference between women’s
average earnings and men’s, but the equal pay legislation which came into
force at the end of 1975 appears to have helped to narrow the gap between
women’s and men’s basic rates. During the 1970s women’s wages have risen

Minorities
Leisure
Trends
proportionately more than men’s but remain relatively low because women
tend to work in lowly-paid sectors of the economy, they often work in pre¬
dominantly female workforces, and they work less overtime than men.
As more and more women joined the workforce in the 1960s and early 1970s
there was an increase in the collective incomes of women as a whole and a major
change in the economic role of large numbers of housewives. Families have
come to rely on married women’s earnings as an essential part of their income
rather than as ‘pocket money’ or a means of buying ‘extras’. At the same time
social roles within the family are more likely to be shared, exchanged and
altered.
Britain has a long history of accommodating minority groups and in the
last hundred years or so a variety of people have settled in the country, some
to avoid political or religious persecution, others seeking a better way of life
and an escape from poverty.
Many Irishmen have made homes in Britain, and comprise the largest
single minority group. Many Jewish refugees started a new life in the country
towards the end of the nineteenth century and in the 1930s, and after 1945
large numbers of other European refugees, Poles in particular, also came to
settle. The large communities from the West Indies and the Indian sub¬
continent date from the i950s and the early 1960s. There *are also sizeable
groups of Americans, Australians, Chinese and various European communities
such as Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Italians and Spaniards. In the last
generation British society has therefore become more multi-racial as ethnic
minority groups from almost all parts of the world have made a permanent
home in the country. Although a small proportion of the total population, they
represent a significant element in certain areas.
The minority communities tend to live mainly in the urban centres, especially
the largest towns, and in particular areas within these centres. The most recent
immigrants, such as the West Indians and the Asians, are usually concentrated
in the poorer inner city areas, whereas earlier arrivals have tended to move out
to the suburbs.
Most minorities share a way of life that is broadly similar to that of the
British community as a whole, though some of the newer arrivals, mainly
from Commonwealth countries and sometimes with a poor command of the
English language, may face problems of limited employment opportunities
and inadequate housing. In areas with large and fairly recently-arrived
immigrant populations arrangements are made in schools and elsewhere to
enable host and minority communities to understand each other’s traditions
better and to help immigrants who need special language training.
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend it
and higher real incomes than had previous generations. Agreed hours of full¬
time work are usually from 35 to 40 hours a week, although many people
actually work somewhat longer (about 45 on average for manual workers)
because of voluntary overtime work, while the hours worked by women and
girls average somewhat less. Most employees work a five-day week.
Almost all full-time employees are entitled to a paid holiday each year in
addition to public holidays and in practically every case the minimum period
is three weeks.
The number of holidays taken in Great Britain by British residents was 36
million in 197? compared with 31 million in 1966. More than two holidays in
five in Great Britain are spent at the home of a friend or relative, and over a
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
quarter involve camping or caravanning. Holidays abroad in 1977 numbered
7-75 million, compared with 5-5 million in 1966, and well over half involved
‘package’ arrangements. Spain is by far the most popular destination, and
receives well over a quarter of all British holiday-makers abroad. A third of the
population each year, however, takes no holiday away from home.
Leisure patterns generally are determined by age, sex, social class, income,
access to a car and education. The most common activities are home based,
with television-watching the most popular; about 96 per cent of households
have a television set and in winter the population aged five and over spend on
average 20 hours a week watching programmes.
Other popular pursuits include: listening to the radio or records; needlework
and other hobbies; going out for a drink to a public house (the ‘pub’ or ‘local’
is a traditional social centre for many people); gardening (a majority of British
families have some garden or allotment despite the high proportion living in
urban areas); eating out; open-air outings; games and sports (as both spec¬
tator and participants); going to social clubs1; film going (especially among
young people); visits to buildings and museums; social and voluntary work;
and attending leisure centres.
1 These include clubs run by political groups; trade unions; church groups; social,
cultural and academic groups; youth clubs and organisations; and groups of local
business and professional people. The longer-established clubs organised on a national
basis include the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and
the Women’s Institutes.

GENERAL SURVEY
The origins and traditions of the United Kingdom are to be found in each
of its four component parts: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
England was united as a kingdom a thousand years ago, and Wales became
part of the kingdom during the Middle Ages. The thrones of England and
Scotland were dynastically united in 1603, and in 1707 legislation passed in
the two countries provided for the establishment of a single Parliament of
Great Britain with supreme authority both in England and Wales and in
Scotland. Ireland had had links with the kingdom of England since the
thirteenth century, and in 1800 the creation of the United Kingdom was
completed by a union joining the Irish Parliament to that of Great Britain.
In 1922 Southern Ireland (now the Irish Republic) became a self-governing
country. The six counties of Northern Ireland had in 1920 been given their
own subordinate Parliament, and voted to remain within the United Kingdom.
Arrangements in Northern Ireland are described on p 53.
The United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster in London—with an
elected chamber comprising members from English, Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland constituencies—therefore represents people whose back¬
grounds and traditions vary considerably from one part of the country to
another. It has ultimate authority for government and law-making, but
administrative arrangements have developed in such a way as to take account
of the particular needs of different areas.
The United Kingdom is a member of the Commonwealth and of the
European Community.
Two Acts of Parliament became law in July 1978, providing for the establish¬
ment in Scotland and in Wales of assemblies (elected by simple majority) with
responsibility for a wide range of their domestic affairs. The Scottish Assembly
would have powers of primary legislation, with an executive body to administer
devolved matters. The Welsh Assembly would have executive responsibility
in devolved matters, but no law-making powers.
The Acts also provide that before assemblies can be elected referendums
must be held in both Scotland and Wales, in which at least 40 per cent of those
entitled to vote must approve the establishment of the assembly. If in either
country such a vote is not obtained, the Secretary of State must lay an order
for the repeal of the Act. If a general election is called before orders for the
referendums have been laid, the referendums cannot then be held until at
least three months after the date of the election.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies,
not part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and
systems of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same
time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of
the antiquity of their connection with the Crown. The United Kingdom
Government is responsible for their defence, their international relations
and, ultimately, their good government. They have separate arrangements
20
The Constitution
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
with the European Community which take into account their special relation¬
ship with the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by conventions, which have never been codified and
are not directly enforceable in a court of law, but which, nevertheless, are
regarded as rules of the constitution. Because the constitution is not contained
in any single document, and because it can be altered by the passing of an Act
of Parliament or by general agreement to vary, abolish or create a convention,
it can the more readily be adapted to changing political conditions and ideas.
The organs of government are readily distinguishable although their
functions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
1. the legislature, the supreme authority in the realm (see p 23);
2. the executive, which consists of: (a) the Government—that is the Cabinet
and other ministers of the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and
directing national policy (see p 36); (6) government departments, most of
them under the control of ministers and all staffed by civil servants, which are
responsible for administration at the national level (see p 39) > (c) l°cal
authorities, which administer and manage many services at the local level
(see p 61); and (d) public corporations which may be responsible for the
operation of particular nationalised industries or, for example, of a social
or cultural service, and which are subject to ministerial control in varying
degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and
is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and, in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. The royal title in the
United Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.
The form of the royal title is varied for those other member nations of the
Commonwealth1 of which the Queen is head of State, to suit the particular
circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-
Governor. In the other member nations of the Commonwealth of which the
Queen is Sovereign, her representative is the Governor-General, who is
appointed by her on the advice of the ministers of the country concerned and
is wholly independent of the United Kingdom Government. In the United
Kingdom dependencies the Queen is usually represented by governors who

in meetings of Heads of Government.)

are appointed by the Crown, having various executive and legislative powers,
and are responsible to the United Kingdom Government for the good govern¬
ment of the countries concerned.
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common
law rules of descent. Lineal Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia (the
Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I of England and VI of
Scotland) are alone eligible to succeed, and although succession is not bound
to continue in its present line, it cannot now be altered other than by common
consent of the member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen
is head of State. Rules of descent provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in
order of succession to the throne according to their seniority; if there are no
sons, the daughters succeed in order of their seniority. When a daughter
succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant and the powers of the Crown are
vested in her as fully and effectively as though she were a king. By convention,
the consort of a king takes the rank and style of her husband; the converse’
however, does not apply and the constitution has never attached any special
rank or privileges to the husband of the Queen-Regnant although in practice
he fills an important role in the life of the nation.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the
accession of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the
new Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of
the' Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London, and
the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the Common¬
wealth are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval of
possibly a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the same in
substance for over a thousand years although the details have frequently been
modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time. The corona-
tion service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of representatives
of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests in the United
Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading citizens of the other Common¬
wealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal
governor of the established Church of England. In practice, as a result of a
long evolutionary process during which the absolute power of the monarchy
has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the advice of her ministers
which she cannot constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule.
he United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the
name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a trend during the past hundred
years towards assigning powers directly to ministers without any necessity
for royal intervention, there are still important acts of government which
require the participation of the Queen. These include the summoning,
prorogation and dissolution of Parliament; giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by both Houses of Parliament; making appointments to all important
State offices, including those of government ministers, judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, diplomats and all the leading positions in the
established Church of England; conferring peerages, knighthoods and other
Ceremonial and
Royal Visits
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
honours1; and remitting all or part of the penalty imposed on a person con¬
victed of a crime. An important function is the appointment of the Prime
Minister. This is normally automatic, and the Queen must invite the leader of
the political party commanding a majority in the House of Commons to form
a government. If, however, no party has a majority, or if the majority party
has no recognised leader, the Queen must select a Prime Minister, and can
consult anyone she wishes. In international affairs, the Queen as head of
State has the power to declare war and make peace, to recognise foreign
States and governments, to conclude treaties and to annexe or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as in the appointment of the Prime Minister)
these and other acts involving the use of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are nowa¬
days exercised by government ministers who are responsible to Parliament
and can be questioned about a particular policy. The law does not require
Parliament’s prior authority before such powers can be exercised, but Parlia¬
ment has the power to pass legislation to restrict or abolish a prerogative right.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not,
however, detract from the importance of the Queen’s participation in the
smooth working of government. She holds meetings of the Privy Council,
gives audiences to her ministers and other holders of office at home and
overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs
innumerable State papers; she must be informed and consulted on every
aspect of the national life; and she must show complete impartiality.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made for a regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the Sovereign is totally
incapacitated (or is under the age of 18 years on accession to the throne). The
regent would be the Prince of Wales, and thereafter those in succession to the
throne who are of age. In the event of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or
absence abroad, provision is made for the appointment of Counsellors of State
(the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adult persons next in succession to the
Crown, and the Queen Mother) to whom the Sovereign may delegate certain
royal functions. Counsellors of State may not, however, dissolve Parliament
(except on the express instructions of the Sovereign), or create peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens, and,
in spite of the changes that have taken place in the outlook of both the Sovereign
and the people, many traditional customs and usages remain. Royal marriages
and royal funerals are marked by public ceremony. The birthday of the
Sovereign is officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on
the Horse Guards Parade and is also celebrated as Commonwealth Day.
State banquets take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits the
United Kingdom; investitures are held at Buckingham Palace; and royal
processions add significance to such occasions as the opening of Parliament,
when the Queen drives in state from Buckingham Palace. The Queen and
other members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom
every year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic,
industrial and charitable works of national importance encourages nation¬
wide interest and publicity. The Queen pays State visits to foreign govern¬
ments, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, and undertakes lengthy
tours in other countries of the Commonwealth. Other members of the royal
family pay official and private visits overseas.
1 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the advice of the Prime
Minister, a few are conferred on her personal selection—the Order of the Garter, the
Order of the Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.
GOVERNMENT
23
Royal Income More than three-quarters of all expenditure arising from the official duties of
and Expenditure the royal family is borne on the accounts of public departments—including,
for example, the costs of the royal yacht, the Queen’s Flight, travel by train
and the upkeep of the royal palaces. Apart from this the Queen’s public
expenditure on staff and expenses incurred in carrying out official duties as
head of State is financed from the Civil List, approved by Parliament. Her
private expenditure as Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which is
supplied mainly from the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster1; and her
personal expenditure as a private individual from her own personal resources.
Annual allowances approved by Parliament are specifically made to certain
other members of the royal family. No allowances are made to the Queen’s
eldest son, the Prince of Wales, who as Duke of Cornwall is entitled to the net
revenue of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall (he has voluntarily agreed to
surrender half the revenue to the nation). The Queen meets from her Privy
Purse the official expenses of members of the royal family for whom Parlia¬
ment has not specifically provided.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the
House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
1 he three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate; they are con¬
stituted on different principles; they work in different places; and they meet
together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the State opening
of Parliament when the Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House
of Lords. As a law-making organ of State, however, Parliament is a corporate
body and cannot as a rule legislate without the concurrence of all its parts.
The Parliament at Westminster can legislate for the United Kingdom as a
whole, or any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination
of them. Parliament can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man, which are Crown dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom,
and have subordinate legislatures2 which legislate on island affairs.
Because it is not subject to the type of legal restraints imposed on the
legislatures of countries with formal written constitutions, Parliament is
free to legislate as it pleases: generally to make, unmake, or alter any law; to
legalise past illegalities and make void and punishable what was lawful when
done and thus reverse the decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy
established conventions or turn a convention into binding law. It can prolong
its own life beyond the normal period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament is slow to exercise its supremacy in this
way. Its members bear in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain
throughout the centuries and have tended to act in accordance with precedent
and tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament that
has been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper
authority cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely
to pass an Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system of
The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since i399> has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and
is separately administered by the Chancellor.
2 The legislatures of the Channel Islands (the States of Jersey and the States of
Guernsey) and the Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) consist of the Queen, the Privy
Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the member
of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each legislative
measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.

party government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its
responsibility to the electorate in mind.
As a member of the European Community, the United Kingdom recognises
various types of Community legislation, including regulations, which take
direct effect in member countries, and directives, which are binding as to the
result achieved upon each member State to which they are addressed, but
allow the national authorities to choose the form and method of implementa¬
tion. Britain has made arrangements for holding direct elections to the
European Assembly in June 1979. A more detailed account of Britain’s
membership of the European Community is given in Chapter 3.
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws regulating the life of
the community, (2) to scrutinise government policy and administration,
particularly proposals for expenditure. In discharging these two functions
Parliament helps to bring the relevant facts and issues before the electorate.
By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of all important
international treaties and agreements, the making of treaties being, in theory
at least, a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the Government and not
subject to parliamentary approval.
A Parliament (in the sense of a parliamentary period) has a maximum duration
of five years, but may be, and nearly always is, dissolved, and a general election
held, before the end of this term. The maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation passed in the usual way in such rare circumstances as during the
two world wars. Dissolution is ordered by the Queen on the advice of the
Prime Minister, by means of a royal proclamation which, besides dissolving
the existing Parliament, orders the issue of writs for an election, and announces
the date on which the new Parliament is to meet (not less than 20 days after
the dissolution). The proclamation is very soon followed by the issue of writs
in each constituency to cause an election to be held on the day named.
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for one
year—beginning and ending most often in October or November and inter¬
spersed with ‘adjournments’ at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the spring holiday and during a long summer recess starting late in July or
early in August. The average number of ‘sitting’ days in a session is about 175
in the House of Commons and about 140 in the House of Lords. At the start of
each session the Queen’s speech in the House of Lords outlines to the mem¬
bers of both Houses the Government’s broad policies and proposed legislative
programme. Each session is terminated by prorogation, a prerogative act
which appoints the day of meeting in a new session (on rare occasions
Parliament has been dissolved without prorogation), and a short speech is
made on behalf of the Queen summarising Parliament’s work during the past
session. Parliament then ‘stands prorogued’ until the new session opens.
Whereas an adjournment does not affect uncompleted business, the effect of
a prorogation is at once to terminate nearly all parliamentary business, so that
all public Bills not completed in the session lapse, and must be reintroduced
in the next unless they are to be abandoned.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal.
The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the Church of
England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops. The Lords Tem¬
poral consist of (1) all hereditary peers and peeresses of England, Scotland,
26
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Great Britain and the United Kingdom who have not disclaimed their
peerages under the Peerage Act 1963) (2) Peers an<^ peeresses created
by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958, and (3) those Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed to assist the House in the perfor¬
mance of its judicial duties. Hereditary peerages carry with them a right to sit
in the House of Lords (subject to certain statutory disqualifications), provided
the holder is 21 years of age or over, but anyone succeeding to a peerage may,
within 12 months of succession, disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime.
Disclaimants lose their right to sit in the House of Lords but they gam the
right to vote at parliamentary elections and to offer themselves for election to
the House of Commons. No hereditary peerage has been conferred since
I9^5-
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings of
that Plouse. Those who do not wish to attend may apply for leave of absence
for the duration of a Parliament.
Peers who frequently attend the House of Lords (the average daily attendance
is about 280) include elder statesmen and others who have spent their lives in
public service. They receive no salary for their parliamentary work, but they
are entitled to recover expenses incurred in attending the House (except for
judicial sittings) and certain travelling expenses.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his
place on the woolsack as ex officio Speaker of the House. In the absence of the
Lord Chancellor his place may be taken by a deputy speaker appointed by
the Crown or a deputy chairman appointed by the House or, if neither a
deputy speaker nor a deputy chairman is present, by a speaker chosen by the
Lords present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of
Committees, who is appointed each session and takes the chair in all commit¬
tees, unless the House otherwise directs. The Lord Chairman and the
Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees are salaried officers of the House.
The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is respon¬
sible for the records of proceedings including judgments and for the promulga¬
tion of Acts of Parliament; the other Clerks at the Table; the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod, who is also Serjeant-at-Arms in attendance upon
the Lord Chancellor; and the Yeoman Usher who is Deputy Serjeant-at-
Arms.
The House of The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by univer-
Commons sal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of
the community. There are 635 seats in the House of Commons (5!6 for
England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland1).
General elections are held after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new
one summoned by the Sovereign. If a vacancy occurs in the House as a result
of the death or resignation2 of a member, or as a result of his elevation to the
House of Lords, a by-election takes place. Members are paid an annual salary
and an allowance for secretarial and research expenses. They also have a
number of other allowances, including travel allowances, a supplement for
London members and, for provincial members, subsistence allowances. The
1 A Speaker’s Conference recommended in February 1978 that Northern Ireland’s
representation should be increased to 17.
2 If a member wishes to resign from the House, he may apply for what is techni¬
cally an office of profit under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or Steward
of the Manor of Northstead) which automatically disqualifies him from membership
of the House but to which, in fact, no remuneration attaches.

basic salary for members is £6,897 a year. Some members receive less than
this, with a minimum of £6,554; a £312 a year increase permitted under the
Government’s pay policy for 1975-76 was not paid to members, or was reduced,
if it would have carried their earnings from parliamentary and other sources
over the £8,500 limit for pay rises. (For ministers’ salaries, see p 38.)
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members to preside over the House. Other parliamentary officers of the
House are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and two deputy chairmen who
act as Deputy Speakers; these officers are elected by the House on the nomina¬
tion of the Government and, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote other
than in their official capacity.
Permanent officers of the House (that is, those who are not members of
Parliament) include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official departments under his control and is the
accounting officer for the House of Commons Estimates, and the Serjeant-at-
Arms, who attends upon the Speaker, executes the orders of the House, is the
official housekeeper of the Commons part of the building, and is responsible
for its security.
for electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. To ensure
equitable representation, four permanent Boundary Commissions (for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) make periodic reviews of
constituencies and recommend any redistribution of seats that may seem
necessary in the light of population movements or for some other reason.
Election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot. British
subjects (except Members of the House of Lords) and citizens of the Irish
Republic resident in the United Kingdom are entitled to vote provided they
are 18 years of age or over, are registered in the annual register of electors,
and not subject to any legal incapacity to vote (that is, are not convicted
offenders in penal institutions or persons found guilty of illegal election
practices w'ithin the past five years). Service voters (that is, members of the
armed forces, Crown servants and staff of the British Council employed over¬
seas, together w'ith their wives and husbands if accompanying them) may also
be registered for an address in a constituency, if they normally reside there.
Each elector may cast one vote at a polling station in person, but service
voters, voters who are abroad on polling day because of the nature of their
occupation (and their wives or husbands who accompany them) may vote by
proxy. Absent voting facilities also exist for merchant seamen. Voters entitled
to vote by post include those who have a service vote but happen to be in the
United Kingdom at the time of an election, persons employed on polling day
as constables or by the returning officer, candidates in another constituency
and their wives and husbands, and electors who are blind or physically
incapacitated.
Voting is not compulsory but, of about 40 million people entitled to vote
in the most recent elections in February and October 1974, some 78*1 per cent
and 72-8 per cent respectively cast their votes. The candidate who polls the
most votes in any constituency is elected; an absolute majority (a greater
number of votes than those cast for all other candidates combined) is not
required.
Anyone, man or woman, who is entitled to vote and who has reached the
age of 21 can stand for election. Undischarged bankrupts, clergymen of the
Church of England, Church of Scotland, Church of Ireland and Roman

Catholic Church, peers, and certain people holding offices of profit under the
Crown are, however, not eligible. The House of Commons Disqualification
Act 1975 defines those who may not become a member of Parliament. They
include holders of judicial office, civil servants and some local government
officers, members of the regular armed forces, members of the police forces
and members of public corporations and government commissions. A
candidate usually belongs to one of the main national political Parties- a “
though smaller parties or groupings also nominate candidates, and individuals
may be nominated without party support.
The maximum sum of money that a candidate may spend on his election
campaign is £1,750, plus i-| pence for each elector in a borough constituency
or 2 pence for each elector in a county constituency. A candidate may send by
post (free of postal charge) an election address to each elector in his con¬
stituency. All other expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal expenses,
must not exceed the statutory limit.
The party system, existing in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, is an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties
each laying its own policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a general
election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for election; any
other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then indicates, by its
choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the opposing policies
it would like to see put into effect. The percentages of votes cast for the main
political parties in the October 1974 general election and the resulting distribu¬
tion of seats in the House of Commons are given in Table 4.

“In September 1978, the party strengths (excluding the Speaker and his
deputies) were as follows: Labour 306; Conservative 282; Liberal 13, Scottish
Nationalist 11; Unionists (Northern Ireland) 10; Plaid Cymru 3; Scottish Labour ,
Social Democratic and Labour 1; Independent 1 ; \ acant 2.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority
of supporters in the House of Commons, usually forms the Government. By
GOVERNMENT
29
tradition, the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by
the Sovereign; and about 100 of its members in the House of Commons
and the House of Lords receive ministerial appointments on the advice of the
Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the official Opposition
with its own leader1 and its own council of discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’;
while the members of any other parties or any independents who have been
elected may support or oppose the Government according to their party’s or
their own view of the policy being debated at any given time.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament largely rests on the
relationship between the Government and the Opposition. Depending on
the relative voting strengths of the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition might seek to overthrow the Government by securing a sufficiently
large adverse vote on a major policy issue. In general, however, its aims are
to contribute to the formulation of policy and its expression in legislation by
constructive criticism of the Government’s approach; to oppose specific
government proposals that it considers objectionable; to secure concessions on
government Bills; and to increase support outside Parliament and enhance
its chances of success in by-elections or at the next general election.
The detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses by the Chief
Government Whips, in consultation with the Chief Opposition Whips. The
Chief Whips together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in
the House of Commons when the question of the possibility of finding
time for debating some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the
business of the Houses is primarily the responsibility of the Leaders of the
Houses and it is their duty to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to
debate matters about which they are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates, and conveying upwards to the party leadership the opinions of their
back-bench members. The Chief Government Whip in the House of Com¬
mons is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; of the other Government
Whips, three (one of whom is deputy Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal
Household, five hold titular posts as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury
and seven are paid Assistant Whips. Salaries are likewise paid to the Chief
Opposition Whip and his counterpart in the House of Lords, and to two of
the Assistant Whips for the Opposition in the House of Commons. The
Government Whips in the House of Lords hold offices in the Royal Household
and sometimes act as spokesmen for the Government in debates.
Annual financial assistance from public funds helps opposition parties in
Parliament to carry out their business. It is limited to parties which had at
least two members elected at the last general election or one member elected
and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The formula is: £550 for every seat and
£1.10 for every 200 votes, up to a maximum of ,£165,000. The Government is
considering whether public funds should be made available to political parties
for their work outside Parliament, and to candidates for election expenses.
1 The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons receives an annual salary
for that post, as well as a parliamentary salary; in the House of Lords the Leader of
the Opposition receives an annual salary.

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Parliamentary
Procedure
Legislative
Proceedings
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom and precedent, mainly formu¬
lated in standing orders governing details of practice in each House. The
system of debate is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every
matter is determined upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and
resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be; and members speak
from wherever they have been sitting and not from a rostrum. The main
difference is that in the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the general
sense of the House, whereas in the Commons the Speaker has full authority
to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and orders of the House.
He must guard against abuse of procedure or any infringement of minority
rights, and he has a discretion whether to allow or disallow any closure motion
(that is, a motion to end discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote).
He has certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to
save the time of the House in various other respects. In case of grave disorder
he can adjourn the House or suspend the sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast for and against the motion under debate, the Speaker must
give the casting vote, but he does so only in accordance with rules which pre¬
clude an expression of opinion on the merits of the question.
The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is similar to that in the
House of Commons, except that the Speaker or chairman has an original, but
no casting, vote—the House of Lords being generally governed by the principle
that unless there is a majority in favour the question is decided in the negative.
When the House is sitting judicially (see pp 84 and 95) the question is put
in such a wray that, if the votes are equal, there is no interference with the
judgment under appeal.
The House of Commons has a public register of members’ pecuniary
interests. Members with a direct pecuniary interest in a matter before the
House must abstain from voting in connection with it, though in order to
operate as a disqualification the interest must be immediate and personal, and
not merely of a general or remote character. In any proceedings of the House
or in transactions with other members or with ministers or civil servants,
members must disclose any relevant pecuniary interest or benefit.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare occa¬
sions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Proceedings
and in the House of Lords, Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The
Official Report of Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and of the Commons from 1547, together
with the parliamentary and political papers of certain past members of the
Houses, are available to the public in the House of Lords Record Office.
Radio broadcasting of the proceedings of both Houses of Parliament began in
April 1978, but parliamentary proceedings are not transmitted on television.
A Parliamentary Sound Archive has been established.
The law undergoes constant reform in the courts as established principles
are interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet new circumstances, but
substantial changes are the responsibility of Parliament and the Government
through the normal legislative process.
Draft legislation takes the form of a parliamentary Bill. Most Bills are public
Bills involving measures relating to public policy, but there are also private
Bills which deal solely with matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
GOVERNMENT
31
Public Bills can be introduced either by a Government minister or by a ‘private
member’ of either House of Parliament who does not hold office in the Govern¬
ment. Most public legislation is in practice drafted on behalf of ministers, and
has the support of the Cabinet before being presented to Parliament by the
appropriate minister.
In the modern legislative process, before a Government Bill is finally
drafted, there is normally considerable consultation with, for instance,
professional bodies, voluntary organisations and other agencies interested in
the subject matter of the proposals, such as major interest groups and ‘pressure’
groups which aim to promote a specific cause. Proposals for legislative
changes are sometimes set out by the Government in ‘White Papers’ which
may be debated in Parliament before the introduction of a Bill. From time to
time consultative documents, sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, are published
setting out for public discussion major ministerial proposals which are still at
the formative stage.
Public Bills can be introduced in either House. As a rule, however, Govern¬
ment Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons before
the Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature often pass
through the Lords first. A Bill with a mainly financial purpose must be intro¬
duced in the Commons, and a Bill involving taxation or the spending of public
money must be based on resolutions agreed to by that House, often after debate,
before it can be introduced. If the main object of a Bill is to create a public
charge, it can only be introduced by a minister, which gives the Government
considerable control over legislation.
At the beginning of each session private members of the Commons ballot
for the chance to introduce a Bill during time specially allocated for private
members’ Bills; the first 20 are successful. A private member may also present
a Bill after question time on notice given, or seek leave to introduce a Bill under
the ‘ten minute rule’ which allows two speeches, one in favour of and one
against the measure, after which the House decides whether to allow the Bill
to be brought in. Private members’ Bills do not often proceed very far, but a
few become law. If one secures a second reading, the Government usually
introduces any necessary money resolution. Private members’ Bills may be
introduced in the House of Lords at any time, without notice, but the time
that can be given to them in the Commons is strictly limited.
The process of passing a public Bill is similar in both Houses of Parliament.
The Bill receives a formal first reading on introduction, it is printed, and after
a while (between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the
Bill) it is given a second reading after a debate on its general principles and
merits. In the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to a second
reading committee to recommend whether it should be taken as read a second
time. After a second reading in the Commons, a Bill is usually referred for
detailed examination to a standing committee (see p 33). If the House so
decides, the Bill may be referred to the whole House sitting in committee.
The House may vote to limit the time devoted to examining a Bill by passing a
timetable motion, commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. In the Lords a Bill
is considered by a committee of the whole House as a matter of course, unless
the House decides to refer it to a Public Bill Committee. The committee
stage is followed by the report stage, during which previous amendments
may be altered and new amendments incorporated. At the third reading a
Bill is reviewed in its final form. In the Commons this stage is taken without
a debate unless there is a motion in the name of six members that the question
‘be not put forthwith’—a procedure of which substantial use is made.
32
Delegated
Legislation
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
After the third reading a Commons Bill is sent to the Lords where it goes
through broadly the same stages. Similarly a Bill which starts in the Lords and
is passed by that House is then sent to the Commons for all the stages there.
Amendments made by the second House generally must be agreed by the first,
or a compromise reached, before a Bill can become law.
Most Government Bills introduced and passed in the Lords pass through
the. Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature.
However, should any non-governmental Lords Bill be unacceptable to the
Commons it would not generally become law because no debating time would
be allotted to it. The Lords, on the other hand, cannot in general prevent a Bill
insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal course
of events they either accept a Commons Bill without changes, or they amend
and return it for consideration by the Commons, who frequently agree to the
amendments made. In practice, the Lords pass without amendment such
financial Bills as the Finance Bill, which authorises taxation, or the Consolidated
Fund or Appropriation Bill, which authorises national expenditure. A Bill that
deals only with taxation or expenditure must become law within one month of
being sent to the Lords, whether or not they have agreed to it, unless the
Commons directs to the contrary. If no agreement is reached between the two
houses on a non-financial Commons Bill (or an amendment to it) the Lords can
in practice delay the Bill (with certain exceptions) for about 13 months. At the
end of this time it becomes law in the form originally passed by the Commons.
The limitations on the power of the Lords are based on the belief that the
principal legislative function of the non-elected House nowadays is to act as a
chamber of revision, complementing, not rivalling, the elected House.
When a Bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages, it is sent to the
Queen for royal assent, after which it is part of the law of the land and known
as an Act of Parliament. The royal assent has not been refused since 1707.
Private Bills, which can be promoted by people or organisations outside
Parliament, go through substantially the same procedure as public Bills, but
most of the work is done in committee, where proceedings follow a semi¬
judicial pattern: the promoter must prove the need for the powers or privileges
he seeks, and objections on the part of the opposing interests are heard. Both
parties may be legally represented.
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
parliamentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in
Council or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to govern¬
ment ministers, government departments for which ministers are responsible,
or to organisations whose regulations are subject to confirmation or approval
by ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament for them. More¬
over, the Acts of Parliament by which particular powers are delegated normally
provide for some measure of parliamentary control over legislation made in
the exercise of these powers, for instance, by reserving to Parliament the right
to affirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts also require direct
consultation with organisations which will be affected thereby before rules
and orders (in the form of statutory instruments) are made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports on the technical propriety of
statutory instruments. In the Commons, in order to save time, they are often
referred to standing committees with any decisions reserved to the House.
GOVERNMENT
33
Parliamentary
Committees
Committees of
the Whole House
Either House may resolve itself into a committee, known as a committee of
the whole house, to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after their second
reading. A committee of the whole house is presided over by the Chairman of
Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords) or a
deputy chairman.
Standing
Committees
Select
Committees
Joint
Committees
House of Commons standing committees include those which examine public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the second reading and
report stages; two Scottish standing committees; the Scottish Grand Com¬
mittee; the Welsh Grand Committee; and the Northern Ireland standing
committee. Ordinary standing committees have no distinctive names, being
referred to simply as Standing Committee A, B, C, and so on. Each has between
16 and 50 members with the balance of the parties reflecting as far as possible
that in the House as a whole. The Scottish Grand Committee, which comprises
all 71 Scottish members and ten to 15 others, considers the principles of
Scottish Bills referred to it at second reading stage, the Scottish estimates and
other matters relating exclusively to Scotland. The Welsh Grand Committee,
with all 36 \\ elsh members and up to five others, considers Bills referred to it
at second reading stage, and matters relating exclusively to Wales. The
Northern Ireland committee considers matters relating specifically to the
province. A standing committee on regional affairs comprising the 516 members
from English constituencies considers matters relating to the English regions.
The Lords equivalent to a standing committee, a Public Bill Committee, is
rarely used.
Select committees are generally set up, by either House, to help Parliament
with the control of the executive by examining some aspect of administration
and reporting to the House. They may be appointed as occasion demands, or
for a session, or for the rest of the life of a Parliament. On rare occasions a
parliamentary Bill is examined by a select committee (a procedure additional
to the usual legislative process). Select committees are constituted on a party
basis, in approximate proportion to party strength in the House.
Select committees in the Commons include committees on public accounts,
expenditure, privileges, House of Commons’ services, nationalised industries,
the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, science and technology,
race relations and immigration, overseas development, and European Com¬
munity secondary legislation. The Committee of Selection and the Standing
Orders Committee have duties relating to private Bills, and the Committee of
Selection also chooses members to serve on standing committees.
In their scrutiny of administrative activity and government policies, the
committees question ministers, senior civil servants and interested bodies and
individuals. They bring before Parliament and the public generally, through
their hearings and published reports, a body of fact and informed opinion on
many important issues and they build up considerable expertise in their
subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords there are sessional committees on the European
Community, standing orders (Private Bills), personal Bills, procedure,
offices, privileges, leave of absence, Lords’ expenses and selection, and the
Appeal and Appellate Committees.
The two Houses may agree to set up joint select committees, and joint com¬
mittees are also appointed in each session to deal with Consolidation Bills and
delegated legislation.
34
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Party
Committees
Parliamentary
Control
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several
important party organisations or committees. The Conservative and Unionist
Members Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee, consists of
the back-bench membership of the party. The Parliamentary Labour Party
is a corporate body comprising all members of the party in both Houses; when
the Labour Party is in office a liaison committee acts as a channel of communi¬
cation between the Government and its back-benchers in both Houses; when
the party is in opposition the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under
the direction of a Parliamentary Committee.
Control of the Government in power is exercised in the final analysis by the
ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign either by
passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a ‘matter of
confidence’ or, ultimately, by refusing to vote the money required for the
public service. A number of opportunities for a searching examination of
government policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own back¬
benchers are provided in parliamentary procedure. These include:
1. Question time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in rotation, answer
questions put to them on matters for which they are responsible. Parlia¬
mentary questions are one means of eliciting information about the
Government’s intentions, as well as a way of airing, and possibly securing
redress of, grievances brought to members’ notice by constituents.
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the House to
initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern.
There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public business; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
spring and the summer) a day is spent discussing matters raised by private
members. Moreover, if a member wishes to discuss a ‘specific and important
matter that should have urgent consideration’ he may, at the end of question
time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker
accepts the terms of the motion, he asks the House for leave for it to be put
forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or if 40 or more members
support the motion, or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support it and
the House (on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the matter
is debated for three hours, usually on the following day.
3. The 29 ‘supply’ days each session, which were formerly used to discuss
details of proposed government expenditure, and which are nowadays
time for the Opposition to choose subjects for debate. (Scrutiny by small
committees has been found more apt for detailed expenditure proposals.)
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during
the debate on the address in reply to the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
a session, during debates or motions of censure for which the Government
gives up part of its own time, and during debates on the Government’s legisla¬
tive proposals.
Opportunities for criticism of the Government are also provided in the House
of Lords at question time and during debates on specific motions.
The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of Com¬
mons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments for the
public service is described in Chapter 17, Finance.
Arrangements have been made in Parliament to keep members informed

about European Community developments, and to enable them to scrutinise
and debate matters which are to be decided in Community institutions.
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is an independent
statutory officer whose function is to investigate complaints of maladministra¬
tion when so requested by members of the House of Commons on behalf of
members of the public. His powers of investigation extend to actions taken by
central government departments in the exercise of their administrative func¬
tions, but not to policy decisions (which are the concern of the Government
and can be questioned in Parliament). Certain administrative actions also
outside his jurisdiction include matters affecting relations with other countries
and the activities of British officials outside the United Kingdom.
In the performance of his duties, the Parliamentary Commissioner has
access to all departmental papers, and reports his findings to the member of
Parliament who presented the case. The Parliamentary Commissioner reports
annually to Parliament and may submit such other reports as he thinks fit.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain rights and immunities designed to
protect it from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. These
rights apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally claims from the Crown ‘their ancient
and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of each Parliament.
These include freedom of speech in debate; freedom from arrest in civil
process; and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege
of the House. Further privileges include the right of the House to control its
own proceedings (so that it is able, for instance, to exclude strangers if it so
wishes); the right to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership
and to declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise those
who commit a breach of its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords include: freedom of speech in debate;
freedom of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to
commit for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker
as in the House of Commons; they exist independently.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner Committee
of the Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council. Nowadays the Privy Council is responsible for advising the
Sovereign to approve Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing
fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal
prerogative, such as Orders approving the grant of royal charters of incorpora¬
tion; and those made under statutory powers, which are the highest form of
delegated legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the Privy
Council attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not
thereby become personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders
are based; this rests with the minister responsible for the subject matter of
the order in question, whether or not he was present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclamations,

some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as sum¬
moning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
The Privy Council’s own statutory responsibilities, which are independent
of the powers of the Sovereign in Council, include powers of supervision over
the registering bodies for the medical and allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council
(which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation
of the Prime Minister to certain eminent persons in independent monarchical
countries of the Commonwealth. There are usually about 340 Privy Coun¬
sellors. The whole Privy Council is called together only on the death of the
Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or her intention to marry.
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These advisory committees may be prerogative committees, such
as those which deal with legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of
the Channel Islands and Isle of Man and with applications for charters of
incorporation; or they may be provided for by statute as are those for the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal
from the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies, courts of independent
members of the Commonwealth which have not elected to discontinue the
appeal, courts of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and certain other
courts, some professional and disciplinary committees and church sources.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in
the Privy Council Office under the Lord President of the Council, a senior
Cabinet minister. He is assisted by a Minister of State and a Parliamentary
Secretary, and has special responsibility for devolution policy (see p 19) and
other work relating to the development of political institutions.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers responsible for the
administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Crowm on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. How¬
ever, the Government must be fully represented by ministers in the House of
Lords as it requires spokesmen of standing to expound its policy and justify
its actions to that House. The Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The creation
of a paid ministerial office with entirely new functions requires legislation, but
the abolition of an office, the transfer of functions from one minister to another,
or a change in the designation of a minister may be effected by Order in
Council. Ministers may be classified as follows:
The Prime Minister is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The head of the Government became known as the Prime
Minister during the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority

Junior Ministers
enjoyed by the holder of this office derives from his ability to command a
majority in Parliament and from his power to submit his own choice of ministers
to the Queen and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. By
convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a
general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences and
approving important departmental decisions where reference to the Cabinet
is not required.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as
for appointments to high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords
of Appeal in Ordinary, and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown
on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord-Lieutenants and certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and some
university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The Prime
Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various public
boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well
as to various royal and statutory commissions. He likewise makes recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (awarded to people who have achieved eminence in
science and the arts and who are in some financial need) and selects the
trustees of certain national museums and institutions.
Departmental ministers are in charge of government departments. The
holders of these offices, who are usually in the Cabinet, are known as ‘Secretary
of State’ or ‘Minister’, or they may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury and a
number of sub-departments).
Non-departmental ministers include the holders of various traditional offices—
the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,
the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and from time to time Ministers
without Portfolio. Usually these ministers have few or no departmental
duties and are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime
Minister may wish to entrust to them.
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a Minister of the Crown
with departmental functions and also head of the judiciary in England and
Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State are usually appointed to assist ministers in charge of govern¬
ment departments in which the work is particularly heavy or complex or
where it involves frequent travelling abroad. It is possible for a Minister of
State to be given a place in the Cabinet and to be paid accordingly.
Junior ministers generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or, where
the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under Secretary of

State. They share in parliamentary debates, answering parliamentary questions,
and assisting in departmental duties. In certain cases, however, they may be
given responsibility, directly under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury
and the other Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are in a different category
as Government Whips (see p 29).
The salaries of ministers in the House of Commons range from £6,050 a year
for junior ministers and £8,250 to £10,450 for more senior ministers to £14,300
for Cabinet ministers. The Prime Minister receives £22,000 a year. Ministers
in the House of Lords receive an additional sum of £520 a year if junior and
£208 a year if senior. The Lord Chancellor receives £22,228 a year, including
£2,500 for his speakership of the House of Lords.
Ministers in the House of Commons, including the Prime Minister, also
have parliamentary salaries of £3,529 (£4,299 for non-Cabinet ministers) and
are entitled to claim the allowances paid to all members of the House.
The Cabinet is composed of about 20 ministers personally selected by the
Prime Minister and may include the holders of departmental and non-
departmental offices. Its origins can be traced back to the informal conferences
that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers, independently of the Privy
Council, during the seventeenth century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal
from an active role in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development
of organised political parties stimulated by successive extensions of the
franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of the policy to
be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive in
accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co¬
ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments. The
exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet is a
group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the support
of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publica¬
tion of Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they have been
in existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection in the
Public Record Office) and a resigning minister wishing to make a statement
involving disclosure of Cabinet discussions should first obtain the permission
of the Sovereign through the Prime Minister.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. To keep the
amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a great
deal of the work of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system,
which involves the reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet committee
or to an ad hoc committee composed of the ministers primarily concerned.
The committee then considers the matter in detail and either disposes of it or
reports upon it to the Cabinet with recommendations for action. Ministers not
in the Cabinet may attend its meetings for discussion of matters affecting
their departments; they may also be members of Cabinet committees.

GOVERNMENT
39
Ministerial
Responsibility
The Secretary of the Cabinet and senior officials of the Cabinet Office
attend meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate.
The term ‘ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the collective responsibility
which ministers share for government policy and actions and to ministers’
individual responsibility to Parliament for their departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, means that the Cabinet is bound to offer
unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject. Consequently it means that the policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. In principle, once the Government’s policy on a particular matter
has been decided, each minister is expected to support it, unless he chooses to
resign, as he is free to do if he cannot agree with his colleagues on a matter of
general policy or on a single major issue. On rare occasions, ministers have
been allowed free votes in the House of Commons on government policies
involving important issues of principle. In the exceptional circumstances
preceding the referendum in June 1975 on British membership of the European
Community, ministers were free to campaign in the country against the
Government’s recommendation. This freedom did not, however, extend to
parliamentary proceedings and Government business.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of administra¬
tion, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since the
majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are available
to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in person.
Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be represented
in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf, usually a
Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they will usually wish to consult
their colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee.
Any decision by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any depart¬
mental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages the
taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and public
companies. In all other respects they must order their affairs in such a way that
there is no conflict between their public duties and their private interests.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to govern¬
ment policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They may,
and frequently do, work with and through local authorities, statutory boards,
and government-sponsored organisations operating under various degrees of
government control.
A few departments have existed for over 200 years. Many more have come
into existence during the past half-century to match the widening scope of
government activity. The election of a party of a different political complexion
4°
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Internal
Organisation
Advisory Bodies
does not necessarily affect the number or general functions of government
departments, although a radical change in policy may be accompanied by some
organisational change.
The work of some departments (for instance, the Ministry of Defence)
covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments (for example, the
Department of Employment) cover England, Wales, and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others, such as the Department of Education and Science
and the Department of the Environment, are mainly concerned with affairs in
England. There are separate departments for Scotland, Northern Ireland and
Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, the minister in charge of the Civil Service Department is
responsible for the Central Office of Information, Her Majesty’s Stationery
Office, and the Department of the Government Actuary; and Treasury
ministers are responsible for the Board of Customs and Excise, the Inland
Revenue, the Department for National Savings and a number of small depart¬
ments including the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Royal Mint, and
the National Debt Office. Generally, departments receive their funds directly
out of money provided by Parliament and are staffed by the Civil Service.
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging its
duties, there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments, how¬
ever, have certain features in common: for instance, the minister of a major
department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent secretary,
sometimes assisted by one or more second permanent secretaries, and also one
or more deputy secretaries, and a varying number of under secretaries and
assistant secretaries. Usually major departments also have a principal finance
officer and a principal personnel and organisation officer. Many departments
also have their own legal advisers or solicitors, economists and statisticians and
their own information divisions. The Government Statistical Service, which
includes the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the Business Statistics Office
(BSO), the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and the statistics divi¬
sions of the major departments, provides a service of statistical information
and advice. Each department compiles statistics relating to its own policy
area and publishes them, usually through its own publications. Information
about individual industries is published by the BSO in Business Monitors.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or committees
(several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect information,
mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before coming to a
decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases there is a
statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee, but usually
advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister concerned
because he feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved, and may include civil servants and repre¬
sentatives of varying interests and professions—for instance, industrialists,
Distribution

trade unionists, university and industrial scientists, educationists, lawyers and
local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recommenda¬
tions on specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal Commissions,
whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide experience and
diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by royal warrant). Royal Commissions
examine written and oral evidence from government departments and
interested organisations and individuals, and on this evidence submit
recommendations. The Government may accept the recommendations in
whole or in part, or it may decide to take no further action or to delay action.
Inquiries may also be undertaken by departmental committees, appointed by
the head of the appropriate department.
of The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the main
government departments. They are arranged in alphabetical order, except for
the Cabinet Office, the Civil Service Department, and the Treasury (which,
in view of their central positions, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern
Ireland departments (which are grouped at the end of the section). Further
information on the work of departments is given in later chapters under the
relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the direction
of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central Policy
Review Staff, the Central Statistical Office and the Historical Section.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers collectively in the conduct of
Cabinet business. It operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy
at the highest level. Functions of the office include circulating the memoranda
and other documents required for Cabinet or Cabinet committee business,
preparing agenda for meetings of the Cabinet and its committees, recording
their discussions and circulating the minutes, keeping in touch with the pro¬
gress of action on decisions, and safeguarding the security of documents.
The Central Policy Review Staff advises ministers collectively on major
issues of policy.
The Central Statistical Office is concerned with the preparation and inter¬
pretation of the statistics necessary to support economic and social policies
and management. It is directly responsible for the central economic aggregates
such as the national accounts, balance of payments, financial statistics and
measures of output; it co-ordinates the statistical work of other departments
and agencies; and it prepares a number of statistical publications.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing
the official histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the
preparation of official histories of certain peacetime events.
The Civil Service Department is under the control of the Prime Minister as
Minister for the Civil Service. Responsibility for day-to-day work is delegated
to a senior minister. The Department’s Permanent Secretary is also the official
head of the Home Civil Service.
The Department is responsible for personnel management in the Civil Ser¬
vice, which includes policy and central arrangements for recruitment, training
(including the Civil Service College), promotion, general career management,
catering, welfare and retirement. It is also responsible for expenditure on civil

service manpower for pay, pensions, and conditions of service in the Civil
Service, and for the co-ordination of pay and pension policies in the public
sector as a whole. Further responsibilities include advising on the development
and application of new systems and techniques in management and admini¬
stration; the provision of central management services covering subjects and
techniques such as organisation and methods, operational research and manage¬
ment accounting; and central planning, procurement and co-ordination of data
processing in government.
The Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for the recruitment of
all permanent civil servants, forms part of the Civil Service Department. In
matters concerned with recruitment policy, the commissioners are respon¬
sible to ministers in the normal way, but in the selection of individuals for
appointment, they act under Order in Council and are completely independent
of ministers.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of all
Government Bills, except Bills or provisions of Bills extending exclusively to
Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Department. The Office
drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and amendments moved
by the Government during the passage of Bills; advises departments on
questions of parliamentary procedure; and attends sittings (and committees)
of both Houses as required. In addition the Parliamentary Counsel draft
subordinate legislation when specially instructed, and advise the Government
on legal, parliamentary and constitutional questions falling within their
special experience.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and five junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners never
meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Financial
Secretary and a Minister of State. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury
is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
The Treasury is the government department primarily responsible for the
development of Britain’s overall economic strategy. Its Public Services Sector
is responsible for controlling aggregate public expenditure and for most of
the individual public expenditure programmes; the Domestic Economy
Sector is concerned with fiscal, monetary and counter-inflation policies, and
with the Treasury’s contribution to industrial policies, including control of
public expenditure on industry and agriculture; the Overseas Finance Sector
is responsible for balance of payments policies, the management of Britain’s
foreign currency reserves, international monetary questions, financial relations
with other countries and the aid programme; and the Chief Economic Adviser’s
Sector is responsible for the preparation of short-term and medium-term
economic forecasts and for specialist advice on broad economic policies.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible for admini¬
stering government policy for the agriculture, horticulture and fishing indus¬
tries in England, and for matters relating to the food and drink industries in
Britain generally. Directed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(who is assisted by a Minister of State and a Parliamentary Secretary) its
functions include the administration, in co-operation with the Intervention

administers schemes such as those designed for the control and eradication of
animal and plant diseases and for the improvement and drainage of agricultural
land; and it exercises responsibilities relating to applied research and develop¬
ment. In addition it is concerned with the safety and quality of food including
standards of composition, labelling and advertising, food additives and con¬
taminants; and it has certain responsibilities for ensuring public health stan¬
dards in the production and handling of basic foods in cargoes, stores and
slaughterhouses. Where appropriate these measures and those of the Com¬
munity are being harmonised.
The Ministry’s responsibilities extend to Scotland and Wales regarding the
operational control of certain diseases of animals. It also acts on behalf of the
Secretary of State for Wales in certain matters relating to, for instance, fisheries
and the provision of agricultural advice. 5
The Ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries and participates in certain of the activities of a number of inter¬
national organisations concerned with agriculture, fisheries and food, and
trade in food products, such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the
United Nations, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
An executive department subject to the direction and control of ministers
responsible for agriculture, the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce
is responsible for the implementation in the United Kingdom of the market
support arrangements and certain other aspects of the European Community’s
Common Agricultural Policy provided for under the guarantee section of the
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. In consultation with
the Ministry of Overseas Development, the Board is responsible for sending
cereals to developing countries under the Food Aid Convention 1971, and for
administering occasional Community donations of other commodities to
developing countries and areas of national disasters.
The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and
administer the customs and excise duties, including value added tax, imposed
from time to time in the annual Finance Acts or by other legislation, and to
advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected with them.
The Board is also responsible for preventing and detecting evasion of the
revenue laws.
The Board undertakes, for other departments, a wide range of non-revenue
agency work, for instance, the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions on
the import and export of certain classes of goods, exchange currency control,
and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade statistics from customs
import and export documents. Parliamentary responsibility for the Board’s
work is exercised by Treasury ministers.
The Ministry of Defence is the government department responsible for defence
policy and for the control and administration of the three armed services—
Navy, Army and Air Force (including the procurement of defence equipment).
The Secretary of State for Defence is in charge of the department, assisted by
a Minister of State. Three Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State are
severally responsible for each of the three armed services.

Britain and internationally. The Department also has responsibilities relating
to the library service, support for the British Library and the administration of
the Victoria and Albert and Science Museums in London.
The Secretary of State for Education and Science is assisted by a Minister
of State and a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State. A second Minister of
State in the department is responsible for the arts, and deals with policy on
the promotion of the arts and on libraries and museums.
Among the matters relating to the development of school and post-school
education for which the Department has responsibility are the broad allocation
of resources for education, the capital programmes for the building of new
schools and other institutions, the supply, training and superannuation of
teachers, and the basic standards of education. The Department works in co¬
operation with local education authorities whose duty it is to provide and run
the schools and colleges in their areas. Its relations with the universities are
conducted through the University Grants Committee. Activities concerning
civil science are discharged through five research councils: the Medical
Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural Environ¬
ment Research Council, the Social Science Research Council and the Science
Research Council. On questions of scientific policy an advisory board for the
research councils advises the Secretary of State.
The Department of Employment has overall responsibility for manpower
policies in Britain, either directly or through statutory agencies, and for the
formulation of labour legislation. It is also responsible for monitoring labour
market trends, including pay, and for producing statistics on them and on
retail prices (from which the rate of inflation is calculated). The Department
is responsible for the payment of unemployment benefit through its local
offices; for the issue of work permits to workers from overseas; and for the
Race Relations Employment Advisory Service.
The Secretary of State for Employment is assisted by a Minister of State and
two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Department of Energy is concerned with the development of government
policies for the supply and use of all forms of energy. It discharges functions
connected with the nationalised coal and gas industries in Great Britain and the
electricity industry in England and Wales; is responsible for the United King¬
dom Atomic Energy Authority; and is the sponsoring department for the
nuclear power and oil industries including the British National Oil Corporation.
It is also responsible for the policy for the development of offshore oil and gas
resources in the British sector of the continental shelf; and it sponsors, through
the Offshore Supplies Office in Glasgow, the suppliers of equipment to the
offshore operators. The Department also represents Britain in international
discussions on energy policy, including relations and co-operation with oil-
producing countries. It is the co-ordinating and sponsoring body for energy
conservation policy, in addition to implementing measures not falling directly
to any other department. The Department also encourages the development
of new sources of energy, being assisted by the Energy Technology Support
Unit at Harwell, Oxfordshire. The Secretary of State for Energy is supported
by a Minister of State, who is especially concerned with the development of
North Sea oil and gas resources, and by two Parliamentary Under Secretaries
of State.

The Department of the Environment, under a Secretary of State, is responsible
in England for a wide range of functions relating to the physical environment
in which people live and work.
The Secretary of State is concerned primarily with the strategic issues of
policy and priorities, including public expenditure, which determine the
operations of the department as a whole. He is also responsible for urban
affairs and inner city renewal; new towns; local government; and regional
affairs. He is assisted by a Minister for Housing Construction, who is respon¬
sible for the finance and policy of the housing programme; the construction
industries; and planning, development control and land. A Minister of State
has special responsibilities for sport and recreation; the control of pollution;
water and sewerage; minerals; countryside affairs; and the Property Services
Agency (which provides nearly all government common services relating to
land, property, buildings and furnishings). There are four Parliamentary
Under Secretaries of State.
The Department is also concerned with the conservation \>f historic towns
and buildings and ancient monuments, and research into planning matters,
building and construction, environmental pollution and resources.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department, which is a separate government
department within the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Trade, offers
two main facilities to British exporters; insurance against the risk of not being
paid for goods and services; and access to special fixed interest rates for export
finance. The Department also provides support for ‘buyer credits’ (loans made
direct to overseas buyers for capital goods contracts enabling the supplier to
be paid on cash terms); insurance against the political risks of new overseas
investment for up to 15 years; partial protection for large capital goods contracts
against an unexpectedly high rise in costs; and support for the issue of per¬
formance bonds.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office provides, mainly through diplomatic
missions, the means of communication between the British Government and
other governments and international governmental organisations for the dis¬
cussion and negotiation of all matters, including economic issues, falling
within the field of international relations. In particular the Department is
responsible for alerting the British Government to the implications of develop¬
ments overseas; for protecting British interests overseas, including commercial
interests; for protecting British citizens abroad; and for explaining British
policies to, and wherever possible cultivating friendly relations with, govern¬
ments and peoples overseas. The Department is also responsible for the dis¬
charge of British responsibilities in the associated States (mainly for defence
and external affairs) and dependent territories. In the dependent territories,
each of which has its own internal administration, the British Government is
finally responsible for good government and for the relations between these
territories and other countries.
The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is assisted
by three Ministers of State and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Department of Health and Social Security is responsible in England for
the administration of the National Health Service; the social services provided
by local authorities for the elderly and handicapped, socially deprived families,
and children in care; and for certain aspects of public health, including hygiene.
Throughout Great Britain it is responsible for the collection of social security

contributions and the payment of benefits. The Department is concerned
in making reciprocal health and social security arrangements with other
countries and in the administration of European Community social security
regulations for immigrant workers. It also represents the United Kingdom in
the World Health Organisation.
Through its Supplementary Benefits Commission the Department is respon¬
sible for determining awards of non-contributory benefits and Family Income
Supplement, for reception centres, and for assessing the means of people
applying for legal aid. The Department also has responsibilities in connection
with pensions and welfare services (including in some cases the provision of
medical and surgical treatment) for war pensioners in the United Kingdom,
the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and, through its various agencies, for
United Kingdom war pensioners living in other countries.
The Department is headed by the Secretary of State for Social Services who
is assisted by a Minister for Social Security (of Cabinet rank), a Minister of
State (Health) and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State (one of whom
has special responsibilities for disabled people).
The Home Office deals with those internal affairs in England and Wales not
assigned to other government departments. The Home Secretary is the channel
of communication between the Crown and the public, and between the
United Kingdom Government and the Governments of the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man. He exercises certain prerogative powers of the Crown, of
which the most important are the prerogative of mercy and the maintenance of
the Queen’s Peace. He is also concerned with: the administration of justice;
criminal law; the treatment of offenders; probation; the prison service;
public morals and certain public safety matters; the police, fire and emergency
services; immigration and nationality; community relations; administration of
the community development project; co-ordination of government action in
relation to voluntary social services; and legislation on sex discrimination and
race discrimination policy. He also deals with the broad questions of national
broadcasting policy.
Other Home Office responsibilities include: addresses and petitions to the
Queen and preparation of presentations to Parliament; preparation of patents
of nobility for peers, and formal proceedings for the granting of honours;
requests for the extradition of criminals; scrutiny of local authority by-laws;
grant of licences for scientific experiments on animals; exhumation and
removal of bodies; firearms; dangerous drugs; general policy on liquor
licensing laws; gaming and lotteries; charitable collections; and theatre and
cinema licensing.
The Home Secretary is assisted by two Ministers of State and a Parlia¬
mentary Under Secretary of State.
The Department of Industry, under a Secretary of State, is responsible for
general industrial policy and for industrial aspects of regional policy including
financial assistance to industry under the Industry Act. Some regional indus¬
trial policy functions in Scotland and Wales are exercised by the Scottish and
Welsh Offices. The department sponsors individual manufacturing industries,
and is responsible for the nationalised industries: the British Steel Cor¬
poration; the Post Office, British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders. It is also
responsible for industrial research and development, including civil aerospace
research and the supervision of industrial research establishments and for the

provision of technical services to industry. The Design Council and the
National Research Development Corporation come within its sphere.
The Department’s regional offices also serve the Departments of Trade,
Energy, and Prices and Consumer Protection.
The Secretary of State for Industry is assisted by two Ministers of State
and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Central Office of Information (COI), a common service department,
produces information and publicity material, and supplies publicity services
required by other government departments; these departments are responsible
for the policies expressed. In the United Kingdom, it conducts press, television,
radio and poster advertising; produces booklets, leaflets, films, radio and
television material, exhibitions, photographs and other visual material; and
distributes departmental press notices. For the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office it supplies British information posts overseas with press, radio and tele¬
vision material, publications (including magazines), reference services, films,
exhibitions, photographs, and display and reading-room material. The COI
provides exhibition services (except for trade and cultural exhibitions); and
organises tours (other than those sponsored by the British Council and the
British Overseas Trade Board) for visitors officially invited to Britain. There
are nine regional information offices in England providing services for the
home departments and assisting the overseas services by supplying material
and by arranging tours for overseas visitors; similar services are provided on a
mutually agreed basis by the information staffs of the Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Offices.
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax,
corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, capital transfer tax, petroleum
revenue tax, development land tax and certain other direct taxes, and advises
the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected with them. It is
also responsible for the valuation of land and buildings for such purposes as
compensation for compulsory purchase and, in England and Wales, local rates
(a form of local taxation).
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales (the Attorney General
and the Solicitor General) appear on behalf of the Crown in important civil
and criminal proceedings and in proceedings before international tribunals
such as the international court at The Hague and the European Commission
and Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. The Attorney General is the senior
legal adviser to the Government. He has the ultimate responsibility for the
enforcement of the criminal law and his consent is necessary before proceedings
for a number of criminal offences can be commenced; the Director of Public
Prosecutions is subject to his superintendence. Legal proceedings for the en¬
forcement of public rights and on behalf of the interests of charity are conducted
in his name and the functions of the Queen’s Proctor, who has certain duties
connected with the operation of the divorce laws, are exercised under his
direction. The Attorney General is also spokesman for the Lord Chancellor
in the House of Commons on matters affecting the administration of justice.
The Solicitor General is subject to the authority of the Attorney General,
with the same rights and duties. The Law Officers, who are leading barristers
and are always members of the House of Commons, are assisted, particularly
in parliamentary work, by a Parliamentary Secretary.

The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office held by
an eminent ex-member of the judiciary or of the Bar and carrying Cabinet
rank.
In addition to his functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian
of the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor may sit judicially as a member of the
Appellate Committee of the House of Lords or of the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council.
He is also the minister primarily responsible for the administration of the
courts and of the law. The Home Secretary has important responsibilities in
respect of the criminal law but the Lord Chancellor appoints magistrates and
recommends to the Crown most other appointments to the judiciary in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. His responsibility for the courts and for their
administrative staff is exercised through six regional (or circuit) offices and
their sub-offices.
The Lord Chancellor is responsible for court procedure and for law reform,
including appointing the members of the Law Commission, and for presenting
the commission’s reports to Parliament.
In addition he appoints the chairmen of certain administrative tribunals in
England and Wales, and (with the Secretary of State for Scotland) the members
of the Council on Tribunals; and he is responsible for the administration of
the Judge Advocate General’s Department,1 the Department of the Official
Solicitor2 and the Public Record Office (which preserves, and provides access
to, the national archives).
The Ordnance Survey is responsible for the surveying and mapping of Great
Britain. This includes geodetic surveys and associated scientific work, topo¬
graphic surveys and the production of maps at appropriate scales from these
surveys. The Department also undertakes a considerable amount of agency
work for other departments, particularly the Ministry of Defence, and for the
Institute of Geological Sciences and the Land Registry. Parliamentary
responsibility for the Ordnance Survey is exercised by ministers of the Depart¬
ment of the Environment.
Subject to the overall responsibility of the Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, overseas development functions are the responsibility
of a Minister of State, known as the Minister for Overseas Development,
who is assisted by a Parliamentary Secretary.
The separate Ministry of Overseas Development is responsible for Britain’s
policy of financial and technical co-operation in developing countries. It is con¬
cerned with the aid programme as a whole and its detailed composition. The
provision of financial assistance includes both grants and loans (the latter
mostly interest-free) and support for multilateral aid agencies, such as the
IBRD (World Bank); technical co-operation comprises the supply of British
experts and equipment, the training of overseas personnel, and the support
of research and advisory services.
1 The Judge Advocate General’s Department advises the Secretary of State for Defence
and the Defence Council on legal matters arising out of the administration of military
law, and reviews the proceedings of army and air force courts martial.
2 The Official Solicitor is concerned with the interests of minors and people with a
mental disability involved in proceedings in the High Court, who would otherwise not
be represented. In addition he protects the interests of people committed to prison for
contempt of court, acts as Receiver for people with a mental disability, and can be
appointed as Judicial Trustee in complex and disputed trusts.

The Paymaster General’s Office acts generally as a banker for government
departments other than the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and
Excise, for which separate arrangements exist. Money granted by Parliament
is transferred (in such sums as may be required from day to day) from the
Exchequer account to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of
England. Most departmental payments are made by means of payable orders
drawn on the Paymaster General’s Office; their recipients obtain payments
through the commercial banks, whose accounts at the Bank of England are in
turn reimbursed by the Paymaster General’s Office. The Department is also
responsible for the regular payment of many public service pensions.
The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, whose director is the Registrar
General for England and Wales, is concerned with the administration of the
law relating to non-Anglican marriages and to the registration of births, deaths
and marriages in England and Wales; and with the control of the local registra¬
tion service. Its work also includes the preparation and publication of reports
on vital, medical and demographic statistics, taking the periodical census of the
population, and, through the Social Survey Division, supplying the Govern¬
ment with a wide range of statistical findings resulting from sample surveys.
The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection is responsible for
general policy and legislation on prices. It also deals with consumer affairs,
and sets policy for consumer credit, fair trading, monopolies, mergers and
restrictive practices, consumer and home safety, and weights and measures,
including metrication, quality assurance and standards. It is responsible for
the Price Commission, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the Con¬
sumer Protection Advisory Committee, the Metrication Board, the British
Hallmarking Council, the Hearing Aid Council and the Nationalised Industry
Consumer Councils. It is the sponsoring department for the British Standards
Institution and for the National Consumer Council. The Secretary of State
for Prices and Consumer Protection also appoints the Director General of
Fair Trading. The Secretary of State is assisted by a Minister of State and a
Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.
The Treasury Solicitor provides a common legal service for a large number of
government departments in England and Wales. The duties of his department
include instructing Parliamentary Counsel on Bills and drafting subordinate
legislation, representing other departments in court, and giving general advice
on the interpretation and application of the law. The Department undertakes a
considerable amount of conveyancing connected with the transfer of property,
administers the estates of persons dying without known relatives and intestate,
and deals with the outstanding property and rights of dissolved companies.
The Statutory Publications Office is staffed and controlled by the Treasury
Solicitor, who reports annually on its work to the Statute Law Committee
(a body appointed by the Lord Chancellor from among the judiciary and legal
profession in Great Britain).
Some government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; some have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often,
for litigation and conveyancing; others, whose administrative work is based
on or deals with a code of specialised law or involves a great deal of legal work,
have their own independent legal sections.

The Treasury Solicitor is also the Queen’s Proctor (an officer who has
certain duties in connection with the divorce laws).
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) is the publisher for Parliament and
Government. The Controller is the Queen’s Printer of Acts of Parliament
and the copyright of all British government documents is vested in him.
Official publications are sold by government bookshops in London, Edinburgh,
Cardiff, Belfast, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham, and through agents and
booksellers overseas. HMSO is the United Kingdom agent for publications
of the European Community and of other principal international organisations.
HMSO provides a wide range of printing, duplicating, photocopying, and
micro-copying facilities for Parliament and Government in its eight printing
works and other establishments, and through commercial contractors. It
operates five binderies, two of which are involved in the repair of manuscripts
from national archives. HMSO is the central purchasing organisation pro¬
viding the home and overseas public service with paper, printing, binding,
books, office supplies and office machinery, and supporting services, such as
addressing, and distribution and maintenance of office machinery.
The Department of Trade is responsible, under a Secretary of State, for
commercial policy and relations with overseas countries. It promotes British
commercial interests overseas, negotiates trade and commercial matters, and
administers British protective tariffs. It sponsors the work of the British
Overseas Trade Board in export services and government support for overseas
trade fairs and provides an information service to industry largely through the
eight regional offices. It is responsible for companies legislation, supervision
of the insurance industry, the insolvency service and for patent, trade mark
and copyright matters. Other responsibilities include civil aviation, marine and
shipping policy, tourism, the hotel and travel industries, the newspaper,
printing, publishing and film industries, and the distributive and service
trades. The Secretary of State is assisted by two Parliamentary Under Secre¬
taries of State.
The Department of Transport, headed by a Secretary of State, is responsible
in England for the main inland transport industries, including railways, buses,
freight and ports. It is also responsible for the planning and construction of
motorways and trunk roads, although responsibility for the appointment of
inspectors at public inquiries and decisions on their reports is shared with the
Department of the Environment. The Department of Transport is further
responsible for local transport, road and vehicle safety, and vehicle and driver
licensing. The Secretary of State is assisted by a Parliamentary Under Secretary.
The Secretary of State for Wales, a Cabinet minister, has full responsibility
in Wales for ministerial functions relating to child care, health, housing, local
government, education (except universities), town and country planning, new
towns, water and sewerage, roads, agriculture (with some exceptions),
forestry, tourism, national parks, ancient monuments and historic buildings,
and shared responsibility for the administration of urban grants to areas of
acute social deprivation. He has direct ministerial responsibility in Wales for
selective financial assistance to industry, as well as a general responsibility for
economic development. This aspect of the Secretary of State’s work has been
strengthened by the establishment of a Welsh Development Agency, respon¬
sible to him, with important industrial and environmental functions. The
Secretary of State has certain responsibilities relating to the national library
SCOTLAND
The Department
of Agriculture
and Fisheries
for Scotland
GOVERNMENT 51
and the national museum. He is assisted by two Parliamentary Under
Secretaries of State.
The Welsh Office maintains close and continuous working relationships
with the government departments mainly concerned with economic and
industrial affairs. Advice on the implications for Wales of national policies,
particularly in the economic field, is also available to the Secretary of State
through the Welsh Council. The main Welsh Office is in Cardiff, with branches
throughout Wales and a small ministerial office in London.
Scotland has its own system of law and a wide measure of administrative
autonomy. The Secretary of State for Scotland, a United Kingdom Cabinet
minister, has responsibility in Scotland (with some exceptions) both for the
formulation of policy and for its execution in such matters as agriculture and
fisheries, education, local government and environmental services, social
work, health, housing, roads and certain aspects of shipping and road trans¬
port services. He is also responsible for a range of other functions from police
and fire services to sport and tourism. At ministerial level he is assisted by two
Ministers of State and three Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The United Kingdom Government’s administrative functions arising from
these responsibilities are carried out principally by five Scottish departments
based in Edinburgh and known as the Scottish Office. A management group
including five heads of departments under the chairmanship of the Permanent
Under Secretary of State advises the Secretary of State, particularly on
questions, such as the allocation of resources and forward planning, with
which more than one of the departments are concerned.
The Secretary of State also has a major and expanding role in the planning
and development of the Scottish economy. He has important additional
functions related to industrial development, with his assumption of respon¬
sibility for selective financial assistance to industry in Scotland and the
establishment of the Scottish Development Agency which is responsible to
him. He also has responsibilities for the activities in Scotland of the Manpower
Services Commission, the Training Services Agency and the Employment
Services Agency.
He plays a full part in the Government’s determination of energy policy
and exercises a co-ordinating function over activities in Scotland—such as
the location of industry, the creation of employment and the land-based
facilities needed for North Sea oil and gas—which are not his direct respon¬
sibility but have an important effect on the country’s economy. United King¬
dom government departments with significant Scottish responsibilities have
offices in Scotland with delegated powers, and work closely with the Scottish
Office.
The Secretary of State is responsible for legal services in Scotland, and other
important functions are exercised by the two Scottish Law Officers: the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland. On many domestic matters,
in order to reflect distinctive Scottish features and the different conditions
and needs of the country and its people, there is separate legislation relating
wholly to Scotland, or else clauses of special application to Scotland only are
inserted in Acts which otherwise apply to the United Kingdom generally.
The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland has a general re¬
sponsibility for, and in most cases administers, government measures for the
promotion and development of farming in Scotland. It also has responsibilities
for the oversight and protection of the Scottish inshore, deep sea and fresh¬
water fisheries, and functions relating to certain harbours.

The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of services
affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town and country
planning, housing, roads, water supplies and sewerage, coast protection, flood
prevention, building standards and the prevention of river and air pollution
(most of which are administered by local authorities). The Department is also
responsible for general policy in regard to local government organisation and
for ancient monuments and historic buildings; certain transport functions
including oversight of the Scottish Transport Group; and assistance for
shipping services, ferry services, pier work, and air services in the Highlands
and Islands.
The Scottish Economic Planning Department is responsible for industrial and
economic development including the Scottish aspects of regional and industrial
policies and the economic aspects of North Sea oil and gas development;
selective assistance to industry; oversight of the Scottish Development Agency;
rural development, including supervision of the Highlands and Islands
Development Board; electricity; and new towns. The Department also acts
as agent in Scotland for certain of the services of the departments of Trade,
Industry, and Prices and Consumer Protection.
The Scottish Education Department is responsible for the development of
public education in Scotland in all its forms (except universities). Through its
Social Work Services Group the Department has a responsibility for the
guidance of local authorities in their provision and development of social work
services. It is also concerned with sport, including the financing of the
Scottish Sports Council, and with the development of the arts, and has

Royal Scottish Museum (including the Scottish United Services Museum),
the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, and the National Library of
Scotland.
The Scottish Home and Health Department is responsible for the central
administration of functions relating to law and order, including the police
service, criminal justice (other than the conduct of prosecutions) and legal aid
and the administration of penal institutions. It also has responsibility for the
administration of the National Health Service in Scotland, legislation relating
to public service superannuation schemes in Scotland and the administration
of the teachers’ and National Health Service superannuation schemes. The
Home and Health Department is the central authority in Scotland for the
fire service, for certain home defence and emergency services, and for legisla¬
tion concerning shops, theatres, cinemas, licensed premises and land tenure
matters.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Department of the Registrar-
General for Scotland (the General Register Office); the Scottish Record Office;
and the Department of the Registers of Scotland. There are also Scottish
branches of the Great Britain and United Kingdom departments under the
direction of controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the execution in
Scotland of the policy and procedure of their departments is in accordance with
Scottish conditions and needs.

The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned
with questions of legal policy and administration and is himself responsible
for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland,
and the control of summary prosecutions in the Sheriff and District Courts,
which are conducted by officials of the Procurator Fiscal Service. In some of
this work the Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate’s Department
and the Scottish Courts Administration. The members of the Lord Advocate’s
Department also act as legal advisers on Scottish questions to certain govern¬
ment departments who have no Scottish legal adviser of their own. The work
relevant to prosecutions is centred in the Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland, incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department, are responsible to the minister concerned and to the
Law Officers for the drafting of government Bills affecting the law of Scotland.
The Scottish Courts Administration has a general responsibility to the Secre¬
tary of State for the organisation, administration and staffing of the courts
and court offices, and is responsible to the Lord Advocate for certain functions
in the field of law, including the programme of the Scottish Law Commission,
proposals for law reform and questions involving private international law,
international conventions and associated problems, the jurisdiction and
procedure of the Scottish courts, and enforcement of judgments.
Northern Ireland formerly had its own subordinate legislature responsible
for a broad range of domestic matters; the Government of Ireland Act
1920 enacted a constitution which, while preserving the supreme authority of
the United Kingdom Parliament and reserving certain matters to that Parlia¬
ment, provided Northern Ireland with its own legislature and executive to
deal with domestic ‘transferred’ matters. This structure remained in
force until 1972 when, following several years of sectarian violence and
terrorism in Northern Ireland, a period of direct rule was introduced, with
executive powers exercised by a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and
laws made by Order in Council. In 1973 a new type of constitution for the
Province provided, among other things, for the devolution of powers to a
legislative assembly and a ‘power-sharing’ executive. These arrangements
came into force in January 1974, but following widespread opposition in
Northern Ireland the Assembly was prorogued in May 1974. In July 1974 the
Northern Ireland Act was passed, providing for the election of a Con¬
stitutional Convention to consider what arrangements for the government of
Northern Ireland would be likely to command most widespread acceptance
throughout the community. The Act provided that, in the interim period
(defined as one year from the passing of the Act), the United Kingdom Govern¬
ment and Parliament should continue to be responsible for law and order,
electoral matters and business of national importance, such as foreign policy,
defence and certain aspects of taxation, while the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland should be responsible to the United Kingdom Parliament
for the devolved services (such as agriculture, commerce, education, health,
finance and the environment). It further provided that, during this period,
laws for Northern Ireland on matters formerly within the competence of the
Assembly should be made by Order in Council. The Northern Ireland

Assembly was dissolved at the end of March 1975, and elections to the Con¬
stitutional Convention and its first meeting took place in May of that year.
In March 1976, the Convention was dissolved, having failed to reach agreement
on the central issue of a system of government which would provide for a form
of partnership and participation. Direct rule as provided for in the Northern
Ireland Act has since been extended for further periods of a year and Northern
Ireland departments continue to be under the direction and control of the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Government’s principal aim,
however, is for a system of devolved government to be established, in which
both Protestant and Roman Catholic communities participate.
The Northern Ireland Office is the department of the Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland who, assisted by two Ministers of State and two Parliamen¬
tary Under Secretaries of State, has overall responsibility, and is fully answer-
able to Parliament, for the government of Northern Ireland. In addition to
exercising personal responsibility for constitutional developments, law and
order and security in Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State is closely con¬
cerned with financial and economic matters in the Province. The four other
ministers are in charge of the various Northern Ireland departments, the activi¬
ties of which are co-ordinated as necessary.
The Northern Ireland departments’ functions are listed below.
The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the development of Northern
Ireland’s agricultural, forestry and fishing industries. Its functions also include
the collection of agricultural census data, the compilation of statistics, the pro¬
vision of extensive advisory services to farmers, and the promotion of agricul¬
tural research, education and training. The Department acts as agent of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in agricultural support and the
implementation of the European Community’s common agricultural policy.
The Department of the Civil Service is responsible for the general management
and control of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.
The Department of Commerce is concerned with the development of Northern
Ireland’s industry and commerce, and with the administration of schemes of
assistance to industry. The Department also has responsibilities in connection
with electricity and other fuel undertakings; harbours (other than fishery har¬
bours); the tourist trade; the regulation and inspection of mines and quarries;
mineral development; consumer protection; the registration of companies,
societies, credit unions and insurance and unit trusts; and the administration
of an industrial science department.
The Department of Education is responsible for central policy, co-ordination
and financial control of the education (apart from universities), youth and
library services and for the oversight of the five education and library boards
which are responsible for the local administration of these services; for teacher
training; and museums. It also makes awards for teacher training and post¬
graduate studies; formulates and sponsors policies for the improvement of
community relations and community services; and distributes grants for the
arts and various recreational and community facilities.

THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of a
political or judicial office), who usually is paid wholly and directly out of money
voted by Parliament and works in a civil capacity in a department of govern¬
ment. Some civil servants work for Crown bodies, which are not government
departments (the Manpower Services Commission and its agencies are
examples), and are paid out of government grants to these bodies. Including
part-time staff (two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent to one
full-time), there are about 738,000 civil servants (just over one-third of them
women), roughly 343,000 of whom are engaged in the provision of public
services, such as, paying sickness benefits and pensions, collecting taxes and
contributions, running employment services; staffing prisons, and providing
services to industry and agriculture. About 253,000 are employed in the
Ministry of Defence, including the Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Dock¬
yards. The rest are about equally divided between: central administrative and
policy duties; service-wide support services, such as accommodation, printing
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and information; and largely financially self-supporting services, for instance
those provided by the Department for National Savings and the Royal Mint.
Over 75 per cent of civil servants work outside the London area, and further
dispersal from the capital is taking place.
The total of civil servants includes about 171,000 industrial staff, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments, whose pay and condi¬
tions of service are largely separately administered, and differ quite substanti¬
ally from those for non-industrial grades.
Stability of administration is ensured by the political neutrality of the service.
Although a civil servant works under the authority and direction of the minister
of the department to which he is appointed, legally he is a servant of the Crown.
A change of minister, whether due to ministerial changes within a government
or the advent of a government of a different political complexion, does not
involve a change of staff.
Ministers sometimes personally appoint special advisers, who are nonethe¬
less civil servants and are paid from public funds, to give them advice on policy
matters. Such appointments lapse when the Government’s term of office ends.
Following the report of the Fulton committee which in 1968 assessed the struc¬
ture, recruitment and management, including management training, of the
service, the Civil Service has been undergoing a programme of reshaping and
modernisation to make it more effective in carrying out its changing tasks.
The structure of the Home Civil Service is being redesigned to provide for
a more flexible deployment of staff so that talent can be used to the best advan¬
tage and the highest levels of the Civil Service seen to be open to people of
outstanding ability, whatever their specialist background or original method
of entry to the service. These structural changes involve the abolition of
classes, and are being allied with personnel management policies designed to
ensure that, although work requiring specialist skill is always done by appro¬
priately qualified individuals, people with the necessary aptitudes are given
opportunities to gain suitably wide experience to fit them for higher posts.
At the top levels of the Civil Service, where staff are predominantly con¬
cerned with higher management and policy, there is an open and unified struc¬
ture, with three grades—permanent secretary, deputy secretary and under
secretary—available for all types of posts. Posts at these levels are filled by the
people most suitable for them without regard to their academic background or
to whether they were previously in a specialist or administrative stream.
At other levels the structure is being based on a system of occupational
groups, which are the basic groupings of staff for the purposes of pay, recruit¬
ment and personnel management, and categories which consist of one or more
occupational groups having a common pay and grading pattern. Ten cate¬
gories have so far been created, and the groups of staff that are so far members
of them are shown below.
There are five groups within the General Category. The Administration Group
contains some 250,000 staff. Their functions range from the formulation of
policy advice to ministers and the implementation of government policies to
the performance of clerical duties. The Economist Group contains about 390
staff. They provide economic advice and undertake economic analysis. The
Statistician Group (some 530 staff) undertakes the collection and analysis of
statistics required for government purposes. The Information Officer Group
(some 1,400 staff) carries out a variety of specialised press, publicity, public
relations and information work. The Librarian Group (some 380 staff) carries
out the professional librarian duties in departmental libraries.

The Science Category contains the Science Group (16,700 staff), which is
responsible for conducting scientific research and testing in numerous govern¬
ment laboratories and testing establishments, and for providing advice on
scientific policy. Its members also participate in the planning and management
of advanced technology procurement projects.
There are three groups in the Professional and Technology Category. The
Professional and Technology Group contains some 40,000 staff and includes
a range of professionals—architects, surveyors, quantity surveyors, and
electrical and mechanical engineers—and appropriate supporting staff, whose
main function is to plan and oversee a wide range of government construction
and procurement activities, and to carry out certain inspection and regulatory
activities. The Graphics Officer Group contains about 490 staff responsible for
the preparation of all forms of artwork applied to the wide range of require¬
ments within the government service. The Marine Services Group contains
about 600 staff who operate the civilian-manned vessels of the Royal Maritime
Auxiliary Service.
Within the Training Category the Instructional Officer Group comprises
some 5,750 staff employed on instruction in a trade, craft or subject, or on ancil¬
lary or supervisory duties connected with instruction.
The Legal Category contains the Legal Group (England and Wales) and the
Legal Group (Scotland), a total of some 980 staff who carry out a wide range of
legal work for government departments.
The Police Category consists of a single Police Group of some 4,450 staff
who form an internal constabulary to carry out normal police functions in
Ministry of Defence establishments.
The Secretarial Group within the Secretarial Category comprises 22,000
typists, who work mainly in small groups, some 4,600 personal secretaries
who work mainly for senior civil servants, and 1,800 superintendents and
controllers.
The Data Processing Category contains a single group of 8,600 staff who
operate processing equipment in computer and other machine installations.
The Research Officer Category contains the Social Science Research Group,
and the Resource and Planning Research Group, a total of some 460 staff who
carry out a wide range of research work.
The 44,500 staff employed in the single group within the Social Security
Category work in local offices of the Department of Health and Social Security.
The ten categories already established account for over 70 per cent of the
non-industrial staff. The intention is that the remainder (including support
staff such as paperkeepers, messengers and office-keepers) will be absorbed into
existing categories or, where this is impossible, into additional categories
set up for the purpose.
The Diplomatic Service was established in 1965 as a separate service of the
Crown and provides the staff for service in the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office and at United Kingdom diplomatic missions and consular posts in
foreign and in independent Commonwealth countries. Its functions include
advising on policy, negotiating with overseas governments and conducting
business in international organisations; promoting British exports and the
advancement of British trade; administering British aid, presenting British
ideas, policies and objectives to the people of overseas countries; and protecting
British interests abroad.
The Service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with that
of the Home Civil Service. It also has secretarial, communications and security

officer branches. Specialists and advisers from home departments or the
armed forces may serve at overseas posts on loan or attachment and it is
intended to build a closer working relationship between the Diplomatic
Service and the Home Civil Service.
Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which, subject to regional differ¬
ences, is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, recruitment being
effected through its own Civil Service Commission. Interchange of staff
between the two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for
departmental agreement in individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but when
vacancies cannot be filled by this means generally the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office, the Ministry of Overseas Development and the Crown Agents
for Oversea Governments and Administrations are asked to recruit other
candidates, principally from the United Kingdom. Hong Kong has its own
Government office in London with responsibility for recruiting to the Hong
Kong public service.
Recruitment to the Civil Service is the responsibility of the Civil Service Com¬
mission which, working in conjunction with departments, ensures that staff
are selected on the basis of fair and open competition. The selection of junior
staff such as those engaged in clerical and manual work, is undertaken almost
entirely by departments. The commission, however, always issues the certifi¬
cate of qualification’ necessary for permanent appointment. The appointment
of a successful candidate is made by the department concerned.
For the Administration Group, which forms the central part of the Home
Civil Service, entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic achieve¬
ments of university honours graduates; 18-year-old school-leavers; and 16-
year-old school-leavers. The selection procedure for the highest of these levels
(the Administration Trainee entry) comprises qualifying tests, followed by a
series of tests and interviews at the Civil Service Selection Board and an inter¬
view by the Final Selection Board. The next level (the Executive Officer entry)
selection from among those possessing the necessary academic qualifications is
in two stages, a set of qualifying tests followed by an interview. For the clerical
entrants selection is normally by interview of those holding the prescribed
educational qualifications.
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications, and selection is on the basis of past record and by interview.
In all except the smallest government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors whose task it is to help identify the training needs of the
staff and to organise courses, both general and technical, to provide for their
varying requirements. A substantial number of management courses is run
within the Civil Service both by departments and by the Civil Service College.
Use is also made of external management courses in business schools, the
Administrative Staff College, Henley, and other centres.
Methods of training within the Civil Service combine lectures, discussion
groups, instructional visits and case-studies with the use of many audio-visual
aids such as closed-circuit television and video-tape recordings, instructional
films and self-instructional programmes. There is also a considerable amount
of ‘on-the-job’ training. Civil servants are regularly moved between the
GOVERNMENT
59
Promotion
Conditions of
Service
different branches of their department and sometimes between departments
so that they can gain as wide an experience as possible of Civil Service work.
In order that they may continue their education, arrangements are made for
the release of civil servants under the age of 18 to attend appropriate courses
usually on one day a week (‘day release’ schemes). Adult staff are assisted
financially to undertake, mainly in their own time, private studies leading to
recognised educational or professional qualifications in approved subjects.
There are also opportunities for civil servants in mid-career to obtain fellow¬
ships or otherwise to go on sabbatical leave to undertake research in areas of
interest to themselves or their departments.
Training is co-ordinated by the Training Division of the Civil Service
Department which is responsible, in conjunction with the Civil Service
College, for the analysis and determination of training needs to be met cen¬
trally, and which exercises advisory functions in regard to departmental
training. Central training is provided by the Civil Service College which
offers a wide range of courses and seminars (some of a broad developmental
nature and others more job-related) for civil servants, including those in specia¬
list groups, at various levels up to and including that of under secretary. Sub¬
jects include structure and machinery of government, management studies,
social administration and social policy, economics, accountancy and financial
management, statistics and operational research, computers, information
systems and management services; many of the courses are multi-disciplinary.
The College also provides courses on European institutions and has reciprocal
training arrangements with other European countries.
A period of probation (varying according to grade, with extensions in certain
instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the Civil Service.
Promotions are made partly through centrally conducted examinations and
partly by the departments themselves. Promotions or appointments to deputy
secretary-level posts and above and all transfers between departments at these
levels are approved by the Prime Minister, who is advised by the official head
of the Home Civil Service.
Normally promotion is from grade to grade, but arrangements exist for
accelerated promotion for staff who have shown exceptional promise.
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service as
a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed jointly
of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate sections
of the service is provided through the various staff associations which civil
servants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil and Public Services
Association, the Society of Civil and Public Servants and the Institution
of Professional Civil Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils.
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a fair com¬
parison with that paid for broadly comparable work outside the service and
usually he receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the
grade to which he belongs. There is a pension scheme. The aim of the Civil
Service is to ensure that every civil servant who is capable and efficient realises
his or her full potential.
It is possible for staff to interrupt their careers, or to have special leave
granted, to look after domestic responsibilities, and staff who resign may apply
later to rejoin the service in the grade they held at the time of resignation.
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each week.
Certain grades are eligible for overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of
6o
Political and
Private Activities
Security
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the standard hours, but this does not apply to the higher grades whose salaries
are determined on the assumption that they will work as long as necessary with¬
out additional pay. The standard working week for office staff is 42 hours (41
in London). Annual leave varies according to grade and length of service up to a
maximum of 30 working days a year.
Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance benefit received, may be
granted to civil servants for up to six months in a 12-month period, and there¬
after on reduced p3y up to a maximum of one year s sick leave in any four
years; any officer whose health is permanently impaired may be retired.
The position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the Government of the day
irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which he is free, as a
private individual, to participate in political activities varies according to grade.
For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who are
completely free to engage in all kinds of national and local political activities
(although if they intend standing for Parliament, they must resign their appoint¬
ment before nomination day on the understanding that if not elected they will
be reinstated in their previous capacity within a week of the declaration of the
election result); those who are free, subject to the acceptance of the need for
discretion and with the permission of the department, to take part in most activi¬
ties except parliamentary candidature; and those who are debarred from
national political activities though they may seek permission to take part in local
government political activities. In the non-industrial Civil Service the com¬
pletely free groups are mostly ancillary staff such as cleaners and messengers.
The intermediate group includes mainly members of the clerical and typing
grades and the granting of permission by the department depends, broadly, on
the nature of the work done. The remainder are not allowed to take part in
national political activities. Permission is usually granted to members of all
groups to engage in local political activities to the maximum extent consistent
with the reputation of the Civil Service for political impartiality and the avoid¬
ance of any conflict with official duties. Where permission is granted, it is sub¬
ject to a code of discretion and to the obligation to notify the department of
election or co-option to a local council. A committee of inquiry, set up by the
Government to review the rules governing political participation by civil ser¬
vants, has said that it considers these arrangements to be unnecessarily restric¬
tive and has recommended that the group allowed to take part in national
political activities with departmental permission should be substantially
enlarged.
All civil servants enjoy the right to register their private political opinions on
appropriate occasions, for instance, at general or local authority elections. They
may also engage in such private activities as they wish, provided that these do
not in any way conflict with their official duties, nor with the provisions of the
Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1920, and the Prevention of Corruption Act
1926. However, since a civil servant must not use his official position to further
his private interests, he is subject to certain restrictions in commerce and
business: for instance, he may not hold private interests in public contracts and
he may not use official information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without
the approval of his department.
As a general rule the political views of civil servants are not a matter of official
concern, but there are some civil duties in which secrecy is so vitally important
to State security that the Government does not feel itself justified in employing
anyone to carry them out whose reliability is in doubt. For this reason no one

who is known to be a member of, or actively associated or in sympathy with, the
Communist Party or with Fascist organisations, or is liable to be a security risk
in any other respect, is employed on secret work.
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security,
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a Director-
General who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals with
national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the Leader of the Opposi¬
tion, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public service
and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security arrange¬
ments is necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
The local government system comprises a pattern of elected councils for
defined areas. The councils represent their own localities, provide a local level
of democracy and make available a wide range of services.
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Act of Parliament (or by measures made under the authority of an Act). The
actual administration and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits are
the responsibility of the local authority, but, in respect of certain services, Acts
of Parliament dealing with local government give government ministers defined
powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national uniformity
in the standard of service provided or to safeguard public health, while others
are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For some services the
minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for others there are strictly
limited powers. Government policy is to ensure that central government con¬
trols over local authorities are kept to the minimum necessary.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local govern¬
ment give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory circu¬
lars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The main links between local authorities and the central Government are:
in England, the Department of the Environment; in Scotland, the Scottish
Development Department; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ire¬
land, the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
(outside Greater London) is a division of the country into 53 large county
authorities, within which there are 369 smaller district authorities. Both types
of authority have independent, locally elected councils, and have separate
functions to perform. County authorities normally provide the large-scale
local government services, while the districts are responsible for the more
local ones (see pp 63-4). However, in six of the English counties, which are in
heavily populated areas and known as ‘metropolitan’ counties, responsibility
for certain large-scale services rests with the district authorities. In England
populations in the non-metropolitan counties range from 288,000 to about
1-4 million (the Isle of Wight with a population of about 112,000 is an excep¬
tion), and in the metropolitan counties from 1-2 to 27 million. District authori¬
ties within metropolitan counties have populations of between 167,000 and
i" 1 million; other districts’ populations average between 75,000 and 100,000,
although many fall outside this range. The local government system in Wales
closely resembles that in non-metropolitan areas of England. Populations in the
counties range from 102,000 to 540,000, and the districts have populations of
62 BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
between 19,600 and 282,000. English parish councils or meetings in villages
and small towns serve as focuses for local opinion as bodies with limited
powers of local interest. In Wales community councils have similar functions.
Greater London—an administrative area of about 610 square miles (1,580
sq km) and a population of some 7 million—is administered by the Greater
London Council, the councils of 32 London boroughs (with populations rang¬
ing from 136,000 to 331,000) and the Corporation of the City of London (the
historic centre which has a resident population of about 6,800).
On the mainland of Scotland local government is on a two-tier basis: nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each area having its own elected council.
There are three virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles. Provision is made for local community councils to be formed.
These councils have no statutory functions and are not local authorities.
The pattern of local authorities, and of their electoral arrangements, is kept
up to date by Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and Scotland.
In Northern Ireland there are 26 district councils which are responsible for
local environmental and other services. Statutory bodies and local offices,
responsible to central departments, administer major services such as roads,
education, health, and housing. Populations of the districts range from 13,000
to over 350,000.
Constitution Local authority councils consist of a number of elected unpaid councillors
and Election of presided over by a chairman. They can claim flat-rate attendance allowance as
Councils of right (without proof of loss of earnings) on the performance of council
business; they are also entitled to travelling and subsistence allowances. Parish
and community councillors cannot claim for duties within their own areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland each council annually elects a
chairman and vice-chairman. Some districts have the ceremonial title of
borough, or city, both granted by royal authority (except in Northern Ireland
where they are granted by the Secretary of State). In boroughs and cities the
chairman is normally known as the Mayor (in the City of London and certain
other large cities, he is known as the Lord Mayor). In Scottish regions and
islands areas the chairman is called the convener and the chairman of the
district councils of each of the four cities is called the Lord Provost. No general
title is laid down for the chairmen of the other district councils, but some are
known as conveners, while others continue to use the old burghal title of
‘provost’.
The term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government is
usually four years. In England and Wales county council elections took place
in 1977 and will be held every fourth year thereafter. Metropolitan district
elections are held for a third of the seats in each year when there is no county
council election. Non-metropolitan district councils may adopt the same
procedure or opt for whole council elections; the latter took place in 1976
and are being held again in 1979 and every following fourth year. In London
elections to the Greater London Council were held in 1977 and elections to the
London borough councils in 1978. In Scotland elections for the regions and
islands areas took place in 1978. Elections for the districts were held in 1977’
Elections for the district councils in Northern Ireland took place in 1977 anc^
will be held every fourth year thereafter.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote
at a local government election in Great Britain provided that he or she is 18
years of age or over, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not
subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for

the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for registration as a
local government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register (compiled
annually), he or she is resident in the council area. In Northern Ireland the
qualification for voting is a little different.
A candidate for election as councillor—man or woman—normally stands
as a representative of one of the national political parties, as a member of an
association representing some local interest, or as an independent. He must be
a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic and aged 21 or over. In
addition, he must be registered as a local government elector in the area of
the local authority to which he seeks election; or have resided or occupied (as
owner or tenant) land or other premises in that area during the whole of the
12 months preceding the day on which he is nominated as a candidate; or, in
that 12 months, have had his principal or only place of work there. A candidate
is also subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed to ensure
that unsuitable people do not offer themselves for election.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local
council elections. Administrative counties in England and Wales are divided
into electoral divisions returning one or more councillors. Districts in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland are divided into electoral ‘wards’. In Scotland
in the regions and islands areas the electoral areas are called electoral divisions,
each returning a single member; the districts are divided into wards, similarly
returning a single member. For parish or community council elections in
England and Wales, each parish or ward of a parish (or, in some cases, a com¬
bination of parishes) forms an electoral area which returns one or more
members. For elections to the Greater London Council, Greater London is
divided into electoral divisions, each returning one councillor.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer con¬
cerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar
to that for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are
more restricted. In Great Britain each elector has one vote for each seat con¬
tested in his electoral area: he need not record all his votes, but must not give
more than one vote for each candidate. In Northern Ireland local govern¬
ment elections are held on the basis of proportional representation and for this
purpose electoral wards are grouped into district electoral areas. Facilities
for postal voting are available.
The functions of local authorities are far reaching. Some are framed primarily
as duties mandatory on an authority, others are purely permissive.
Broadly speaking, functions in England and Wales are divided between
county and district councils on the basis that county councils are responsible
for matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring
the support of substantial resources. Within the metropolitan areas district
councils are responsible for functions needing substantial resources because
they have populations large enough to give such support. District councils as a
whole administer functions of more local significance. In London the division
of functions is slightly different.
In England all county councils are responsible for such matters as strategic
planning, transportation planning, highways, traffic regulation, consumer pro¬
tection, refuse disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries and the
personal social services are functions of county councils in non-metropolitan
areas and of district councils in metropolitan areas. All district councils are
responsible, for instance, for environmental health, housing, decisions on most
64

planning applications and refuse collection. They may also provide off-street
car parks subject to the consent of the county council. Powers to operate some
functions—such as the provision of museums, art galleries and parks—are
available at both levels; arrangements depend on local agreement.
In Greater London the London boroughs and the Corporation of the City of
London are responsible for the same range of functions as district councils in
metropolitan areas (with the addition of consumer protection). The Greater
London Council (GLC) deals only with those services which by their nature
require unified administration and control over the whole area. In the inner
London area education is administered by the Inner London Education
Authority, an independent committee of the GLC. Responsibility for highways
in London is divided according to the type of road: the main strategic road net¬
work is a matter for the GLC, while the London boroughs look after the other
roads. The boroughs are primarily responsible for the provision of housing,
although the GLC also maintains a stock of housing. It is additionally involved
in such matters as the provision of housing outside London for people from the
London area, assisting the inner London boroughs in relation to slum clearance,
the provision of accommodation for people on the London boroughs’ housing
waiting lists, and the rehousing of its own tenants and those of the London
boroughs whose accommodation needs have changed. The police force in the
London area (see p 78) is directly responsible to the Home Secretary.
In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non-metropolitan
areas of England. The main differences are that Welsh district councils are re¬
sponsible for refuse disposal; they may, subject to the consent of the county
council, provide on-street as well as off-street car parking facilities; and they
may, exceptionally, exercise library and consumer protection functions.
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for most of their func¬
tions to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority. The exceptions
to this general rule are functions relating to education, police, the personal social
services and national parks.
In Scotland the regional and district authorities discharge local government
functions in a way broadly similar to that of authorities in England and Wales,
including some at both levels. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, because
of their isolation, have single, virtually all-purpose authorities.
In Northern Ireland, local environmental and certain other services are
administered by the district councils, but responsibility for planning, roads,
water supply and sewerage services is exercised in each district by a local
office of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland working
closely with the district council and its staff. Area boards, responsible to
appropriate central departments, administer locally education, public libraries
and the health and personal social services. The Northern Ireland Housing
Executive, responsible to the Department of the Environment, administers
housing.
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own in¬
ternal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they dis¬
charge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system, whereby
questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and committees are
appointed to administer the various services. Parish and community councils in
England and Wales are often able to do their work efficiently in full session
although they appoint committees from time to time as necessary. Some
councils have established policy advisory or co-ordinating committees with

powers to originate policy, subject to the approval of the full council. The
powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be advisory or
executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except its powers in
connection with raising loans, levying rates (see p 66), or making financial
demands on other authorities liable to contribute, which are legally reserved to
the council as a whole.
Local authorities can make arrangements among themselves for the discharge
of their functions. These include co-operation through joint committees, joint
teams and the loan of staff. One authority may discharge functions for another,
and may also supply others with a range of goods and services.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of a council (and of
committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered if the
council (or committee) resolves that publicity for that matter would be pre¬
judicial to the public interest.
The execution of council policy rests with salaried officers and employees, of
whom there may be tens of thousands in the larger authorities. Some 2*8 million
people are employed by local authorities in Great Britain. These include ad¬
ministrative, professional and technical staff, manual workers and teachers.
Although a few appointments, such as chief education and fire officers and the
director of social services, must by law be made by all the authorities responsible
for the functions concerned, councils are individually responsible within
national policy requirements for determining the size and composition of their
work forces and the way they should be used. An authority must not, however,
employ one'of its own councillors. In Northern Ireland, each council must
by law appoint a clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or chief
officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial kind;
subordinate officers employed in an administrative, a professional, clerical or
technical capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical
work for which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually
made at the instance of the committee or committees particularly concerned;
most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are also
responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engagements
always conform to the council’s set establishment, and committees are informed
of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within the
jurisdiction of the employing council, although there are recommended scales.
Local authority expenditure in the United Kingdom (on both current and
capital accounts) was about £20,000 million in 1977. A clear distinction is made
between capital and current expenditure. Capital expenditure (just under a
quarter of the total) is financed partly from the current account surplus (about
half), from borrowing (two-fifths) and the remainder from grants and other
incomes. Housing, the major element, accounted for over half in 1977. Current
expenditure by local authorities accounts for just over a quarter of total current
account spending by central and local government. The education service
represents over a third of this expenditure, followed by the police, personal
social services, roads (including lighting), public health and debt interest.
Current expenditure is financed mainly from central government grants (about
three-fifths) and from local rates paid by occupiers of land and building
(about one-third). Each local authority is responsible for its own finance,

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government
Grants
Rates
although in a few cases several authorities combine to organise a specialist
service which it would be uneconomic for each authority to provide on its own.
Government ‘rate support grants’ to local authorities are paid in aid of revenues
generally. Grants are also paid towards the cost of specific services—either
towards current expenditure, such as on the police, or towards capital expen¬
diture, such as on the acquisition and clearance of derelict land. (In Wales,
approved schemes for the acquisition and clearance of derelict land are financed
by the Welsh Development Agency.) Annual subsidies are paid for local
authority housing.
Rate support grants are distributed among authorities in three parts: the
‘needs’ element which is designed to give most help to authorities whose spend¬
ing needs are greatest; the ‘resources’ element, which is used to supplement the
rate income of authorities whose rateable value per head of population falls
below a standard figure, prescribed for each year; and the ‘domestic’ element,
which compensates authorities for loss of rate income from reductions in rate
poundage which they are required to give to householders. The formula for
distributing the ‘needs’ element is subject to annual variations. Grants are also
made towards the cost of rate rebates for people with low incomes.
In Northern Ireland the district councils receive specific grants plus a
general grant used to supplement the resources of those councils whose rateable
value resources are below the standard level.
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of land and property (with certain
exceptions, see below) to meet part of the cost of local services. Each
occupier’s payment is calculated annually by the rating authority by multiply¬
ing the rateable value of his property (broadly equivalent to its annual rental
value) by the rate poundage—an amount per £ of rateable value fixed by the
authority according to its projected financial needs. In England and Wales
rateable values are assessed periodically by the Board of Inland Revenue (see
p 47). The last general revaluation of all property was in 1973- Disputes about
rating assessments are heard by local valuation courts, and on appeal by the
Lands Tribunal. Public undertakings have their rates separately determined.
Crown property is not rateable but payments are made, based on values
assessed by the Treasury Valuer, in lieu of rates.
In Scotland valuation is carried out by assessors appointed by the regional
and islands councils. The last general revaluation was in i97^‘ Appeals are
heard by the valuation appeal committees of each valuation area and there¬
after by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of Session.
In Northern Ireland valuations are carried out by the Valuation Officer of
the Department of Finance. There is a right of appeal. The present valuations
came into force in 1976.
Responsibility for levying and collecting rates in England and Wales lies
with the district councils and London borough councils. Each county council
(and the Greater London Council) determines what rate will be required to
meet its estimated expenditure and district councils (and London borough
councils) include this element in the rate they levy. Householders benefit from
domestic rate relief and those with lower incomes may also qualify for rate
rebates; both reliefs are financed by government grants. Rates may be paid by
instalments, normally in ten one-monthly payments. Rating relief is available
in certain circumstances on premises adapted for the use of the disabled.
Agricultural land and buildings (apart from living accommodation) and places
of religious worship are exempted from rate payments. Charities pay half the
full rate on premises they occupy for charitable purposes and may be given

further relief by rating authorities, who can also reduce or remit the rates for
a wide range of non-profit-making bodies. Rates may be levied on empty
properties at any percentage up to the full amount and in the case of empty
commercial property a rating surcharge may be payable.
In Scotland every authority determines a rate for its own services, but the
collection of rates and the administration of rating is the responsibility of
regional and island councils. Industrial (including freight transport) premises
in Scotland are rated at a half of net annual value and the right to pay rates in
instalments extends to all ratepayers. There is empty property rating in
Scotland but no empty property surcharge.
In Northern Ireland there are two rates: one set by the district councils
and one set by the Department of Finance. Both are collected by the Depart¬
ment and the appropriate part paid over to the respective councils. Industrial
(including freight transport) premises are rated at a quarter of net annual value
and the degree of charitable exemption is decided by the Valuation Office.
Empty properties are not rated.
Loans may be raised by local authorities to finance capital expenditure under
general powers conferred by national legislation. For items of expenditure in
key sectors (such as education, housing and roads) local authorities in England
and Wales must seek approval from the government department concerned
before raising loans. For other capital expenditure, each authority receives an
annual loan authorisation within which it determines what sums to borrow and
what projects to undertake. The GLC applies annually for parliamentary sanc¬
tion to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure while the City of
London has ancient charter powers to cover its borrowings. In Northern
Ireland long-term borrowing by district councils is subject to approval by the
Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland. In Scotland depart¬
mental approval is given to capital expenditure, not to loans.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by means of private mortgages,
issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange and bonds which may or may not be
quoted on the Stock Exchange. Local authorities also have right of access to the
Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer, or, in Northern Ireland,
to the Government Loans Fund, for long-term borrowing to finance a propor¬
tion of their reckonable capital payments, and may borrow temporarily for a
limited proportion of their current outstanding loan debt.
Internal control of finance is normally exercised on behalf of the council con¬
cerned by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy
of the council under constant review. (There is no statutory requirement for
local authorities to appoint a finance committee, but they have to make proper
arrangements for the administration of their financial affairs.) Local authorities
must have their accounts audited. Those in England and Wales can choose
between the district auditor (appointed by the Secretary of State for the En¬
vironment) and an approved private auditor (or partly both). In Scotland the
auditing of accounts is the responsibility of an independent Commission for
Local Authority Accounts in Scotland appointed by the Secretary of State
for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland it is carried out by independent local
government auditors appointed by the Department of the Environment.
A complaints system for local government in England and Wales involves inde¬
pendent statutory Commissions for Local Administration (one each for Eng¬
land and Wales) comprising a number of local commissioners, each responsible
in a particular area of the country for investigating citizens’ complaints of
68
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
maladministration by local authorities. In Scotland there is a single Com¬
missioner for Local Administration. The commissioners help local authority
councillors to protect the interests of constituents.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by district councils,
and certain other public bodies.
THE FIRE SERVICES
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to a
measure of central control. The cost is borne by local authorities, aided by
central government through the rate support grant (see p 66). Every part of
the country is covered by a public fire brigade. Northern Ireland has its own
service responsible to the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
Fire Authorities Each of 68 fire authorities in the United Kingdom must by law make provision
for fire-fighting purposes, and in particular maintain a brigade of sufficient
strength to meet efficiently all normal requirements (in some parts of Scotland,
authorities are combined to provide fire cover). Other fire-fighting organisa¬
tions are maintained, for instance, by the Army and Air Force Departments of
the Ministry of Defence; by the Department of Industry at certain establish¬
ments ; and by some large industrial and commercial concerns.
Central Control The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility for the fire service in England and Wales and in Scotland respec¬
tively. Central control is directed mainly towards ensuring the operational effi¬
ciency of brigades. Ministers have statutory powers to make regulations on such
matters as appointments and promotions, standards of training and equipment,
pensions, and disciplinary matters. Their approval is also required for reduc¬
tions in the operational establishments of fire brigades. Each minister is advised
by a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of officers of the re¬
spective home departments, representatives of the local authority associations,
and of the associations representing members of fire brigades, and other persons
with special qualifications, appointed by the minister concerned. Inspectorates
of fire services advise the ministers on operational and technical matters.
Personnel Most fire brigade establishments include part-time retained personnel to aug¬
ment and support the full-time strength in return for a retaining fee and call-out
and attendance fee. Volunteer members (who receive no remuneration) under¬
take to attend a fire if called upon. Fire authorities also employ people for duties
in controls communications and mobilising and staff duties. Some brigades
have schemes for the employment of juniors of 16-18 years, prior to their enrol¬
ment as regular members at the age of 18.
Each fire authority must draw up a scheme showing the establishment of
personnel, the number and location of fire stations and the number and type of
appliances considered necessary for the provision of fire cover for its area.
Establishment schemes vary according to the fire risks in the area concerned. In
the United Kingdom there are about 31,240 full-time and 16,130 part-time
operational members of fire brigades.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at collective training schools run by the
larger fire authorities. In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central
training school. Management and command training is provided for the higher

and middle ranks at the Fire Service Staff College, where high-level operational
studies are also conducted. Fire prevention, practical firemanship, advance¬
ment and instructor training for junior and middle ranks is provided at the Fire
Service Technical College. Both colleges are maintained by the Home Office
and the Scottish Home and Health Department. Facilities for officers from
overseas fire services.to study the organisation, current training methods,
appliances and equipment of British fire brigades are arranged by the Home
Office Fire Department.
Every fire authority must buy such appliances and equipment as may be neces¬
sary to meet efficiently all normal fire-fighting requirements in its area. Certain
items of equipment are standardised so that there is complete interchange-
ability when a fire is attended by personnel and appliances from more than one
area. The principal types of fire-fighting appliances are bought by fire authori¬
ties to requirement specifications approved by the Home Office and the Scottish
Home and Health Department on the advice of the respective Central Fire
Brigades Advisory Councils. These specifications ensure that minimum stan¬
dards are maintained, and allow sufficient freedom of design to meet special cir¬
cumstances and encourage further developments.
In the United Kingdom some 5,000 fire-fighting appliances are used (includ¬
ing pumps, turntable ladders, hydraulic platforms, water tenders, emergency
tenders, foam tenders and hose-laying lorries), and are housed in just over
2,000 fire stations.
Each fire authority must appoint a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in Scotland)
for its fire brigade. The appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary
or by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Central control is exercised by the Chief Fire Officer from brigade head¬
quarters. Divisional officers in charge of the geographical divisions into which
most brigade areas are divided are responsible for mobilising forces to deal with
outbreaks of fire in their divisions. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters and, if at any time an outbreak of
fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division, help is sent from one or
more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of another fire authority.
Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire authorities, the nearest
available force is sent to a fire, regardless of area boundaries.
Fire authorities have discretion to employ their brigades and equipment for
purposes other than fire-fighting, and they are used in a variety of emergencies
(such as rail, road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings, flooding of
premises, leakage of noxious gas or liquids and the rescue of people or animals
from dangerous situations) for which no charges are made. Brigades are also
used, by prior arrangement, for such purposes as emptying swimming pools
and filling water tanks.
Fire authorities are concerned with fire prevention measures relating to most
buildings to which the public have resort or in which they are employed. The
authorities are also under a statutory duty to give advice on fire prevention,
restricting the spread of fires, and means of escape in case of fire. Courses in
fire prevention are held at the Fire Service Technical College for fire brigade
officers.
Fire precautions are not normally required by law in private dwellings, so
that, in addition to enforcement duties, brigades are also involved in educa¬
tional and publicity activities to promote fire safety in the home.

Research
Central government is advised on all these fire prevention matters by the
Joint Fire Prevention Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Coun¬
cils, representing the service and central and local authorities.
Research into the different aspects of fire is undertaken by a number of govern¬
ment departments and other organisations. A comprehensive programme of
research into fire brigade operations, organisation, fire-fighting appliances and
equipment is conducted by the Home Office with the help of the fire service
under the auspices of the Joint Committee on Fire Research of the Central Fire
Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual research projects are undertaken by
the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch or, under contract to the Home
Office, by other government agencies, notably the Fire Research Station, which
is part of the Building Research Establishment of the Department of the En¬
vironment, or by private consultants.
The Fire Research Station is the main organisation undertaking the study
and investigation of the technical aspects of fire. Its work is supervised by a
steering committee, the membership of which is drawn from the Department
of the Environment, the Home Office and independent sources.

European Community
Formation of
the European
Communities
The European
Coal and Steel
Community
The European
Economic
Community
Britain, together with the Irish Republic and Denmark, joined the original six
countries—Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxem¬
bourg and the Netherlands—in the European Community on i January 1973.
British membership of the Community was endorsed, after renegotiation of
the terms of membership, in June 1975 by a more than two-to-one majority in
the first national referendum to be held in Britain. The period of transition
following accession ended on 31 December 1977. Britain plays a full and
positive part in all Community activities. Details of Britain’s participation in
specific policies of the Community are contained in the appropriate chapters.
The European Community consists of three communities set up by separate
treaties—the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic
Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), set up in 1952, established
a common market for coal and steel and formed the model for the ‘community’
approach to economic integration. The ECSC is designed to ensure an orderly
supply of coal and steel to member countries, to promote the rational ex¬
pansion and modernisation of production and to provide better conditions of
employment and living for the employees in the industries. The Treaty of Paris,
signed in 1951, which established the ECSC, provided for the abolition of
duties and quantitative restrictions (or charges having the same effect) on trade
in coal and steel between member states; of discrimination by producers in
prices, delivery terms or transport rates; of any measures which hampered free
choice of supplier; and of restrictive practices resulting in the collusive sharing
or exploitation of markets. The treaty also provided for action by the Com¬
munity over a wide field of activity in the coal and steel industries, the work of
the Community being financed mainly by a levy on production. The Com¬
munity provides funds for capital investment, research and other programmes,
as well as loans to help create new jobs where coal seams are being exhausted
or where restructuring of the steel industry is taking place. Grants to assist
redundant coal and steel workers until they find new employment, or while
they are undergoing retraining, are also made.
The European Economic Community (EEC) was created by the Treaty of
Rome signed by the six countries in 1957. It aimed to promote a continuous
and balanced economic expansion by establishing a common market and pro¬
gressively approximating the member states’ economic policies. The preamble
to the Treaty included among the basic objectives of the EEC the laying of the
foundations for a growing unity among European peoples, the improvement
of their living and working conditions, the progressive abolition of restrictions
on trade, and the development of the prosperity of overseas countries. The
initial steps towards the attainment of these objectives were the creation of a
72

Community

Accession
European
Communities
Act
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
customs union, abolition of internal tariffs and other barriers to trade and
establishment of a common external tariff, the development of a common
policy for agriculture, and the introduction of measures to establish the free
movement of labour, capital and services. At the same time, provision was
made for the overseas countries which had special links with the member
countries to have preferential treatment in aid and the development of trade.
This principle has since been embodied in the Lome Convention of 1975,
which covers 53 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, and in
the arrangements made in 1976 with the British dependent territories and
the other Community countries’ overseas countries and territories (see
P 358)-
The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was set up by a second
treaty signed in Rome in 1957, which provided for the co-ordinated develop¬
ment of members’ atomic energy industries and of their other peaceful nuclear
activities. Euratom has worked to develop a co-ordinated research programme
(for power production, industrial and medical purposes), to ensure the dis¬
semination of technical information, to facilitate the co-ordination of invest¬
ment in the nuclear field, to ensure an adequate supply of nuclear ores and fuels,
and to develop wider commercial outlets. Since 1959, there has been a common
market for all nuclear materials and equipment, with a common external
tariff on imports of nuclear materials, while the Community has established
common nuclear legislation and a common control system for nuclear materials
to prevent their diversion to purposes other than those declared.
The Treaty of Accession was signed by the applicant countries and the original
member states in January 1972. Britain thereby became a party to the two
treaties of Rome establishing the EEC and Euratom, adjusted as necessary to
take account of enlargement. Accession to the ECSC was effected by a decision
of the Council of Ministers.
In 1977, following a transitional period during which tariffs on trade in
industrial products between Britain and the original six members were pro¬
gressively reduced, the internal tariffs were abolished and the phased intro¬
duction of the common external tariff on British imports from countries neither
members of the Community, nor having any special arrangements with it, was
completed. Britain had also adopted, progressively, the Community system
of agricultural support undfer the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The
treaty provided for a slightly longer period of adjustment with regard to pay¬
ments to the Community budget (see p. 75). Other provisions included those
relating to participation in the Community’s institutions and to its relations
with Commonwealth and other countries.
The European Communities Act became law in October 1972 an<^ ma<ie the
legislative changes necessary for Britain to comply with the obligations entailed
by membership of the Community and to exercise the rights of membership.
The Act gave the force of law in Britain to that part of Community law which
is directly applicable in member states. It also contained detailed legislation
(in part repealing or amending existing statutes) to implement Community
obligations.
Community Law Community policies are implemented by means of regulations, which are
legally binding and directly applicable in all member countries; directives,
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
73
Institutions
which are binding, as to the result to be achieved, on those member states to
which they are addressed but allow national authorities to decide on the means
of implementation; decisions, which are binding on those to whom they are
addressed (foi example, member states, firms, or individuals); and recommen¬
dations and opinions, which have no binding force.
The separate institutions established by the treaties for each of the three Com¬
munities were merged in 1967. The institutions (the Council of Ministers, the
Commission, the European Assembly, the Court of Justice, the Court of
Auditors, and the Economic and Social Committee), together with other
bodies and organs dealing with specific subjects, provide a framework within
which the interests of the member states are represented and reconciled, and
common policies formulated and administered. Each state has one representa¬
tive on the Council; in the other institutions Britain’s representation is in line
with that of the other large member states (France, Federal Republic of
Germany, and Italy). English is one of the six official languages of the
Community.
The Council of Ministers is the final decision-making body for all major
Community questions and is the only institution established by the treaties
whose members, usually the foreign minister or other ministers appropriate to
the subject of discussion, directly represent each member country. Most
council decisions are taken on the basis of a proposal by the Commission.
Where member states vital interests are involved, the Council’s practice is to
proceed only on the basis of unanimity. Some issues may be decided by
majority, or qualified majority, with votes weighted according to provisions in
the Treaty of Accession. A Committee of Permanent Representatives
(COREPER) has been established to assist the Council by preparing its meet¬
ings and co-ordinating the work of the Council’s other subordinate bodies and
working groups.
The Presidency of the Council (the chairmanship of meetings of the Council
and its subordinate bodies) changes at six-monthly intervals. Britain held the
Presidency for the first time from January to June 1977.
The Commission is responsible for formulating detailed policy proposals for
submission to the Council of Ministers, for promoting the Community interest
and attempting to reconcile national viewpoints and for implementing the pro¬
visions of the treaties and Community measures. It has some limited powers of
decision relating mainly to the detailed administration of the CAP. It is com¬
posed of 13 commissioners nominated by the member governments; two are
from Britain. In January 1977, a former British Cabinet Minister took office
as President of the Commission. The President, who is appointed for a two-
year renewable term, acts as the Commission’s representative and is respon¬
sible for its general administration. Each of the other commissioners is
responsible for one or more of the main Community activities. The Com¬
mission is pledged to act independently of national or sectional interests and
to formulate its proposals and administer policy in the interests of the Com¬
munity as a whole. Its proposals are made only after extensive consultation
with officials of the national governments and with producers, trade unions,
employers’ associations and many others.
The Court of Justice interprets and adjudicates on the meaning of the
treaties and of any measures taken by the Council of Ministers and Com¬
mission under them, hears complaints and appeals brought by or against Com¬
munity institutions, member states or individuals and gives preliminary rulings
on questions referred to it by courts in the member states. As a court of final
74
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
appeal, its procedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest
courts in member states; its rulings are binding on member countries, Com¬
munity institutions and individuals. The Court consists of nine judges,
assisted by four advocates-general.
The European Assembly is composed of 198 nominated members of the
parliaments of member states, sitting according to party affiliation and not
nationality. Britain is entitled to nominate 36 members. The Assembly is con¬
sulted on and debates all the major policy issues of the Community. Members
of the Assembly may question the Council of Ministers and Commission and
have the power to dismiss the Commission by a two-thirds majority. The
Assembly may reject in its entirety the Community’s draft annual budget as
presented by the Commission and approved by the Council; a formal con¬
ciliation procedure has been adopted for use in the event of disagreement
between the Assembly and the Council of Ministers on matters with major
budgetary or financial implications. In future the Assembly is to be directly
elected and its size is to be increased to 410 members, with 81 from Britain.
The first direct elections in Britain are to be held on 7 June 1979.

A new Community institution, the European Court of Auditors, was set up
in October 1977, under a treaty of 22 July 1975; it has replaced two previous
bodies and carries out a continuous audit of the handling of Community funds
by all member states and institutions.
The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body representing a
cross-section of economic interests. Its members—representing employers’
organisations, trade unions and other interests—are consulted by the Council
of Ministers and Commission during the formulation of policy. Britain is
entitled to send 24 members out of a total of 144.

The Community
Budget
In addition to, and separately from, the institutions operating within the
Community framework established by treaty, the member states have set up
the European political co-operation machinery for the consideration of impor¬
tant problems of foreign policy. The British Government attaches considerable
importance to Community co-operation in this area. The Community foreign
ministers meet in this framework four times a year. Under the foreign ministers
there is a structure of specialised committees. The country having the Presi¬
dency of the Council of Ministers provides the Secretariat. Close contact is
maintained with Community institutions when this is appropriate, and
decisions are made on the basis of consensus. Ministers meeting within the
framework of political co-operation have adopted a code of conduct on employ¬
ment practices for member states’ companies operating in South Africa. Among
other problems considered have been the prospects for negotiated settlements
in the Middle East and in Rhodesia, and the co-ordination of the member
states’ policy at the Belgrade meeting on security and co-operation in Europe
(see p 104).
The Community’s heads of State or of Government meet at least three times
a year as the European Council. This Council operates outside the Treaty
framework and may consider both Community matters and those arising in
the context of political co-operation. It discusses issues unresolved in the
Council of Ministers as well as the general problems facing the Community,
and lays down guidelines and an overall political direction for future work.
All member countries contribute to a common budget for certain specific pur¬
poses, such as agricultural support (administered by the European Agricultural
Guidance and Guarantee Fund, often known by its French initials FEOGA),
the European Social Fund (used to finance occupational retraining and
re-adaptation programmes, and to encourage manpower mobility), the
Regional Development Fund, and administrative costs. The budget is financed
by an own resources’ system; that is, all levies on agricultural imports and all
customs duties collected in member states are earmarked for the Community
budget, with the exception of a 10 per cent rebate to cover collection costs.
Hitherto these funds have been supplemented by direct contributions from the
six original member states on the basis of their gross national product (GNP).
It is intended that, from 1 January 1979, these contributions be replaced by a
proportion (equivalent to a flat rate of up to 1 per cent) of the proceeds of the
value added tax (VAT) collected on a harmonised base.
The Treaty of Accession provided that the new member states would par¬
ticipate in the full ‘own resources’ system as from 1 January 1980. In the inter¬
vening years their contributions would be allowed to rise by carefully graduated
percentages.
A correcting mechanism’ has been established providing for repayments to
a member state whose contribution to the Community budget is seriously out
of line with its share of total Community GNP and its economic situation.

THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary State, it does not have a single body
of law. England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own
legal systems and law courts. Common opinions on broader issues, and a
common final court of appeal in civil matters have resulted in substantial
identity on many points, but considerable differences remain in law and in
procedure and practice. In Northern Ireland legal procedure and practice
have for centuries closely resembled those of England and Wales but there are
often differences in enacted law. However, a large volume of modern legisla¬
tion applies throughout the United Kingdom.
The main sources of law in the United Kingdom are legislation, common law
and European Community law. Legislation consists of Acts of Parliament,
orders, rules and regulations made by ministers under the authority of an
Act of Parliament, or by-laws made by local government or other authorities
exercising powers conferred upon them by Parliament. Common law is the
ancient law of the land as deduced from custom and interpreted by the judges.
Generally speaking it has never been precisely defined or codified but forms the
basis of the law except when it has been superseded by legislation.
Community law (see p 72) arises out of the United Kingdom’s membership
of the European Community and is largely confined in impact to economic and
certain social matters. In certain circumstances it prevails over domestic law.
Community law is normally applied by the domestic courts, but the most
authoritative rulings are given by the European Court of Justice (see p 73)-
A feature common to the domestic legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. The criminal law
is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole while civil law is
concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
society between themselves.
CRIMINAL JUSTICE
Four distinct stages are involved in the British system of criminal justice: the
enactment of criminal legislation which, for instance, defines prohibited acts,
establishes criminal courts and provides for the treatment of offenders; the
prevention of crime and the enforcement of the law—largely matters for the
police service; the determination by the courts of the guilt or innocence of
people accused of crimes, followed by the selection of appropriate sentences for
the guilty; and the treatment of convicted offenders.
A Royal Commission has been set up to examine the powers and duties of
the police in England and Wales, the rights and duties of suspects and
accused people, and the process of and responsibility for the prosecution of
criminal offences.
The criminal law, like the law generally, undergoes constant reform in the
courts as established principles are interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet
JUSTICE AND THE LAW

new circumstances. Substantial changes in the law are the responsibility of
Parliament. In practice most legislation affecting the criminal law is govern¬
ment-sponsored, but there is often consultation between government depart¬
ments and bodies representing the legal profession, the police and the probation
and prison services. The views of voluntary bodies are also considered.
C hief constables in England and Wales have a duty to supply statistics relating
to offences, offenders, criminal proceedings and the state of crime in their
areas. Crime statistics are published annually by the Home Office and further
information about crime trends (as well as about police matters) is contained in
the annual reports of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and (for
London) the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Similar arrangements
operate in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The differences in the legal systems of the constituent countries make it
impractical to analyse in detail trends in criminality for the United Kingdom
as a whole. In considering trends for a single country, it has to be remembered
that the number of offences recorded as known to the police does not cover all
offences committed since some offences go undiscovered and others are not
reported to the police. Nevertheless it is clear that, as in western Europe gener¬
ally, there has been an upsurge in crime since the early 1950s.
As Table 5 shows, there has been a rise in the rate of indictable offences
recorded as known to the police in the past few years in most of the main
offence groups; in 1977 in England and Wales there were some 5,014 indictable
offences per 100,000 population.
In 1977, 428,740 people were convicted by courts in England and Wales of
indictable offences. Of these about 16 per cent were women and about 47 per
cent were under 21 years of age. Not all apprehended offenders are proceeded
against in court. For indictable offences 114,984 people were given formal oral
cautions by the police; of these 90 per cent were under 21. For non-indictable
offences (excluding motoring offences) oral cautions were given to 34,328
people of whom 49 per cent were aged under 21.

Social Research Studies series. Research is also carried out in universit\
departments, much of it financed by the Government. The principal university
research establishment is the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme provides ex gratia compensatioi
to victims of crimes of violence and people hurt as a result of attempts to arresi
offenders and prevent offences. It is administered by a board consisting of
legally qualified members appointed by the Home Secretary and the Secretary
of State for Scotland after consultation with the Lord Chancellor. Compensa¬
tion, which is assessed on the basis of common law damages and usually takes
the form of a lump sum payment, has totalled over .£50 million since the scheme
began. The results of a review of the scheme were published in 1978 (see
P 438)-
The scheme does not apply in Northern Ireland where there is statutory
provision in certain circumstances for compensation from public funds for
criminal injuries caused to people and also for malicious damage to property
(see below). Compensation for property damage includes losses of profits
arising from the damage.
Various temporary measures to deal with terrorism in connection with
Northern Ireland have affected some aspects of the British criminal justice
system. Under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976,
organisations concerned in terrorism connected with Northern Ireland affairs
and occurring in the United Kingdom can be proscribed. The appropriate
Secretary of State can exclude people concerned in terrorism from Great
Britain or Northern Ireland. If the person is not a British citizen he can be
excluded from the United Kingdom as a whole. The Act provides powers for
the arrest and detention of suspected terrorists. There is also a system of
controls at ports on passengers travelling between Great Britain and Ireland.
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 creates extra-territorial offences under
Northern Ireland law so that it is possible to try in the province a person
accused of certain offences committed in the Irish Republic. It also enables
evidence to be obtained in Northern Ireland for the trial of offences in the
Irish Republic. Reciprocal legislation has been passed by the Irish Parliament.
Trials in Northern Ireland criminal courts of offences involving terrorism
are heard by a judge sitting without a jury to obviate the possibility of
intimidation of jurors.
As a result of the civil disturbances in the province since 1968, over £38-4
million has been paid from public funds in compensation for personal
injuries and about ^248 million for damage to property.
Crime prevention and crime investigation, the preservation of the peace and
the bringing to trial of offenders are primarily the concern of the police service.
The action of the British police in enforcing the law rests mainly upon common
consent, for there are only a small number of officers in relation to the
population (roughly one officer to 450 people). Officers do not normally
carry firearms (their only weapon is a wooden truncheon) and there are
strict limitations on police powers.
There are 43 police forces in England and Wales, eight in Scotland and one
in Northern Ireland. Each force is responsible for law enforcement in its own
area, but there is constant co-operation among them.
Outside London most counties (regions or islands in Scotland) have their
own police forces, though in the interests of efficiency several have combined
their forces. In London, the Metropolitan Police Force, with headquarters at
JUSTICE AND THE LAW

Police
Authorities
and Chief
Constables
Central
Authorities
New Scotland Yard, is responsible for an area within a radius of about 24
kilometres (15 miles) from the centre but excluding the City of London,
where there is a separate force. The strength of the regular police force in
Great Britain is about 120,000 (including about 8,890 policewomen), the size
of individual police forces depending on the area and population which they
serve. The strength of the Metropolitan Police Force is 22,240.
In addition to the regular police forces, constabularies are maintained by the
British Railways Board, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, the
Ministry of Defence and a few other public bodies. Considerable numbers of
people are employed by commercial security organisations which are subject
to the ordinary law of the land.
Each of the regular police forces is maintained by a police authority, a com¬
mittee consisting of local councillors and, in England and Wales, magistrates.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home Secretary.
In Northern Ireland the police authority is appointed by the Secretary of State.
The primary duty of the police authority is to provide an adequate and
efficient police force in the area for which it is responsible. Its functions, some
of which are subject to ministerial approval, include appointing the chief
constable, deputy chief constable and assistant chief constables and, if neces-
sary, calling upon them to retire; fixing the authorised establishment (maxi¬
mum permitted strength of the force); and providing buildings and equip¬
ment. In the Metropolitan Police area the chief officer of police and his
immediate subordinates are appointed on the recommendation of the Home
Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police forces
and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below deputy or
assistant chief constable. They are generally answerable to the police authori¬
ties on matters of efficiency, and must submit a written report every year.
The Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary
of State for Northern Ireland are concerned with the organisation, administra¬
tion and operation of the police service. They approve the appointment of chief
constables, and may require a police authority to retire a chief constable in the
interests of efficiency, call for a report from a chief constable on any matters
relating to the policing of his area, or cause a local inquiry to be held. They are
also empowered to make regulations covering such matters as police ranks;
qualifications for appointment, promotion and retirement; discipline; hours
of duty, leave, pay and allowances; and uniform and equipment. Some of these
regulations are first negotiable on the Police Council (a negotiating body on
which are represented the police authorities, police staff associations and mini¬
sters) ; others are discussed on representative advisory bodies, together with
any general questions affecting the police service.
All police forces in Great Britain (except the Metropolitan Police for which
the Home Secretary is directly responsible) are subject to inspection on behalf
of the Secretaries of State. Inspectors of constabulary carry out, under Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector
of Constabulary for Scotland, a formal annual inspection of the forces in their
regions, inquiring into efficiency and reporting to the Home Secretary or the
Secretary of State for Scotland. Annual reports are published, covering the
whole range of police matters. The inspectors also maintain close touch with
forces for which they are responsible, and have various advisory functions.
In Northern Ireland periodic inspections of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
are made by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary.

Status and
Duties
The income of police authorities comes from central and local government.
The Government’s contribution, a half of approved expenditure (a third in the
City of London), is conditional on the Home Secretary or the Secretary of
State for Scotland being satisfied that the force is being efficiently administered
and maintained.
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men and women between
the ages of i8i and 30. A chief constable may approve the appointment of
especially suitable older men and women.
The standard police ranks in England, Scotland and Wales, except in the
Metropolitan Police and City of London Police areas, are: chief constable,
assistant chief constable, chief superintendent, superintendent, chief inspector,
inspector, sergeant and constable. The chief officer in the Metropolitan Police
area, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, is assisted by a deputy
commissioner and four assistant commissioners. Next in rank are deputy
assistant commissioners, and then commanders; from chief superintendent
the ranks are the same as in the regions. In the City of London the ranks are the
same as in the regions except that the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police
and the second in command is an assistant commissioner. Police ranks in
Northern Ireland are very similar to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
Cadet training is designed to prepare boys and girls between 16 and i8| years
of age for a police service career. They have no police powers but, in addition
to their educational studies and physical and adventure training, are instructed
in elementary police work.
In order to release as many uniformed police officers as possible for opera¬
tional duties, police authorities employ some 40,000 civilians on administrative
duties (pay, records, finance and other general subjects), technical duties
(fingerprint, scenes of crime and control room work) and other duties,
including catering and domestic work.
Traffic wardens (of whom there are nearly 5,460) discharge specified duties
normally undertaken by the police. They may be authorised to serve fixed
penalty notices1 for some minor traffic offences; to man police car pounds
(except in Scotland and Northern Ireland); to enforce some aspects of the
vehicle excise laws; and to obtain the names and addresses of people thought
to have committed certain types of traffic offence. They may also be authorised
to direct traffic, to act as parking attendants at street parking places, and as
school-crossing patrols. Wardens are under the control of the chief constable.
Each police force has an attachment of special constables, who volunteer to
perform police duties without pay in their spare time. In England and Wales,
they act as auxiliaries to the regular force when required. In Scotland they are
employed only in emergencies although they may be assigned for duty for train¬
ing. In Northern Ireland there is a largely part-time (and paid) reserve.
A police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office;
he is an agent of the law of the land, not of the police authority nor of the
central Government, and he may be sued or prosecuted in respect of any
wrongful act he may commit in the performance of his duties. Strict pro¬
cedures govern the way complaints against police officers are handled and an
independent element has been introduced into the way complaints are
investigated.

clerk of the appropriate court instead of having his case tried in the ordinary way.

Members of the police service may not belong to a trade union nor may
they withdraw their labour in furtherance of a trade dispute. All ranks, how¬
ever, have their own associations which can make representations to ministers
or to police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their members.
Police work ranges from the protection of people and property, road or
street patrolling and traffic control to crime prevention, criminal investigation
and the arrest of offenders. In urban areas, particularly, police officers often
have to deal with social problems and, where necessary, they bring in other
social agencies and expert help. In England and Wales they also prosecute
accused people (see p 82).
The main departments in all forces are the uniform department, the
criminal investigation department, the traffic department and specialised
departments, including river or marine police, mounted police, and dog
handlers.
A number of common services are provided by the central government depart¬
ments and by arrangements made between forces. The most important of these
are: training services; a forensic science service in England and Wales with
seven regional laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan Police Laboratory);
telecommunications services which supply and maintain police radio equip¬
ment; and central and provincial criminal records which are available to all
forces. In addition, regional crime squads, consisting of teams of experienced
detectives from several forces, and operating under a committee of chief
constables, investigate major crimes involving inquiries in more than one
police area. The Scottish Crime Squad assists forces in the investigation and
prevention of crime.
Certain special services such as liaison with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol) are provided for other British forces by the Metropoli¬
tan Police Force. The services of the Force are available, on request, to assist
any other police force in England and Wales in criminal investigation, as are
the services of the Fraud Squad, which is run jointly by the Metropolitan
Police and the City of London Police for the investigation of company frauds.
Research into technical services is organised in separate units within the
Home Office Police Department: the Forensic Science Service Unit and its
regional laboratories; a Central Research Establishment staffed by scientists;
and a Directorate of Telecommunications with one section of engineers
engaged solely on research and development. The Police Scientific Develop¬
ment Branch is staffed by scientists and technicians assisted by police officers
seconded from the Police Research Services Unit; the Branch and the Unit
are concerned with operational research into police methods and the develop¬
ment of equipment for police forces. The Economic Planning Unit, composed
mainly of economists and accountants, is responsible for the development of a
planning-programming-budgeting system for the police; this includes the
production of programme accounts and studies of the use of resources.
In England and Wales arrest may be made on a warrant issued by a judicial
authority on sworn information laid before it or without warrant. An arrested
person is entitled to ask the police to notify a named person, such as a relative
or a solicitor, about his or her arrest. The police may delay notification if they
think it necessary in the interests of the investigation, the prevention of
crime or the apprehension of offenders.
Anyone arrested without a warrant may be released by the police on bail

and must be so released if he or she cannot be brought before a magistrates
court within 24 hours, unless the alleged offence is serious. If remanded in
custody, the defendant must be brought before a magistrates’ court as soon as
practicable. People granted bail have to surrender to custody at an appointed
time and place. On appearance before a magistrates’ court, a defendant may be
refused bail only if there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she
might abscond, commit further offences or otherwise interfere with the course
of justice; if bail is refused by the magistrates, the defendant can apply to a
judge of the High Court and, if committed to the Crown Court, may apply for
bail to that court. In 1976 some 83 per cent of people committed for trial by
magistrates were given bail.
Once anyone has been charged with an offence, the police may not put any
further questions to him, save, in exceptional circumstances, to prevent or
minimise harm or loss to any person or to the public, or to clear up an ambiguity
in a previous answer or statement. This is laid down by the Judges Rules
which do not have the force of law but carry very great weight.
A person detained in custody who thinks that the grounds for his detention
are not lawful1 may apply for a writ of habeas corpus against the person who
detained him, this person being required to appear before the court on the
day named to justify the detention. An application for such a writ is normally
made to a divisional court of the High Court either by the person detained or by
someone acting on his behalf.
In Scotland the police have similar powers of arrest as have the police in
England and Wales. Although the Judges’ Rules do not apply, an arrested
person must be cautioned and have the charge read over to him. There¬
after, only his voluntary statements are used in evidence at his trial, and
the court will reject any statements made by him unless it is satisfied that they
have been fairly obtained. When anyone is apprehended he must be brought
before a court with the least possible delay. Where a prosecution on indict¬
ment is contemplated, the accused is brought before a judge for judicial
examination and the judge may then commit him for trial or for further
examination. Eight days may elapse between commitment for further examina¬
tion and commitment for trial.
People in custody in Scotland, other than those charged with murder or
treason, may be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the
jurisdiction of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court 01 b^
the police. Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be granted at the
discretion of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a light
of appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail, by
the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the amount
fixed. The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High
Court of Justiciary has power to release anyone unlawfully detained and trials
must be brought to a conclusion within no days of committal to custody.
The decision to prosecute normally rests, in England and Wales, with the
police and in Scotland with public prosecutors. In Northern Ireland there is a
Director of Public Prosecutions (see p 83). In England and Wales (and very
exceptionally in Scotland) a private person may institute criminal proceedings.
Police have powers to issue cautions (warnings in Scotland) instead of prosecut¬
ing, especially in the case of young people.
1 Detention is lawful in pursuance of criminal justice, for contempt of court or of
either House of Parliament and when expressly authorised by Parliament. It is also
lawful in the case of persons found to be mentally disordered.

Magistrates’
Courts
In England and Wales some offences can only be prosecuted by, or with the
consent of, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions, the
latter acting under the superintendence of the Attorney General and being
responsible to him. Where the consent of the Attorney General is required, the
Director is in practice responsible for prosecution; offences in the category
include crimes such as bribery and corruption of officials, and the use and
possession of explosives.
The Director has to prosecute cases such as treason and murder. The police
must report to him a further list of offences, including serious offences against
the person, sedition, criminal offences by police officers, and offences relating
to obscene or indecent publications. The Director does not necessarily pro¬
secute all such cases referred to him but may do so in any that appear to be
important or where he thinks intervention is necessary; otherwise proceedings
are conducted by solicitors employed by the police. The Director also con¬
siders whether proceedings should be taken in cases reported to him by govern¬
ment departments. In addition he advises the police and others concerned with
the administration of the criminal law.
When cases go for trial, barristers in private practice are instructed to appear
on the Director’s behalf; at the Central Criminal Court in London, these are
drawn from a panel of ‘Treasury Counsel’ appointed by the Attorney General.
The prosecution process in Scotland is different from that in the rest of the
United Kingdom. The Lord Advocate (see p 99) is responsible for the
prosecution of all crimes but delegates most of the work to the Solicitor
General (see p 99), to ten Advocates Depute and to procurators fiscal. The
permanent adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters is the Crown
Agent who is head of the procurator fiscal service and is assisted by a staff of
civil servants known as the Crown Office. Prosecutions in the High Court of
Justiciary are prepared by the Crown Office while crimes tried before the
sheriff and district courts are prosecuted by the procurators fiscal who are
lawyers and full-time civil servants. The police investigate offences known
to them and report to the procurator fiscal who decides whether or not to
prosecute, subject to the discretion and control of the Crown Office.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, who is responsible
to the Attorney General, prosecutes all offences tried on indictment. He can
also prosecute such summary offences or classes of summary offence as he
considers should be dealt with by him, for example, those which he regards as
serious or offences of a political or sectarian kind. Other summary offences
are prosecuted by the police.
Magistrates’ courts deal with about 98 per cent of criminal cases in England
and Wales, and conduct preliminary investigations into the more serious
offences. The Crown Court, situated in a number of towns and cities, takes all
criminal work above the level of magistrates’ courts.
Magistrates’ courts hear and determine charges against people accused of
‘summary offences’, that is those that can be legally disposed of by magistrates
sitting without a jury. There are some 700 courts and some 23,500 magistrates.
Each court normally consists of a bench of three lay unpaid magistrates whose
function is to ascertain the facts of a case and apply the law to them. The
magistrates are advised on points of law and procedure by a clerk to the
justices (or one of his assistants) who is normally legally qualified and is also
in charge of the court’s administrative arrangements. Magistrates are appointed
by the Lord Chancellor.

In inner London and some other large urban areas where the pressure of work
is heavy and continuous there are also professional ‘stipendiary’ magistrates who
are full-time, salaried and legally qualified. They usually preside alone.
Magistrates must as a rule sit in open court, but when they make preliminary
inquiries into a more serious case to see whether there is sufficient evidence to
justify committal for trial in the Crown Court the evidence must not be reported
in the press at the time except at the defendant s request, unless the magistrates
discharge him. . ,
Magistrates cannot usually impose a sentence of more than six months
imprisonment or a fine exceeding £1,000. If an offence carries a higher maxi¬
mum penalty, they may commit the offender for sentence to the Crown Court
if they consider their own power inadequate.
To hear cases involving people under the age of 17 brought before the court in
‘care’ (see p 92) or criminal proceedings, and to deal with applications for
the adoption of children, magistrates’ courts sit as juvenile courts, either in a
different room or building from other courts, or at a different time; only
limited publicity is allowed. If a young person under the age of 17 is charged
jointly with someone of 17 or over, the case is heard in the ordinary magis¬
trates’ court. If the young person is found guilty, that court remits the case
to a juvenile court, unless it wishes to dispose of the case by discharge or fine.
The Crown Court is responsible for trials of the more serious cases, the senten¬
cing of offenders committed for sentence by magistrates’ courts, and appeals
from magistrates’ courts. It has about 90 centres and is served by High Court
judges, full-time ‘circuit judges’ and part-time recorders. All contested trials
in the court take place before a jury. A High Court judge sits alone for the most
serious cases. A circuit judge or recorder sits with between two and four magi¬
strates for appeals and committals for sentence from magistrates’ courts and
may sit with magistrates to try the less important cases.
The Crown Court may impose a fine of any amount on a convicted offender
and, within the maximum penalty determined for the offence by Parliament,
any other custodial or non-custodial penalty.
In 1977 the Crown Court tried 68,547 people; 46,957 pleaded guilty to at
least one charge and 21,590 not guilty to all charges. About a half of defendants
charged with one offence and pleading not guilty were acquitted.
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal to the Crown Court
against the sentence imposed and, if he contested his guilt, the conviction.
Where the appeal is on a point of law, either the prosecutor or the defendant
may appeal from the magistrates’ court to the High Court, which sits in London
and some regional centres (see p 94). Appeals from the Crown Court, either
against conviction or against sentence, are usually made to the Court of Appeal
(Criminal Division). A further appeal from the Court of Appeal to the House of
Lords can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that
the point is one that ought to be considered by the House. A prosecutor or
defendant may appeal to the House of Lords from a decision of the High
Court in a criminal case.
The Attorney General may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point
of law which has arisen in a case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted;
the court has power to refer the point to the House of Lords if necessary. The
acquittal in the original case is not affected, nor is the identity of the acquitted
person revealed without his consent.

There are three criminal courts: the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff court
and the district court. The High Court tries serious crimes such as murder,
treason and rape while the sheriff court is concerned with less serious offences
and the district court with minor offences.
Criminal cases are heard either under solemn procedure, when proceedings
are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury of 15 members, or under
summary procedure, when the judge sits without a jury. All cases in the High
Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff courts are tried by
a judge and jury. Proceedings are taken under summary procedure in the less
serious cases in the sheriff courts, and in the district courts.
A government committee is considering the effect on the criminal courts and
the prosecution system of the volume of minor offences dealt with by sum¬
mary prosecution and whether some other process could be devised to deal
with such offences while maintaining safeguards for accused persons.
District courts are the administrative responsibility of the district and islands
local authorities (see p 62). The judges are lay justices of the peace including
up to one-quarter of the membership of district and islands authorities who
may be nominated as ex justices. In Glasgow there are three stipendiary
magistrates who are full-time salaried lawyers.
Scotland is divided into six sheriffdoms which are further divided into sheriff
court districts, each of which has a sheriff who is the judge of the court.
The High Court of Justiciary is Scotland’s supreme criminal court. It is both a
trial court and an appeal court. Any one of the following judges is entitled to try
cases in the High Court: the Lord Justice General (the head of the court), the
Lord Justice Clerk (the next judge in seniority) or one of the Lord Com¬
missioners of Justiciary who preside at sessions of the court in other towns.
The main seat of the court is in Edinburgh where all appeals are heard.
All appeals are dealt with by the High Court of Justiciary. In both solemn and
summary procedure, an appeal may be brought against conviction, or sen¬
tence, or both. The High Court cannot order a retrial if it sets aside a convic¬
tion. Appeals are heard by three or more judges; there is no further appeal to
the House of Lords.
Children under 16 years (and in some cases people between 16 and 18) who
have committed an offence or are considered to need compulsory care may be
brought before an informal children’s hearing comprising three members of
the local community (see p 93).
The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with minor local criminal cases in
Northern Ireland is carried out by magistrates’ courts presided over by a
professional, paid resident magistrate. Young offenders under 17 years and
young people under 17 who need care, protection and control are dealt with
by juvenile courts consisting of the resident magistrate and two lay members
(at least one of whom must be a woman) with special qualifications for dealing
with juveniles. Appeals may be made to a county court.
The county courts and the High Court of Justice share a similar jurisdiction
in criminal matters, except that the most serious cases, such as murder, are tried
in the High Court only. Other cases are heard at the court where the trial
can be heard soonest. For people convicted of serious crimes there may be
an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal and from there to the House of

Lords. Government proposals to reform the system have been passed by
Parliament. The main changes proposed are the establishment of a Crown
Court for the trial of all criminal cases on indictment and the abolition of the
Court of Criminal Appeal and the transfer of its jurisdiction to the Court of
Appeal.
All criminal trials in the United Kingdom take the form of a contest between
the prosecution and the defence.
Since criminal law in Britain presumes the innocence of the accused until his
guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any advantage, apparent or
real, over the defence. A defendant has the right to employ a legal adviser for his
defence and if he cannot afford to pay he may be granted legal aid wholly or
partly from public funds. If remanded in custody he may be visited in prison
by his legal adviser to ensure that his defence is properly prepared. In England
and Wales during the preparation of the case, the prosecution usually informs
the defence of any relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in
evidence and discloses them if asked to do so. The prosecution should also
inform the defence of any witnesses whose evidence may assist the accused
and whom the prosecution does not propose to call. The defence or prosecu¬
tion may suggest that the mental state of the defendant is such that he is
unfit to be tried. A jury must decide whether or not this is so. If they find that
it is, the defendant is admitted to a hospital specified by the Home Sec¬
retary in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland to one specified by a
health and social services board (see p 114).
Criminal trials in England and Wales are normally held in open court and
the rules of evidence (which are concerned with the way facts may be proved
and what facts may not be proved) are rigorously applied. If evidence is
admitted in contravention of the law, a conviction can be quashed on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the right to hear and subsequently to cross-
examine (normally through his lawyer) all the witnesses for the prosecution; to
call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial of their own free will,
may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court either in person or
through his lawyer—the defence having the right to the last speech at the trial.
Moreover, the defendant cannot be questioned unless he consents to be
sworn as a witness in his own defence. When he does testify, he may only be
cross-examined about his character or other conduct in exceptional circum¬
stances and generally, the prosecution may not introduce evidence of such
matters. Although confessions made in the course of previous judicial
proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been made upon oath, no
confessions made in any other circumstances are admitted unless it can be
proved that they were made voluntarily.
In jury trials the judge determines questions of law, sums up the evidence for
the benefit of the jury, and discharges the accused or passes sentence. Only
the jury decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. If the jury
cannot reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may direct it to bring in a
majority verdict provided that, in the normal jury of 12 people, there are not
more than two dissentients. If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the
prosecution has no right of appeal against the verdict and the defendant cannot
be tried again for the same offence. From a verdict of ‘guilty’ there is a right
of appeal by the defendant to the appropriate court.
A jury is completely independent of the judiciary. Once members are
sworn in, they are protected from interference of any kind. Both the

prosecution and the defence can object to particular jurors. In England and
Wales people whose names appear on the electoral register are liable for jury
service; in Scotland, where the minimum age for jurors is 21, not all those on
the register are eligible to serve as the minimum voting age is 18.
At summary trials in Scotland the accused is asked to plead to the charge at
the first calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the
case. Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or,
more usually, may appoint a later date.
In Scottish trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ proceedings take place in
the sheriff court, when the accused person is called upon to plead guilty or not
guilty. If he pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ pro¬
ceedings in the appropriate court. If he pleads guilty, and the case is to
be dealt with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a
High Court case, it is continued to the second proceedings for disposal.
The trial proceedings are held at least nine days after the pleading pro¬
ceedings, either before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury of 15.
Evidence is presented without opening speeches, and there are closing speeches
for the prosecution and for the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the
jury. The jury may return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of
which result in acquittal, or they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case
the court proceeds to deliver sentence. The verdict may be by a simple
majority. With a few minor exceptions, no person may be convicted without
the evidence of at least two witnesses, or corroboration of one witness by
facts and circumstances which clearly implicate the accused in the crime.
Most of the work of coroners’ courts involves the investigation of violent
and unnatural deaths or of sudden deaths where the cause is unknown.
Cases may be brought to the notice of the local coroner (a senior lawyer or
doctor appointed by local government) by doctors, the police, various public
authorities or members of the public, and it is his duty to hold an inquiry into
how, when and where the deceased died. If the death is a sudden one of which
the cause is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest in court, but may
order a post-mortem examination to determine cause of death. If, however, he
has reason to believe that the deceased died a violent or unnatural death or died
in prison or other circumstances provided for by statute, he must hold an
inquest.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The procurator fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may
report the result of his inquiries to the Crown Agent.
Coroners in Northern Ireland are mostly senior lawyers; the work of their
courts is similar to that of coroners’ courts in England and Wales.
Courts martial have jurisdiction over serving members of the armed forces and
in certain circumstances their dependants and other civilians who accompany
them outside the United Kingdom. The courts do not deal with certain serious
offences if committed in the United Kingdom, such as treason, murder, man¬
slaughter, treason-felony and rape. Other non-military criminal offences
committed by servicemen in the United Kingdom are also normally dealt
with in the ordinary courts.
Although custodial treatment is an important part of British penal practice,
it is increasingly seen as the last resort in dealing with people who break the
law.
88
Sentencing
Non-Custodial
Treatment
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The criminal courts’ discretion to select the sentence most appropriate for
an offender is modified by statutory provisions designed to ensure that prison
sentences are kept to a minimum. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a
person who has not previously served a custodial sentence of a particular kind
may not be sentenced to custodial treatment of that kind unless he is legally
represented or has chosen not to be, and in the case of imprisonment unless the
court is satisfied that no other sentence will suffice. In England and Wales,
extended sentences longer than the normal maximum term may be imposed
on persistent offenders. In the case of murder there is a mandatory penalty of
imprisonment for life. This is the maximum penalty for a number of serious
offences such as robbery, rape, arson and manslaughter. A few very rare
serious offences, such as treason, carry the death penalty but it is not
mandatory. ,
In Scotland, unless the sentence is limited by statute, the maximum penalty
is determined by the status of the court trying the accused. In trials on indict¬
ment, the High Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for any term up
to life and the Sheriff Court up to two years. In summary cases, the sheriff may
impose up to six months’ imprisonment.
Non-custodial treatment includes fines; probation; absolute or (in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland) conditional discharge for up to three years (one
year in Northern Ireland)—a discharge being made when the court feels that
there is no need to impose punishment on a convicted person, and binding
over’ where the offender is required to pledge money, with or without
sureties, to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
A recent innovation is the community service order for offenders con¬
victed of imprisonable offences in England and Wales. Similar schemes are
to be introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Examples of work done
include decorating houses and flats for old people and building adventure
playgrounds for children. Between 40 and 240 hours’ service may be ordered
within a period of 12 months.
An offender in England, Wales and Northern Ireland may also with his
consent have his sentence deferred for up to six months to enable a court to
arrive at the most appropriate sentence, taking into account his conduct after,
for instance, some expected change in his circumstances.
The courts may order an offender to pay compensation for any personal
injury, loss or damage resulting from his offence and, in the case of major
crimes against property, bankruptcy proceedings may be brought against him
in England and Wales. In Scotland a committee has reported to the Secretary
of State and the Lord Advocate on the question of the potential role of the
criminal court in ordering reparation by the offender to the victim.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a judge is free to pass a suspended
sentence of not more than two years. The sentence is not served by the
offender unless he is convicted of a further offence punishable with imprison¬
ment; in that event the suspended sentence normally takes effect and another
sentence may be imposed for the new offence. An offender receiving a
suspended sentence of more than six months may be made subject to super¬
vision by a probation officer for all or part of the period. Under the Criminal
Law Act 1977 courts in England and Wales will have power, when passing
a sentence of between six months’ and two years’ imprisonment, to order
that part should be served and the rest held in suspense; the suspended part
will be not less than one quarter nor more than three quarters of the whole.
In certain circumstances the courts may order the forfeiture of property

Prisons
involved in the commission of a crime. An offender convicted of a serious crime
may be disqualified from driving if a motor vehicle was used in its commission.
In most circumstances, a person convicted of a criminal offence need not
reveal or admit it after a rehabilitation period of from six months to ten years
depending on the nature of the sentence imposed. This does not apply to
those who have received a prison sentence of more than 2| years.
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while he
continues his ordinary life under the supervision of a probation officer, whose
duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. Before making a probation order
(which lasts for between one and three years), the court must explain its effects
and make sure that the probationer understands that if he fails to comply with
the requirements of the order he will be liable to be dealt with again for the
original offence. A probation order can be made only if the offender is 17 years of
age or over (14 in Northern Ireland) and must have his consent; it usually
requires the probationer to keep in regular touch with the probation officer,
to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious life. It may also require
him to live in a specified place, or in appropriate circumstances, to submit to
treatment for a mental condition.
In England and Wales the probation service is administered locally by
probation and after-care committees consisting of local magistrates and co¬
opted members with legal and specialist interests. In Northern Ireland it is
administered by the Northern Ireland Office. Probation officers are usually
members of small teams, although each has a large measure of independence
in his or her casework with an offender.
Probation and after-care committees may, with the approval of the Home
Secretary, provide and maintain day training centres (which offenders may be
required to attend for up to 60 days), bail hostels, probation hostels and other
establishments for use in connection with the rehabilitation of offenders. The
service is also responsible for administering the community service scheme.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation and
after-care officers are available to every criminal court.
In Scotland, offenders subject to probation orders or to after-care super¬
vision following release from a penal institution are supervised by specially
approved local authority social workers.
Although the courts have made proportionately less and less use of prison as a
penalty for criminal activity, there has been an increase in the prison population
as a result of the rise in crime. In 1977 the average number of people in prisons,
borstals, and detention centres was about 41,570 in England and Wales and
4,870 in Scotland; there are 135 prison service establishments and the size of
the prison service in 1977 was 24,500.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known as
local prisons’; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which may be open
or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons (open prisons do
not have physical barriers to prevent escape). Sentenced prisoners in England
and Wales are classified into four groups for the purposes of security. Separate
prisons cater for women prisoners.
People awaiting trial are entitled to privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners and, as far as practicable, are separated from convicted prisoners.
Prisoners under 21 are separated from older prisoners.
Many British prisons were built during the nineteenth century and are un¬
satisfactory by modern standards. Overcrowding is also a problem. However,
a number of new prisons have been built in the past few years, and existing

establishments are being redeveloped and modernised, as far as limited
resources allow.
All prisoners in Great Britain serving a determinate sentence of more than one
month, except those sentenced to imprisonment for life, are allowed remission
of one-third of their sentence provided that this does not reduce their sentence
to less than 31 days (in Scotland, 30 days). Remission may be forfeited for
serious misconduct in prison. In addition, prisoners serving fixed sentences of
more than 18 months become eligible for consideration for release on parole
after serving one-third of their sentence or 12 months, whichever expires later.
The parole licence remains in force until the date on which the prisoner
would have been released had not parole been granted. The licence prescribes
the conditions with which the offender must comply when on parole. About
10 per cent of prisoners granted parole in England and Wales in 1977 were
recalled to prison.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence, after
consultation with the judiciary and on the recommendation of the Parole Board.
Those released in this way remain on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall at any time should the circumstances warrant it.
In Northern Ireland, where there is no parole scheme, prisoners receive
one-half remission on determinate sentences, provided that remission does
not reduce the sentence to below 31 days. For those serving over a year, a
court can order all or part of the outstanding balance of the remitted period to
be served in the event of reconviction for an imprisonable offence in the
remitted period, in addition to any penalty imposed for a further offence.
The main aim of the prison industries is to give inmates training and experience
to assist them to get and keep jobs when released. Prison industries generally
consist of clothing and textile manufacture, weaving and knitting, engineering,
woodwork, laundering, light engineering work, and electrical and mechanical
production. A wide range of semi-skilled work is available and there is one
industrial prison. Some products such as clothing are for use by the prison
service, while others are supplied for government departments or sold on the
open market. The farming and horticultural industries contribute to the prison
food provision. A few prisoners are employed outside prison. Small payments
are made to inmates for the work they do; in some prisons, incentive schemes
provide an opportunity for higher earnings on the basis of output and skill.
Education for those in custody is financed by the prison service and provided
by the local education authorities. Each prison in England and Wales has an
education officer assisted mainly by part-time teachers and a small number of
full-time ones. Education is compulsory for young offenders below school
leaving age. Education resources for other inmates are devoted to teaching and
improving literacy and the provision of vocational training. Some prisoners
study for public examinations (including those of the Open University). When
resources permit there is teaching in recreational and leisure pursuits.
The purposes of physical education and remedial gymnastics are to promote
health and fitness and to ensure that inmates are physically competent to
sustain the demands of outside employment. Physical education is voluntary for
adults but those under 21 have to attend a certain number of classes. Many
establishments, however, do not have the proper facilities.
The prison medical service has a general responsibility for the physical and
mental health of all those in custody. Each establishment has accommodation

for sick people and there are some larger prison hospitals (some with up to
100 beds) to which patients can be transferred if necessary. Four prisons have
surgical units and patients can also be transferred to hospitals within the
National Health Service. There is one specialist psychiatric prison and some
other centres in the prison service where patients can receive psychiatric care.
In some establishments there is special treatment for alcoholics.
Prison psychologists are involved in the evaluation of treatment programmes
and regimes, contribute to the management and treatment of individuals and
groups, take part in advisory and training work with prison staff, and clinically
examine selected inmates.
All prisoners, from the beginning of their sentence, have a general right to write
and receive letters and to be visited by their relatives at regular intervals. They
also have such privileges as additional letters and visits, the use of books,
periodicals and newspapers, and the right to make purchases from the canteen
with money they have earned in prison. Depending on the facilities available,
they may be granted the further privileges of dining and recreation in association
and watching television in the evening.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or by the
board of visitors (visiting committee in Scotland), who have power to order,
among other penalties, forfeiture of remission and forfeiture of privileges.
Boards of visitors consist of lay people, two of whom must be magistrates.
The welfare of prisoners is the general concern of all the prison staff. Much of
this work is the responsibility of probation officers (in Scotland social workers)
stationed in prisons who help prisoners in their relations with individuals and
agencies outside and make plans for after-care on release.
Prisoners may also receive visits from specially appointed prison visitors
whose work is voluntary and, in England and Wales, is co-ordinated and guided
by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
Chaplains give spiritual help and advice to inmates and are increasingly
involved in management decisions affecting their needs and quality of life. A
chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland of the Church of Ireland and of the Presbyterian
Church), a Roman Catholic priest and a Methodist minister are appointed to
every prison. Ministers of other denominations are appointed or specially
called in as needed.
All prisons in England and Wales arrange pre-release preparations for pri¬
soners. Any person serving a sentence of four years or more is considered for
outside employment for a period before release. If selected, work is found
outside the prison for about the last six months of sentence; during the period
the prisoner may live in a separate part of the prison or in a hostel outside.
Normal wages are paid so that he can resume support for his family.
Periods of home leave may be granted in the last nine months of sentence to
those serving two years or more to enable them to contact people, such as
potential employers, able to assist them on release.
The aim of after-care, run by the probation and after-care service, is to assist
the offender on his return to society by offering him the help of a skilled case
worker. Compulsory supervision by a probation officer is given to offenders
under 21 when released, adult offenders released on parole, and those released
on licence from a sentence of life imprisonment. A voluntary system is offered

to the remainder. After-care is also provided by a number of voluntary societies,
most of which are members of the National Association for the Care and
Resettlement of Offenders. Hostels and other forms of accommodation are
provided, often with some financial help from the Home Office.
In Northern Ireland after-care duties are carried out by probation and
after-care officers and in Scotland by local authority social workers.
In England and Wales no child under ten years can be held guilty of any offence.
A child aged ten to 16 years who is alleged to have committed an offence may be
the subject of criminal proceedings or of ‘care’ proceedings, both of which are
normally held before juvenile courts (see p 84).
In care proceedings the fact that a child is found guilty of an offence is not
in itself sufficient justification for the making of a care order; the court must
also be of the opinion that the child is in need of care or control which he is
unlikely to receive unless an order is made. In criminal proceedings a court
may make a care order without the need to consider whether the child is in
need of care or control; this applies to a child found guilty of an offence
punishable in the case of an adult by imprisonment.
A number of orders are available to courts in both care and criminal pro¬
ceedings. A care order commits the child to the care of the local authority,
so that the authority becomes responsible for deciding where the child should
be accommodated, for example, with foster parents or in a community home
(see p 125). The care order must be reviewed every six months by the
authority, and can be ended at any time by the court; normally it expires at
the age of 18 or 19. For children who are too severely disturbed or disruptive
to be treated in other child care homes, ‘youth treatment centres’ are being
provided by the Department of Health and Social Security.
Under a supervision order (usually valid for three years or less) a child
normally remains at home under the supervision of a local authority social
worker or a probation officer. He or she may be required to undergo ‘inter¬
mediate treatment ’ which is a compromise between measures involving complete
removal from home and those which do not. It consists of participation under a
supervisor in a variety of constructive and remedial activities through a short
residential course or, more usually, attendance at a day or evening centre. An
intermediate treatment fund, administered by the Rainer Foundation with
the help of government finance, has been created to give grants to individuals,
groups or organisations willing to provide intermediate treatment facilities.
A court may also order a parent or guardian to enter into recognisances to take
proper care of the child and to exercise proper control over him; such an order
may only be made in criminal proceedings with the consent of the parent or
guardian. In care proceedings, the court may order a stay in hospital in
accordance with the mental health legislation.
In criminal proceedings the courts may also order payments of compensation,
or impose fines or grant a conditional or absolute discharge. If the offender is a
boy, he may be ordered to spend a total of (normally) 12 to 24 hours of his spare
time on Saturdays at an attendance centre (up to three hours on any one
occasion). The centres are for boys found guilty of offences for which older
people could be sentenced to imprisonment, and provide physical training and
instruction in handicrafts or some other practical subject. For boys aged 14 or
over courts may make a detention centre order (see p 93), and young people of
15 and over may be committed to the Crown Court with a view to passing a
sentence of borstal training (see p 93). In the case of a very serious crime,
detention in a place approved by the Home Secretary may be ordered.

In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years but prosecution of
children in the criminal courts is rare and can take place only on the instruc¬
tions of the Lord Advocate; court proceedings usually apply only to very
serious offences such as murder or assault. Instead children under 16 years
who have committed an offence or need care and protection may be brought
before an informal children’s hearing which decides the most appropriate
measures of care and treatment (see p 125). An official ‘reporter’ decides
whether a child should come before a hearing. If the grounds for referral are
not accepted by the child and his parents, the case goes to the sheriff court
(sitting in its civil capacity) for proof. It can then come back to the hearing.
The sheriff also decides appeals against a decision of a children’s hearing.
The age of criminal responsibility in Northern Ireland is ten. Children aged
16 and under charged with committing a criminal offence may be brought
before a juvenile court. If found guilty of an offence punishable by imprison¬
ment in the case of an adult, the child may be sent to a training school or be
placed under supervision. Children brought before the courts in need of care
and protection may be placed in care locally. The law relating to young
offenders is under review.
Offenders aged 17 to 20 years are recognised as a category distinct from child
and adult offenders. The main non-custodial measures are generally the same
as those used in dealing with adults, although in the London and Manchester
areas an attendance centre order (usually made for younger boys, see p 92)
may be given. The custodial sentences available are: detention in a detention
centre, borstal training and imprisonment.
Some 12 senior detention centres provide a means of treating young male
offenders (age 17-21) in Great Britain for whom a long period of residential
training away from home does not seem necessary or justified by the offence,
but who need to be taught respect for the law through some form of custody.
There are also six junior centres for boys aged 14 to 16 years. The normal period
of detention is three months but in England and Wales there is power to award
up to six months and, exceptionally, nine months. Life in a centre is brisk and
formal, demanding the highest possible standards of discipline and achieve¬
ment. Training comprises a normal working week of 40 hours, including an
hour each day devoted to physical training, with considerable attention paid
to education. All offenders discharged from a detention centre are supervised
for a year.
Borstal training is remedial and educational, based on personal training by
carefully selected staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled
trades. There is much freedom of movement and many borstals are open
establishments. Offenders are placed as near their homes as possible in order
to maintain their ties with the local community. The training system is
available to offenders aged 15 to 20 years (16 to 20 years in Scotland and North¬
ern Ireland). Courts rarely order borstal training unless they have already tried
fines, probation or detention centre training, perhaps all three. The training
period usually ranges from six months to two years and is followed by super¬
vision in the community.
A person under 17 years cannot be sentenced to imprisonment in England
and Wales, and no court may pass a sentence of imprisonment on an offender
aged 17 to 20 years unless satisfied that no other method of dealing with him is
appropriate. Sentences of up to two years may be ordered by a court to be sus¬
pended. Prisoners under the age of 21 at the time of their sentence are classified

as ‘young prisoners’, and serve their sentences separately from older prisoners
unless they are reclassified as adults and treated as such in an adult prison. In
Scotland no offender under 21 years may be sent to prison; where neither
borstal nor detention training is suitable for an offender aged 16 to 20 years,
detention in a special ‘young offenders’ institution may be ordered.
CIVIL JUSTICE
The main sub-divisions of the civil law of England, Wales and Northern Ireland
are: family law, the law of property, the law of contract and the law of torts
(covering injuries suffered by one person at the hands of another irrespective of
any contract between them and including such concepts as negligence, defama¬
tion and trespass). Other branches of the civil law include constitutional and
administrative law (particularly concerned with the use of executive power),
industrial law, maritime law and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil law has its
own, often analogous, branches.
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial
proceedings for custody and maintenance orders, adoption orders and affilia¬
tion and guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction concerning
nuisances under the Public Health Acts and the recovery of rates. Committees
of magistrates license public houses, betting shops and clubs.
The jurisdiction of the 300 or so county courts covers, for instance, actions
founded upon contract and tort (with minor exceptions) where the amount
claimed is not more than £2,000; trust and mortgage cases, where the amount
does not exceed £15,000; and actions for the recovery of land where the net
annual value for rating does not exceed £2,000. Cases outside these limits may
be tried in the county court by consent of the parties, or may in certain circum¬
stances be transferred from the High Court to the county court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the
Rent Acts, landlord and tenant and adoption cases. In addition, undefended
divorce cases are heard and determined in county courts designated as divorce
county courts (defended cases are transferred to the High Court) and outside
London bankruptcies are dealt with in certain county courts. The courts also
deal with complaints of racial and sex discrimination in education and the pro¬
vision of goods, facilities, services and premises (see p 135). Where small claims
are concerned (especially those for less than £200 involving consumers), there
are special facilities for arbitration and simplified procedures.
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the
Crown Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have
power to sit in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges
assigned to it by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are
mostly taken by them. The judge normally sits alone, although on the request
of a party the court may, in exceptional cases, order a trial with a jury.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction, which is both original
and appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases, is vested in all its
divisions. In general, however, particular types of work are assigned to a
particular division—distribution of work being governed by statute, the rules of
court and the practice of the court. The Family Division, for instance, is
concerned with all jurisdiction affecting the family, including that relating to
adoption and guardianship of children. The Chancery Division deals with

Appeals

Sheriff Courts
The Court of

the interpretation of wills and the administration of estates. Maritime and
commercial law is the responsibility of admiralty and commercial courts of the
Queen’s Bench Division.
There are 74 High Court judges, each of whom is attached to one division on
appointment but may be transferred to any other division during his term of
office. The Lord Chancellor is president of the Court of Appeal and of the
Chancery Division—the administration of the Chancery Division being the
responsibility of the senior judge known as the Vice-Chancellor. The Queen’s
Bench Division is presided over by the Lord Chief Justice of England, who
ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in the legal hierarchy, and the Family Divi¬
sion is headed by the President. Outside London (where the High Court sits at
the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings of the court are held at 23 Crown Court
centres.
For the hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly.
Appellate jurisdiction in civil matters from inferior courts is exercised by
courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of the appropri¬
ate division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial proceedings heard by magistrates’ courts go to a
divisional court of the Family Division of the High Court. Affiliation appeals
are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from decisions of the licensing
committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High Court and the county courts
are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and may (with leave of the
court or of the House of Lords) go on to the House of Lords, which is the
ultimate court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex officio members of the Court of Appeal are the Lord Chancellor, the
Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and the Master of the
Rolls; the ordinary members are 16 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and some¬
times even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally take place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber),
but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit. The president
of the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor, and proceedings
take the form of the normal proceedings of the House: judgments are given
as speeches to a motion, and the decision is in the form of a vote.
The main civil courts are the sheriff courts and the Court of Session.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to most kinds of action and is
normally unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the
sheriff, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal
or directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits only in Edinburgh, and has jurisdiction to deal with
all kinds of action, subject to a few exceptions. The main exception is an action
exclusive to the sheriff court, namely one where the value claimed is less than
£500. The Court of Session has sole jurisdiction in divorce and certain other
actions. The court is divided into two parts: the Outer House, a court of first
instance, and the Inner House, which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner
House is divided into two divisions of equal status, each consisting of four
judges—the first division being presided over by the Lord President and the
second division by the Lord Justice Clerk. Appeals to the Inner House may be
made from the Outer House and from the sheriff court. From the Inner House

an appeal may go to the House of Lords. The judges of the Court of Session
are the same as those of the High Court of Justiciary. The Lord President of the
Court holds the office of Lord Justice General in the High Court (see p 85).
The Scottish Land Court is a special court whose jurisdiction relates to
agricultural tenancies and similar matters. It consists of a judge (ranking
equally with the judges of the Court of Session) and four laymen who are
specialists in agriculture.
Minor civil cases in Northern Ireland are dealt with in magistrates’ courts, but
as in England and Wales most civil actions are heard in the county courts. The
superior civil law court is the High Court of Justice and appeal may lie to the
Court of Appeal. Together, these two courts comprise the Supreme Court of
Judicature and their practice and procedure are similar to those in the corres¬
ponding English courts. The House of Lords is the final civil appeal court.
Under legislation passed in 1978, the administration of both criminal and
civil courts will be unified.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is required.
Actions in the High Court are usually begun by a writ of summons served on
the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant that the plaintiff
has a claim against him and states the nature of the claim. If the defendant
intends to contest the claim, he informs the court. Documents setting out the
precise question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court.
County court proceedings are initiated by a ‘request’ served on the defendant
by the court; subsequent procedure is simpler than in the High Court.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced in open court, but the special
procedure introduced for a limited class of case in 1973 and extended to most
undefended cases in 1977 dispenses with the need to give evidence in court
and provides for written evidence to be considered by the registrar.
Civil proceedings, because they are a private matter, can usually be aban¬
doned or compromised at any time without leave of the court—the parties to a
dispute being able to settle their differences through their solicitors before the
stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that are brought to court are usually
tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases involving claims for defama¬
tion, false imprisonment, or malicious prosecution, when either party may
insist on trial by jury, or in a case of fraud, when the person against whom
fraud is alleged may claim this right. The jury decides questions of fact and
damages awarded to the injured party; majority verdicts may be accepted.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by seizure
of the debtor’s goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order requiring an
employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction from the
debtor’s wages). Other judgments can take the form of an injunction restraining
someone from performing an illegal act. Refusal to obey a judgment directing
the defendant to do something or to refrain from doing something may result
in imprisonment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal
may be effected only on a warrant of the court.
The general rule is that the costs of the action (the barristers’ fees, solicitors’
charges, court fees and other payments) are in the discretion of the court.
Normally, the court orders them to be paid by the party losing the action.
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary actions (of a
value exceeding £50°) in the sheriff court are initiated by serving on the

defender a summons (an initial writ in the sheriff court). In Court of Session
actions the next step is the publication of the action in the court lists. If the
defender intends to contest the action, he must inform the court; if he does
not appear, the court grants a decree in absence in favour of the pursuer. In
ordinary actions in the sheriff court the defender is simply required to enter
appearance within a certain number of days after service of the initial writ,
and if he does so this is followed by a formal appearance in court by the parties
to the dispute or their solicitors.
In summary causes (actions normally of a value less than £500) in the sheriff
court the procedure is less formal. The statement of claim is incorporated in
the summons, which is a printed form obtained from the sheriff clerk. The
procedure is designed to enable most actions to be carried through without the
parties involved having to appear in court. They (or their representatives) need
appear only when an action is defended or there is some doubt about the method
of paying the debt.
Proceedings in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England and Wales.
The Restrictive Practices Court is a specialised United Kingdom court which
deals with monopolies, and restrictive trade practices. It comprises five
judges and up to ten other people with experience and expertise in industry,
commerce or public life.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a rule,
they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by statute, which
also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in the
social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions on
which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration, with a
group of people or with another individual. Consequently there has been a sub¬
stantial growth of administrative tribunals adjudicating in disputes arising
under regulatory or welfare legislation. Such tribunals include those concerned
with: land and property; national insurance; supplementary benefits; employ¬
ment rights; mental health; transport; taxation; and many which do not fall
into any specified group. Usually they consist of an uneven number of people
so that a majority decision can be reached. Members are normally appointed
b^ the minister concerned with the subject but other authorities (for instance,
the Lord Chancellor) have the power of appointment in appropriate cases. The
Lord Chancellor (or the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland)
makes appointments in most cases where a lawyer chairman or member is
required. Members usually hold office for a specified period.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline (for example of
doctors and solicitors) but these are entirely different in constitution from the
statutory tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Appeals on a point of law from all the more important tribunals may be
made in England and Wales to the High Court, in Scotland to the Court of
Session and in Northern Ireland to the Court of Appeal. An appeal may also
be made to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of the Crown
or to an independent referee. The Employment Appeal Tribunal which hears
appeals on questions of law from decisions of industrial tribunals (see p 324)
has High Court and Court of Session status. The Council on Tribunals
(appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate) exercises
general supervision over tribunals and reports on particular matters, those
peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by the Scottish Committee of the Council.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW
The United Kingdom judiciary is entirely independent of the Government and
is not subject to ministerial direction or control. There is no minister of justice.
Responsibility for the administration of justice rests with the Lord Chancellor,
the Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Also concerned is the Prime Minister who recommends the highest
judicial appointments to the Crown.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the judiciary (and sometimes sits as a judge
in the House of Lords). He is concerned with court procedure and is responsible
for the administration of all courts other than magistrates’ courts. He also
appoints magistrates. On the civil law side, law reform and supervision of the
legal aid and advice scheme are matters for him.
The Home Secretary is concerned with the criminal law (including law
reform), the police service, prisons and the probation and after-care service.
He also exercises a general supervision over magistrates’ courts, with some
specific responsibilities (such as approving the appointment of justices’ clerks).
On matters relating to crime prevention and the treatment of offenders, he is
advised by the Advisory Council on the Penal System. Prison policy and the
administration of custodial centres are functions of the Home Office Prison
Department and the Home Secretary appoints to each centre a board of
visitors representing the local community to investigate and advise him on the
state of the buildings, administration and the treatment of inmates. The boards
have certain disciplinary powers in relation to serious breaches of discipline
and they hear applications or complaints from inmates. The Home Secretary
is advised by a special Parole Board on the release of prisoners on licence.
Responsibility for the treatment of offenders under the age of 17 is shared
by the Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Security.
The Home Secretary is also responsible for advising the Queen on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy to grant a free pardon in connection
with a person’s conviction, or to remit all or part of a penalty which may have
been imposed on an offender by a court.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is responsible for providing
accommodation for all the superior courts in England and Wales, except for the
Central Criminal Court, which is the responsibility of the City of London.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor General, the Law Officers of the
Crown for England and Wales, are the Government’s principal advisers on
English law, and represent the Crown in appropriate domestic and international
cases. They are senior barristers, elected members of the House of Commons
and hold ministerial posts. The Attorney General is also Attorney General for
Northern Ireland.
As well as exercising various civil law functions, the Attorney General has
ultimate control over the institution and withdrawal of criminal proceedings;
the Director of Public Prosecutions (see p 83) is subject to his superintendence.
The Attorney General is concerned with the institution and prosecution of
certain types of criminal proceedings, but he must exercise an independent
discretion, and must not be influenced by his Government colleagues. The
Solicitor General is, in effect, the deputy of the Attorney General.
The Secretary of State for Scotland recommends the appointment of all judges
other than the most senior ones. He also appoints the staff of the High Court of
Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the composition,

staffing and organisation of the sheriff courts. District courts are staffed and
administered by the district and islands local authorities.
The Secretary of State is also responsible for crime prevention, the police
and the penal system. He is advised on parole matters by the Parole Board for
Scotland.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish questions and the principal repre¬
sentatives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord
Advocate is closely concerned with questions of legal policy and administra¬
tion; he is also responsible for the Scottish parliamentary draftsmen, and for
the public prosecution of all major crimes (see p 83).
In Northern Ireland the judiciary are appointed by the Queen on the advice
of the Lord Chancellor. The Northern Ireland Office, under the Secretary of
State, deals with the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty
sessions courts and is responsible for the police and the penal system.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts since the Crown is
the historic source of all judicial power. The Queen, acting on the advice of
ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary.
Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor,
who is head of the judiciary, speaker of the House of Lords and a Cabinet
minister. With the exception of lay magistrates, judges are normally appointed
from practising barristers (advocates in Scotland) or solicitors. Lay magistrates
in England and Wales need no legal qualifications but on appointment they
undertake to complete a period of basic training, so that they may obtain a
sufficient knowledge of the law, including the rules of evidence, and may
understand the nature and purpose of sentencing. A special committee
advises the Lord Chancellor on training policies. The Scottish district court
justices of the peace likewise need no legal qualifications, and the Secretary of
State for Scotland is responsible for training. In Northern Ireland lay
magistrates serving on juvenile courts undertake training courses; resident
magistrates are drawn from practising solicitors or barristers. In certain
circumstances (for instance, in cases of misconduct or proven incapacity)
judges of the inferior courts in England and Wales and Northern Ireland
may be removed from their position by the Lord Chancellor, and in Scotland,
by the Secretary of State on a report by the Lord President of the Court of
Session and the Lord Justice Clerk.
In order to safeguard and perpetuate the independence of the judiciary from
the executive, however, superior judges in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland (other than the Lord Chancellor who, as a Cabinet minister, changes
with the Government) are subject to a power of removal only by the Sovereign
on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament; in Scotland there is no
statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or High Court
of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation would be
required to effect such a dismissal.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the ‘Bar’, and
collectively and individually as ‘counsel’. Solicitors undertake legal business
for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through
solicitors and present cases in the higher courts although certain functions

are common to both. Although an individual is free to conduct his own case
most people prefer to be legally represented in the more serious court cases.
Royal commissions are inquiring into the provision of legal services and con¬
sidering the structure, organisation, entry, training and remuneration of the
legal profession.
In England and Wales every barrister and every student wishing to become a
barrister must be a member of one of the four Inns of Court (Lincoln’s Inn, Inner
Temple, Middle Temple and Gray’s Inn). To become a student member of an
Inn, an entrant must normally have a law degree from a United Kingdom
university or polytechnic. People with other degrees and ‘mature’ students may
also be accepted, but they must pass a diploma in law. All students must pass
the professional examinations run by the Council of Legal Education. After
training, a student can be called to the Bar, but may not practise independently
until he has completed a year’s pupillage with an established barrister. The
governing body of the profession is the Senate of the Inns of Court and the
Bar. The Bar Council (composed of those members of the Senate who are
elected by the Bar) maintains the standards and independence of the profession
and improves its services.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable by
the appropriate committee of The Law Society (the professional organisation
of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his professional
career. The term of articles lasts for two to four years, depending upon the
educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must pass the
necessary examinations prescribed by The Law Society and, unless he has been
a barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend
a course of studies at a recognised law school. Once a solicitor is qualified, he
may become a member of The Law Society.
In Scotland prospective advocates and solicitors undergo much the same
training. While the respective professional organisations—the Faculty of
Advocates and The Law Society of Scotland—have their own professional
examinations, candidates usually obtain exemption from them by including the
necessary subjects in a law degree of a Scottish university. The prospective
advocate must, thereafter, undergo a period of training (either of 21 months or
of 12 months depending on whether or not he has been granted exemption from
nine months’ training) in a solicitor’s office, followed by about nine months’
pupillage with a practising advocate. The prospective solicitor must serve
an apprenticeship of two years in a solicitor’s office before he can begin his
professional career.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is The Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.
Legal aid is provided for people of limited means to pay for the cost of advice and
assistance and for legal representation in court proceedings. Lawyers’ costs and
the expenses of litigation are paid out of a fund provided by the State.
The fund is entitled to be reimbursed from contributions which assisted
people may have to pay according to their means and costs, damages re¬
covered from legally aided people’s opponents in litigation, and a government
grant.
Where court proceedings are not involved, people with limited means can
obtain help from a solicitor on any legal matter either free or subject to a

contribution. This includes giving advice, writing letters, drafting wills and
obtaining opinions from a barrister. A solicitor may act for a client until his
costs and expenses reach a total of £25 (£45 for undefended divorce cases), but
authority must be obtained for this limit to be exceeded. A person seeking
help has to give the solicitor brief details about his income and savings. The
income limit laid down by the scheme is reviewed at least annually.
In some urban areas law centres exist to provide free legal advice; all have at
least one full-time salaried lawyer and most employ community workers. There
are also voluntary legal advice centres in many parts of the country and many
Citizens Advice Bureaux provide legal advice.
Legal aid for civil court proceedings is available to people whose disposable
incomes and disposable capital do not exceed certain prescribed amounts,1
but a contribution is payable according to the level of the applicant’s income;
if that is below a prescribed amount, legal aid is given free of any contribution.
As in the case of legal advice and assistance, the qualifying income limits for
aid are reviewed at least once a year.
An applicant for legal aid must also show that he has reasonable grounds for
taking or defending the proceedings. Provided his application is successful
the case is then conducted in the ordinary way, except that no money passes
between the assisted person and his solicitor—payments being made in and
out of the legal aid fund. The costs of an action which an assisted litigant loses
against an unassisted opponent may also, subject to certain conditions and if
the court so orders, be met out of the fund. Solicitors and counsel have a duty
to review the case at each stage to see that it is not being pursued unreasonably
at public expense. Legal aid is not generally available in cases where redress is
sought for alleged defamation or for representation in most proceedings in
administrative tribunals.
The civil legal aid schemes are run by The Law Society, The Law Society of
Scotland and The Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland, under the
general guidance respectively of the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made by
the court concerned if it appears to be in the interests of justice and that a
defendant’s means are such that he requires financial help in meeting the costs
of the proceedings in which he is involved. An order must be made when a per¬
son is committed for trial on a charge of murder or applies for leave to appeal
from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) or the Courts Martial Appeal
Court to the House of Lords. No person can be given a custodial sentence for
the first time unless he is legally represented.
Voluntary duty solicitor schemes at many magistrates’ courts provide
‘stand-by’ help for unrepresented defendants.
The criminal legal aid scheme in England and Wales is administered by the
courts, under the overall responsibility of the Home Secretary.
The arrangements for aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland and Northern
Ireland are broadly similar, but in Scotland there is a statutory duty solicitor
scheme for accused people in custody in sheriff, and district, court cases and
the ‘interests of justice’ test applies only in summary cases.
1 Assessments of disposable income and capital are made by the Supplementary Benefits
Commission and are governed by regulations which allow for deductions from gross
income for maintenance of dependants, interest on loans, income tax, rent and other
matters for which a person may reasonably provide out of income, and deductions for
furniture and other household effects from his capital.

LAW REFORM
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The duty of keeping the law under review in order to ensure that it meets the
needs of modern society lies in England and Wales with the Law Reform
Committee, the Criminal Law Revision Committee and the Law Commission,
and in Scotland with the Scottish Law Commission. The Law Reform Com¬
mittee and the Criminal Law Revision Committee are standing committees of
judges and distinguished practising and academic lawyers, appointed respectively
by the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary, to examine such aspects of the
civil and criminal law as may be referred to them by the appropriate minister.
The Law Commission is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of high
standing, charged with the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its
systematic development and reform, including the possibility of codification,
the elimination of anomalies, the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enact¬
ments, and the reduction of the number of separate enactments. It reports to the
Lord Chancellor. The Scottish Law Commission, which has a constitution
similar to that of the English body and similar functions, reports to the Lord
Advocate. The work of the two commissions has led to changes in many
areas of the law, the repeal of some 950 obsolete Acts and the pruning of the
contents of nearly i,400 others.

Britain’s defence policy is based firmly on the North Atlantic Alliance, and
this commitment was emphasised by the decision, taken in January 1978
following a period of retrenchment, to increase defence expenditure in line
with an Alliance agreement (see below). In other respects, defence policy
continues to be centred around the conclusions of the 1974 Defence Review,
which aimed at reducing defence costs as a proportion of national resources
while maintaining a modern and effective defence system. As a result of the
review, completed in early 1975 following consultations with Britain’s allies,
defence forces are being concentrated on those areas in which a British con¬
tribution to collective defence will be most effective in ensuring the nation’s
own security and that of its allies. Thus the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO) remains the primary charge on Britain’s defence resources, and Britain
has withdrawn from its non-NATO commitments wherever this has been
consistent with its fundamental military and political obligations. At the same
time, general purpose forces are being maintained as insurance against the
unforeseen.
At the end of 197^) reductions in planned defence expenditure for
1978-79 were announced as part of the overall reductions in public expenditure
programmes (see p 186). About half of the savings are coming from the equip¬
ment programme, about one-fifth from works and accommodation stores, and
the balance from miscellaneous changes. The Government’s overriding
objective is to keep to the minimum the effect of the reductions on Britain’s
front-line contribution to NATO.
Following the NATO agreement in May 1977 that all member countries
should aim at an annual increase of defence expenditure of about 3 per cent
in real terms for the period 1979-84, Britain has announced a 3 per cent
increase in real terms in the defence budget for 1979-80 and a further 3 per
cent increase for 1980—81. The latter figure is subject to review in the light
of economic circumstances, and no decisions have been taken beyond 1981
since it will be necessary before reaching conclusions to take account of
developments in arms control and defence as well as in the economy.
POLICY
Britain’s basic security depends on the strength of the North Atlantic Alliance,
and it is to NATO that by far the greater part of Britain’s military forces is
committed. Britain makes a major contribution to the full range of deterrent
capabilities, both conventional and nuclear, required to maintain NATO’s
defensive posture. Within NATO, Britain plays an important part in the efforts
of the European members to assume, through closer co-operation, an increasing
responsibility for Western defence. In the ‘Eurogroup’ Britain and ten other
European members are working to improve their contribution to the Alliance
and to achieve a more effective collective result from the available resources.
The sub-groups of the Eurogroup, each of which concentrates on a specific
area such as training or logistics, make an important contribution towards
the strength of the Alliance by increasing co-operation among its members.
Britain also participates in the independent European Programme Group

of all European members of the Alliance; the group has been set up to extend
co-operation among European countries in defence equipment and to contri¬
bute to greater equipment co-operation throughout the Alliance.
Britain is playing a major part in the efforts to reduce tension and achieve
more lasting peace in Europe. It is working to ensure that the agreements
signed in Helsinki with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries
on security and co-operation in Europe, which were reviewed at a meeting in
Belgrade from October 1977 to March 1978, will contribute to increased
stability and improved relations. It is also seeking to achieve progress in the
negotiations for mutual and balanced force reductions in Central Europe.
Britain retains responsibility for the protection of its remaining dependencies;
is a member of the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO); and retains a con¬
sultative commitment to the Five Power Defence arrangement with Australia,
New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore. In addition, the armed forces continue
to give assistance to communities overseas, particularly in such activities as
disaster relief and development work.
Britain also plays an active part in the United Nations (UN) and other inter¬
national bodies working to eliminate the sources of tension and conflict
between nations and to promote arms control and disarmament. It supports
the peace-keeping efforts of the UN—supplying the largest national contingent
to the UN Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus. Britain played an active role in the
UN special session on disarmament which took place from May to July 1978.
In addition, it is a frequent contributor to debates in the Conference of the
Committee on Disarmament and has played a leading part in strengthening
the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons through the International
Atomic Energy Agency and other bodies.
PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Government as a
whole, which is responsible to Parliament. The formulation of defence
policy is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence. In recent
years the emphasis in defence organisation has been on increased central
policy control and the co-ordinated planning of the defence effort. The Ministry
of Defence (see p 43) ensures effective co-ordination of policy and administra¬
tion concerning the Services. The Secretary of State is assisted by a Minister of
State, and by three Under-Secretaries of State—for the Navy, Army and Air
Force respectively. They, together with the Chief of the Defence Staff, the
three Service Chiefs of Staff, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for
Defence, the Vice-Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel and Logistics), the Chief
Scientific Adviser and the Chief of Defence Procurement, form the Defence
Council, which deals with major aspects of defence policy. The Chiefs of Staff
Committee is responsible for giving professional advice on strategy and opera¬
tions, and on the military implications of defence policy. The day-to-day
management of the three Services is the responsibility of the Admiralty, Army
and Air Force Boards of the Defence Council.
Information about defence policy and the armed forces is provided in an annual
Statement on the Defence Estimates (Cmnd. 7099 in 1978, published in
February). The defence estimates for 1978-79 totalled ^6,919 million, which
represents about 4-75 per cent of gross domestic product at market prices. Of

The basis of the NATO strategy of flexibility in response, which retains
the principle of forward defence, is that credible deterrence of military aggres¬
sion of all kinds is essential. While NATO must be ready to use nuclear weapons
if necessary, its conventional forces must be maintained to enable it to respond
to aggression at a variety of levels, the level of response being that which enables
NATO to maintain the territorial and maritime integrity of the Alliance and
thereby to gain time for negotiations to end a conflict. The strategy requires a
comprehensive range of mobile and well-equipped conventional forces, and
of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons.
Britain makes a major contribution to the forces required by NATO’s present
strategy. Together with its tactical nuclear forces, the British Polaris strategic
force provides a unique European contribution to NATO’s nuclear deterrent.
V irtually all ships of frigate size and above are earmarked for assignment in
an emergency to NATO. The Royal Navy also contributes to NATO’s
Standing Naval Force Atlantic, Standing Naval Force Channel, and the
Naval On Call Force Mediterranean. The British Army of the Rhine
(BAOR) and Royal Air Force (RAF) Germany are deployed in the Federal
Republic of Germany and there is a Field Force in Berlin. The main combat
element of BAOR is First (British) Corps which is being reorganised, and by
1979 will comprise four new-style armoured divisions, an artillery division, and
a new infantry formation. Its peacetime strength of around 55,000 would be

more than doubled on mobilisation by reinforcements and reserves from
Britain (see p no). Virtually all the RAF’s combat and combat support
aircraft are assigned to NATO. RAF Germany is a tactical air force including
strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support and air-defence aircraft. In
addition, combat units based in Britain provide an important part of
NATO’s mobile reinforcement capability. These include the ground elements
of the United Kingdom Mobile Force, the British contribution to the
Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Land) and three squadrons of 22
Special Air Service Regiment. RAF Strike Command provides forces for
strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support, air defence and maritime patrol
and anti-submarine warfare, together with transport forces and air elements
for the United Kingdom Mobile Force and Allied Command Europe Mobile
Force (Air).
At home a major task of the armed forces since 1969 has been to assist the
civil authorities in Northern Ireland in the maintenance of law and order, and
they have operated to counter the terrorist activities of extremist organisations.
In the Mediterranean, British forces are deployed in Gibraltar, in Malta until
March 1979, and in Cyprus to meet Britain’s commitment to the United
Nations Force and to provide for the security of the Sovereign Base Areas. In
Hong Kong, units of all three Services provide a garrison for external defence,
and a Gurkha battalion is stationed in Brunei. A Royal Marines detachment is
maintained in the Falkland Islands; and in the Caribbean, units of the Army
and the RAF provide a garrison for the external defence of Belize.

THE ARMED FORCES
Britain’s armed forces consist of the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air
Force.
The Royal Navy has four main arms: the Naval General Service, which
mans and maintains the surface fleet; the Fleet Air Arm; the Submarine
Service; and the Royal Marines, who primarily provide an amphibious
striking force. The Royal Navy has a unified sea command, Commander-in-
Chief, Fleet; and the Naval Home Command, Portsmouth, under a
Commander-in-Chief, with subordinate area commands based at Plymouth,
Chatham and Rosyth.
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services which include the
Household Cavalry, the Royal Horse Artillery, the Royal Armoured Corps,
the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal
Corps of Signals, the Regiments of Foot Guards and Regiments of Infantry,
the Special Air Service Regiment, the Army Air Corps, the Royal Corps of
Transport, the Royal Army Medical Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps
and the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. At home the
Army is under a single command, United Kingdom Land Forces, with
subordinate district commands; Northern Ireland remains a separate com¬
mand while the emergency continues.
The Royal Air Force general purpose forces are organised in two opera¬
tional commands, Strike Command and Royal Air Force Germany. Support
and training organisations are grouped within one United Kingdom
command.
The three women’s Services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service, the Women’s
Royal Army Corps, and the Women’s Royal Air Force are integral parts of

the armed forces, and servicewomen serve alongside servicemen in Britain
and overseas. Nursing services are provided by Queen Alexandra’s Royal
Naval Nursing Service, Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps and
Princess Mary’s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Britain’s armed forces excluding non-United Kingdom personnel totalled
about 323,500 on 1 January 1978, 75,500 in the Royal Navy and Royal
Marines, 163,100 in the Army and 85,000 in the Royal Air Force. The forecast
total for 1 April 1979 is 322,500. The average number of civilian staff expected
to be employed by the Ministry of Defence during 1978-79 is 266,800.

Note: These are average strengths and include locally enlisted personnel.
Britain’s armed forces consist entirely of personnel serving on a voluntary
basis. Engagements available to non-commissioned ranks range from three to
22 years, with a wide freedom of choice on the length and terms of service.
Recruits to non-commissioned ranks of all three Services are committed for
only a minimum period of service (about three years, excluding training) and,
subject to that minimum, may leave at any time at 18 months’ notice. Discharge
may also be granted on compassionate grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of
conscience (applications being assessed by an independent tribunal). Com¬
missions may be granted for short, medium and long terms. In all three Services
there are opportunities for promotion from the ranks. Entry to commissioned
ranks is on the basis of educational and other qualifications. All three Services
have schemes for university cadetships.

Entrants to non-commissioned ranks are given basic training, and further and
specialist training is given during the course of their careers. Young service¬
men and women are encouraged to study for educational qualifications, all
three Services providing extensive facilities for the consolidation and develop¬
ment of their personnel’s education. Trade and technical training, though
primarily designed for Service purposes, leads for about half the total
number of service personnel to nationally recognised qualifications.
Service technical training is highly valued in industry, which is a significant
advantage on return to civilian life. To assist such resettlement the Services
provide an advisory service, familiarisation attachments to civilian organisa¬
tions, and opportunity and assistance to study for suitable civilian qualifica¬
tions. There are also opportunities for short- and longer-term retraining
both before and after discharge from the Services.
Entrants to commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia
Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, the
Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, or similar institutions. This is followed by
specialist training, often including degree courses at university or Service
establishments.
Staff training is provided by the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich, the
Army Staff College at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at
Bracknell. The National Defence College at Latimer is designed to fit
selected mid-career officers of all three Services for key posts that contribute
to formulation of defence policy in the Ministry of Defence and on inter¬
national staffs. Specially selected senior officers and officials from Britain,
the Commonwealth, NATO, CENTO and other countries attend the Royal
College of Defence Studies in London, which provides the wider background
necessary for those destined to fill higher appointments.
Considerable operational training is carried out through joint-Service and
inter-allied exercises. All three Services provide training facilities for the
armed forces of allied and Commonwealth countries.
Combat forces are functionally divided into the nuclear strategic force (costing
an estimated ^93 million in i978-79)> Royal Navy general purpose combat
forces (£1,017 million), European theatre ground forces (£1,251 million), other
Army combat forces (£74 million) and Royal Air Force general purpose
forces (£1,107 million).
The British contribution to NATO’s strategic deterrent is provided by the
Royal Navy’s force of four Polaris nuclear submarines Resolution, Repulse,
Renown and Revenge. Each can remain on underwater patrol for long periods
and is equipped with 16 Polaris missiles, armed with nuclear warheads, with
a range of about 4,500 km (2,800 miles).
Britain’s maritime forces are concentrated in the Eastern Atlantic and English
Channel, where they provide the majority of forces readily available to NATO.
However, they retain an ability to be deployed world-wide in defence of
allied or national interests. Nearer home there is an increasing commitment
arising from the need to protect Britain’s offshore resources, in particular
the North Sea oil and gas installations, and to continue the traditional task
of fishery protection.
HMS Invincible, the first of a new class of anti-submarine warfare cruiser,
was launched in 1977. Its prime role will be to deploy the Sea King anti¬
submarine helicopter. The cruiser will also provide a command and control

function for maritime task forces and will contribute to area air defence
with its Sea Dart missile system and Sea Harrier maritime vertical short
take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft. The aircraft carrier HMS Ark
Royal also deploys the Sea King helicopter and operates Buccaneer strike
aircraft (equipped with the Anglo-French Martel air-to-surface missile),
Phantom air-defence and Gannet airborne early warning aircraft. Sea Kings
are also embarked on the anti-submarine warfare cruiser HMS Hermes
and the command helicopter cruisers HMS Blake and Tiger, which are
responsible for directing and controlling naval forces. There are the County
class guided-missile destroyers, all armed with Seaslug and Seacat surface-to-
air missiles and four with the Exocet surface-to-surface guided-missile system,
the Type 82 guided-missile destroyer HMS Bristol (equipped with the Sea
Dart area air defence missile system and the Ikara anti-submarine guided
weapon system), and three of the new class of Type 42 Sea Dart guided-missile
destroyers. Other surface vessels include 49 general purpose frigates (compris¬
ing 26 Leander class, seven Tribal class, eight Rothesay class and eight of the
new Type 21 Amazon class), two anti-aircraft frigates, two aircraft direction
frigates, two anti-submarine frigates, 38 mine counter-measure vessels and five
new Island class offshore patrol vessels. The frigate classes are variously
armed with automatic guns, surface-to-air missile systems, underwater
detection and anti-submarine weapons. Most have the Wasp helicopter
embarked, which is being replaced, where appropriate, by the Anglo-French
Lynx.
Exocet missile systems are being installed in some Leander class and
Type 21 frigates, giving these vessels a better surface-to-surface capability.
Some Leander class frigates are also equipped with the Ikara anti-submarine
weapon. Ten nuclear-fleet submarines are in service, including the first four
of the Swiftsure class, as are 17 conventional patrol submarines. There is
also an amphibious capability comprising the two assault ships HMS Fearless
and HMS Intrepid and the Royal Marines Commando Forces, supported by
HMS Hermes which retains a secondary role as a commando ship. Support will
also be available from HMS Bulwark which is to return to full operational
service as an anti-submarine warfare cruiser, but will, like HMS Hermes, retain
an amphibious lift capability.
Ships under construction include HMS Illustrious, the second of the new
anti-submarine warfare cruisers, and three of the new Type 22 class frigates
which will be armed with the Sea Wolf surface-to-air and Exocet anti-ship
missile systems. In addition, work is in hand on three nuclear-fleet submarines,
including the first of a new class, seven Type 42 Sea Dart destroyers, and two of
a new class of glass-reinforced plastic mine counter-measure vessels.
The European theatre ground forces consist of BAOR, and the forces stationed
in Britain, the main elements of which have primary roles in support of
NATO (see p 105).
Other Army combat forces comprise land forces stationed overseas to meet
treaty commitments to Commonwealth and other countries (see p 106).
Armoured regiments are equipped with the Chieftain main battle tank. A new
series of tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles is in service, including
Scorpion and Scimitar, mounting respectively a 76mm and a 30mm gun,
Striker, carrying the Swingfire anti-tank missile, and Sultan, a command
vehicle. The primary tracked armoured personnel carriers used by mechanised

infantry battalions are the FV432, and entering service with the infantry is the
crew-portable Milan anti-tank weapon system. Artillery units are equipped
with the Abbot 105mm self-propelled gun, 155mm and 175mm self-propelled
guns, and Field Artillery Computer Equipment (FACE). A new 105mm light
gun is entering service and will be joined by the FH70 155mm field howitzer.
Tactical nuclear support is provided by the Lance missile system. Air defence
is provided by the Rapier low-level surface-to-air missile system and the
Blowpipe man-portable very-low-level missile.
The Royal Air Force general purpose forces consist of aircraft for air defence,
strike/attack, reconnaissance, offensive support, airborne early warning,
maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare, transport and in-flight refuelling,
together with RAF Regiment field squadrons.
Phantom and Lightning aircraft, together with Rapier and Bloodhound
surface-to-air missiles, are employed in air defence. Radar warning is provided
by Shackleton airborne early warning aircraft and by the ground radars and
control and reporting centres of the United Kingdom Air Defence Ground
Environment system. Jaguars, Buccaneers and Vulcans operate in the strike/
attack role; Jaguars, Canberras and Vulcans are employed for reconnaissance;
Jaguars and the Harrier V/STOL aircraft for offensive support (with the
Harrier also having a tactical reconnaissance capability); Nimrods for long-
range maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare and for offshore surveillance
and fishery protection duty.
The VC10 provides strategic transport and the Hercules (which also has a
strategic capability) is used for tactical transport over medium ranges. For
short-range tasks, the Wessex and Puma helicopters are used, while for search
and rescue operations Wessex, Whirlwind and Sea King helicopters are used in
Britain. Victor tankers are used for in-flight refuelling, which gives added range
and flexibility to combat aircraft.
Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. Apart
from their essential military role—to supplement the regular forces in time of
war or emergency with trained personnel able immediately to take their places
in the Services either as formed units or as individual reinforcements—they
form an important link between the Services and the civil community. Some
of their members have a reserve liability following a period of regular service
(regular reserve); others are volunteer men and women who devote their spare
time to training for the roles they would undertake in war or an emergency. On
1 January 1978 regular reserves totalled 176,200, and volunteer reserves and
auxiliary forces 75,300. Cadet forces, which make a significant contribution to
recruitment to the regular forces, totalled 141,000.
The Royal Navy regular reserve consists of various categories of former full¬
time officers and ratings liable to recall in emergency, including the Royal Fleet
Reserve, which consists of men with recent experience of regular service. The
volunteer reserves comprise the Royal Naval Reserve, with its associated
women’s reserve, and the Royal Marines Reserve. Both carry out regular part-
time training, the former to man a number of operational minesweepers and
support maritime and other headquarters, the latter to reinforce the regular
corps and in particular the Royal Marine Commandos.
The Army reserves comprise the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve
(TAVR) and regular reserves consisting of ex-regular servicemen.

The TAVR’s primary role is to reinforce the ground forces committed to
NATO and to assist in maintaining a secure United Kingdom base in support
of the forces deployed in Europe. It consists of independent units, organised
on a local basis with regular Army and permanent civilian staff, and sponsored
units of specialists recruited on a country-wide basis. They undergo regular
part-time training. The task of regular reservists would be to bring regular and
TAVR formations to war strength.
The Ulster Defence Regiment is a locally-recruited, largely part-time force
designed to support the regular forces in Northern Ireland.
The Royal Air Force Reserve consists of former regular officers and personnel
with a reserve liability, and the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which
includes the university air squadrons. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists
of units which would support regular formations in an emergency.
CIVIL DEFENCE
Civil defence arrangements are principally based on the extended and adapted
use of existing public services operated by nationalised industries, local
authorities, police authorities and government departments. Supplementary
effort from individual volunteers and voluntary organisations would be brought
in, either at the discretion of local authorities or in response to a national
appeal, in time of crisis. A central point of recent policy has been to improve the
preparedness of local government to meet a war emergency. Since there is
common ground between such planning and the preparations and organisation
for a major peace-time emergency or national disaster, activities have also been
directed towards creating a closer relationship in local planning for the
different emergencies of peace and war.
Within an annual budget of £26-3 million, emphasis is placed on a high
quality of central and local government planning. Studies and seminars are
arranged by the Home Office on staff college lines.
Arrangements also include an emergency system for decentralised govern¬
mental control and communications. The United Kingdom Warning and
Monitoring Organisation, which includes the civilian Royal Observer Corps, is
organised to provide public warning of an attack, of the location and strength of
nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level of radioactive fall-out.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Responsibility for the procurement (that is, research, development and pro¬
duction) of defence equipment, including aircraft, ships, ordnance, guided
weapons and electronics, lies with the Procurement Executive within the
Ministry of Defence. The Executive is responsible for maintaining liaison
between the Service users and the machinery for procurement, and co¬
ordination with industry in the formulation of programmes; this ensures a
co-ordinated and cost-effective approach.
The major part of research is undertaken by the Ministry of Defence’s research
and development establishments, but the Ministry also sponsors a substantial
amount of research by industry and the universities. The research and develop¬
ment establishments have a very wide technological capability, which has
civil as well as military applications: for example, support is given to civil
aerospace projects and advanced aero-engines. On the development side, the
112
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
National Projects
Production
establishments collaborate closely with the Ministry’s contractors by monitor¬
ing their progress, and by assisting in testing programmes and in solving
particular technical problems.
Modern defence equipment is becoming ever more complex, and its develop¬
ment requires a high initial investment; in 1978-79 the total cost of British
equipment research and development is estimated at £876 million. The
search for a more efficient use of these resources has caused attention to be
concentrated on collaborative projects, which enable the cost of development
and production to be shared with other countries. In some cases the outright
purchase of foreign equipment is the most economical solution. Nevertheless,
the importance of maintaining a sound national industrial base for defence
procurement is recognised, and there is close consultation between government
and industry both in the National Defence Industries Council and through
other specialised machinery.
Collaboration between Britain and other European countries is already
extensive, and may be expected to increase, particularly through the work of
the European Programme Group. Successful joint projects so far include the
Anglo-French Jaguar aircraft, the Martel air-to-surface missile, the Lynx,
Puma and Gazelle helicopters and the Anglo-Belgian family of armoured
combat reconnaissance vehicles. Production and development of the Tornado
multi-role combat aircraft (MRCA) with the Federal Republic of Germany
and Italy is continuing and good progress is being made in the development,
with these two countries, of the medium artillery pieces FH70 and SP70.
Equipment collaboration also facilitates joint logistic support and training
arrangements, like those taking place among the five European countries
which have agreed to purchase the Lance surface-to-surface missile system
from the United States.
A considerable number of projects, covering all the main equipment areas, are
under development. They include a complete range of new avionic and sonic
equipment which will greatly improve the effectiveness of the Nimrods; an air
defence variant of the Tornado, which is planned to replace the Phantom; a
search and rescue version of the Sea King helicopter with a greater range and
capability; a new range of logistic vehicles for battlefield support; a new type
of tank armour, Chobham Armour, which weight for weight provides greatly
improved protection for armoured vehicles; and the Wisp and Wideye
remotely-piloted helicopters. An airborne early warning (AEW) version of the
Nimrod is being developed, equipped with an advanced AEW radar, which
will be interoperable with any other AEW system other NATO countries may
decide to procure.
Following the development of defence equipment, either nationally or in
co-operation with allies, production is usually undertaken by private industry
on a contract basis or by the Royal Ordnance Factories and Royal Dockyards.
Production may also be undertaken on a collaborative basis. The Defence
Sales organisation provides support, assistance and advice to British industry
and the Royal Ordnance Factories in promoting the sales of defence equipment
overseas. In 1978-79 the value of exports of British defence equipment is
expected to reach £900 million.
6 Soml Welfare
The British social welfare system comprises the National Health Service, the
personal social services and social security. Education is described in Chapter
7, and housing in Chapter 9. The National Health Service supplies, largely
free, the best medical service available to all, irrespective of means. The
local authority personal social services and voluntary organisations pro¬
vide advice and help to elderly people, disabled people and children in need of
care. The social security system is designed to secure a basic standard of living
for people in financial need by providing income support during periods of
inability to earn, helping families and compensating for disablement.
Although public spending on health and personal social services has in¬
creased in real terms, the rate of growth has had to be cut because of restrictions
on central and local government expenditure. Protection of the elderly, the
sick and the poor is a central part of the Government’s social programme, and
pensions and other social security benefits have been unaffected by cuts in
public expenditure and are raised annually.
In the health service, priority is being given to services for the mentally ill,
the mentally handicapped, the elderly, families with children and primary
health care. Efforts are being made to distribute resources more fairly between
different parts of the country. The Government is also placing even greater
emphasis than hitherto on the need to obtain value for money. Among addi¬
tional money-saving measures being studied are cuts in administrative costs,
more preventive medicine, a more efficient utilisation of hospital beds, more day
hospital treatment and improved systems of purchasing supplies.
The Government in collaboration with local authorities has continued to
build up the personal social services. Joint finance and planning between
health and local authorities aims to prevent overlapping of services and to
encourage the development of community services such as hostels for patients
discharged from mental hospitals. In deciding their priorities, some local
authorities attach greater importance than others to the personal social services
and to the various categories of people in need of help, with the result that
provision can vary from area to area.
Central government is responsible directly for the National Health Service,
administered by health authorities and boards acting as its agents, and for the
social security system. It has an indirect responsibility for the personal social
services administered by local government authorities.
Spending on social welfare in 1977 was: health £6,730 million, personal
social services £1,266 and social security £13,213 million.
NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The National Health Service is based upon the principle that medical care and
advice should be readily available to everyone, at little or no cost. Health ser¬
vices are available largely free of charge to everyone ordinarily resident in
Britain. Visitors can also use the Service if they require immediate treatment
for an unforeseen emergency; they are expected to pay if the purpose of their
visit is to seek treatment. There are reciprocal health arrangements with some
countries (see p 121). The Service is administered by appointed statutory
BRITAIN 1979: an OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
authorities and is financed largely from general taxation, but other sources of
revenue include charges for some items and a small part of the national insurance
contribution (see p 126).
Since the beginning of the Service in 1948 (a period in which there have
been considerable advances in standards of living, nutrition and scientific
medicine), the infant mortality rate has been halved. The health of children
has steadily improved with the decline of the major infectious diseases, and
deaths from tuberculosis, poliomyelitis and diptheria have fallen steeply. As
part of the general growth of facilities under the National Health Service,
staffing has improved markedly. Since 1965, for example, the hospital
medical staff in England, Wales and Scotland has increased by nearly 53
per cent and the nursing staff by over 32 per cent.
Although major advances have been made in the provision of health facilities,
certain problems remain, notably regional disparities in health provision and a
shortage of resources resulting from the need to restrain the growth in public
expenditure. An additional problem is the high cost of technologically advanced
equipment required for diagnosis and treatment. To help alleviate some of
these difficulties the Government is allocating more funds to the less-favoured
regions. Greater emphasis is being placed on preventive services (such as
screening and health surveillance of children, immunisation, family planning
and measures to discourage cigarette smoking) and on developing the services
provided by family doctors, dentists and ophthalmic practitioners, district
nurses, midwives and health visitors. A continued rise in standards in general
practice is expected as a result of compulsory vocational training schemes for
family doctors.
A Royal Commission is considering the best use and management of the
financial and manpower resources of the National Health Service.
ADMINISTRATION The health ministers—the Secretary of State for Social Services in England
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are
responsible for all aspects of the health services in their respective countries.
Within each of the four countries the health departments (the Department of
Health and Social Security in England, the Scottish Home and Health Depart¬
ment, the Welsh Office and the Department of Health and Social Services in
Northern Ireland) are responsible for strategic planning. Area health authori¬
ties in England and Wales, health boards in Scotland and health and social
services boards in Northern Ireland are responsible for planning and operational
control of all health services in their area. In England, because of its greater
size and population, there is an additional tier of regional authorities respon¬
sible for regional planning and certain services best administered on a regional
basis (for example, research and major capital building work).
There are 14 regional health authorities and 90 area health authorities in
England, 8 area health authorities in Wales and 15 health boards in Scotland.
They are statutory agencies of central government and co-operate closely with
local authorities responsible for social work, environmental health, education
and other services. In general the areas covered by area health authorities and
health boards correspond with those of the major local authorities. Health and
local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland co-operate by means of joint
planning arrangements and joint consultative committees.
In Northern Ireland the four health and social services boards act as agents
for the Department of Health and Social Services.
Area authorities and health boards in Great Britain have discretion to deter¬
mine the pattern of services best suited to their areas but they have to take

account of national priorities. In most areas the day-to-day running of services
is carried out by management teams in districts which usually contain a district
general hospital and have a population of between 200,000 and 500,000, though
some are considerably larger (in Scotland and Wales they may be much smaller
in the remoter areas). In Scotland a Common Services Agency organises certain
central services; there are similar agencies in Wales and Northern Ireland.
The health authorities and boards consist of unpaid part-time members. All
chairmen and members of the English regional authorities and the Scottish
health boards, and the chairmen of the English and Welsh area health authori¬
ties are appointed by the Secretary of State concerned after consultation with
professional, local authority, university and other interests. Two-thirds of
the members of the area health authorities are appointed by the regional health
authorities in England and the Secretary of State in Wales; these include at
least one university nominee and some professional members who work within
the Service. The remainder are appointed by the corresponding local authori¬
ties, Area authorities in areas containing a university medical school are known
as area authorities (teaching) and in addition to two university nominees
contain at least two members with teaching hospital experience. University
medical and dental schools are responsible for teaching medical students and
the National Health Service provides hospital clinical facilities for their
training.
There is statutory provision for professional advisory committees at national,
regional and area level; the authorities have a duty to consult with these com¬
mittees. The main national advisory bodies are the Central Health Services
Council in England and Wales, the Scottish Health Service Planning Council
in Scotland and the Health and Social Services Council in Northern Ireland.
The Health Advisory Service for England and Wales reports to the Secretaries
of State on conditions in hospitals and the community health service.
The Scottish Hospital Advisory Service reports to health boards and the
Secretary of State.
Public representation in the Service for England and Wales is provided by
community health councils. These consist of about 20 to 30 members, half of
them appointed by local government councils and the rest mainly on the
nomination of voluntary bodies interested in local health services. They have
access to the area health authority, the right to secure information and the right
to visit hospitals.
In Scotland local health councils have been set up by the health boards to
represent the interests of the public. District committees exercise this function
in Northern Ireland.
Legislation provides for the appointment of three Health Service Commis¬
sioners (for England, Scotland and Wales) to investigate complaints from
members of the public about the health service. All three posts are held by the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (see p 35). His health service
jurisdiction covers the failure of a health authority to carry out its statutory
duties, maladministration, and injustice or hardship caused by a failure in a
service. A complaint can only be considered if the complainant has sent it first
to the health authority and given it sufficient time to investigate and reply.
Matters outside his jurisdiction include action taken solely in the exercise of
clinical judgment and the action of family practitioners (see p 116).
The commissioner reports annually to ministers who lay the reports before
Parliament; he also publishes at regular intervals full texts of his reports of
investigations without, however, naming individuals or institutions.

In Northern Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints (see p 68)
investigates complaints concerning the health service, but not the actions of
medical practitioners or the professions supplementary to medicine.
About 88 per cent of the cost of the health services falls on the Treasury while
the rest is met from the national health service contribution paid with the
national insurance contribution and from some charges.
There are charges for medical prescriptions but these do not apply to
children under 16 years, expectant and nursing mothers, women aged 60 and
over and men aged 65 and over, patients suffering from certain medical condi¬
tions, war and Service disablement pensioners (for treatment of their disability),
and families with very low incomes, including those receiving supplementary
benefits and family income supplement. In addition there are charges for
treatment in the general dental service (but not for examination only or for
treatment given to people under 21 years or women who are pregnant or have
borne a child in the past year); for dentures (except for children under 16 or
still at school, and women who are pregnant or have borne a child in the past
year); for spectacles (except children’s standard spectacles); and for some other
articles. Certain low income groups are exempt from dental and optical charges
(those receiving supplementary benefit or family income supplement and
those receiving free prescriptions or welfare foods).
A limited amount of accommodation may be made available at a small
charge for hospital patients wanting privacy as long as it is not needed on
medical grounds for non-paying patients.
Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients to be treated as private
patients on payment of the whole cost of their accommodation and treatment.
The Government is phasing out private pay beds in National Health Service
hospitals (for private health provision, see p 121).
Hospital medical staffs are salaried and can be employed full-time or part-
time. Part-time hospital doctors are free to accept private patients. General
medical practitioners are self-employed and paid by a system of fees and
allowances designed to reflect responsibilities, work load and practice expenses.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they
dispense. Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
part in the general ophthalmic service are paid approved fees for each sight test
made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number and
type of pairs supplied.
Primary health care is in the hands of doctors, dentists, opticians and pharma¬
cists working within the Service as independent practitioners, and district
nurses, midwives and health visitors employed by the health authorities.
The family practitioner services cover the services given to patients by doctors,
dentists, opticians and pharmacists of their own choice. They are administered
in England and Wales by family practitioner committees established by the
health authorities, in Scotland by the health boards and in Northern Ireland
by the Central Services Agency.
There are nearly 26,000 family doctors under contract to the National
Health Service. A doctor may not normally have more than 3,500 patients;
the average number in Great Britain is about 2,300 and in Northern Ireland
2,150. Access to most other parts of the health service is obtained through the
family doctor.

Some 960 ophthalmic medical practitioners and about 7,080 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians are engaged in the general ophthalmic services which
provide for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Patients requiring
treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
There are over 13,800 dentists taking part in the health service.
There are about 10,700 retail pharmacies under contract to the National
Health Service with responsibility for the dispensing of prescriptions except
for the small number dispensed by hospital pharmacies and some family
doctors.
District nurses attend to people needing nursing at home or elsewhere outside
hospital. Although almost all babies are born in hospital, there is a domiciliary
service for mothers having their babies at home, midwives and family doctors
caring for mothers and babies after birth. Midwives also assist births in hos¬
pital. Health visitors are concerned with the health of the household as a whole
and provide services for families with young children and care for elderly
people; they take part in health education, assist in preventing ill-health,
and work closely with family doctors, district nurses and social workers.
Family doctors often work as members of health care teams with health visitors,
district nurses, and sometimes midwives or social workers. About four-fifths
are in partnership or group practices. About a fifth of the doctors in Great
Britain and almost a half in Northern Ireland work in nearly 1,000 modern
and well-equipped health centres built and maintained by the health authori¬
ties. Additional services at health centres may include child health clinics,
family planning, ante-natal care, dentistry, ophthalmic and pharmaceutical
services, chiropody and health education.
The hospital and specialist services include district general hospitals with
treatment and diagnostic facilities for in-patients, day-patients and out¬
patients, hospital maternity departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric
and geriatric facilities, rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all
forms of specialised treatment. A number of specialist hospitals for mentally
ill, mentally handicapped and elderly people are also provided. In the long
term the Government plans to replace the majority of mental illness hospitals
by facilities based on psychiatric units in district general hospitals. Mentally
handicapped people are cared for in hospital and in the community; it is long¬
term government policy to shift the emphasis from hospital to community care
but, where hospital treatment is required, it will be provided in small units near
to the patient’s own home. It is also government policy to provide more geriatric
beds in general hospitals, while elderly people needing longer term care will
increasingly be admitted to smaller community hospitals.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built in
the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’ and St. Bartholomew’s hospitals
in London. Much has been done to improve and extend existing hospitals,
some of which are housed in inconvenient buildings, and many new
hospitals have been or are being opened. The most recent development in hos¬
pital design is the ‘nucleus’ hospital of some 300 beds which will make a more
intensive use of space and facilities; it can be used either as the first stage of
a new hospital or as an extension of an existing hospital. Building work on
the first nucleus hospital began in 1978.

Rehabilitation

There are 2,700 NHS hospitals with nearly half a million beds and a
nursing and midwifery staff of about 425,000 (whole time equivalent). There
are 38,620 medical staff including over 14,260 consultants.
Rehabilitation is an important part of medical care beginning at the onset of
illness or injury and aimed at helping people to live as normally as possible.
Rehabilitation is especially important for elderly, disabled and mentally-ill
people who need such help in order to become self-sufficient. Facilities are
provided in the majority of hospitals and at special centres. The work is
carried out by teams of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts,
occupational therapists, speech therapists and social workers. The hospital
departments work closely with the Disablement Resettlement Service of the
Manpower Services Commission (the Department of Manpower Services in
Northern Ireland).
Medical services may include the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, wheel chairs, and other
appliances. Very severely physically handicapped patients may be issued with
electrical control equipment which enables them to operate devices such as
alarm bells, radio and television, a telephone, and heating. The controls are
operated by continuous depression of a microswitch or by sustained suction
through a pneumatic tube with a pipe-stem mouthpiece. Nursing aids for the
handicapped at home can be borrowed.
Local authority social workers, home helps and occupational therapists are
available to hospital patients who, because of their illness, have difficulties on
their return home.
Some 40 hospices provide care for the dying either directly in residential homes
or through the provision of nursing and other assistance in the patient’s own
home. About ten are financed entirely by the NHS; the remainder, most of
which receive support from public funds, are run by independent charitable
organisations. Control of symptoms and psychological support for the patient
and his family form the central features of hospice care. The hospice movement,
which is world-wide, originated in Britain.
Treatment for narcotic addiction is available at drug treatment clinics. Some
doctors are licensed by the Home Secretary to prescribe heroin and cocaine to
addicts (in Northern Ireland licensing is the responsibility of the Department
of Health and Social Services). Doctors do not require a licence to prescribe
methadone and other controlled drugs to addicts, but all doctors must notify
the Home Office of any patient they consider to be addicted to certain con¬
trolled drugs.
Hospital services have treatment for drug misusers including accident and
emergency services for people who take overdoses. Several voluntary bodies
organise rehabilitation facilities including accommodation, day centres and
counselling. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs advises ministers
on measures to prevent the misuse of dangerous drugs or to deal with the social
problems connected with their misuse.
Treatment is provided for alcoholics as part of the general psychiatric service.
In the National Health Service there are some 23 specialised treatment units
as well as a day hospital. Three experimental detoxification centres are being
sponsored by the Department of Health and Social Security. Closely linked
with treatment are community services (including those provided by voluntary
organisations) covering prevention, advice and rehabilitation.

Special preventive health services, including free dental care, are available for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. A feature of the service is
the education of parents before and after the birth by means of talks, dis¬
cussion groups, demonstrations and classes. Very young children are tested
for vision, hearing, speech and language deficiencies so that any handicap
can be identified. Family planning advice and help is provided at many
clinics and welfare foods (dried milk and vitamins) are distributed from them.
Sick children are treated at home or in hospital as out- or day-patients. If
admission to hospital is necessary, the Government encourages health authori¬
ties to accommodate them in children’s departments staffed by paediatricians
and specially trained nurses.
The school health service, which is part of the National Health Service,
organises health surveillance of school children including medical inspection
and dental inspection and treatment where appropriate. The staff of the school
health service work closely with local education authorities in the medical
assessment of handicapped children thought to need special attention.
Child guidance facilities provide help and advice concerning children with
psychological or emotional problems. These are run by local social services
and education authorities and by the health authorities. In Scotland child
guidance clinics are run by education authorities.
Free family planning facilities are available to everyone through family plan¬
ning clinics, hospitals and a domiciliary service. Most family doctors provide
a similar service for women only.
Under the Abortion Act 1967 termination of a pregnancy may take place if two
registered doctors think that its continuance would involve a greater risk to the
life of the pregnant woman (or of injury to her physical or mental health or
that of any existing children in the family) than if the pregnancy were ended.
Termination may also be allowed if the two doctors think that there is a sub¬
stantial risk of the child being born with severe physical or mental abnormali¬
ties. Abortions may be carried out in National Health Service hospitals or in
premises officially approved for the purpose. The Department of Health and
Social Security has issued guidance on counselling women with unwanted
pregnancies. The Abortion Act does not apply in Northern Ireland.
The blood transfusion service has more than 2 million voluntary blood donors.
There are 19 regional transfusion centres in Britain recruiting donors and
organising donor sessions in towns and villages, factories and offices, and in
establishments maintained by the armed forces. Donors must be between the
ages of 18 and 65. The regional centres are also responsible for blood grouping
and testing, maintaining blood banks, providing a consultant service to
hospitals, teaching in medical schools, and instructing doctors, nurses and
technicians. There are four central laboratories which prepare blood products
and undertake research.
Where necessary on medical grounds, free transport by ambulance is provided
by the health authorities. The work of the ambulance service falls into two
categories: emergency work dealing with sudden illness, urgent maternity
cases, and accidents of all kinds; and non-urgent work providing transport for
people needing out-patient treatment at hospitals, clinics and day hospitals.
The London Ambulance Service is probably the largest of its kind in the
world, catering for eight million residents and non-residents in an area of
120

PROFESSIONS
1,580 sq km (610 sq m). It uses over 1,000 vehicles at 85 ambulance stations and
has a staff of 2,700. On an average day it receives 1,500 emergency calls (one
call every minute) and carries out 7,000 non-urgent patient journeys.
In some areas the ambulance service is augmented by volunteers using their
own cars.
Health education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is promoted by the
Health Education Council which assists in the development of programmes of
health education with the health authorities, professional organisations, volun¬
tary bodies and industry. Central health education services in Scotland are
organised by the Scottish Health Education Unit, which is part of the Common
Services Agency. Major themes of publicity campaigns are the encouragement
of family planning, correct diet and exercise, and warnings against cigarette
smoking and excessive consumption of alcoholic drink. Although expenditure
for health education is met largely from central government funds, the Health
Education Council is free to determine its own priorities and programme.
Within the National Health Service, medical officers advise health authorities
on health education, and specialist officers have executive responsibility.
Under the Medicines Act 1968, which came into force in 1971 and applies to
the whole of the United Kingdom, the health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for licensing the manufacture, marketing and importation of
medicines for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission advises
the ministers on policy regarding medicines and a Committee on Safety of
Medicines advises the health ministers on the safety, efficacy and quality of
new medicines and monitors adverse drug reactions. A review of medicines
on the market began in 1975, the health ministers being advised by the Com¬
mittee on the Review of Medicines. The Act also controls the advertising,
labelling, packaging, distribution, sale and supply of medicines.
Only people whose names are on the medical and dental registers may prac¬
tise as doctors and dentists in the National Health Service. Registration as a
doctor requires five or six years’ training in medical school and hospital, with an
additional year’s experience in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years at a
dental school are required. The governing body of the medical profession is the
General Medical Council and that of the dentists is the General Dental Council.
The British Medical Association is the doctors’ main professional association;
that of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a nurse is normally three years. Training may be in general, sick children’s,
mental or mental subnormality nursing. An enrolled nurse takes a two-year
course. The examining bodies of the nursing profession in England and Wales
and in Scotland are the general nursing councils. Midwives in England and
Wales and in Scotland must have the certificate of the appropriate Midwives
Board. The examining body for nurses and midwives in Northern Ireland is
the Northern Ireland Council of Nurses and Midwives. Most pupil midwives
are already registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the
two-year midwifery training period is reduced to one year and for other
registered and enrolled nurses to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing
and the Royal College of Midwives are the professional bodies for nurses and
midwives. Health visitors are registered general nurses who have undergone
at least the first part of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing before taking
a year’s course in health visiting, promoted by the Council for the Education

and Training of Health Visitors. District nurses are state registered or state
enrolled nurses, the majority of whom have undertaken additional training.
A retail or hospital pharmacist must have his or her name entered in the
register maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, the
governing body of the profession, or, in Northern Ireland, in the register of
the Department of Health and Social Services. Four years’ academic study and
practical training are necessary for registration. The dispensing of all medicines
on doctors’ prescriptions and sale of certain specified medicines can be carried
out only by, or under the supervision of, a registered pharmacist. Under the
Opticians Act 1958 the General Optical Council regulates the professions of
ophthalmic optician and dispensing optician; only registered ophthalmic
opticians (or registered medical practitioners) may test sight. Training of
ophthalmic opticians takes four years including a year of practical experience
under supervision. Dispensing opticians may take a two-year full-time course
with a year’s practical experience or a part-time day-release course while
employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists,
radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards,
corresponding to the eight professions, under the general supervision of the
Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. A professional training
lasting two to four years is needed to qualify for registration. Only members of
those professions who are state registered may be employed in the National
Health Service and some other public services.
Dental auxiliaries (who have undergone a two-year training course) and
dental hygienists (who have undergone a training course of about a year) may
carry out some simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
Britain has special health arrangements with other member states of the
European Community under which most United Kingdom nationals are
entitled to receive urgent medical treatment in another Community country
on the same basis as insured nationals of that country. There are also reciprocal
arrangements with some other countries.
Though practically all residents in Britain use the National Health Service, a
number of people sometimes prefer to pay for private consultations and treat¬
ment. Among the major users are the families of subscribers to the provident
schemes which make provision for private health care in return for annual
subscriptions. It is the Government’s policy to phase out private facilities from
National Health Service hospitals, but patients will remain free to seek
medical treatment, and doctors to practise, in private hospitals or nursing
homes. Some of these are run by charitable institutions.
Environmental health officers employed by local authorities are responsible
for the control of air pollution and noise, the inspection of offices, the investi¬
gation of unfit housing, and refuse collection and disposal. Doctors who
specialise in community medicine and are employed by the health authorities
advise local authorities on the medical aspects of environmental health. They
may also assist the water authorities responsible for water supply and
sewerage.
Environmental health officers are also stationed at ports and airports where
they carry out a range of duties concerned with shipping, inspection of imported
foods and disease control.

CONTROL OF
INFECTIOUS
DISEASES
In Northern Ireland district councils are responsible for noise control, collec¬
tion and disposal of refuse, clean air, and food composition, labelling and
hygiene.
It is illegal to sell food which is injurious to health, unfit for human consump¬
tion, or not of the nature, substance or quality demanded. In England and
Wales the composition, labelling and description of food are the concern of
food and drugs authorities (county councils, London borough councils and the
City of London Corporation) while food hygiene and the safety and fitness of
food are the concern of district councils, London borough councils and port
health authorities. Premises where food or drink is prepared, handled, stored
or sold must conform to certain hygiene standards. Environmental health
officers may take for analysis or for bacteriological or other examination samples
of any food on sale for human consumption. There are special regulations
controlling the safety of particular foods such as milk, meat and ice-cream. The
Department of Health and Social Security, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Welsh Office are the central departments responsible
for giving advice and making regulations. Expert committees of these depart¬
ments periodically review regulations dealing with food.
In Scotland regional and islands councils are responsible for food standards
and labelling, and district and islands councils for food hygiene. District
councils in Northern Ireland are responsible for food hygiene, food standards
and labelling.
The health authorities have general responsibility for the prevention of disease
and co-operate with the local authority environmental health services. The
area health authorities and health boards carry out programmes of vaccination
and immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (females only),
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. Although vaccina¬
tion is voluntary, the Government encourages parents to obtain protection for
their children from these diseases.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory at
Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection of
Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms. In addition it
has a surveillance centre, opened in 1977, which investigates and monitors
human communicable diseases. In Scotland bacteriological work is done
mainly in hospital laboratories. In Northern Ireland a central public health
laboratory shares the bacteriological work with hospital laboratories.
PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES
Responsibility for personal social services rests with the social services authori¬
ties (local authority social services departments in England and Wales, social
work departments in Scotland and health and social services boards in Northern
Ireland). Many of their services are directed towards the same groups of
people needing health services, for example, many elderly or disabled people.
Other groups helped are young families with social problems, children deprived
of a normal home life, the mentally disordered and young offenders. Close
co-operation is maintained between local authority social services departments
and health authorities. In Scotland local authorities also undertake duties
SOCIAL WELFARE
123
similar to those of the separate probation and after-care service in England
and Wales (see p 89).
The Personal Social Services Council advises ministers on policy issues and
provides information and advice to all concerned with the personal social
services in England and Wales, based on research projects or inquiries
sponsored by the council. Its members are from local government, voluntary,
educational and research bodies, and professional organisations. There is
cross-representation with the Central Health Services Council and the Central
Council for Education and Training in Social Work. Finance comes from
central and local government. In Scotland there is an Advisory Council on
Social Work and in Northern Ireland a Central Personal Social Services
Advisory Committee. Advice on health and personal social services for
children in England and Wales is given by the Children’s Joint Committee;
its members are nominated by the Central Health Services Council, the
Personal Social Services Council, and the Secretaries of State for Social
Services and Wales.

Social services authorities have a duty to provide social services for handi¬
capped people. In Great Britain they are required to ascertain the number of
handicapped people in their area and to publicise services. A wide range of
facilities may be available including advice on personal and social problems
arising from disability, assistance in overcoming the effects of disability,
adaptations to people’s homes (such as fitting ramps, ground floor toilets and
grab rails) and various aids to living. In certain circumstances a telephone or a
television set may be installed. Other facilities include social and occupational
clubs, residential homes and the organisation of outings and holidays. In
addition some authorities make arrangements for the teaching of handicrafts
and other occupations. Voluntary organisations also provide services for dis¬
abled people.
Help available from other sources includes social security, medical treatment,
special education, employment and training services and specially designed
housing and means of access to public buildings.
Services for elderly people are provided by statutory and voluntary bodies to
help them to live at home for as long as possible. These may include the
advice and help of social workers, domestic help, delivery of cooked meals,
sitters-in, night attendants and laundry services as well as day centres, clubs
and recreational workshops. In many areas ‘good neighbour’ and friendly
visiting services are arranged by the local authority or a voluntary organisation.
Social services authorities also provide residential accommodation for the
elderly and infirm and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisa¬
tions or privately. The newer homes usually have accommodation for 30 to 50
residents. About 2,500 homes for elderly people are provided by local authori¬
ties in England which house about i’5 per cent of the population over the age
of 65. There are similar homes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Local authorities, as part of their responsibility for public housing, build
flats specially designed for elderly people; some of these blocks have resident
wardens. Housing associations also build this type of accommodation.
Social services authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping the
mentally ill or mentally handicapped in the community, and for prevention and
after-care services. Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness,
which enable patients either to be treated at home or to be discharged from
124
Help to Families

hospital more quickly provided support is available in the community, are
adding to demands for these services and particularly for social work support.
Arrangements include training centres for the mentally handicapped, day
centres for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and a variety of residential
care for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped of all ages. Social workers
help patients and their families to deal with social problems arising from mental
illness or handicap and can arrange compulsory admission (on a medical
recommendation) of mentally disordered people to hospital in certain
circumstances.
Social services authorities, through their own social workers or a voluntary
organisation, make available help and advice to families facing special problems.
The home help service provides practical assistance at home for sick and
disabled people, elderly people and expectant mothers.
Some authorities make direct provision for the special needs of unmarried
mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work done by
voluntary organisations and other bodies.
Social services authorities are responsible for child care. This includes the
provision of day care for children under five, often with special social or health
needs, in day nurseries and part-time nursery groups, voluntary and private
day nurseries (registered with the local authority), and play groups.
The authorities have a duty to offer advice, guidance and assistance to
families in difficulties in order to promote the welfare of children. The aim is
to intervene at an early stage to diminish the need to receive children into care
or bring them before a juvenile court.
Cases of child abuse are the concern of health and local authorities which
have established joint area review committees to represent the views of the pro¬
fessions and agencies and to agree on local policies and practices for handling
these cases.
Authorities have a duty to receive into their care any child under the age of 17
who has no parent or guardian or who has been abandoned or whose parents
are unable to provide for him if they are satisfied that such intervention is in
the interests of the child. The child remains in care until he is 18 years old unless
discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends before that time.
When taking a decision on a child in care, the authorities have to give first
consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child.
Where children are in care, efforts are made to work with their families in order,
where appropriate, to enable the child to return home.
Children in England and Wales may be brought before a juvenile court if
they are neglected or ill-treated, exposed to moral danger, beyond the control
of parents, not attending school or (if ten years or over) have committed
an offence. At the same time it must be shown that the child is in need of
care or control which he is unlikely to receive unless a care or other relevant
order is made by the court. Local authorities are responsible for undertaking,
through social workers, inquiries and consultations with parents, schools and
the police. A child may be committed to the care of a local authority under a care
order if the juvenile court is satisfied that he is in need of care or control. As an
alternative the court may issue a supervision order for a period of up to three
years. Supervision is carried out by a social worker or a probation officer.
In Northern Ireland the court may send the child to a training school (see
p 93), commit him to the care of a fit person (which may include a health and
social services board) or make a supervision order.

In Scotland children in trouble (see p 93) or in need may be brought before a
children’s hearing which can impose a supervision requirement on a child if it
thinks that compulsory measures of care are appropriate. Under these require¬
ments most children are allowed to remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker but some may be sent to a residential establishment while under
supervision. Supervision requirements are reviewed at intervals of not more
than one year until terminated by a children’s hearing.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home is not
the most suitable place for a child or if one cannot be found for him, he may
be placed in a children’s home, a voluntary home or other suitable residential
accommodation. Community homes for children in care in England and
Wales comprise local authority and voluntary children’s homes and com¬
munity homes with education on the premises which provide long-term care
usually for the more difficult children. In Scotland local authorities are
responsible for placing children in their care either in foster homes, in local
authority or voluntary homes, or in residential schools. In Northern Ireland
there are residential homes for children in the care of the health and social
services boards, although training schools and remand homes are administered
separately.
Regulations regarding conduct of community homes and registered volun¬
tary homes and the boarding out of children in care are made by central
government.
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a valuable part in this work. Children’s homes run by voluntary
organisations are subject to inspection by social work service officers of the
central government.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own
homes include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units.
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its
Scottish counterpart maintain inspectors and visitors to investigate reported
cruelty or neglect.
Adoption of children is strictly regulated by legislation and some 12,000
adoption orders were made in England and Wales in 1977 and 1,600 in
Scotland; the Registrars General keep confidential registers of adopted
children. Local authorities have the power to act as adoption agencies and
eventually will be obliged to offer such a service. Adoption societies (over 55
societies arrange adoptions) must be registered with their local authority.
Adoptions of minors under the laws of most European and Commonwealth
countries are recognised but this does not confer British citizenship on the
adopted person.
The effective operation of the social services is largely dependent upon the
availability of professionally qualified social workers trained in the methods of
social work. Training courses in social work are provided by universities, poly¬
technics and colleges of further education; their length depends upon previous
educational qualifications and can last from one to four years. The Central
Council for Education and Training in Social Work recognises social work
courses and offers advice to people considering entry to the profession.
Professional social workers (including those working in the National Health
Service) are employed by social services authorities. Others work in voluntary
126

organisations or in the probation service (see p 89). Not all social workers
employed by social services authorities are professionally qualified, but efforts
are being made to increase the number of trained personnel.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries insurance, child benefit, family income
supplement, supplementary benefits, and war pensions constitute a compre¬
hensive system of social security. The payment of many benefits depends on
prior payments to the national insurance scheme, while others are available
without contribution conditions. The former are paid from the national
insurance fund consisting of contributions from employed people and their
employers, self-employed people and the Government. Non-contributory
benefits are financed from general taxation revenue. Two or more benefits
cannot normally be paid for the same set of circumstances.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers these services in
Great Britain; within the department, the Supplementary Benefits Commission
is responsible for the system of supplementary benefits. In Northern Ireland
the Department of Health and Social Services administers social security
with the exception of supplementary benefits which are provided through the
Supplementary Benefits Commission for Northern Ireland. Pensions and
welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants are the responsibility
of the Department of Health and Social Security throughout the United King¬
dom. Appeals relating to claims for the various benefits are decided by
independent tribunals.
A series of Acts in the 1940s established a comprehensive social security
system which became operative in July 1948. Benefits were flat-rate but as the
level of earnings rose in the 1950s and the 1960s the gap between earnings and
benefits tended to widen. In the 1960s, therefore, a modest earnings-related
addition to retirement pension was started based on graduated contributions;
this principle was extended to unemployment and sickness benefit and, later
in 1975, to maternity allowance. In the 1970s new benefits have included
better pension arrangements for widows, pensions for people aged 80 and
over who have not qualified for a national insurance retirement pension, and
more benefits for disabled people (see p I3°)- The most important advance
since the 1940s is the new earnings-related state pension scheme providing
improved retirement, widows’, widowers’ and invalidity pensions.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Employees and
Employers
Class 1 contributions are earnings-related and cover the employee for retire¬
ment pension, sickness and invalidity benefits, unemployment benefit,
maternity benefits, widows’ benefits, and death grant. Earnings-related
supplements to sickness and unemployment benefit and maternity allowance
are also covered. Industrial injuries benefits, although non-contributory, are
payable from the national insurance fund. Additional payments are made for
dependants.
The contribution paid by the employee varies; if he is not a member of a
‘contracted-out’ occupational pension scheme run by his employers (see p
128), his contribution is 6‘5 per cent of earnings up to ^120 a week (the upper
earnings limit) provided that these earnings are at least j£i7‘5° l°wer
earnings limit). The employer pays 10 per cent of the same earnings range.
If the employee is a member of a ‘contracted-out’ occupational pension
scheme, a lower Class 1 contribution is payable, namely 6-5 per cent of earnings
up to the lower earnings limit and 4 per cent of earnings between the two

limits; the employer’s contribution is 10 per cent and 5-5 per cent respectively
Contributions are collected through the ‘Pay As You Earn’ income tax
system. The employer also pays to the Exchequer a national insurance sur¬
charge of 3-5 per cent of the earnings range for each of his employees (see
P 342)-
Self-employed people pay a flat-rate Class 2 contribution of £i'go a week and
a Class 4 contribution amounting to 5 per cent of net profits or gains between
£2,000 and £6,250 a year. Self-employed contributors receive basic retire¬
ment pension (see below) and the same benefits as employees with the excep¬
tion of unemployment benefit, earnings-related supplements, and industrial
injuries benefits.
Certain married women and widows retain the right to pay Class 1 contribu¬
tions at the reduced rate of 2 per cent when employed and to pay no Class 2
contributions when self-employed. This right is being phased out and is
retained only by those entitled to it at 5 April 1978. Reduced contributions do
not count for the purposes of benefit. The employer’s contribution is not
affected.
Voluntary Class 3 contributions of £i-8o are payable by people wanting to
safeguard rights to some benefits. Class 3 (and Class 2) contributions are paid
by stamping a national insurance card or by direct debit of a bank or National
Girobank account.
Some people do not have to pay contributions. Employees who continue
working after pensionable age (60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay
contributions though the employer remains liable. People earning less than
the lower earnings limit are not liable for contributions, neither are their
employers. Self-employed people with earnings below £950 a year and those
over pensionable age may be excused payment of contributions.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before
benefit can be paid at all, certain contributions have to be paid; secondly, the
full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless contributions have been paid or
credited up to a specific level over a specified period. There are special rules
to help a widow who does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widow¬
hood or when her children have grown up, to qualify for sickness, unemploy¬
ment or maternity benefit in the period before she can have established or
re-established herself in insurance through her own contributions; there are
also provisions to help a divorced woman who was not paying contributions
during her marriage. The main benefits (payable weekly) are summarised
below. The rates quoted are those effective from November 1978; allowances
for children include child benefit.
Social security benefits are reviewed every year and increased if their value
has fallen through inflation. Long-term benefits, such as basic retirement
pension, are linked with percentage increases in average earnings or retail
prices, whichever is the higher. Short-term benefits like sickness or unem¬
ployment benefit are tied to percentage increases in retail prices.
A state retirement pension is payable to women at the age of 60 and to men
at the age of 65. The weekly rate of basic pension is £19-50 for men and
128

Allowance
women qualifying on their own contributions and £1170 for a woman
qualifying on her husband’s contributions. In 1978 the new state pension
scheme came into operation and will mature fully after 20 years of
contributions; the retirement pension will consist of the basic pension
plus an additional pension of 25 per cent of earnings between the lower
earnings limit and the upper earnings limit (see p 126). If there are fewer than
20 years’ contributions, a proportionate rate of additional pension will be pay¬
able, that is 1-25 per cent of earnings between the earnings limits for each year
of contributions paid under the scheme.
Employers are free to ‘contract-out’ their employees from the state scheme
for additional pension and provide their own occupational pension in its place
provided that the latter is at least as good as the state additional pension. The
State remains responsible for the basic pension. Lower national insurance
contributions are payable if contracting-out takes place.
Rights to basic pension are safeguarded for mothers who are away from
work looking after children or for people giving up work to care for severely
disabled relatives. Women contributors receive the same pension as men with
the same earnings.
A small pension is also payable to those people who contributed to the state
graduated pension scheme which operated between 1961 and 1975-
Basic pension is protected against inflation by annual increases. It is raised in
line with average percentage increases in earnings or prices, whichever is the
higher. Additional pension will be calculated by revaluing earnings in line
with the general movement of earnings, and any pension awarded will keep
up with the average percentage increase in retail prices. Since 1978 the small
graduated pension has been protected against inflation.
In real terms the value of the retirement pension for a married couple has
more than doubled since 1948.
A non-contributory retirement pension of ^ii-95 for a man, single woman
or widow and for a married woman (including an age addition of 25P)
is payable to people over the age of 80 who have not qualified for a contribu¬
tory pension or who qualified for one at a lowTer rate than the non-contributory
pension. The age addition is also paid to all other pensioners aged over 80.
A maternity grant of £25 is payable for each living child born and for a still¬
born child if the pregnancy lasts for at least 28 weeks. Maternity allowance is
^15-75 a week and is payable normally from 11 weeks before the expected
week of confinement until the sixth week following the birth. The allowance
is payable only to working women who have paid full Class 1 or Class 2
contributions. An earnings-related supplement may also be payable.
The non-contributory child benefit is the main social security benefit for
children. The April 1979 rate is £4 for each child (£6 for the first child of
single-parent families). Income tax allowances for children are being phased
out gradually and their value transferred to child benefit which is tax free and
payable to the mother. Benefit is payable for children up to the age of 16 and
for those up to the age of 19 if they continue in full-time education: benefit is
not payable if the young person is taking a degree, teacher training or any
other advanced course or if the education is sponsored by an employer.
A contributory child’s special allowance of £9*35 for each child, inclusive of
child benefit, is payable to a mother on the death of a former husband if the
marriage was dissolved or annulled and if the husband was contributing to the
support of the children.

A non-contributory guardian’s allowance of ^9'35, inclusive of child benefit, is
payable to someone who takes an orphaned child into his or her family, pro¬
vided that one of the dead parents satisfied a residence condition and that the
claimant is entitled to child benefit for the child.
Additions for children are payable with widows’, sickness, unemployment and
other benefits.
A contributory widow’s allowance is payable for the first 26 weeks of widow¬
hood at the rate of ^27-30 plus ^9-35 for each child, inclusive of child benefit.
An earnings-related supplement may also be payable. After this a widowed
mother receives a widowed mother’s allowance of ^19-50 plus ^9’35 for each
child, inclusive of child benefit. Widow’s pension is payable to a widow who is
40 years or over when her husband dies or when her entitlement to widowed
mother’s allowance ends; the rates payable range from £5-85 for widows of 40
to f°r widows of 50 or over. Payment continues irrespective of earnings
until the widow remarries or begins drawing retirement pension.
Under the new state pension scheme widow’s pension and widowed mother’s
allowance will consist of a basic pension and an additional pension earned by
the deceased husband’s contribution. If the widow is aged between 40 and 50
when widowed (or when her children have grown up), she gets part of the
additional pension.
A man whose wife dies when they are both over pension age will be able to
inherit his wife’s pension rights just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
There are also benefits for widows under the industrial injuries scheme (see
p 130). A pension of ^27-30 is payable for the first 26 weeks of widowhood. A
widow may also receive an earnings-related addition if sufficient Class 1
contributions have been paid by the deceased husband on earnings in excess
of the lower earnings limit in the relevant tax year. Thereafter, she can receive
a pension of £20-05 a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her husband’s
death, or has dependent children or fulfils certain other conditions; otherwise,
she receives £5-85 a week. If she had been living apart from her husband, a
pension is payable only if she was receiving or entitled to receive at least
£0-25 a week for her maintenance from him.
In addition allowances are paid for children under the child benefit age
limits. For widows they are £9-35 for each child inclusive of child benefit.
Other beneficiaries receive £4-85.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be en¬
titled to pensions, allowances or gratuities.
There is a large variety of benefits for people unable to work because of sick¬
ness or disablement.
Contributory sickness benefit of £15-75 a week is payable for 28 weeks. There
are allowances of £9-75 for a wife or other adult dependant and £4-85 for each
child inclusive of child benefit. An earnings-related supplement may be pay¬
able for up to six months but total benefit (including the flat-rate benefit)
cannot exceed 85 per cent of the reckonable wTeekly earnings on which the
supplement is based.
Invalidity pension is £19-50 plus £11-70 for a wife and £9-35 for a child, inclu-
‘ sive of child benefit, and is payable when sickness benefit ends if the beneficiary

is still incapable of work. An invalidity allowance (ranging from £1-30 to £4-15
according to age) is paid with the pension to those people who become sick
more than five years before retirement age.
Under the new pension scheme, invalidity pension will be replaced by a
basic pension and an additional earnings-related pension calculated in the
same way as the new retirement pension.
Various benefits are payable for injury or disablement caused by an accident at
work or a prescribed disease.
Injury benefit for an adult is £18-50 a week plus £9-75 for an adult depen¬
dant and £4-85 for each child, inclusive of child benefit. It is paid when the
employed earner is incapable of work and payment can continue for a maxi¬
mum of 26 weeks beginning on the date of the accident or development of the
disease. A person entitled to sickness benefit who draws injury benefit instead,
also receives an earnings-related supplement (see p 129).
When injury benefit ceases disablement benefit may be paid if, as the result
of the industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a loss of physical or
mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the disablement as
assessed by a medical board; it varies from £31-90 a week for 100 per cent
disablement to £6-38 for 20 per cent disablement, but for disablement of less
than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement at the weekly rate of £i9,5°; invalidity
allowance according to age (see above); constant attendance allowance of up to
£12-70 a week normally, or up to £25-40 in exceptionally severe cases; an
allowance of £12-70 a week payable in addition to constant attendance
allowance in certain cases of exceptionally severe disablement; a special
hardship allowance of up to £12-76 for a person who is unfit to return to his
regular job or to do work of an equivalent standard; and hospital treatment
allowance which raises the disablement benefit to that for a 100 per cent
assessment during hospital treatment for the industrial injury. Increases of
disablement benefit for dependants may be payable with unemployability
supplement. There are benefits for widows and their children (see p 129).
An attendance allowance of £15-60 is paid to severely disabled people requiring
a great deal of attention by day and at night. A lower rate of £10-40 may be
paid to those who need help either by day or at night. A non-contributory
invalidity pension of £11-70 is payable to people of working age unable to
work and not qualifying for the national insurance invalidity pension; it is also
payable to disabled housewives incapable of work and unable to perform their
normal household tasks.
A weekly invalid care allowance of £ 11 -70 is payable to people (aged between
16 and pension age) who cannot go out to work because they are caring for a
severely disabled relative receiving an attendance allowance.
Physically disabled people unable to walk may be entitled to a mobility
allowance of £10 a week to help pay their transport costs. The allowance is
intended for people aged between 5 and 65 (males) or 5 and 60 (females). At
present the age group 5-58 is covered. An independent organisation called
Motability assists those disabled drivers and disabled passengers wanting to
use their mobility allowance to rent a vehicle.
Unemployment benefit at the same rate as sickness benefit (see p 129) is
payable for up to 312 days (not counting Sundays) in any one spell of unem¬
ployment; periods which are 13 weeks or less apart count as one spell.

Earnings-related supplement may be payable on the same basis as that for
sickness benefit. Anyone claiming unemployment benefit has to be registered
for employment at a local office of the Manpower Services Commission (in
Northern Ireland the Department of Manpower Services) which helps
people to find jobs.
A death grant is payable on the death of a contributor or a contributor’s near
relative. It is normally £30 for an adult and a smaller sum for a child.
Every person aged 16 or over who is not in full-time work and who does not
have enough money to live on may be entitled to supplementary benefit. It is
not awarded to people attending school or for the requirements of people in¬
volved in a trade dispute (dependants of strikers, however, are covered). In
Northern Ireland a residence condition must also be satisfied. The benefit
takes the form of a supplementary allowance for people under the minimum
retirement age, and a supplementary pension for those over. The benefit is the
amount by which a person’s needs exceed his available resources, both being
defined by rules approved by Parliament. The calculation of needs is based on
different amounts for single people and family groups (for blind people there
are special higher amounts) with, in each case an addition for rent. A higher
long-term scale is used for retirement pensioners and for people under
pension age who have received supplementary benefit for more than two years
without having to sign on for work. Additions can be made for special dietary
or heating requirements. A single payment of benefit may be made to meet an
exceptional need. When resources are calculated, most social security benefits
are taken into account in full. Part of most other income including part-time
earnings, disablement benefit and war widow’s pension is ignored, as is the
capital value of an owner occupied house or capital resources of less than
£1.250.
The payment of a supplementary allowance to an able-bodied person
of working age may be conditional on registering for employment at an
unemployment benefit office of the Department of Employment or, in North¬
ern Ireland, the Department of Manpower Services. The supplementary
benefits scheme is administered by a Supplementary Benefits Commission
within the Department of Health and Social Security and there is a similar
commission in Northern Ireland.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence people
without a settled way of living to lead a more normal life. It provides temporary
accommodation for them in 21 reception centres, one of which is administered
by a local authority on its behalf. For men who have been unemployed for long
periods and who are receiving supplementary allowances, it runs 17 re-estab¬
lishment centres, three of which have residential accommodation, where they
are given help to fit them again for work. These provisions do not apply in
Northern Ireland.
Family income supplement is a cash benefit for families (including single
parents) with small incomes where the head of the family is in full-time
work and there is at least one dependent child. It is payable when the gross
weekly income of a family falls below a prescribed amount, fixed at £46 a
week where there is one child plus £4 for each additional child. The weekly
rate of the supplement is half the difference between the family’s income and
the prescribed amount up to a maximum of £10-50 for a one-child family and
this is increased by £1 for each additional child.

The war pensions scheme is administered throughout the United Kingdom
by the Department of Health and Social Security. Pensions are payable to
people disabled as a result of service in the armed forces or from injuries
received in the merchant navy or civil defence during war-time.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier is
£31-90 a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of dis¬
ablement. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic
pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones
being for unemployability (^20-75 a week), constant attendance (up to £12-70
and, exceptionally, £25-40 a week), comforts (£2-70 or £5-40 a week), and
lowered standard of occupation (up to £12-76 a week). An age allowance
(between £2-20 and £6-8o a week) is payable to disabled pensioners who are
aged over 65 or over and whose assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate of
pension for widows of private soldiers is £25-30 a week, with additional allow¬
ances for their children and, in certain cases, a rent allowance (up to £9-60 a
week). There is an additional allowance of £2-40 for widows aged 65 which is
increased to £4-80 at the age of 70. Parents or other relatives who were depen¬
dent on a person whose death resulted from service in the Forces may receive
pensions if they are in financial need.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service
for war pensioners, war widows and war orphans. It works in close co-operation
with many voluntary and ex-Service organisations who give financial aid and
personal help to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
Social security benefits (other than child, maternity, unemployment, sickness,
invalidity, injury or disablement benefit) are included in the taxable income
on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand various income tax
reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the support
of dependants. Supplementary benefit, family income supplement, attendance
allowances and war disablement pensions are not taxable.
Measures are taken to ensure that social security payments go only to those for
whom they are intended. Increased efforts are being made to cut down on
fraudulent claims, the number of prosecutions rising from 15,400 in 1975 to
26,000 in 1977; the conviction rate is about 98 per cent. The size of the prob¬
lem, however, remains small; as far as can be established, only £3-2 million was
identified in 1976-77 as lost through fraud—about £0-03 for every £100 paid
in benefits. The value of benefits unclaimed by people entitled to them is
believed to be very many times greater than that of the money lost by fraud.
In addition to payments provided under the social security legislation, there are
a number of other benefits for which people with low incomes may be eligible.
These include legal aid and assistance (see p 100), rent rebates and allowances
(see p 176), rate rebates (see p 66), exemption from health service charges (see
p 116) and free school meals (see p 143).
VOLUNTARY SERVICES
The State services are complemented by those provided by voluntary organi¬
sations and by individual volunteers. Voluntary organisations, especially the
churches, pioneered the development of many social services by providing
schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries and social and recreational clubs. How¬
ever, these facilities were not uniformly spread throughout the country and
did not cover everyone in need. Gradually the State accepted responsibility for
Voluntary
Organisations

the major services by developing a comprehensive structure to ensure a
minimum standard of living and well-being for the population.
State and voluntary social services work in co-operation. Central and local
government make grants to the voluntary agencies. Public authorities plan
and carry out their duties taking account of the work of voluntary organisa¬
tions. Local authorities and voluntary agencies provide residential care
for elderly, disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped people and for
children. It has been estimated that about 5 million people take part in some
voluntary work during the course of a year.
Co-ordination of government interests in voluntary social service through¬
out Britain is the responsibility of the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit.
The Volunteer Centre, a national centre for information and research on
voluntary work, was established in 1973 with the aid of a government grant.
There are many full-time and part-time local volunteer bureaux.
In England and Wales the Charity Commission, a Government agency, gives
free advice to trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their purposes or
facilitate their administration when necessary. It maintains central and local
registers of charities which are open to public inspection, and it investigates and
checks abuses, though it has no power to act in the administration of a charity.
There are thousands of voluntary organisations ranging from national bodies
to small individual local groups. Most are members of larger associations or
are represented on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees.
Some are chiefly concerned with giving personal service, others in the forma¬
tion of public opinion and exchange of information. Some carry out both
functions.
The main voluntary body in England which aims to provide central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies is the National Council of
Social Service, which brings together most of the principal voluntary agencies
for consultation and joint action, either as a whole or in groups of those con¬
cerned with particular aspects, such as youth work. There are also the Scottish
Council of Social Service, the Council for Social Service for Wales and the
Northern Ireland Council of Social Service, which perform similar functions.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems include the
voluntary family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Association, Family
Service Units, and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
Guidance Council; the National Council of Voluntary Child Care Organisa¬
tions; the National Council for One Parent Families; and the Samaritans, who
help people who are near to committing suicide.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people, particularly
those belonging to a number of national and local organisations, for example,
Community Service Volunteers, Task Force, Scouts, Girl Guides and school
groups.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled is given by—among others—the
British Red Cross Society, St. John Ambulance, the Women’s Royal Volun¬
tary Service and the Leagues of Hospital Friends. A number of societies
exist to help people with particular disabilities and difficulties. These societies
include the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal National
Institute for the Deaf, MIND (National Association for Mental Health), the
National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children, the Spastics Society,
Alcoholics Anonymous, Age Concern, Help the Aged and their equivalents
in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

National organisations whose social work is specifically religious in inspira¬
tion include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Commit¬
tee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England
Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work, the Young
Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the
Society of Friends, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish
Welfare Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, provides flatlets and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with
family problems and assists in hospitals and clinics, as well as doing relief work
in emergencies.
Some 710 Citizens’ Advice Bureaux give explanation and advice to the
citizen who is in doubt about his rights or who does not know about the
State or voluntary services which could help him. There are law centres and
housing advisory centres in some areas.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, one of the most comprehensive on this
subject in the world, makes discrimination between men and women unlawful
in employment, education, training and the provision of housing, goods, facili¬
ties and services. Discriminatory advertisements which breach the Act are also
unlawful. Sex discrimination is defined as treating a person less favourably
than another on the grounds of his or her sex. Northern Ireland has similar
legislation.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970 (and corresponding legislation in Northern
Ireland), women are entitled to equal pay with men when doing work that is
the same or broadly similar or work which has been given an equal value under
a job evaluation scheme.
The Equal Opportunities Commission assists in the enforcement of both
Acts and promotes equal opportunities between the sexes. There is a separate
commission in Northern Ireland.
Employers must not discriminate against a man or woman because of his or
her sex. This applies to recruitment, promotion, the provision of benefits,
dismissals and training. It is also unlawful for employers to discriminate against
a person on grounds of marriage. There are a limited number of exceptions in¬
cluding employment in private households and employment in jobs where a
person’s sex is a ‘genuine occupational qualification’, such as acting. Employers
of not more than five people are exempt from the Act.
Co-educational schools, colleges and universities may not discriminate in
the provision of facilities or in their admissions. Single sex establishments are
permissible, however, and there are arrangements for such institutions to
move gradually towards co-education if they wish.
It is unlawful to discriminate against a man or a woman in the sale or letting
of land, houses, flats and business premises. The law applies equally to public
and private housing, furnished and unfurnished. The Act does not apply to
lettings in a small dwelling occupied by the landlord or a near relative.
Discrimination is also unlawful in the provision of goods, facilities and
services. For example, banks, building societies or finance companies must not
refuse to give credit, mortgages or loans to women on the same terms as would
be applied to men. Exceptions include services provided in certain special
care establishments such as hospitals; places used for religious purposes

matters where risk is assessed on reliable actuarial or other data.
It is unlawful to publish or place advertisements which contravene the Sex
Discrimination Act whether for jobs, goods, facilities or services.
Complaints of discrimination may be brought before the county courts in
England and Wales or the sheriff courts in Scotland, except for complaints
concerning employment which are dealt with by industrial tribunals (see
p 324). Complaints concerning State educational establishments must first
be made to the relevant Secretary of State before they can be brought before
a court. Only the Equal Opportunities Commission is responsible for handling
complaints about discriminatory advertisements and can bring proceedings in
matters concerning advertising. Where necessary, legal advice or assistance,
or legal aid if the case is taken to court, are available for complainants with
low incomes (see p 100). Legal aid is not available for industrial tribunal cases
but applicants can receive advice and assistance.
The Equal Opportunities Commission helps to enforce the Sex Discrimination
Act and the Equal Pay Act. Its roles are to eliminate sex discrimination and to
promote equal opportunities. The Commission advises people of their rights
under both Acts, and in certain circumstances, may give financial help or
assist individuals to prepare and conduct a case before a court or tribunal. It
may also attempt to secure a settlement. The Commission has power to conduct
formal investigations and, if satisfied that practices are unlawful, it can issue
non-discrimination notices requiring that discriminatory practices cease. For
certain formal investigations, the Commission has the power to require a
person to give information and to attend hearings to give evidence. In
addition it reviews the workings of both Acts and may submit proposals for
amending them to the Home Secretary.
RACE RELATIONS
After the 1950s considerable numbers of people entered Britain from Com¬
monwealth countries in the West Indies, Asia and Africa to take up employ¬
ment, many with the intention of settling permanently, and they make an
important contribution to the economy and the public services. In 1977 the
population of New Commonwealth1 and Pakistani ethnic origin was estimated
at some i'8 million (about 3-4 per cent of the total population) of whom 40
per cent were born in Britain. Nearly three-quarters live in the south-east
and the west Midlands. Although, as Commonwealth citizens, they enjoy full
political and civic rights, many suffer from social and economic disadvantages.
This can partly be attributed to the fact that many initially lack the skills
needed in an industrial society and occupy low-status jobs in poor environ¬
ments of the older towns. Another factor, the extent of which is difficult to
determine, is that of racial discrimination.
The difficulties experienced by residents of the older inner city areas are
being alleviated by continuous social programmes which benefit the whole
community and others which are directed at areas of special social need.
Additional teachers have been appointed to schools with ethnic minorities and

ing, therefore, people from Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar.

Race Relations
Act
Commission for
Racial Equality
government grants are available to local authorities with substantial ethnic
minority groups towards the salaries of extra staff, such as interpreters, health
visitors and helpers in schools and community homes. Language teaching is
recognised to be of prime importance in schools and schemes arranged for
adults include classes at their place of work and language groups run by
voluntary organisations. The welfare of ethnic minorities and good relations
between minorities and the local community are promoted by community
relations councils and other voluntary bodies.
A major report published in 1976, while showing that many members of
minority groups were at a disadvantage in terms of the level of their jobs or
the quality of their housing, found that minorities did not regard racial dis¬
crimination as their main difficulty in making a life in Britain but saw them¬
selves as relative newcomers in a country where prices were rising and jobs
hard to get. Only a small proportion of Asians and West Indians believed that
they had personally encountered discrimination. Policies for promoting
equality of opportunity among ethnic minorities are pursued against a back¬
ground of legislation designed to protect them from discrimination.
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race or ethnic or national origin in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in employment, training and related matters, in education, in housing
and in advertising. It strengthens the previous legislation passed in 1968 which,
in turn, widened the scope of the first race relations legislation enacted in 1965.
The 1976 Act brings the law against racial discrimination into line with that
against sex discrimination (see above), and gives complainants direct access to
civil courts and, in the case of employment complaints, to industrial tribunals.
Complaints concerning educational establishments are made first to the
appropriate education minister. The remedies available from the courts are
damages, a declaration of rights or an injunction. Industrial tribunals are also
able to declare the rights of parties, make recommendations or award com¬
pensation. Legal aid (see p 101) is available to complainants with low
incomes.
The 1976 Act also strengthens the criminal law on incitement to racial hatred.
A prosecution made under the Act may only be brought in England and Wales
by, or with the consent of, the Attorney General.
The Commission for Racial Equality was established under the Act to work
towards the elimination of discrimination and to promote equality of oppor¬
tunity and good relations between different racial groups. It has powers to
investigate unlawful discriminatory practices and to issue non-discrimination
notices, enforceable in the courts, requiring that'such practices should cease.
The Commission has sole responsibility for those contraventions of the Act
which do not result in a particular person being discriminated against, for
example, discriminatory advertisements and instructions; it may also assist
individuals with their complaints. It has an important educational role and has
power to issue codes of practice in employment.
The Commission supports and co-ordinates the work of nearly 100 local
community relations councils operating in areas with significant minority
groups; their purpose is to promote harmonious community relations.
It makes grants towards the salaries of community relations officers and towards
special projects which help to improve community relations or to assist mem¬
bers of the ethnic minorities. Particular encouragement is given to self-help
schemes run by members of the minority communities.
7 Education
Priorities
British education aims to develop individual abilities to the full and to shape
those abilities for the benefit of society as a whole. Compulsory schooling
takes place between the ages of five and 16, although some provision is made
for children under five and many pupils remain at school beyond the minimum
leaving age. Post-school education (mainly at universities, polytechnics and
further education colleges) is organised flexibly to provide opportunities for
academic work, vocational training and continuing study throughout life.
Considerable educational change has taken place in the last 15 years or so.
New methods of teaching and learning have increasingly been used, particu¬
larly in modern languages, mathematics and science. Informal techniques
designed to awaken children’s curiosity and interest have been introduced,
especially in primary schools. Secondary education has been extensively
re-organised into comprehensive schools which dispense with selection
procedures for entry at 1 i-plus and provide a wide range of studies for children
of all abilities. Post-school facilities have also been expanded, particularly for
advanced studies in the higher education sector.
Most expenditure on education comes from public funds; some £7,853
million in 1977 which represented 6-3 per cent of the gross national product.
Following the period of substantial innovation and change the Government
initiated a national debate on school educational issues, involving teachers,
administrators, parents, employers, trade unionists and others. Two of the
broad themes raised concerned the content of curricula and the links between
schools and industry.
There is a general concern that schools’ curricula should meet the needs of
modern Britain, and that there should be a coherent and soundly-based means
of assessment for individual pupils, for schools and for the educational
system as a whole. The Assessment of Performance Unit of the Department
of Education and Science which promotes the development of methods of
assessing and monitoring the performance of children at school is concentrat¬
ing on the development of tests suitable for national monitoring in English
language, mathematics and science. Some of the costs are being met by the
Welsh Office which is also sponsoring assessment of the use and development
of the Welsh language in schools in Wales.
The Government is encouraging further links, especially locally, between
schools and industry, to try to ensure that every pupil grows up with a basic
understanding of the economy and the activities which are necessary for
the creation of the country’s wealth (particularly manufacturing industries),
and to encourage more of the able pupils to consider and prepare for careers
in productive industry. Many organisations already work to improve liaison
between school and industry; national initiatives include the Schools Council
Industry Project, being mounted with the Confederation of British Industry
and the Trades Union Congress, and the Confederation’s own project
‘Understanding British Industry’.
Within the necessary strict financial limitations the Government remains
committed to improving educational provision for all. Nursery education for
children of pre-school age is being expanded, and priority in the allocation of
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
138
resources is being given to those with social and educational disadvantages
and to handicapped children. In many ‘priority areas’ within large cities, for
instance, special annual payments are made to teachers working in schools
of exceptional difficulty, and extra funds are allocated for school building.
The recent fall in birthrate (see p 8) has already caused the number of
primary school children to decrease sharply, and over the next few years the
secondary schools will face a similar decline. The trend is having its effect on
teacher training programmes (see p 147) and the development of the higher
education system in the 1990s is being discussed in this context.
The Government is anxious that more young people in the 16 to 18 age
group should stay in full-time education in schools and colleges, and is dis¬
cussing with local authorities the possibility of a statutory system of awards
which could ensure this.
Administration Educational responsibilities are devolved in varying degrees to ministers of the
four countries of Britain. The Secretary of State for Education and Science is
responsible for all aspects of education in England, and for universities, civil
science and the arts throughout Great Britain. The Secretaries of State for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have full educational responsibilities
in their countries except that the Secretaries of State for Wales and Scotland
are consulted about university-level education but are not responsible for it.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is divided
between the central government departments (the Department of Education
and Science, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Department of Education for Northern Ireland), local education authorities
(education and library boards in Northern Ireland), and various voluntary
organisations. Their relationship is based on consultation and co-operation.
Local education authorities are responsible for the provision of school
education and most post-school education outside the universities, and provide
grants to students proceeding to higher education (including universities).
In Scotland the central institutions (for higher education) and colleges
of education (for teacher training), which are administered by independent
governing bodies, are financed directly by the Scottish Education Department
and grants to students are also paid by the Department. In Northern Ireland
the Ulster College (an institution of higher education) is likewise administered
by an independent board of governors and is financed directly by the Northern
Ireland Department of Education. Colleges of education are controlled by the
Department or voluntary agencies.
Universities are administratively independent and their governing bodies
are appointed according to the terms of their individual charters or statutory
provisions. The Government exercises its responsibilities in relation to the
universities through the University Grants Committee (see p 145)-
SCHOOLS Parents are required by law to see that their children receive efficient full-time
education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
Over 11 million children attend Britain’s 38,000 schools. Most receive free
education financed from public funds, but a small proportion (very roughly
four per cent) attend schools wholly independent of public financial support.
Boys and girls are taught together in most primary schools and in an increas¬
ing number of secondary schools. Over 80 per cent of pupils in maintained
secondary schools in England and Wales and over 50 per cent in Northern
Ireland attend mixed schools. In Scotland nearly all secondary schools are
mixed. Most of the independent schools for younger children are co-educa-
tional, but of those providing secondary education the majority are single-sex.

Schools
Schools supported from public funds are of two main kinds in England and
Wales: county schools and voluntary schools. County schools are provided
and maintained by local education authorities wholly out of public funds.
Voluntary schools have mostly been established by religious denominations
and receive varying amounts of public finance according to type (‘aided’,
‘controlled’ and ‘special agreement’). Nearly a third of the 28,350 schools
maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary
schools: some 5,860 are Church of England, 2,660 are Roman Catholic, and
340 belong to other groups and religious denominations. Each publicly
maintained school has a body of managers or governors, some or all of whom
are appointed by the local education authority. In Scotland most of the schools
supported from public funds are provided by education authorities and are
known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type of independent
school, see p 140).
In Northern Ireland there are two main categories of school: voluntary
schools which are mainly, though not exclusively, under Roman Catholic
management receiving grants of up to 85 per cent of capital costs and up to
100 per cent of running costs, and controlled schools owned and managed by
the Area Education and Library Boards and having all their expenditure met
from public funds. Government policy is to encourage integration between
Protestant and Roman Catholic school education where there is a local desire
for it, but there is no question of enforcing integrated education against the
wishes of local communities.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
maintained schools, and books and equipment are free. In Scotland, education
authorities may charge fees where this can be done without prejudice to the
adequate provision of free school education (although no authorities make use
of this power). In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children
attending grant-aided schools, with the exception of grammar schools, where
a small proportion-of pupils are admitted on a fee-paying basis.
Facilities for informal education and play for children aged two to five are pro¬
vided free in public sector nursery schools and nursery classes in public sector
primary schools, and are also available for a fee in a few independent schools
and a large number of ‘pre-school playgroups’ organised by voluntary organisa¬
tions or by groups of parents. Apart from children only just under five, the
proportion ofchildren aged two to four who attend public sector schools remains
low (the supply of places being inadequate to meet the demand for them)
though attendance, particularly part-time attendance, has been increasing very
rapidly in recent years.
Compulsory education begins at five when children in England and Wales
go to infant schools or departments; at seven they go on to junior schools or
departments. The usual age of transfer from primary to secondary schools is
11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but an increasing number of
local authorities in England are establishing ‘first’ schools for pupils aged
5 to 8 or 10 and ‘middle’ schools covering various age ranges between 9 and 14.
In Scotland, the primary schools take children from 5 to 12, normally
having infant classes for children under 7, although in some areas there are
separate infant schools.
The public or State system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. About 80 per cent of the maintained
140

secondary school population in England and Wales attend some 3,600 compre¬
hensive schools which take pupils without reference to ability or aptitude and
provide a wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children of
a district. They can be organised in a number of ways including schools that
take the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; middle schools whose
pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at 12 or 13, leaving at 16 or
18; and schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a sixth-
form or ‘tertiary’ college for pupils over 16. Most of the remaining children
receive their secondary education in ‘grammar’ and ‘secondary modern’ schools
to which they are allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11. In order
to hasten progress towards the re-organisation of secondary school provision
along comprehensive lines, the Education Act 1976 gives the Secretary of State
powers to require local authorities, if they have not already done so, to submit
plans for such re-organisation.
A small number of selective grammar schools have in the past received direct
grant payments from central government funds. The system is, however,
being phased out. Of the 170 such schools 51 chose to enter the maintained
sector as voluntary aided comprehensive schools, and most of these have done
so, or will do so in the next few years. Those which did not choose to enter the
maintained sector will become wholly independent (see below).
Secondary education in Scotland is almost completely organised according to
the comprehensive principle and virtually all pupils in education authority
secondary schools are in schools with a non-selective intake. The majority
of schools are six-year comprehensive schools. Because of local circumstances
there are some comprehensive schools whose courses may extend to four years
or less and from which pupils may transfer at the end of their second or fourth
years to a six-year comprehensive school.
In Northern Ireland selective secondary education is being eliminated in
favour of a comprehensive system.
Independent schools in England and Wales receive no grants from public funds
but all are open to inspection and must register with the appropriate govern¬
ment education department which has power to require them to remedy any
objectionable features in their premises, accommodation or instruction and to
exclude any person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or to be the proprietor
of a school. In default, the appropriate Secretary of State can, in effect, close
a school, but schools have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal against
any of the requirements. There are about 2,300 registered independent schools.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages. The largest and most im¬
portant of them are the public schools,1 which accept pupils at about 12 or 13
years of age usually on the basis of a fairly demanding examination. There are
about 470 public schools in England and Wales, most of them single-sex
(about half of them for girls) and at least partly boarding; but there are some
coeducational schools and certain boys’ schools have recently begun to admit
girls direct to their top forms. Combined tuition and boarding fees in the public
schools are about £2,000 a year, but some of this may be remitted for children
winning competitive scholarships. A number of preparatory schools, day and
boarding, coeducational and single-sex, prepare children for entry to the
public schools.
1 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of the Head¬
masters’ Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association. They should not be confused with the State-supported
public schools in Scotland.

Special education is provided for children who require it because of physical
or mental disability either in ordinary schools or special schools (including
hospital schools). It has long been governmental policy to send as few handi¬
capped children as possible to special schools, and by a law yet to be brought
into effect such children will have to be educated in ordinary schools whenever
practicable and compatible with efficient teaching. There are, however, some
i,800 separate special schools (both day and boarding) for a number of cate¬
gories of disability. These are the blind, partially sighted, deaf, partially
hearing, delicate, educationally subnormal (mentally handicapped in Scotland),
epileptic, maladjusted, physically handicapped, autistic and those suffering
from speech defects. There is no separate category for the delicate in Scotland.
As many children have multiple handicaps, there is a growing tendency to
relate educational provision to an assessment of overall needs.
A new framework of special education, based on the concept of special
educational need, was recommended by the Warnock Committee in 1978 (see
Bibliography p 441). It would cover not only children with disabilities of mind
or body but also those who have significant difficulties in learning, many of
whom are at present the concern of remedial services, as well as those with
emotional behavioural disorders.
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are appointed by local education
authorities or schools, governing bodies or managers. There are more than
535,000 teachers (including the full-time equivalent of part-time teachers) in
publicly maintained schools in Britain and the pupil/teacher ratio was about
20 to 1. Teachers must hold qualifications approved by the appropriate
education department. Their salaries are determined by nationally negotiated
scales taking account of qualifications, responsibilities and experience.
In England and Wales the secular curriculum in maintained schools is the
responsibility of the local education authority, or, in the case of secondary
schools, of the schools’ governors. In practice there is a very high degree of
devolution to headteachers, particularly in nursery and primary schools. In
Wales, the Welsh language is taught and is used as either the main or secondary
medium of teaching in some schools. Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Schools
are responsible to the Department of Education and Science and the Welsh
Office for the inspection of all schools including independent schools. They
review and report on the content and value of the education provided and are
available as advisers. Local education authorities also employ inspectors to
guide them on maintained schools. Teachers’ organisations and institutions
concerned with the education and training of teachers are additional sources of
advice. Further guidance and encouragement for school-based research and
development is available to teachers through the Schools Council for Cur¬
riculum and Examinations. The Council, an independent body representative
of all educational interests, acts as an advisory body and sponsors and carries
out research and development work on curricula, teaching methods and exam¬
inations in primary and secondary schools. The Schools Council Committee
for Wales carries out similar activities in Wales.
Local education authorities have been asked to review their curricular
arrangements. In the light of the review the Government is to seek to establish
a broad consensus on a framework for the curriculum and on whether part of
it should be protected because there are aims (such as the achievement of
basic literacy and numeracy at the primary stage) common to all schools and
pupils at certain stages.

the content and balance of the curriculum is kept under continuous review by
the Consultative Committee on the Curriculum. Provision is made, where
appropriate, for the teaching of Gaelic. Northern Ireland has a Schools
Curriculum Committee which works in close liaison with the Schools Council;
the Inspectorate of the Department of Education helps and advises teachers
and inspects and evaluates the work of all schools.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents choose otherwise. In county schools, and sometimes in
voluntary schools, religious instruction of a non-denominational character is
given which may include the study of comparative religions. (In areas with
large immigrant populations this can take the form of lessons on compara¬
tive cultures.) In all kinds of voluntary school there is opportunity for
denominational instruction. In Scotland, subject to safeguards for the indi¬
vidual conscience, religious instruction must be given, but the content is
determined by education authorities or, more commonly, by the schools
themselves. Roman Catholic children generally have their own schools. In
controlled schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access which may
be used for denominational instruction; in voluntary schools corporate worship
and religious education are controlled by the management authorities.
The freedom of schools to frame their own curricula has facilitated quite
rapid change and experiment, partly stimulated by the Schools Council and
other organisations. The general purpose has been to adapt curricula to reflect
technological advance and social change; and to enable to respond to the
needs of individual children. Greater emphasis has also been placed on
appreciation of music and the arts.
Among the most clearly observable general trends in new teaching methods
have been the increased emphasis, particularly for younger children, on
‘learning by doing’; the efforts to reduce or modify ‘streaming (grouping
according to ability) in such a way as to minimise its ill effects on children
placed in a lower stream; and the increased importance attached to pupils’
motivation. At the same time greater use is being made of new educational aids.
The broad direction of changes in the school curriculum was among the sub¬
jects discussed in the national debate on education (see p 137)-
Broadcasting is a major resource for school teachers—most schools can
receive television, and almost all have radios. Relaxation of copyright for
educational purposes enables many schools to make recordings for more
flexible use within the school timetable, films and slides are also used, often
in conjunction with tape recordings for audio-visual presentations. These
may be prepared by the schools themselves, but commercial products,
including the BBC’s ‘Radiovision’ programmes, are available.
The Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom and the
Educational Foundation for Visual Aids advise those connected with educa¬
tion on the use of audio-visual aids. In Scotland this function is undertaken by
the Scottish Council for Educational Technology.
Computers are increasingly used to assist learning by means of calculation,
information retrieval and the simulation of situations. They are also used in
planning timetables and helping in the management of courses.
There is no national school-leaving examination in England and Wales, but
secondary school pupils may attempt examinations, in various subjects, leading
to the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) or the General Certificate of

Children
Education (GCE). The CSE is designed for pupils completing five years’
secondary education and is normally taken at the age of 16. It is controlled by
14 Regional Examining Boards, consisting mainly of teachers serving in the
schools which provide the candidates. The highest grade in the CSE (grade 1)
is widely accepted as being of the same standard as at least grade C at GCE
‘Ordinary’ level. The GCE examinations are conducted by eight independent
examining bodies and are set at two levels: Ordinary (‘O’) and Advanced
(‘A’). Normally candidates taking ‘O’ level are about 16 years of age, although
some take it earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. ‘A’ levels are
usually taken after a further two years’ study. Control over the scope and
standards of the examinations is exercised by the Schools Council (see p 141)
to ensure national comparability. Entries for both levels of the GCE are
accepted from candidates at further education establishments and from
candidates entering privately.
Grade C or above in various subjects at GCE ‘O’ level and the equivalent
CSE grade 1 are usually considered to be qualifications for entry to courses of
further education and training. Since the inception of the CSE the number
achieving the highest grade has increased steadily as the popularity of the
examination has grown while GCE ‘O’ level subject performances have also
improved. The ‘A’ level examination is at the standard for entrance to university
and for entry to many forms of professional training.
In Scotland examinations are conducted by the Scottish Certificate of Edu¬
cation Examination Board. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary
courses sit an examination at 16 years for the Ordinary grade of the Scottish
Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth or sixth year are presented for
the Higher grade. Passes at the Higher grade are the basis for entry to uni¬
versity or professional training. For those who have completed their main
studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their studies in particular
subjects there is a Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Northern Ireland General
Certificate of Education or the Northern Ireland Certificate of Secondary
Education, which are equivalent to those examinations in England and Wales.
The International Baccalaureate, which is offered by several educational
institutions in Britain, consists of a two-year curriculum for students at sixth-
form level, and leads either to a diploma or to separate subject certificates, the
latter being recognised for admission to higher education in Britain and many
other countries.
Physical education, including organised games, is part of the curriculum of all
schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must have the
use of a playing field, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
The Department of Health and Social Security is responsible for the medical
inspection of school children and for advice and treatment of specific medical
and dental problems associated with children of school age.
Local education authorities must provide free school milk, normally one-
third of a pint (o’tq litre), on each school day, for all pupils in maintained
special schools, pupils up to seven years in other maintained schools, and, on
health grounds, to pupils up to eleven. They have discretionary powers to
provide free milk for all other junior pupils in maintained schools. The
authorities must also provide for all day pupils in maintained schools a mid¬
day meal at a subsidised charge (which is remitted in cases of need). Under
certain conditions the authorities must provide free school transport, and they
have discretionary powers to assist financially in the provision of transport for

pupils between their home and school and for many other school activities.
Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible, under the
general supervision of the central departments, for providing the schools and
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central depart¬
ments determine the maximum size of the authorities’ individual programmes
in the light of national priorities; they also offer guidance to authorities by
means of building bulletins and in other ways.
Since 1945 an extensive school building programme has been carried out
resulting in the completion of about 16,300 new schools in Britain, together
with extensions, alterations and remodelling of existing state schools; over
9 million new places have been provided.
Grants of up to 85 per cent of the approved cost are normally available from
the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office for the building
of new voluntary aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to exist¬
ing 'aided schools. In Northern Ireland capital grants of 85 per cent are
available for voluntary schools managed by maintained school committees
and voluntary grammar schools which have entered into an agreement under
statutory provisions.
The school building programme has provided for new ideas and methods in
design and construction. Industrialised building techniques have been widely
adopted. New schools are designed to be light, airy and colourful as well as to
have enough teaching area and space for auxiliary activities and outdoor games.
Space is being used more flexibly, particularly in primary schools to meet the
needs of new teaching methods.
Education for those who have left school is organised very flexibly. It is avail¬
able to everyone above school-leaving age, is provided at all levels and may be
part-time or full-time, vocational or non-vocational.
More than a third of young people receive some form of post-school educa¬
tion compared with a fifth in 1965. Many courses lead to recognised qualifi¬
cations, varying from degrees and professional qualifications through
technician level to qualifications similar to those obtained before leaving school.
Further education is a broad term usually taken to refer to all post-school
education outside the universities. Higher education (postgraduate, first-
degree and similar level work) is provided at universities and on advanced
courses at polytechnics and other establishments of further education. Adults
of every age make extensive use of widespread and varied facilities for the
educational and cultural leisure activities included under the term ‘adult
education’ (see p 149).
The principal institutions of post-school education are the 45 universities (see
p 146); the 30 polytechnics in England and Wales and the 14 Scottish central
institutions, in which advanced (or higher) courses outside the universities are
increasingly being concentrated; the Ulster College in Northern Ireland; and
well over 600 other colleges which are maintained or assisted from public funds,
some of which have a very wide range of courses, while others concentrate on
particular subjects. These colleges include the ‘liberal arts’ colleges and institu¬
tions of higher education in England and Wales into which the former colleges
of education (for teacher training) have been assimilated. All these institutions
offer courses leading to recognised qualifications, while their premises as well
as school and other premises are often also used for adult education.
Apart from the universities, most establishments of post-school education
are maintained and administered by the local education authorities. The
EDUCATION

Students
Scottish central institutions, however, the Scottish colleges of education and
the Ulster College do not come under the control of the education authorities,
but are managed by independent governing bodies, representative of the
authorities and other appropriate interests.
In addition, there are many independent specialist establishments, such as
secretarial colleges, correspondence colleges and colleges teaching English as a
foreign language; a number of voluntary bodies and private undertakings
providing cultural and general education, sometimes with financial or other
assistance from local education authorities; and a large number of other
education and training schemes run by public or private organisations.
Most establishments for post-school education are either maintained or assisted
from public funds. Where industrial training is provided by a college, the
charges are the responsibility of the employer, and broadly reflect the
economic cost of provision. Many full-time students are helped by awards
from public funds. These awards are mandatory for most students taking
university first-degree and other comparable courses. They are assessed to cover
tuition fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who can afford to contribute
towards the cost are required to do so. In England and Wales these awards are
made by local education authorities up to first-degree level, while in Scotland
awards to students on advanced level courses are made by the Scottish Educa¬
tion Department. In Northern Ireland awards up to first-degree level are made
by the education and library boards. Grants for postgraduate study and research
are offered by the education departments and the research councils. In all,
about 90 per cent of full-time students on advanced courses receive help from
public funds. Some scholarships are available from endowments and from
particular industries or companies.
Although largely dependent on public funds, the universities are guaranteed
as autonomous institutions by a special financial arrangement. The University
Grants Committee is appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and
Science to advise on State aid to the universities; its members are drawn from
the academic and business worlds. This body acts as a link and buffer between
the Government from which it receives a block grant and the universities to
which it allocates this grant. So, although the Government is responsible for
financing about 90 per cent of universities’ central expenditure (colleges
within universities may have their own investments, endowments and
budgets), it does not control their work or teaching. The Open University
(see p 147) is financed directly by the Department of Education and Science,
not through the University Grants Committee; and in Northern Ireland,
government grants are made direct to the universities by the Department of
Education which first seeks the advice of the University Grants Committee.
Well over 900,000 students take full-time and sandwich courses (courses
where substantial periods of full-time study alternate with periods of super¬
vised experience on a relevant job) at universities and other major establish¬
ments of further education in Britain (1976-77 figures). Of these about 272,000
are at universities while another 250,000 follow advanced courses outside
universities, at colleges of further and higher education, polytechnics and
Scottish central institutions. More than 400,000 take non-advanced courses,
most of them studying for recognised vocational or educational qualifications.
Additionally, there are over 3 million part-time students, over 600,000 of
whom are released by their employers for study during working hours. The
remainder for the most part take some of the wide variety of adult education
classes (see p 149).

Higher
Education
Universities
The provision for higher education has almost tripled in size since i960. It
caters for about 520,000 full-time and sandwich students and about 230,000
part-time students through a variety of courses and in a variety of institutions.
Nearly 14 per cent of 18 year-olds enter courses of higher education. This
expansion has been achieved by creating ten new universities; by developing a
number of colleges into universities, 30 of them into polytechnics specialising
in advanced work; and by widening the range and flexibility of courses.
Student members (excluding teacher training) are evenly divided between
science-based and arts-based courses; although this is not a matter for explicit
government policy, it has been the subject of much public discussion.
There are 45 universities in Britain, including the Open University, compared
with 17 in 1945. In addition, the University College at Buckingham, which
receives no assistance from public funds, began courses in 1976 but has not yet
achieved university status.
The English universities are: Aston (Birmingham), Bath, Birmingham,
Bradford, Bristol, Brunei (London), Cambridge, City (London), Durham,
East Anglia, Essex, Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury, Lancaster,
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough, Manchester, New¬
castle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford, Sheffield, South¬
ampton, Surrey, Sussex, Warwick, and York. The London Graduate School of
Business Studies and the Manchester Business School also have university
status. The federated University of Wales includes five university colleges, the
Welsh National School of Medicine, and the University of Wales Institute of
Science and Technology. The Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee,
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt (Edinburgh), St. Andrews, Stirling, and
Strathclyde (Glasgow). In Northern Ireland there are the Queen’s University
of Belfast, and the New University of Ulster in Coleraine.
The universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
Admission to universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour, nationality or sex bar, though in practice there are
about twice as many men as women. Prospective candidates for nearly all the
universities apply for places through the Universities Central Council on
Admissions. The only students to apply directly are applicants to the Open
University and British candidates who apply only to the universities of Glas¬
gow, Aberdeen and Strathclyde.
Most students at universities are undergraduates: in 1976-77 there were
about 272,000 full-time university students in Britain, including over 50,000
postgraduates. Just under a half lived in colleges and halls of residence, over
one-third were in privately rented accommodation, and the remainder lived
at home. There were about 32,000 full-time university teachers paid wholly
from university funds. The ratio of staff to students was about one to eight
or nine, one of the most favourable in the world.
Except at the Open University, first-degree courses are mainly full-time and
usually last three or four years, though medical and veterinary courses may
require five or six. A full-time course at a university remains the most usual way
of obtaining a first degree, in spite of the extension of facilities for obtaining a
degree in other ways. About four-fifths of all students on full-time first-degree
courses are at universities.
Actual degree titles vary according to the practice of each university; in

England and Wales the commonest titles for a first degree are Bachelor of Arts
(BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a second degree Master of Arts
(MA), Master of Science (MSc), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD); while in
Scotland Master is used for a first degree. On the other hand, uniformity of
standards between universities is promoted by the practice of employing
outside examiners for all university examinations, and the general pattern of
teaching (a combination of lectures, small group seminars or tutorials with
practical classes where necessary) is fairly similar throughout Britain.
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-time
degree and other courses, using a combination of television and radio broad¬
casts, correspondence courses and summer schools, together with a network
of viewing and listening centres. No formal academic qualifications are
required to register for these courses, but the standards of its degrees are the
same as those of other universities. The university’s first degree, the BA (Open),
is a general degree awarded on a system of credits for each course completed;
the average amount of study needed for a full course is estimated at 12 to 14
hours a week. The first courses began in 1971, and in 1978 some 60,000 under¬
graduate and 7,500 associate students were following courses. About 6,000
people a year obtain degrees from the Open University—about 1 in 14 of the
total for Britain. The university also has a consultancy service to make its
advice and facilities available on a fee-paying but non-profit-making basis to
bodies throughout the world interested in ‘teaching at a distance’ projects.
In order to teach in a maintained school in England and Wales all new entrants
to teaching must generally have taken a course of professional teacher training.
Many new entrants have undertaken three-year non-graduate courses leading
to the award of the Certificate of Education. With the exception of a few one-
year certificate courses for holders of specialist qualifications in subjects
where there is a shortage of staff in the schools, however, this qualification is
to be phased out as part of the move towards an all-graduate profession. It is
to be replaced by a direct-entry Bachelor of Education degree course at
ordinary or honours level. The last general entry to the non-graduate cer¬
tificate courses will be in I9791 From 1980 onwards the most usual route to a
teaching qualification will, for non-graduates, be by way of a three- or four-year
course leading to the Bachelor of Education degree; for graduates it will be by
way of a one-year postgraduate Certificate of Education course.
Teacher training formerly took place in specialist colleges of education but
is being integrated with the rest of higher education. By 1981 nearly all training
places will be in polytechnics, colleges of higher education and/or further
education or universities.
In response to the change in demand for newly trained teachers, caused by
restrictions on public expenditure and the continued decline in the size of the
school population following the fall in the birthrate, the number of teacher¬
training places planned for 1981 has been cut to 47,000, to include 10,000
places for in-service training. This substantial reduction from about 100,000
places in i97^~77 Fas led to the closure of a number of training colleges.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority and grant-aided schools must
be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. All teachers
of academic subjects in Scottish secondary schools must be graduates. Courses
in colleges of education lead to the award of a Teaching Qualification (Primary
Education) or a Teaching Qualification (Secondary Education). Graduates and
holders of specialist diplomas undergo a one-year course; courses in practical
and aesthetic subjects for non-graduates extend to two, three or four years.

Most Scottish colleges of education also offer four-year courses leading to the
degree of Bachelor of Education.
In Northern Ireland teacher training takes place in the two university edu¬
cation departments, three colleges of education, the Ulster College and one
technical college. The principal courses are three-year (certificate) and four-
year (Bachelor of Education) but there are also one-year courses for graduates or
holders of other appropriate qualifications.
Increased importance is being given to the continued professional education
of practising teachers in Britain, and local authorities, universities and colleges
provide a variety of in-service courses.
In 1976-77 about ^72,000 students, over half of them full-time, were taking
advanced courses other than in universities in a wide variety of subjects,
including architecture, art and design, catering, engineering, natural sciences,
social work and business and management studies and teacher training. An
increasing proportion of the students were taking courses leading to the awards
of the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). The Council has
power to award degrees and other academic qualifications, comparable in
standard with those granted by universities, to students who successfully
complete approved courses of study in establishments which do not have the
power to award their own degrees. The courses range from science and
technology to the arts, social studies, business studies and law, but the
proportion of technological, business or other explicitly vocational courses is
much higher than in universities and the proportion of arts, language and
science courses lower.
In England and Wales higher education provision outside universities and
teacher training colleges is being concentrated within 30 major national
institutions named ‘polytechnics’. These provide all types of courses (full¬
time, sandwich and part-time) on a wide range of subjects at all levels, though
the trend is towards a concentration on advanced work. In Scotland similar
provision is made in 14 central institutions and a few further education
colleges managed by education authorities, though there is a tendency for the
Scottish establishments to specialise more by subjects than do the English
polytechnics. In Northern Ireland such higher education provision is
concentrated within the Ulster College.
The British education systems offer facilities for obtaining all types of
vocational education and training, and are notable for providing alternative
routes to higher qualifications for those who have found themselves unable to
continue full-time education after leaving school.
There is a wide variety of courses for young people in various trades and
occupations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of
up to five years. Other, more academic, courses lead to the National Certificates
and Diplomas awarded by joint committees consisting of representatives of
education departments, teachers’ organisations and appropriate professional
bodies. Courses are normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. The Ordinary
National Certificate (ONC) courses normally last two years part-time, and
students usually follow them between the ages 01 16 and 195 the level of the
certificate is generally considered to approach that of GCE ‘A’ level. The
Ordinary National Diploma (OND) courses are the full-time or sandwich
counterparts of the ONC but involve wider and deeper study. The Higher
National Diploma (HND), which requires a further two years’ full-time or
three years’ sandwich study, is recognised, within its more restricted field, as
approaching the standard of a pass degree; the Higher National Certificate
EDUCATION
149
Adult
Education
(HNC), after two further years’ part-time study, is lower in standard because
it is more narrowly based, but is nevertheless classified as an advanced course.
A Technician Education Council has responsibility for developing a
unified system of courses for technicians in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, leading to awards which will eventually replace those of the joint
committees; some courses leading to the awards of the Council are already in
existence. A similar council has been established in Scotland.
Many further education colleges offer courses in shorthand, typing, book¬
keeping, and office studies. More advanced level work, however, is generally
concentrated in polytechnics or other colleges with a department of business
studies, notably those designated as regional centres of management education.
Courses for the post-experience postgraduate Diploma in Management
Studies are run by about 75 colleges; and some polytechnics run courses
leading to the Master’s degree of the Council for National Academic Awards
(see also p 148). Much business education is related to the specialised exami¬
nation requirements of various professional bodies, and courses leading
to them are provided in many colleges, although numbers of candidates seeking
such qualifications do so through correspondence courses. A Business Educa¬
tion Council was established in 1974 with the same functions as the Technician
Education Council (see above) in relation to courses of business education. In
Scotland, similar courses lead to the Scottish National Certificate, the Scottish
Higher National Certificate and the Scottish National Diploma in Business
Studies, awarded by the Scottish Business Education Council.
Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of post-school education
outside the main areas of higher, professional and technical education. Courses
are provided by local education authorities, certain residential colleges, the
adult education (extra-mural’) departments of universities and various
voluntary and statutory bodies.
A major part of adult education is financed by local education authorities and
provided mainly in their establishments, including schools (used for adult
evening classes). Most of the courses are part-time, and in some cases ‘com¬
munity schools’ where adult education (together with educational, social and
cultural opportunities for the wider community) is an integral part of the pro¬
vision. In addition local authorities maintain or aid most of the short-term resi¬
dential colleges or centres, of which there are 45 in England and Wales, and
- which provide courses varying in length between a weekend and a fortnight.
Many of the courses are practical, but there are widespread opportunities for
academic study.
Long-term residential colleges (seven in England and Wales, one in
Scotland) which are grant-aided by the central government departments,
provide courses of one or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The
colleges aim to provide a liberal education and do not apply academic entry
tests. Most students admitted to them are entitled to full maintenance grants.
The extra-mural departments of the universities and the Workers’ Educa¬
tional Association (WEA), the largest of the recognised voluntary bodies, pro¬
vide extended part-time courses of more academic studies, though recently
there has been a tendency for more short courses organised for special
(including vocational) interests. Often the WEA provides the organisation and
the teaching is provided by the extra-mural departments, many of which have
full-time staff appointed for this purpose and can also call on the services of
other departments of the university. Similar work is promoted in some local
education authority centres.
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
15°
There are a large number of other organisations (both national and local)
which provide many kinds of education and training. Several non-political
bodies, such as the National Federation of Women’s Institutes and the
National Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations, receive govern¬
ment grants; others are commercially or privately financed. Some make their
facilities available to the public as a whole, others to a particular group, such
as the disabled or the unemployed, or the employees or members of an
organisation.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides a national centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many interested organisations in Eng¬
land and Wales. It is mainly financed by contributions from local education
authorities and assisted by a grant from the Department of Education and
Science. The Institute has a Government-funded Adult Literacy Unit to act
as a focus for adult literacy work, to commission special projects of relevance to
local authorities, and to assist voluntary projects promoting literacy. The
Scottish Institute of Adult Education is the Institute’s Scottish counterpart.
An Advisory Council for Adult and Continuing Education has been set up
to advise on the co-ordination of existing facilities and assist in planning for the
future. Northern Ireland has a similar Council for Continuing Education.
Teaching The general pattern of teaching and learning on full-time courses at universi-
Methods ties and colleges remains a mixture of lectures, prescribed or suggested reading,
seminars or tutorials, exercises and tests, and, where appropriate, practical
work. Nevertheless, each institution has different ways of preparing its course
material and different approaches and emphases in teaching it. They make
use of the teaching and learning aids provided by radio and television and of
other visual aids. Teaching machines and language laboratories are also used,
as are computer-assisted and computer-managed learning techniques. All
universities have access to computers for educational and research purposes,
and most universities and many colleges have closed circuit television.
Radio and television programmes, both specially instructional and general,
are perhaps the most penetrating purveyors of adult education, and are often
linked to a range of supplementary publications and activities. Most BBC radio
study programmes are grouped in hourly sessions on five nights a week and
week-end afternoons. Television study programmes are shown on Saturday
and Sunday mornings and in the early morning and late evening on weekdays.
Both the BBC and Independent Television provide programmes at successive
intellectual levels from domestic, social and craft skills to progressive voca¬
tional training. The BBC also works with the Open University, producing
and broadcasting radio and television programmes as part of the courses.
Educational programmes would be one of the main priorities of the ‘fourth
channel’ television service which, under government proposals of July 1978,
would be provided and supervised by a new Open Broadcasting Authority
(see p 419).
EDUCATIONAL Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
RESEARCH educational services is supported financially by the central government
education departments, local education authorities, philanthropic organisa¬
tions, universities and teachers’ associations. Some research is also sponsored
at further education institutions and by a few independent organisations.
The Schools Council and the Social Science Research Council are important
channels for government support.

The major institute undertaking research in education, outside the universi¬
ties, is the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and
Wales, an autonomous body which derives its income mainly from corporate
members, including local education authorities, teachers’ organisations and
universities, and from an annual grant from the Department of Education and
Science. There are also the Scottish Council for Research in Education and the
Northern Ireland Council for Educational Research.
There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and
for British students to study abroad, and some British teachers serve overseas
for a period. There are also official grant-aided schemes for teacher exchange
with other Commonwealth countries (administered by the League for the
Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers) and with the United States and various
European countries (administered by the Central Bureau for Educational
Visits and Exchanges). The United States/United Kingdom Educational Com¬
mission promotes the interchange of undergraduates and academic staff to
study in the opposite country.
The promotion of educational work overseas, including advice and assistance
in English teaching, is a major concern of the British Council (see also p 388).
The Council (founded in 1934) is financed mainly from public funds, and is
governed by a board which is broadly representative of many elements of
British life and includes members nominated by government ministers. Its
purpose is defined in its Royal Charter as the promotion of a wider knowledge
of the United Kingdom and the English language abroad and the develop¬
ment of closer cultural relations between Britain and other countries. Through
its staff in 78 countries, the Council’s activities also include fostering personal
contacts between British and overseas people, especially in the educational,
professional and scientific fields; running, or helping to maintain, over 170
libraries of British books and periodicals; and presenting British achieve¬
ments and arts. Its work in Britain is concerned mainly with professional
visitors and with the welfare of overseas students.
British membership of the European Community is creating closer educational
ties with other member countries. Both at school level and in the colleges and
universities there has been an expansion of interest in European studies and
languages. Post-to-post exchanges of teachers have been encouraged by
government-sponsored schemes which are administered by the Central
Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges. The Bureau also makes appoint¬
ments available to European teachers wishing to teach in Britain, negotiates
posts on an in-service training basis for British teachers wishing to further
their experience in another European country, and operates a scheme for
foreign language teaching assistants. Britain has adhered to the Statute
of the European Schools (six of which have been established throughout
the Community) to provide school education for children of people em¬
ployed in the European Community institutions. Negotiations are in progress
to promote recognition of professional qualifications which will enable qualified
people to practise anywhere in the Community.
Two aspects of education being given particular attention within the
Community are the relationship between education and working life, and the
educational needs of migrant workers’ children.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
the academic year 1976-77 there were about 125,000 overseas students in
152
BRITAIN I979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain, of whom about 34,500 were at universities, another 47,500 at further
education colleges and the remainder learning English or training as teachers,
nurses, for the law, banking and accountancy, or in industry. About 45 per
cent of all overseas students were from the Commonwealth and about 55 per
cent were from developing countries.
A range of public and private study fellowships and scholarships are
awarded annually to students and research workers from other countries.
As part of British technical co-operation with developing countries, the
Ministry of Overseas Development supports many students with subsistence
and fees, encourages the development of special courses of particular value to
students from developing countries and of advisory and welfare services to
meet their needs. Over 12,000 students and trainees were helped in this way
in 1977. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, the
governments of certain Commonwealth countries have made awards avail¬
able at their own institutions of higher education to men and women from other
Commonwealth countries. At the beginning of the academic year 1977-78,
589 scholarships and fellowships (including medical awards) were held in
Britain under the plan. The Commonwealth Education Awards Scheme
provides opportunities for further training, study and research for teachers and
others with appropriate experience. Over 1,000 study fellowships were
financed during 1977.
About 450 British Council Scholarships tenable usually for one year in
Britain, and 25 British Council Fellowships tenable for two to three years, are
offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Some 30 Marshall
Scholarships for two years’ study at any university in Britain are offered
annually by the British Government to graduates from the United States of
America. Over 70 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to graduates
from the Commonwealth, the United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany for two years of study at the University of Oxford. Other univer¬
sities and colleges themselves offer many scholarships for which graduate
students of any nationality are eligible.
The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes three handbooks
(see Bibliography p 440) which include information about sources of financial
aid tenable in Britain. The Association promotes co-operation between
Commonwealth universities. Its activities include the provision of publication,
information and academic appointments services, and of secretariats for
various bodies affecting its member institutions, such as the Commonwealth
Scholarship Commission and the Marshall Aid Commemoration Commission.
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are
additionally available under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Colombo
Plan, and the Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan. Over 1,500
awards for study or training in Britain are also made under various multi¬
national programmes such as those of the United Nations and its specialised
agencies (UNESCO, FAO, WHO, for example), the Council of Europe,
OECD and the European Development Fund of the European Community.
The Atlantic College at St. Donat’s, south Wales (one of the three consti¬
tuent colleges of the United World Colleges) provides two-year residential
courses for selected fee-paying pupils of different nationalities prior to their
entering university. About 80 per cent of its students benefit from scholarships
which are provided mainly by governments and international companies.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth, and
regular Commonwealth education conferences are held. The United Kingdom

Council for Overseas Student Affairs is an independent body serving overseas
students and organisations, and individuals concerned in student affairs. It
provides both a forum for the exchange of ideas, and machinery for consulta¬
tion with government and other authorities.
Many British students follow courses overseas at universities and other
institutions of higher education, often in Canada, the United States and
France.
In 1977-78 15 British students took up awards in six Commonwealth
countries under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (see p
152). The United States-United Kingdom Educational Commission (still
sometimes called the Fulbright-Hays Commission) offers travel and mainten¬
ance grants for postgraduate study in the United States. Notable among other
scholarships are the Kennedy scholarship to enable British students to study
at an American university, and the Churchill travel scholarships for men and
women in all walks of life. British students are also offered scholarships at
institutions of higher education in many European and non-European coun¬
tries outside the Commonwealth.
Between 4,000 and 5,000 British teachers serve overseas in schools, colleges
of education, technical colleges, universities, and as teacher trainers and educa¬
tional advisers in developing countries. Many of them are supported by
public funds and most work in Commonwealth countries. Recruitment is
carried out by the Ministry of Overseas Development, the British Council
and voluntary teacher recruiting agencies, such as Christians Abroad. Some
developing countries carry out their own recruitment of British teachers
through their offices in London.
Most of the several hundred British people teaching in universities overseas
are placed through the Inter-University Council for Higher Education
Overseas, the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the British
Council. The Government supports a number of schemes of assistance for
overseas universities. These are administered by the Inter-University Council
and include the Special Commonwealth Awards which are made to leading
scholars from British universities who are willing to work for a minimum of
two years in important posts in the universities of developing Common¬
wealth countries.
The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes lists of sources of
financial support for British graduates to study or do research overseas and for
overseas graduates to come to Britain (see Bibliography p 440).
In addition, four voluntary organisations, co-ordinated under the British
Volunteer Programme, recruit graduate and qualified volunteers for service
overseas. Over half the volunteers are teachers. The programme receives
financial assistance from the British Government.
Several schemes designed to assist interchange between institutions of higher
education in Britain and overseas countries through staff visits are adminis¬
tered by the British Council. Study and research visits by British and overseas
scholars are supported through programmes of the British Academy, the
Royal Society, the Science Research Council, and other British and inter¬
national bodies.
Schemes under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for a year with
teachers overseas include one with the United States and another with Com¬
monwealth countries involving each year over 200 British teachers.
Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European

countries, both for teachers and for assistants’ posts for language specialists.
The largest of these schemes is the modern languages assistants’ scheme,
administered by the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges,
which enables students and young teachers to serve overseas, particularly in
Europe, and for their counterparts to serve in Britain.
Britain provides assistance, on request, to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for specialist missions
and technical and consultancy services. Areas of particular activity include the
introduction of new materials, methods and techniques. This assistance is
provided through various educational organisations, the Ministry of Overseas
Development and the British Council. In addition, the most extensive language
teaching undertaking in the world is provided by the English by Radio and
Television service of the British Broadcasting Corporation. English lessons
are broadcast weekly by radio with explanations in 30 other languages, and
recorded lessons are supplied to some 300 stations in 100 countries. English
by television programmes have been used in more than 90 countries.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The aim of the youth service is to promote the social and informal education
of young people by offering them opportunities in their leisure time to mix
socially and to develop and enlarge their range of interests. The service is
provided by a partnership between public authorities and a large variety of
voluntary organisations. Membership of groups is voluntary and there is no
attempt to impose uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a national
youth movement.
The youth service forms part of the education system. The central govern¬
ment education departments formulate broad policy objectives for the service
and encourage their achievement through financial assistance and advice.
They assist national voluntary youth organisations through grants towards the
cost of administration and building projects. They also make known the
Government’s attitude by means of circulars to local education authorities and
through contacts between departmental officials and representatives of the
authorities and the voluntary organisations. The Scottish Education Depart¬
ment is advised by a council representing both statutory and voluntary bodies
concerned in youth and community work, while in Northern Ireland the
advisory body is the Youth Committee for Northern Ireland. The Youth
Service Forum for England and Wales acts as a central forum for the considera¬
tion of national policies.
Local education authorities (education and library boards in Northern
Ireland) are responsible for local administration of the youth service. Authori¬
ties provide and run their own youth clubs and centres (some of which are
residential) which may be purpose-built or associated with schools. They also
assist local voluntary youth groups by lending premises and equipment and by
contributing to their capital and running costs. Many authorities have
appointed youth committees on which official and voluntary bodies are
represented, and employ youth organisers to co-ordinate youth work in
their areas and to arrange in-service training. In Scotland these committees
and organisers are normally concerned with services for both young people
and adults.
Although there are many local education authority youth clubs and centres,
national voluntary organisations still promote the largest share of youth

activities through local groups which raise most of their day-to-day running
expenses by their own efforts. These have an estimated combined membership
of over 6 million. They vary greatly in character, some concentrating on social
and recreational pursuits while others concentrate on educational or religious
activities. Most of the national organisations in England are members of the
National Council of Voluntary Youth Services, a consultative body which takes
action only in the name and with the consent of its member bodies. The
Council has 64 national organisations and 46 local co-ordinating bodies as
members. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there are similar repre¬
sentative bodies.
Among the largest of the voluntary youth organisations in membership of
the National Council are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations (with about
600,000 and 800,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs
(about 500,000), the National Association of Boys’ Clubs (some 170,000) and
the Youth Hostels Association (about 275,000). The three pre-service
organisations (the Combined Cadet Force, Army Cadet Force and Air Training
Corps) are also members. They are financially assisted by the Ministry of
Defence and combine social, educational and physical development with
training for possible entry to the armed forces.
There are some 4,000 full-time youth workers in Britain and these are
supported by many thousands of part-time workers, many of them unpaid.
Part-time workers usually have no professional qualification in youth work but
some have allied qualifications, for instance as teachers, and a large number
attend short courses and conferences on youth work. Qualified school teachers
are recognised as qualified youth workers.
In England and Wales, there is a basic two-year training for youth and com¬
munity workers. Provided at further education colleges, the course leads to
a professional qualification. In addition a number of teacher training colleges
provide a study of youth work as a principal or subsidiary subject within
teacher-training courses. In Scotland one- and three-year courses are
provided at certain colleges of education and in Northern Ireland courses are
provided by the Ulster College.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme, which operates through bodies
such as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, is
designed as a challenge to young people to reach certain standards in leisure¬
time activities with the voluntary assistance of adults. Over 108,000 young
people between the ages of 14 and 25 from Britain and other Commonwealth
countries entered the scheme in 1977. There are three awards—Bronze,
Silver and Gold—for each of which young people must attempt activities in
four out of five sections: service; interests; expeditions; and either physical
activity or design for living.
King George’s Jubilee Trust is a charitable body which, since its creation in
I935» has distributed ^3-3 million in grants to voluntary youth organisations
and towards experimental youth projects.
There are, in addition, a number of organisations, which, although primarily
concerned with the welfare and out-of-school pursuits of young people,
operate in a context broader than that of any individual youth movement.
Among the most important are the Sports Councils for England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland, which provide practical and advisory services
for many youth organisations; the National Playing Fields Association, which
advises local authorities and sports organisations on the acquisition, layout,
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
construction and use of sports grounds; and the Outward Bound Trust,
which maintains five schools in areas of outstanding natural beauty and offers
full-time residential courses designed to encourage a sense of adventure,
responsibility, confidence and achievement.
The National Youth Bureau is a forum for association, discussion and joint
action for those concerned with the social education of young people. It pro¬
vides comprehensive information, training and research services, and has a
specialist information unit on social work with young people. In Scotland the
Board for Information in Youth and Community Service undertakes similar
functions.
Thousands of young people voluntarily take part in community service
designed to assist those in need, including the elderly and the disabled.
Organisations providing opportunities for community service such as Inter¬
national Voluntary Service, Task Force and Community Service Volunteers
receive grants from the Government. Many schools also organise com¬
munity service activities as part of the curriculum.
The Young Volunteer Force Foundation is an independent body which
advises interested organisations in England and Wales on methods of involving
young people in providing service to the community. The Foundation is grant-
aided by the Government and employs teams of young people who are available
on request to assist such bodies as local authorities, voluntary organisations and
hospital boards in promoting voluntary service. In Scotland, a similar
organisation, ‘Enterprise Youth’, exists to co-ordinate and promote voluntary
community service.
The Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust, launched in 1977, encourages the efforts
of young people in Britain and the rest of the Commonwealth in community
work to help others of all ages.
8 Plannmgand the
Environment
By comprehensive land-use planning and development control Britain has
had considerable success in resolving the conflicting demands of industry,
commerce, housing, transport, agriculture and recreation and in reducing
environmental pollution. There is no ‘national plan’ for urban and land deve¬
lopment, but there is a statutory system of land-use planning applying over the
whole country and to virtually every kind of development, and there are laws
dealing specifically with environmental health and the control of pollution.
All development requires local ‘planning permission’, and applications for
permission are dealt with in the light of ‘development plans’ which set out
strategies for each area on such matters as housing, transport, industry and
open land. The underlying approach is to identify people’s needs and possible
ways of meeting them, and there is a growing move away from narrow land-use
allocation towards broader strategic planning recognising the community’s
social and economic goals.
The system of land-use planning in Great Britain involves a centralised
structure under the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Wales and
Scotland, and compulsory planning duties for local planning authorities. The
Department of the Environment brings together the major responsibilities in
England land-use planning, housing and construction, countryside policy and
environmental protection. The Welsh Office and the Scottish Development
Department have broadly equivalent responsibilities. Large-scale planning
in England and Wales is primarily the responsibility of the county councils
and the Greater London Council while district councils and the councils of the
London boroughs and the City of London are responsible for most local plans
and development control, the main housing functions and many other environ¬
mental health matters. In certain areas of planning, the two types of authority
exercise concurrent powers. In Scotland, planning functions are undertaken by
regional and district councils whose responsibilities are divided on a basis
broadly similar to that in England and Wales. In the more rural regions and
islands areas, all planning responsibilities are carried out by the regional and
islands councils respectively.
In Northern Ireland the Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland is responsible for planning matters through its local offices which work
closely with the district councils and the local offices of the Housing Executive
(see p 179)- District councils have local environmental health responsibilities.
Special provisions, in addition to the general town and country planning
measures, control the location of industry and offices (see p 211). General
problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number
of government departments, but each development scheme, as a rule,
requires the local planning authority’s consent. Financial incentives from the
Government encourage the location of industry in particular areas.
Throughout Britain voluntary organisations take an active interest in
planning, conservation and the control of pollution.

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The development plan system in England and Wales involves ‘structure’
and ‘local’ plans. Structure plans are prepared by county planning authorities
and require ministerial approval. They set out broad policies for the develop¬
ment and other use of land (including measures for the improvement of the
physical environment and traffic management) and indicate ‘action areas’
where comprehensive development or improvement is expected to start within
a specified period. Local plans, which have to conform generally with the struc¬
ture plan, contain detailed proposals including plans for ‘action areas and are
normally prepared by district councils, though sometimes by county councils.
Local plans are adopted by the planning authorities without being subject to
ministerial approval unless the Secretary of State calls in a plan for his own
decision. All plans are under continuous review and may be altered from time
to time. Scotland has a similar planning system. In Northern Ireland there is
a single-tier system; plans are prepared by the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity
to express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative
stages of the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must
ensure adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans;
representations may be made about them to the authorities. These oppor¬
tunities for public participation are additional to provisions for objecting to
prepared plans. In the case of structure plans the Secretary of State holds an
examination in public of matters on which he requires more information in
order to reach a decision. In the case of local plans objectors have a right to be
heard, and a public local inquiry is normally held for this purpose.
Where specific proposals for development differ substantially from the
intentions of a development plan, they must be publicised locally. Other
schemes affecting a large number of people are usually advertised by the local
planning authority and applications seeking permission for certain types of
development must also be advertised. The applicant has a right of appeal to
the appropriate Secretary of State if planning permission is refused or granted
subject to conditions. Most appeals are transferred for decision to inspectors
(in Scotland reporters) appointed by the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State can direct that a planning application be referred to
him for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and usually only in respect
of proposals of national or regional importance. The applicant has the right to
be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a public inquiry
is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development schemes of
national or regional importance or of a technical or scientific nature, and if an
ordinary inquiry is inadequate for the purpose, the ministers responsible may
decide to set up planning inquiry commissions to carry out investigations and
hold inquiries locally. Where highway development is proposed, the govern¬
ment minister concerned can hold such inquiries as he considers appropriate.
Similar provision is made in Northern Ireland for public participation in the
planning process and for the hearing of objections. There is a right of appeal
to an independent Planning Appeals Commission.
The Secretary of State for the Environment has responsibilities for regional
planning in England, which is carried out with the help of the Regional Eco¬
nomic Planning Councils and Economic Planning Boards. There is a council
and a board in each of the eight economic planning regions: the North, York¬
shire and Humberside, East Midlands, East Anglia, the South East, the South
West, the West Midlands and the North West. The councils are advisory

bodies and comprise voluntary part-time members with wide experience of
their regions; the membership includes local authority representatives, as
well as people from industry, commerce and the universities, for instance. The
councils help in the preparation of broad economic and land-use strategies
which provide a regional framework for national and local planning and
investment decisions. The boards consist of senior officials in the regions
of the government departments concerned with aspects of regional planning.
They co-ordinate the regional work of departments and provide the councils
with information and advice.
Scotland also has an Economic Council and an Economic Planning Board;
there is a Welsh Council; and Northern Ireland has an Economic Council.
The Community Land Act of 1975 established the principle that ultimately
all substantial private development should take place on land which has been
brought into public ownership and then, except where needed for owner-
occupied housing, released on leasehold terms. It gives local planning authori¬
ties new powers and duties to buy land needed for development (other than
relatively minor development). Under associated tax legislation authorities
are empowered to buy land at a price net of the tax payable on its development
value. A separate Land Authority for Wales has been set up to assume in
Wales the functions connected with acquisitions and disposals of develop¬
ment land which are carried out in England and Scotland by local authorities.
The new towns represent one of the most successful achievements of recent
British planning. The policy behind their creation was mainly one of encoura¬
ging the gradual dispersal of industry and population from congested cities to
new areas, planned in advance to become self-contained towns with services
and amenities within convenient distance of the whole community. Since 1946,
32 new towns have been designated, and nearly a million people have gone to
live in them.
Town development (or ‘expanding town’) schemes, involving the transfer
of people and industry from overcrowded areas to existing towns suitable for
expansion, offered another way of dealing with the same problems, but are
arranged directly between the local authorities of the towns concerned.
A government review of the new towns policy, undertaken against a back¬
ground of substantial reductions in population forecasts and a need to pay
more attention to the regeneration of declining inner city areas (see p 161), has
led to a reduction in the long-term target populations of some towns. The
momentum of new town development is to be substantially maintained,
however, over the next few years.
Of the 32 new towns, most of which had as a nucleus an existing town or
village, 21 are in England, 2 in Wales, 5 in Scotland and 4 in Northern Ireland.
The planning and growth of each new town is supervised by a government-
appointed development corporation which is given general powers to acquire,
by compulsory purchase if necessary, land or property needed for the provision
of houses, factories and other buildings and for roads and essential services.
In England four of the new towns have been substantially completed and
have become the responsibility of the Commission for the New Towns, a
government-appointed agency. In Wales responsibility for one of the two new
towns has been taken over by the Development Board for Rural Wales. In
Northern Ireland, development of the new towns has been incorporated in a
new District Towns Strategy which is the responsibility of the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Inner City
Policies
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT l6l
The capital cost is advanced from public funds and is repayable over 60
years. Parliament has approved a fund to provide for advances to the develop¬
ment corporations, which, for Great Britain, stands at £2,750 million, of which
£2,250 million had been advanced by the end of 1977.
The new towns have a total population of over 2 million. Young people form
a somewhat higher proportion than in the population of the country as a whole.
Several of the more developed towns are becoming regional centres and, as
the populations grow large enough to give the necessary support, offices, hotels
and department stores, as well as art centres and full entertainment and recre¬
ational facilities, are gradually being provided. The new towns programme
has included the expansion of large existing towns such as Northampton,
Peterborough and Warrington; this has the advantage, among others, that
many facilities are already available. Most of the towns expanded under town
development schemes (for example, Aylesbury, Basingstoke, Swindon and
Thetford) are well established and are providing homes, jobs and amenities
for people from large cities.
Revitalising the inner areas of many towns and cities presents one of the most
important challenges to modern British planning. Past policies have produced
many successes (many of the slums have been replaced, much old housing has
recently been improved and the clean air legislation has enhanced the general
environment and public health) but old problems of poor housing, and in some
areas congestion, have still to be overcome. In many areas they have been
joined by problems of high unemployment, decay and dereliction and un¬
balanced population structures with relatively high proportions of the elderly
and the disadvantaged. The extent of these problems varies from place to place,
and the inter-relationship between them is complex. Government policy is
not to seek a universal solution but to work out for each city the package of
measures that is most likely to improve conditions.
The Government is giving greater resources and priority to the inner city
areas, partly through an expanded urban aid programme which is being
increased from a 1977-78 level in England and Wales of under £30 million a
year to £125 million a year in 1979-80 (in Scotland from about £6 million a
year to £20 million a year by 1980-81). The programme has traditionally com¬
plemented the work of major social programmes by providing extra facilities
which would otherwise not have been available, such as day nurseries, centres
for the elderly and language classes for immigrants, but is being recast so as
to cover industrial, environmental and recreational provision as well. The
urban programme represents only a small part of the central assistance to urban,
and other, local authorities. The main contribution is through the annual ‘rate
support’ grant, transport supplementary grant (in England and Wales only),
housing subsidy and other programmes. The Government has also provided
£100 million for inner city construction work between 1977 and 1979.
A co-ordinated ‘partnership’ approach is being adopted in seven English
areas whereby central and local government work together to tackle places
where the problems are greatest. Each partnership has a three-year action
programme based on the needs of the area and its particular priorities. Else¬
where in England 15 areas have been identified where the problems are on a
slightly smaller scale but still merit special attention. These areas are preparing
their own inner city programmes and will receive greatly increased funds from
the urban programme.
In Scotland a major urban renewal exercise in Glasgow to regenerate the
city’s east end is organised on somewhat similar lines to the partnership areas
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
162
in England. In Northern Ireland a special effort is being made to tackle
Belfast’s inner city problems.
The Inner Urban Areas Act 1978 is directed towards the economic revival of
inner urban areas, and gives powers to selected inner city local authorities
to support the creation of new employment opportunities and to improve the
environment of industrial areas.
Lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; nearly 290,000 buildings
are already listed. It is an offence to demolish or alter the character of any listed
building without special consent from the local planning authority or the
appropriate Secretary of State; where consent is given to demolish a building,
the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (for England) and similar
bodies for Scotland and Wales have an opportunity to make a photographic
record of the building. Emergency ‘building preservation notices’ can be
served by the local planning authority to protect buildings not yet listed.
The respective Secretaries of State (on the recommendation of the appropri¬
ate Historic Buildings Council) can make grants and loans for the repair or
maintenance of buildings (or groups of buildings) of outstanding interest, and
local authorities can make grants and loans for any building of architectural or
historic interest even if it is not listed. A Government-sponsored Architec¬
tural Heritage Fund provides loans for local historic buildings trusts.
Local planning authorities have designated for special protection over 4,000
‘conservation areas’ of particular architectural or historic interest. Grants and
loans are available for works for the preservation or enhancement of out¬
standing conservation areas.
The Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales are
responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and for the protec¬
tion of ancient monuments of which about 800 are in their care. The Ancient
Monument Boards recommend which monuments are considered to be of
national importance and therefore worthy of preservation.
In Northern Ireland 138 historic monuments are maintained and protected
by the State, and there is planning legislation on the listing of buildings of
special architectural or historic interest. Grants for repairs and maintenance
are made by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, which
is also responsible for the designation of ‘conservation areas’.
The local planning authorities have power to protect trees and woodlands
in the interest of amenity by means of tree preservation orders. When granting
planning permission for development, a local planning authority must, where
appropriate, impose conditions to secure the preservation or planting of trees.
Landowners are generally required to replace ‘preserved’ trees, which die or
are removed or destroyed in contravention of a preservation order.
Green Belts In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’ (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from building
development and where people can seek recreation) have been established or
proposed on the fringes of certain urban areas. Much of London’s green belt,
for example, is agricultural land or woodland, some of which can be used for

recreation. There are also country parks, public open spaces, playing fields
and golf courses specifically for recreational use.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use
at the coast providing, for example, recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coast’s natural attractions and preserve coastal areas of
scientific interest.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales, undertaken
by the Countryside Commission in 1966-70, recommended that certain
stretches of underdeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be
treated as heritage coast. There is a practical programme aimed at the desig¬
nation of 42 such coasts which together would cover over 1,300 kilometres
(808 miles), some 40 per cent of the underdeveloped coastline. Jointly with
local authorities, the Commission has defined 33 of these coasts so far,
protecting just over 1,000 kilometres (621 miles).
In 1965 the National Trust (see p 172) launched its Enterprise Neptune
campaign to raise funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great
natural beauty and recreational value. More than £3 million has been raised
so far and as a result the Trust has under its protection 622 kilometres (387
miles) of coastline in England and Wales. Some 127 kilometres (79 miles) of
coast in Scotland are protected by conservation agreements with the National
Trust for Scotland. In Northern Ireland 56 kilometres (35 miles) of coast and
coastal path have been acquired.
In exceptional cases economic arguments override conservation; the deve¬
lopment needs of North Sea oil and gas are making a major impact on remote
and unspoiled coastal areas in Scotland, for instance, but special planning
guidelines aim to ensure that oil-related activities are sited so as to make the
best use of existing labour and infra-structure and to minimise the effect on
the coastline. Provision has also been made for funds to be set aside for the
restoration of sites once there is no further need for them.
The protection of the coastline against erosion, for which the Department
of the Environment, the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office are centrally
responsible in Great Britain, presents difficult engineering problems and
heavy costs for the maritime local authorities. All sizeable coast protection
schemes drawn up by the authorities under the Coast Protection Act 1949
are investigated by government engineering staff. Substantial grants from
central funds (up to a maximum of 80 per cent) may be made to the authorities.
Protection against sea flooding where there is no question of erosion is the
responsibility of the water authorities (see pp 263 and 277). To help to prevent
the pollution of the sea and coastline, international conventions restrict the
discharge of oil into the sea (see p 169).
The display of outdoor advertisements is controlled by planning legislation.
General consents have been issued for certain classes of advertisement but
these can be withdrawn in particular cases where there is a serious threat to
amenity or public safety. Consent for advertisements outside these classes
must be sought from the local planning authority. Rural areas and urban
areas requiring special protection can be designated as areas of special control
which may impose more restrictive standards.
Countryside
Commissions
Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) encourage the development of facilities for open-air recreation in
164 BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the countryside. These include the provision by local authorities (some¬
times in association with other bodies) and private individuals of country
parks within easy reach of towns; the establishment of camping sites and picnic
areas; and the increased use of reservoirs, canals and other waterways for
bathing, sailing and other activities. Some 150 country parks and 200 picnic
sites have been recognised in England and Wales by the Countryside Com¬
mission. In Scotland a large number of local authority schemes for the provision
of a variety of countryside facilities have been approved for grant aid.
The Commissions are also responsible for encouraging and promoting
measures to conserve and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the
countryside and may undertake research projects and experimental schemes,
working in consultation with local authorities and such bodies as the Nature
Conservancy Council (see p 165) and the Sports Councils (see p 421). In
England and Wales, the Countryside Commission may give financial assistance
to public bodies and individuals carrying out countryside recreation and
amenity projects. Attention is increasingly being given to techniques of
countryside management to supplement the statutory planning controls.
National Parks
and Areas of
Outstanding
Natural Beauty
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) is empowered to
designate, for confirmation by the appropriate minister, national parks and
‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’ and to make proposals for the creation
of long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished: Northumberland, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, the North
York Moors and the Peak District in northern England; Snowdonia, the
Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons in Wales; Exmoor and Dart¬
moor in south-west England. They cover some 13,600 sq km (5,250 square
miles), or 9 per cent of the area of England and Wales. Administration is
the responsibility of special committees or planning boards which carry out
all or most of the planning functions. Some 33 areas of outstanding natural
beauty had been designated, covering some 14,500 sq km (5,600 square
miles).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures,
for which grants are available, such as tree planting and preservation, and
the removal of eyesores. In the national parks, other measures for the benefit
of the public include the provision of car parks, camping and caravan areas,
and information centres. All national parks and some other designated areas
have warden services. Most local authority expenditure on national parks
is met by central government grants. Some 2,640 km (1,650 miles) of long¬
distance footpaths and bridleways have been approved. Large stretches
of these paths are already public rights of way.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Countryside Committee advises on the
establishment of national parks and the designation of areas of outstanding
natural beauty. Eight areas of outstanding natural beauty have been designated
and six areas are being managed as country parks.
Although there are no national parks in Scotland, there are five national
park direction areas, in which all except minor planning applications are
subject to scrutiny by the Secretary of State. The areas are: Loch Lomond-
Trossachs; Glen Affric-Glen Cannich-Strathfarrar; Ben Nevis-Glen Coe-
Black Mount; the Cairngorms; and Loch Torridon-Loch Maree-Little Loch
Broom. Ministerial supervision, with the advice of the Countryside

Commission for Scotland, is exercised over planning permission in ‘areas of
special planning control’ which are areas of particular beauty, designated
by the Secretary of State. One such area forms part of the Pentland Hills
to the south of Edinburgh. Over 98 per cent of the land in Scotland
has been designated as countryside within the jurisdiction of the Countryside
Commission for Scotland.
The Forestry Commission (see p 284) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven forest parks in some of the finest country in Great Britain: Argyll, Glen
Frool, Glen More and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and
Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park on the borders of
England and Scotland. They cover some 243,000 hectares (600,000 acres), and
camping and other recreational facilities are provided in all of them. The
historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a forest park, is also open to
the public. In addition the Forestry Commission welcomes the public to much
of the land under its management. In Northern Ireland, the Department of
Agriculture has established six forest parks (Tollymore, Castlewellan,
Gortin Glen, Drum Manor, Gosford and Glenariff) and there are also
forest scenic drives and many recreational facilities in these and other forests.
County councils in England and Wales are required to prepare definitive maps
showing all public rights of way (footpaths and bridleways), which must be
kept free of obstruction. If a path is not shown on the map, a private citizen
may claim that it is a public right of way if it has been used and regarded as
such without hindrance for at least 20 years. Public footpaths are maintained
by local authorities who must also provide signposts and supervise landowners’
duties to repair stiles and gates. Local authorities in Great Britain can create
paths, close existing paths no longer needed for public use and divert paths
to secure either a shorter route or the efficient use of land. Local planning
authorities can also convert minor roads into footpaths or bridleways to
improve the amenities of their area.
There is no automatic right of public access to open country, although many
landowners permit such access more or less freely. Local planning authorities
can secure access by means of agreements with landowners; if agreements
cannot be obtained, authorities may acquire land or make orders for public
access. Similar powers cover Scotland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 600,000 hectares (1*5 million acres) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually
privately owned, but people other than the owner have various rights on or
over it, for example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by
law and cannot be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries
of State for the Environment or Wales. The Commons Registration Act
i965 provided for the registration of all commons and village greens. Under
the Countryside Act 1968 local authorities can provide facilities for enjoyment
on any common land to which the public has access.
The official body responsible for nature conservation in Great Britain is the
Nature Conservancy Council which has the functions of establishing, main¬
taining and managing nature reserves, advising ministers, providing general
information and advice, and commissioning or supporting research. There are
some 162 national nature reserves covering over 126,500 hectares (nearly
l66 BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
313,000 acres). Some 3,600 sites of special scientific interest have been
scheduled because of their flora, fauna or geological or physiographical
features.
About 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of Forestry Commission land are
managed as areas in which nature conservation is the main object. Local
authorities have declared more than 50 nature reserves, and voluntary organi¬
sations, which play an- important part in protecting wildlife, have established
over 1,000 reserves.
•
Land Derelict land, often concentrated in places associated with nineteenth century
Reclamation industrial development, presents special problems to planners. With central
government grants to help to meet the cost of local authority clearance schemes,
however, it is improved in a number of ways. Waste land has been turned to
farming or forestry use, as well as into sites for industry, housing, schools,
roads and recreational areas. Disused excavations have been filled with water
and equipped for water sports. Sometimes where removal of waste heaps is
not practicable, they have been made more pleasing to the eye by, for example,
covering with vegetation.
The Department of the Environment and the Scottish and Welsh Develop¬
ment Agencies provide central advice and information, and in Northern
Ireland grants are paid to landowners who restore or improve the appearance
of derelict sites.
Planning controls to prevent the spread of dereliction require that, when
permission is granted for mineral working, various measures must be taken to
minimise the disturbance caused by the work and to secure whatever restora¬
tion is practicable, either progressively or when working ceases. The use of
land for disposal of waste materials is also subject to conditions restricting
height or requiring treatment on completion.
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
Government measures to control environmental pollution, in which industry
and voluntary organisations co-operate, are long established, and are seen as
complementary to the planning system and the various measures to conserve
amenities and the country’s heritage.
Administration Responsibility for the control of pollution is shared by various central govern¬
ment departments, local and water authorities and statutory agencies. Industry
co-operates with these authorities and voluntary organisations help to focus
public interest on the process of control. An independent standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution advises the Government on national
and international matters concerning the pollution of the environment, on
the adequacy of research and on the future possibilities of danger to the
environment. The Secretary of State for the Environment has a co-ordinating
role concerning pollution matters as a whole, exercised through a Central
Unit on Environmental Pollution within his department. An independent
Standing Commission on Energy and the Environment provides the Govern¬
ment with advice on the inter-action of energy policies and the environment.
Specific responsibilities of the Department of the Environment in England
include air pollution control, fresh water pollution control, waste disposal,
control of radioactive wastes (jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food), of oil and chemicals on beaches and of noise other than
aircraft noise, traffic noise and noise at work. Most of these responsibilities in

The Control of
Pollution Act
1974
The Land
Scotland are exercised by the Scottish Development Department, in Wales
by the Welsh Office and in Northern Ireland by the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland.
The Department of Trade is responsible for the control of oil pollution at
sea (other than from offshore operations) and its clearance, and for the control
of aircraft noise. The Department of Transport is responsible for policies for
the control of traffic noise. The Department of Energy is responsible for the
control of pollution arising from the exploration and exploitation of oil. The
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland, the Northern Ireland Departments of Agriculture
and the Environment and the Health and Safety Executive are responsible
for the control of agricultural chemicals such as pesticides, for the protection
of fisheries from pollution and for the prevention of food pollution. The
protection of the health of employees at work (see p 327) is the responsibility
of the Department of Employment and is controlled by the Factory Inspec¬
torate which forms part of the Health and Safety Executive; in Northern
Ireland it is the responsibility of the Department of Manpower Services.
Other departments such as the Department of Education and Science, the
Department of Health and Social Security and the Scottish Home and Health
Department have an interest in health aspects of pollution control.
Local authorities are responsible for matters such as collection and disposal
of domestic wastes; control of air pollution from domestic and certain indus¬
trial premises and noise abatement measures. Sewerage and sewage treatment
and disposal are the responsibilities of water authorities in England and Wales
and of local authorities in Scotland. The regional water authorities in England,
the Welsh Water Authority in Wales, the river purification boards and islands
councils in Scotland and the Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland are responsible for control of water pollution.
The European Community has adopted a Community Environment
Programme as a result of which a number of measures for Community action
are being developed.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974, which applies to Great Britain, constitutes
the first comprehensive attempt to tackle pollution problems in different (but
related) government areas. It extends a wide range of new powers and duties
to local and water authorities, increases the existing powers to deal with con¬
trolled wastes, air and water pollution and noise, and contains important
provisions on the release of information to the public on environmental con¬
ditions. In particular the provisions dealing with waste on land institute a new
system for the comprehensive planning of regulation of waste disposal opera¬
tions so as to ensure that disposal is carried out to satisfactory standards and
that the best use is made of waste materials. The Act also increases the penalties
for a large number of pollution offences. It is being implemented in stages,
and most of it is in operation.
The main risks of land pollution lie in the indiscriminate dumping of waste
materials on land, application of pesticides and chemicals, fall-out of materials
from the atmosphere and the deposition of materials from floodwater. The
application of sewage sludge on farms, too, involves risks as well as benefits
to the land.
The Control of Pollution Act lays a duty on waste disposal authorities
(county councils and the Greater London Council in England, for example)
to ensure that there are adequate arrangements to dispose of controlled
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
wastes and to draw up and periodically revise a waste disposal plan. It also
establishes a licensing system for all waste disposal sites, treatment plants and
storage facilities receiving controlled wastes. In addition it provides for a more
intensive control system for certain specially hazardous or difficult wastes.
The Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme is a voluntary scheme set up by
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with the support of the
agricultural chemicals industry, under which the Advisory Committee on
Pesticides, with its Scientific Sub-Committee and Wildlife Panel, reviews the
safety of new pesticides and new uses of existing pesticides. Clearances from
the Advisory Committee may be provisional or limited, until sufficient infor¬
mation is available for a full clearance for a particular use to be given. The
scheme is being extended to include non-agricultural uses of pesticides. A
further voluntary scheme is being introduced to ensure that distributors of
pesticides, as well as users, take appropriate precautions.
Under the Litter Act 1958 and the Dangerous Litter Act 1971 it is an
offence, subject to a fine of up to £100, to leave litter on land in the open air
to which the public have free access. Under the Refuse Disposal (Amenity)
Act 1978 the deliberate dumping of rubbish carries a similar maximum fine
with the possibility of a £200 fine and three months’ imprisonment for
subsequent offences.
The Government encourages the reclamation and recycling of waste materials
wherever this is practicable and economic in order to reduce imports and
waste disposal costs and to help to conserve natural resources. Industry already
makes considerable use of reclaimed waste material such as metals, paper and
textiles. Local authorities collect about 200,000 tonnes of waste paper annually
and about 100,000 tonnes of ferrous scrap. Waste disposal authorities are
required under the Control of Pollution Act to take full account of oppor¬
tunities for waste reclamation in drawing up their waste disposal plans.
Voluntary organisations also organise collections of waste material.
The Government has set up a Waste Management Advisory Council and
launched a National Anti-Waste Programme to co-ordinate policy and pro¬
mote opportunities for reclamation and recycling through education and
advice. Extensive Government-supported research and development in this
area is in progress. The Department of the Environment is providing financial
and technical help to South Yorkshire and Tyne and Wear County Councils
which are constructing full-scale prototype plants for the mechanical sorting
of household refuse at Doncaster and Byker. These are expected to come into
operation in 1979. In addition Britain participates in discussions on waste
reclamation and recycling in the European Community.
Discharges of polluting matter into rivers, lakes, estuaries and some coastal
waters are controlled by law. The Control of Pollution Act contains a number
of provisions that will considerably strengthen existing legislation: for example,
part of the Act extends powers to control pollution of all inland water, inclu¬
ding specific underground waters, and tidal coastal water up to the three-mile
(4-8 km) limit. Much of this part of the Act is not yet in force but full imple¬
mentation is expected by the end of 1979. There has been a steady and signifi¬
cant improvement in water quality. The level of pollution in the tidal Thames,
for example, has been reduced to a quarter of the 1950s’ level—some 97
kinds of fish have been identified there since 1964.
More than 90 per cent of the British population is provided with main
drainage, and public authority sewage treatment works serve over four-fifths
of the population—a very high proportion by international standards.

Marine
Pollution
Clean Air
Control of marine pollution from ships is based largely on international con¬
ventions drawn up under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Maritime
Consultative Organisation, a United Nations agency with headquarters in
London, and implemented for British ships by domestic legislation. The
Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971, which gave effect to the International
Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil 1954, as
amended in 1962 and 1969, makes it an offence for ships of any nationality to
discharge any oil into British territorial waters and for British registered ships
to discharge persistent oil anywhere at sea, except in accordance with very
stringent regulations. Further amendments to the convention, made in 1971
but not yet in force, relate to the design of tankers and are aimed at reducing
the volume of oil that could escape in the event of an accident. The Inter¬
national Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 (as
modified by the 1978 Protocol) will, when in force, replace the 1954 convention
by more stringent requirements and will regulate pollution by chemicals,
sewage and garbage as well as by oil.
The Department of Trade has developed a nationwide organisation, based
on the Coastguard and the Marine Survey Service, to deal with oil spills at
sea which threaten to cause coastal pollution or are likely to endanger wildlife.
If necessary, action is taken to clear the oil by using low toxicity dispersant
and spraying equipment. Central government and local authorities have con¬
tingency plans for dealing with oil and chemical pollution of beaches and in
inshore waters.
The development of the offshore oil industry has brought an increased risk
of oil pollution in the North Sea. Offshore operators are required to ensure
that oil does not escape into the sea and are also expected to have contingency
plans for dealing with oil spills. Not all traces of oil can be removed from water
separated from crude oil before its discharge from production platforms into
the sea, and these discharges from offshore installations are normally granted
exemption from the 1971 Act subject to strict controls laid down by the
Department of Energy. The Department of the Environment, the Welsh
Office, the Scottish Development Department and the Northern Ireland
Department of the Environment grant exemption subject to similar controls
for discharges from land-based sources.
The loading of wastes for dumping at sea by means of vehicles, ships, air¬
craft, hovercraft, marine platforms and conveyor belts is controlled by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the appropriate departments
in Scotland and Northern Ireland through the Dumping at Sea Act 1974
which gave statutory backing to the voluntary arrangements which had
operated for several years. A licence has to be obtained for the permanent
deposit of any substance or article into tidal waters and the sea. Dumping at
sea is permitted on the basis of the scientific criteria set out in the annexes to
the Oslo Convention (International Convention for the Prevention of Marine
Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft 1972) and the London Con¬
vention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other
Matter I972- The 1974 Act does not however control discharges of liquid
effluent from pipelines, which are covered by the Control of Pollution Act,
nor discharges incidental to or derived from the normal operation of a ship,
aircraft, vehicle, hovercraft or marine structure.
Responsibility for clean air rests primarily with local authorities. Under the
provisions of the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968 they may declare csmoke
control areas within which the emission of smoke from chimneys constitutes
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
an offence. Over half the premises in the conurbations are now covered by
smoke control orders. Emissions from most industrial premises are also subject
to the control of local authorities under the Clean Air Acts. The emission of
dark smoke from any trade or industrial premises or from the chimney of any
building is in general prohibited, and new furnaces must be capable as far as
practicable of smokeless operation. The height of the chimney serving a new
furnace must generally be approved by the local authority, and approved grit
and dust arrestment plant has to be installed. Regulations have been made
which prescribe specific limits to the quantities of grit and dust which may
be emitted from certain furnaces. Industrial premises that give rise to parti¬
cularly offensive or dangerous emissions are, in England and Wales, under the
control of the Alkali and Clean Air Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
Executive. The Inspectorate requires the best practicable means to be used
to prevent or abate emissions. Founded in 1863, it was probably the world’s
first air pollution control agency. Controls are also in force on emissions from
motor vehicles, such as the maximum permitted lead content of petrol which
was reduced from 0-84 grammes per litre in 1973 to 0-45 grammes per litre
at the beginning of 1978.
The Clean Air Council (set up in 1956) and a similar council for Scotland
review the progress made in abating air pollution in Great Britain. Notable
progress has been made towards the achievement of cleaner air and a better
environment, especially in the last twenty years or so. It is estimated that the
total amount of smoke in the air has been reduced by about 80 per cent since
the early 1950s. The domestic smoke control programme has been particularly
important in achieving this result. London no longer experiences the dense
smoke-laden ‘smogs’ of the 1950s and in central London winter sunshine has
increased by 70 per cent since 1958. Similar improvement has been achieved
in other cities including Glasgow and Sheffield. Control measures have
reduced urban ground-level concentrations of sulphur dioxide in Britain by
40 per cent in the last ten years.
Noise Local authorities enforce noise control and must inspect their areas for noise
nuisances and act to secure abatement. The Control of Pollution Act improved
and strengthened local authorities’ existing powers and enabled them to set
up ‘noise abatement zones’ within which they can require noise levels to be
held constant or reduced and within which noise levels may not be increased
without their permission. The Act contains special provisions to control
noise from construction and demolition sites.
Results of the country’s first ‘quiet town’ experiment, sponsored in
Darlington by the Noise Advisory Council are being studied. The aim
of the experiment was to reduce unnecessary noise wherever it occurred.
Transport is one of the main offenders in noise pollution, and British
measures, like those of other countries, aim to tackle the problem, first by
reducing noise at source, by insisting that aircraft and motor vehicles should
be made quieter, and secondly by protecting people from its effects. As part
of this process, grants have been made towards the sound-proofing of some
rooms in houses subject to loud aircraft noise, and sound-insulation grants
have been made for rooms in homes likely to be subject to excessive noise
levels from traffic on some new trunk roads.
The control of aircraft noise is provided for in a number of statutes relating
to civil aviation. Measures taken to abate noise include the insulation of homes
against noise—for which the major airport owners have provided grants—and
the progressive introduction of quieter aircraft.
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Radioactivity

All aircraft landing or taking off in Britain must be ‘noise certificated’ in
accordance with noise standards for the manufacture of new aircraft which
have been internationally agreed and are kept under review by the Inter¬
national Civil Aviation Organisation. As far as civil subsonic jet aircraft are
concerned, the latest of these became applicable in August 1978. When intro¬
duced into British legislation it will require noise levels of newly designed
aircraft to be significantly lower than those of aircraft meeting the previous
standards, which were effective from about 1969, and much lower than those
of aircraft presently exempted from the previous standards because they were
designed before 1969. Noise standards are also being applied to propeller-
driven aircraft, and the International Civil Aviation Organisation is examining
the possibility of setting standards for civil helicopter noise and for noise from
future civil supersonic transport aircraft (the noise level of the Concorde
supersonic aircraft is comparable with that of older subsonic aircraft,
although not as quiet as that of the new wide-bodied jets).
There are to be prohibitions on the use of non-noise-certificated subsonic
jets acquired by British operators after September 1978, and on the use of all
such aircraft on the United Kingdom Register of Civil Aircraft from 1986.
All these measures are expected to reduce substantially the noise nuisance
to people living near British airports.
In the United Kingdom radiation exposure of the population resulting from
industrial and other processes represents only a small fraction of that to which
the population is exposed from the natural environment. Nevertheless, that
fraction is subject to stringent control because of possible effects on health or
longer-term genetic effects. Under the Radioactive Substances Act i960 users
of radioactive materials other than those subject to licence under the Nuclear
Installations Act (see below) must be registered by the appropriate department,
and authorisation is also required for the disposal of radioactive waste, with
exemption for very minor uses and disposals. The Health and Safety Execu¬
tive, through its Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, is the authority concerned
with the granting of nuclear site licences for commercial nuclear installations.
No such installation may be constructed or operated without a licence granted
by the Executive.
The Government is carrying out a review of the existing arrangements for
the control of radioactive waste. Various methods are used for disposing of
such waste. Most low-level solid waste is buried; intermediate-level solid
waste is mostly stored, with some disposed of at sea; and highly radioactive
liquid waste is at present stored in tanks while research proceeds on methods
of disposal. One such method under investigation is the ‘Harvest’ process for
converting this waste into a solid insoluble glass which would be contained in
stainless steel cylinders and might be buried in stable geological formations.
The process was developed by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority
which, in collaboration with the Institute of Geological Sciences, is partici¬
pating in a programme of the European Atomic Energy Community to study
different types of formation which might be suitable for radioactive waste
disposal.

VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS
Voluntary organisations are particularly active in ensuring that proposed
changes in the use of land take full account of the interests of the public and
considerations of amenity. The National Trust for England, Wales and North¬
ern Ireland, founded in 1895, is the largest private landowner in Britain and
has 610,000 members. For the benefit of the public it owns 162,000 hectares
(400,000 acres) of land and protects from harmful development a further
28,700 hectares (71,000 acres). It owns 232 historic buildings and large
stretches of coastline. Properties in Scotland covering some 33,200 hectares
(82,000 acres) are protected by the National Trust for Scotland, an indepen¬
dent body founded in 1931, which has over 82,000 members.
The Town and Country Planning Association, founded in 1899, seeks to
improve the qualities of land use and planning and operates a planning aid
service for local amenity groups; while the Royal Town Planning Institute
encourages high standards in town planning. The Civic Trust, established in
1957, encourages the protection and improvement of the environment, high
standards in architecture and planning and has been closely associated with
the drafting of conservation legislation. It supports and advises over 1,200
local amenity societies. Associate trusts are linked with the Civic Trust in the
north-east and north-west of England, Scotland and Wales.
Other voluntary societies concerned with amenity in town and country
include: the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland
and the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside; the National
Association for Environmental Education; the Keep Britain Tidy Group; the
Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society and the Scottish
Rights of Way Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the
Protection of Ancient Buildings and the Ancient Monuments Society; the
Georgian Group and the Scottish Georgian Society; the Saltire Society
(which encourages the preservation of the architectural heritage in Scotland)
and the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society; the Victorian Society; the
Pilgrim Trust; the Council for British Archaeology; the Historic Churches
Preservation Trust; the Council for National Parks; the Prince of Wales’s
Committee (which promotes environmental improvements in Wales); the
Inland Waterways Association; Friends of the Earth; the Conservation
Society; the Noise Abatement Society; and the National Society for Clean Air.
Among a large number of voluntary bodies concerned with nature conserva¬
tion are the Society for the Promotion of Nature Conservation, the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Council
for Nature.
The Committee for Environmental Conservation, comprising many of the
main voluntary organisations, acts as a liaison body and is concerned with
broader questions of amenity than those covered by individual societies. The
Centre for Environmental Studies is an independent research body concerned
with urban, regional and other planning problems.
9 Housing
A home for all households at a price within their means is a central aim of
housing policy. Others include: a better balance between new building and
renovation with social as well as financial costs taken into account; reasonable
stability in household housing costs; attention to the needs of people with
special problems such as the elderly, the disabled and the handicapped; a
degree of priority for people who may have problems in finding suitable
housing but who are not traditionally thought of as ‘in need’, such as middle-
aged single people; increased scope for mobility; easier means for people to
obtain the type of tenure they want; and the safeguarding of tenants’
independence.
Although some households still live in unsatisfactory conditions, the pro¬
portion of the total is relatively small, and the Government believes that it no
longer makes sense to consider housing problems in national totals; atten¬
tion and resources are therefore being directed more selectively to the areas,
often in inner cities, with the most pressing needs. A system of local strategies
and investment programmes has been instituted as a means by which local
authorities can, in consultation with local bodies concerned, plan compre¬
hensively for development in both public and private sectors.
Public expenditure provision for housing has had to be more strictly
limited in recent times, but the expenditure programme is still substantial,
standing at over £4,700 million a year.
Housing There are over 20'5 million dwellings, houses being much more common
Characteristics than flats (the ratio is roughly four to one). Nationally the number of dwellings
is slightly larger than the number of households, but there continue to be
shortages in certain areas and, because of changing social habits, the houses
available may not always be of the type in demand.
More than two families in every five live in a post-1945 home, but there
remain a large number of old dwellings, some of which have been kept in good
repair and modernised, but many others of which (particularly in the centres
of cities) are unsatisfactory by modern standards.
Throughout this century pressure on housing accommodation has been
increased more by the rapid rise in the number of separate households than
by the increase in the population. While the number of people has increased
by about two fifths, the number of households has more than doubled.
Families are smaller, there has been a substantial reduction in the sharing of
homes by three generations, and there has been an increase in the number of
one-person households.
Over half of all dwellings are owned by their occupiers, nearly a third
are rented from public housing authorities, and most of the remainder are
rented from private landlords. There are variations, however, in the distribu¬
tion of tenure between different parts of the country; in Scotland more than
half the dwellings are rented from public authorities. Private rented accom¬
modation is generally more common in the central parts of large towns, while
owner-occupation is more frequent in outer suburbs and in country areas.
New house construction is undertaken, on a roughly equal scale, by both
public and private sectors, and in addition about five per cent of new building

Mortgage Loans
is carried out by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public authori¬
ties provide dwellings mainly for renting while private interests build mainly
for sale to owner-occupiers. There is very little building of private dwellings
to rent.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Secretary of State for the Environment in England
and by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. (For Northern Ireland
see p 179.)
Most of the public housing is provided by 459 local housing authorities,
which are responsible for ensuring that the supply of housing in their areas is
adequate. The authorities are: in England and Wales (outside London) the
district councils; in London, the Greater London Council, the London
borough councils and the Common Council of the City of London; and in
Scotland, the district and islands councils. Other public housing authorities
are the new town authorities, the Scottish Special Housing Association which
supplements building by local authorities in Scotland, and the Development
Board for Rural Wales.
The central government departments specify certain standards for the con¬
struction and equipment of all new dwellings; these are enforced by the local
authorities. Subsidies are made available to the authorities to assist them with
housing costs, and guidance is given on design and layout.
Local authorities are involved in many other aspects of housing policy, such
as the payment of house renovation grants and the implementation of housing
renewal programmes. A growing number are establishing housing advisory
centres to provide information on most aspects of housing.
Research into building materials and techniques, as well as into the social,
economic and design aspects of housing, is undertaken within the Depart¬
ment of the Environment. It is carried out by the Building Research Establish¬
ment of the Department’s research directorate as well as by the directorates of
economics, statistics and housing development. The Research and Develop¬
ment Group of the Scottish Development Department also undertakes
research. Sponsored work is carried out by universities, polytechnics, market
research firms and the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, and local
authorities may also have housing research programmes.
The Government is advised on the need for, and application of, research
and development by the Construction and Housing Research Advisory
Council. Advice on ways of increasing productivity in house-building is also
provided by the National Building Agency.
The number of people owning their own houses has more than doubled in
the last 20 years, and the 11 million owner-occupied dwellings in Britain
account for over half of the total housing stock.
Loans to enable people to buy their own houses are available from various
sources, including building societies, insurance companies, industrial and
provident societies and local authorities.
Building societies (see also p 349) are by far the largest sources of such
funds; their share of the market being over 90 per cent. They do not build
houses themselves but lend money upon security by way of a mortgage on the
home bought for owner-occupation. They usually advance up to 80 per cent
of their valuation of a property but it is possible to borrow up to 100 per cent
with the help of an appropriate insurance guarantee. Loans are normally
repayable over periods of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years in certain
HOUSING
circumstances) by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and interest.
The average price in Britain of all houses mortgaged to building societies in
1977 was about £13,900. In 1977 the societies advanced some £6,700 million.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on their mortgage interest pay¬
ments arising on up to £25,000 of their mortgages (on one house only) and in
1977_78 this amounted to about £1,055 million. An alternative form of
assistance is the option mortgage scheme, designed to help those with smaller
incomes. It allows the borrower to receive, instead of tax relief, a subsidy
which has the effect of reducing the rate of interest on the loan. Assistance
under this scheme in Great Britain amounted in 1977-78 to £150 million.
There is an associated guarantee scheme under which mortgage loans of up
to too per cent of the valuation of a house (not exceeding £14,000) may be
made to those participating in the option mortgage scheme. Other ways of
helping people with lower incomes to become owner-occupiers include a
scheme which allows those buying homes for the first time, subject to certain
conditions, to defer part of their mortgage payments that would normally be
due in the early years until later in the mortgage term, and equity sharing
systems. The Home Purchase and Housing Corporation Guarantee Act 1978
provides for assistance to be given to first-time house buyers who have been
saving. The assistance consists of a tax-free cash bonus on savings, payable at
the time of house purchase, and a loan of up to £600, interest-free for the
first five years and then repayable over the remaining life of the mortgage.
Building For building in the private sector the National House Building Council sets
Standards standards and enforces them by inspection and certification. Almost all new
private houses are covered by the Council’s scheme which carries ten-year
protection against major structural defects. Two-year protection is also given
against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will not grant mortgages on a new
house unless it is covered by a Council certificate.
Public Sector Public housing authorities own some 6-6 million houses and flats. The
Housing number of homes owned by each authority varies widely, several having a
stock of well over 100,000.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of new house construction by
raising loans on the open market or by borrowing from the Public Works
Loan Board. Current expenditure, including maintenance and management
costs and loan interest and repayments, is met from rents, supplemented by
subsidies from the Government and, where required to balance housing
revenue accounts, from the rates. Local authorities are required to charge
their tenants reasonable rents (which keep a balance between the interests of
tenants and ratepayers) without making a profit. Subsidies for public housing
in Great Britain during 1977-78 are expected to total some £1,827 million
(including rent rebates payable to poorer tenants to assist in meeting rents of
accommodation suited to their needs). Supplementary subsidies assist local
authorities with slum clearance.
In selecting tenants for new or vacant dwellings, local authorities normally
give preference to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions,
but they are free to allocate homes according to their own schemes. Authori¬
ties normally establish waiting lists and treat applicants (outside priority
categories) in order of application; some require applicants to fulfil residence
qualifications before they are accepted on waiting lists.
Local authorities have a statutory duty to secure that accommodation (not
necessarily an authority house) is available for homeless people who have

Rented Housing
dependent children or are vulnerable on grounds such as age or disability.
Most building is undertaken by private firms under contract although a
number of authorities employ direct labour to build houses. Some authorities
work in consortia to make the best use of experience and technical information,
and to initiate research and development projects.
Dwellings are constructed to meet the needs of different sizes of household.
More than a quarter are of the single-bedroom type suitable for smaller house¬
holds including the elderly, but the majority are designed for families and
have two or three bedrooms, one or two living-rooms and a kitchen, bathroom
and lavatory.
Sheltered accommodation (with an alarm system and resident warden) is
provided for elderly people who need this degree of support. Increasing im¬
portance is also being placed on the housing needs of physically handicapped
people, and a small but growing proportion of the new housing stock is
suitable for them. Also receiving attention are the needs of other ‘disadvan¬
taged’ groups such as one-parent families, the mentally handicapped, the
ex-mentally ill and women who have suffered from violence within the
family.
Public housing is built to a high minimum standard. In England and
Wales, for example, some 90 per cent of the new houses built for local
authorities in 1976 had central heating and the average floor area of houses to
accommodate five people was 88-4 square metres (952 square feet).
Local authorities are being encouraged to take a broad view of their re¬
sponsibilities for housing management and to consider the wider social and
economic consequences of their housing policies. The aim is for them to
develop a comprehensive housing service, taking full account of people’s
needs and preferences, making the best use of all the resources available in
both public and private sectors, and adopting a flexible view of the way the
housing stock is used. A high standard of skill and organisation is needed to
meet this objective, and emphasis is being given to improved training for all
grades of housing staff. A Housing Services Advisory Group, composed of
central and local government officials, elected councillors and other housing
experts, has been set up to advise local authorities on good professional
practice in housing management and maintenance. A small Housing Services
Advisory Unit has also been created within the Department of the Environ¬
ment to stimulate an exchange of ideas and information on good management
practice and to provide advice on policy within the Department.
During the last quarter of a century there has been a steady decline in the
number of rented dwellings available from private landlords (including tied
accommodation)—from over 50 per cent of the housing stock to about 15
per cent (3 million). Major factors have been the increased demand for
owner-occupation, the greater availability of public rented housing, and
the operation of rent restriction. Privately rented dwellings form a high
proportion of the older housing, most landlords being individuals with limited
holdings; some rented housing is provided by larger property owners, in¬
cluding property companies.
Most privatelv rented dwellings are subject to rent restriction. Tenants have
a wide degree of security of tenure, and may not be evicted without a court
order. Harassment of residential occupiers is a criminal offence. Tenants with
incomes up to average levels are eligible for assistance with their rent under a
national scheme of rent allowances which is operated by local authorities and
financed mainly by government subsidies.
HOUSING

Improving
Older Houses
There are three forms of rent restriction: control, regulation and the fixing
of a reasonable rent by a rent tribunal. Controlled rents (which apply to
dwellings of low rateable value where the tenant has lived continuously since
before 1957) are fixed, and may be increased only to an extent which reflects
expenditure by the landlord on improvements and repairs. However, if a
controlled dwelling reaches a satisfactory standard of amenity, the landlord
may transfer it to the alternative system of rent regulation, which applies
generally to privately rented accommodation, other than in the luxury class,
except for accommodation where the landlord lives on the same premises. In a
regulated tenancy a ‘fair rent’ is fixed by independent rent officers, at the
request of the landlord, the tenant, or both; if the rent officer’s decision is
objected to by the landlord or the tenant, it is referred to a rent assessment
committee. Once fixed, the rent is registered and not normally reviewed for
at least three years.
The third form of rent restriction applies to tenants with resident landlords
and tenants of a few other types of furnished accommodation who may refer
their tenancy agreements to a rent tribunal for determination of a reasonable
rent. Tribunals may grant tenants security of tenure for up to six months with
a possibility of further periods.
Housing associations extend the choice of housing (which for most people is
between owner-occupying or renting from a public authority or a private
landlord) by providing an increasing addition to the accommodation available
for rent. The associations, which have a tradition dating back to the medieval
almshouse trusts, cater for people who would otherwise look to a local
authority for a home. In addition to normal family housing, they provide
particularly for the special needs of elderly or disabled people.
Since the early 1960s the Government has encouraged the growth of these
non-profit-making associations which between them own nearly 300,000
dwellings. The National Federation of Housing Associations has 2,200
associations as its members, and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associa¬
tions covers 124 associations in Scotland.
Rented housing schemes carried out by housing associations qualify for a
government grant but only if the association is registered with the Housing
Corporation, a statutory body set up by the Government. The Corporation’s
register contains details of more than 2,600 associations. Rented dwellings
owned by housing associations come within the fair rent and rent allowance
arrangements.
Alternative forms of tenure on local authority estates and within the
housing association sector are being encouraged in order to give occupiers a
greater stake in the ownership or management of their homes. The Housing
Corporation is engaged in a pilot programme including co-ownership and
community leasehold schemes. The Corporation has also set up a specialist
unit, the Co-operative Housing Agency, to advise, assist and finance housiner
co-operatives (schemes of collective ownership and management).
Modernisation and conversion of substandard housing, with the help of grants
from public funds, has increasingly been encouraged as an alternative to clear¬
ing and rebuilding and as a way of preserving established communities and of
making more economic use of resources. This policy of improvement rather
than redevelopment has been reinforced by the Government’s decision to give
priority to inner city regeneration. Financial assistance is available for the
improvement of individual dwellings or of whole areas of older housing.
178
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Slum Clearance
Renovation grants to improve over 2-35 million homes were approved in
Great Britain between 1966 and 1976.
There are four types of renovation grant: improvement grants, for carrying
out improvements to a high standard or for conversion into flats; intermediate
grants, for the provision of standard amenities and associated repairs; special
grants (not available in Scotland) for providing standard amenities in houses
of multiple occupation; and repairs grants, available only in ‘housing action
areas’ and ‘general improvement areas’ (see below). The amount of the award
depends on the location of the dwelling: up to 75 per cent (sometimes 90 per
cent) of the eligible expense in housing action areas; 60 per cent in general
improvement areas; and 50 per cent elsewhere. A government contribution
amounting to 75 per cent (90 per cent in housing action and general improve¬
ment areas) of each grant is paid to the local authority.
In order to tackle systematically the improvement of whole areas of older
housing, local authorities in England and Wales have powers to declare
‘general improvement areas’ and ‘housing action areas’. General improvement
areas consist of fundamentally sound houses and a stable population. The aim
is to encourage owners to improve their dwellings with the aid of enhanced
grants while the local authority improves the environment with financial aid
from the Government. In areas of particularly poor housing, where bad
physical conditions are combined with social stress, local authorities are em¬
powered to declare housing action areas with the aim of improving living
conditions and housing management, for the benefit of the residents, within a
five-year period. High rates of grant are available, and the local authority has
special powers for compulsory purchase and compulsory improvement in
order to secure rehabilitation within the time-scale. Financial aid for en¬
vironmental improvement is available from the Government, though on a
smaller scale than in general improvement areas. By the end of March
1977 there were 1,086 general improvement areas and 212 housing action
areas in England and Wales. There are broadly similar arrangements in
Scotland where, however, the term ‘general improvement area is not used
and where the ‘housing action area’ powers are available for areas in which at
least half the houses fail to meet prescribed physical standards.
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance and redevelopment have been major
features of housing policy. Since the mid-1950s about 3’3 million people have
been rehoused in England and Wales as a result of slum clearance programmes.
Clearance of large areas of ‘irredeemable’ slums is now almost at an end and
greater emphasis is placed on renewal and modernisation wherever possible.
Local authorities receive special financial assistance from the Government.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or
can be provided by them, for people displaced by slum clearance. Owners of
land compulsorily acquired during slum clearance programmes receive as
compensation either the full market value or, if the land consists of unfit
houses, a sum based on the value of the cleared site; additional payments are,
however, made to most owner-occupiers of unfit houses to bring their com¬
pensation up to market value.
Redevelopment of the slums has presented many problems. Most of the
areas were seriously overcrowded; not only were the houses built to a high
density but they were themselves over-occupied. While the areas usually
lacked social facilities they had the advantage that they were already well
provided with the basic utilities, jobs were usually available in the vicinity
and town centre facilities were not far away. The aim in carrying out slum
HOUSING
179
clearance was thus to house as many people as possible on the cleared sites.
This was most easily achieved if fairly large areas were cleared and high-
rise flats built. The results in many areas are now seen as less than satisfactory
in spite of the high standard of many of the homes themselves. The main
criticisms of multi-storey flats are that they are inhuman in scale and
unsuitable for families with young children because of the lack of convenient
play space. The need to build to a reasonably high density in inner city
areas still exists, but is now being met by carefully grouped low-rise
blocks, including individual houses wherever possible.
Northern Ireland Northern Ireland has a major problem of unfit and derelict housing, especially
in Belfast. The situation has been made worse by the civil disturbances. With
the problem of unfit housing in mind, several recent changes have been made
in housing policy emphasis, including a greater concentration on improving
the existing stock and a major attack on housing problems in Belfast.
The Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 enables housing action areas
to be declared where concerted action can be taken to improve and rehabilitate
the housing. A £130-million programme for the rehabilitation of Belfast
began in 1977.
The Northern Ireland Department of the Environment is responsible for
housing policy in the Province and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
for the provision and management of the public authority housing and for
dealing with unfit housing, whether publicly or privately owned.
The development of housing associations is being encouraged so that they
can undertake the rehabilitation of older properties, especially in Belfast,
and provide new homes for groups such as the disabled and the elderly.
A Northern Ireland Committee of the National Federation of Housing
Associations encourages the development of housing associations, particularly
to help the elderly, the handicapped and those living in older houses which
can be improved or rehabilitated.
In the private rented sector legislation is planned to replace the existing
rent restriction provisions with a single statute designed to safeguard tenants’
rights while providing landlords with sufficient rental income to maintain
their property in good condition.
Another trend in housing policy is the attempt to widen housing options
available to families, particularly those who wish to own their own homes. The
option mortgage scheme is being introduced, and it is intended that the
savings bonus and loans scheme for first-time home buyers will also be
extended to Northern Ireland.
)
10 The Churches
The Church of
England
Everyone in Britain has the right of religious freedom (in teaching, worship
and observance) without interference from the community or the State.
Churches and religious societies may own property, conduct schools, and
propagate their beliefs in speech and writing. There is no religious or denomi¬
national bar to the holding of public office.
Clergy of the established churches of England and Scotland work in
services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, national hospitals
and prisons, and are paid a salary by the State. Clergy of other denominations
are also appointed. Voluntary schools provided by any religious denomination
may be wholly or partly maintained from public funds.
There is no precise or uniform information about the number of church
adherents since no inquiries are made about religious beliefs in censuses1 or
other official returns, and each church adopts its own criteria in counting its
members. Membership figures in this chapter are therefore approximate.
The established Church of England’s relationship with the State is one of
mutual obligation—privileges accorded to the Church balanced by certain
duties which it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always be a member of the
Church, and promises to uphold it; Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans are appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister;
all clergy take an oath of allegiance to the Crown. The Church can regulate
its own worship. The two archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops (according to their
seniority as diocesan bishops) sit in the House of Lords. Clergy of the Church
(together with those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the
Roman Catholic Church) are not allowed to sit in the House of Commons.
The Church has two provinces: Canterbury, comprising 29 dioceses, and
York, 14 dioceses. The dioceses are divided into parishes, of which there are
some 13,860. The Archbishop of Canterbury is ‘Primate of All England’, and
the Archbishop of York ‘Primate of England’. Of the population born and
resident in the two provinces (roughly 46 million), about 60 per cent are
baptised into the Church and some 20 per cent are confirmed members.
The central governing body, the General Synod, has both spiritual authority
and legislative and administrative powers; and bishops, clergy and lay
members are involved in decisions. Certain important issues must be referred
for the approval of the dioceses before being decided by the Synod. Lay
members are associated with church government in the parishes through the
ancient office of churchwarden and the modern parochial church councils.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with
such matters as education, inter-church relations, social questions, recruitment
and training for the ministry, church work at home and overseas and the care
of church buildings, particularly those of historic and architectural interest.
The Synod is also concerned with church schools; church colleges of educa¬
tion; theological colleges; and establishments for training women in pastoral
work.
1 In Northern Ireland, recent full censuses have contained an optional question about
people’s religious professions.
THE CHURCHES
181
The Anglican
Communion
The Church of
Scotland
The Free
Churches
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
matters of purely ecclesiastical concern.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses,
with contributions to a central fund for the maintenance of central services,
including capital expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants
for training candidates for ordination. The State makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses. The Church’s endowment income is mainly
administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for
the payment of clergy stipends and pensions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 25 autonomous provinces in Britain and
overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of about
67 million. In the British Isles, there are four provinces: the Church of England
(established), the Church in Wales, the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and
the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years (the last meeting was in 1978), the Lambeth Conference
meets for unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops: presided over
by the Archbishop of Canterbury, it has no executive authority, but enjoys
great prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other com¬
munions, and attitudes to political and social questions are widely studied.
The Anglican Consultative Council—an assembly of laymen and clergy as well
as bishops which meets every two or three years—is designed to provide
consultations within the Anglican Communion and to serve as an instrument
of common action. The council next meets in 1979.
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian form of government. Its status as
the national church derives from the Treaty of Union 1707 and the Church of
Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete freedom in all spiritual
matters. It appoints its own officers, and its decisions on questions of doctrine
and discipline are not subject to parliamentary discussion or modification.
All ministers have equal status, each of some 2,000 churches being governed
locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and the elected elders
of the church; above the Kirk Session is the Court of the Presbytery, then the
Court of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly, consisting of elected
ministers and elders, which meets annually under the presidency of an elected
moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the
General Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner.
The training for the ministry (to which women may be admitted) has given
the Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The adult communicant membership of
the Church of Scotland is estimated at over 1 million.
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe the ‘nonconformist’
churches of England and Wales (which dissent from certain practices of the
established church and, generally speaking, have distinctive convictions
regarding organisation and worship) and Protestant churches in other parts of
Britain (apart from the established Church of Scotland). Certain other churches
and religious associations have links with the main Free Churches.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with some 558,000
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evan¬
gelical revival by John Wesley, and is based on a 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not
join the union include the Independent Methodists (5,200 members) and the
Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 4,200 members).

The United Reformed Church, with some 170,000 members, was formed
in 1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
community of dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century.
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of
which belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in
1813), with a total membership of about 182,000; in addition there are separate
Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland and other Baptist churches.
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland
(with nearly 125,000 regular communicants in Northern Ireland); the Pres¬
byterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the
revivalist movement led in 1735 by Howell Harris and now numbers about
91,000; the Union of Welsh Independents; the Free Church of Scotland; the
United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland;
the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian
Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of
Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations include: the Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States of
America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an organised community
in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the British Province of the
Moravian Church, which is an international missionary church; the Free
Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in
1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; and the Congregational
Federation, formed from Congregational churches which did not enter the
United Reformed Church. The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), with
about 20,000 members in Britain and over 400 places for worship, came into
being in the middle of the seventeenth century under the leadership of George
Fox and works for peace and the relief of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 82
other countries and has a strength of about 2 million. Within Britain it has
some 100,000 active members operating from more than 1,000 centres of
worship. Believing in a very practical expression of Christian concern, the
Salvation Army has 209 centres to help people in need.
There are also a number of other religious organisations with churches or
assemblies in Britain, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church); and the Christian Scientists with some 300
branch churches and societies in the British Isles.
The Roman The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tem-
Catholic Church porarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish
hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in
1878. There are now 6 Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each under
an archbishop, 26 episcopal dioceses, and some 3,000 parishes. In Northern
Ireland, there are 9 dioceses, some of which have territory partly in the Irish
Republic. It is estimated that there are some 4-2 million adherents (including
children) to the Roman Catholic faith in the whole of Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
its children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the
Catholic faith. Many schools for Catholic children are staffed by members of
the religious orders who also undertake other social work such as nursing,
child care, and the conduct of homes for old people.

THE CHURCHES
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but the
community in Britain dates from 1656; consisting of some 410,000 people,
including both Sephardi (originally from Spain and Portugal) and Ashkenazi
(from Germany and Eastern Europe), it has become one of the largest
groups of Jews in Europe. The community is divided into two schools
of thought—the Orthodox, to which about 80 per cent of practising Jews
belong; and the Reform, which originated in 1840 and was followed in 1901 by
the Liberal Jewish movement. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group
(Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi
group. Jewish congregations in Britain number about 45°- Jewish denomina¬
tional schools are attended by about one in five Jewish children.
Immigrants to Britain from Commonwealth and foreign countries have estab¬
lished centres of worship, especially in London, for their own communities.
Among the Christian communities represented are Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries and the Armenian Church.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. For the many Muslims in
Britain there are mosques or Islamic centres in London, Birmingham, Man¬
chester, Cardiff, Glasgow and in many other large cities. The community’s
headquarters are at the London Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre.
The Buddhist Society, with headquarters in London and centres in most other
large towns and many universities, publishes and makes known the principles
of Buddhism and encourages their study and practice. It adheres to no one
school of Buddhism. There are other centres for Buddhism, and also many
centres of eastern philosophy and religion among immigrant communities.
The British Council of Churches, with representatives or observers from all
the main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates common action
and seeks to further Christian unity. It works through five divisions: Christian
Aid (which has a separate constitution); Conference for World Mission;
Ecumenical Affairs; Community Affairs; and International Affairs.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches in England and
Wales. It promotes unity and joint action among the Free Churches and is a
channel for communication with central and local government.
The permanent Anglican-Roman Catholic Commission explores points of
possible unity between the two communions.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches in the British Isles also participate
in the World Council of Churches (of which the British Council of Churches
is an associated national council) which links together some 290 churches in
over 80 countries for co-operation and the study of common problems. The
Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding among members
of the two religions and deals with problems in the social field.
The New English Bible, a modern English translation completed in 1970,
is the result of co-operation among many Christian churches.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made
by two or more churches for the sharing of church buildings.

History
11 The National Economy
Britain has a mixed economy, nationalised industries accounting for about
one-tenth of the national product and about one-seventh of total fixed invest¬
ment. Manufacturing industry accounts for about 29 per cent of total domestic
income and services1 for 45 per cent. International trade is of great importance
and exports of goods and services represent about 34 per cent of gross domestic
product. Britain ranks fifth in world trade (after the United States, the Federal
Republic of Germany, Japan and France) and accounts for 6 per cent of total
world trade. It takes over 7 per cent of the world’s exports of primary
products, and contributes just over 9 per cent to the main manufacturing
countries’ exports of manufactured goods. It is among the world’s largest
exporters of aerospace products, motor vehicles, electrical equipment,
finished textiles, and most types of machinery, and is one of the world’s
largest importers of agricultural products, raw materials and semi¬
manufactures.
With abundant resources of coal and the discovery and exploitation of
North Sea oil and gas, Britain is expected to become self-sufficient in energy by
1980 with substantial benefits to the balance of payments through the reduction
of oil imports. The potential balance of payments effect of British production
of oil in 1979 has been estimated at .£4,500 million (1976 prices). Other eco¬
nomic effects of the offshore oil industry include the growing revenues accruing
to the Government through taxation, the new jobs created, and the stimulus
provided for the development and sales of highly specialised equipment and
services.
A high level of agricultural productivity enables Britain to provide just over
half the food it needs from its own soil, although only 2-7 per cent of the
employed labour force are engaged in agriculture—a lower proportion than
in any other major industrial country.
Britain earns overseas currency by exports of (mainly) manufactured goods
and by invisible transactions—earnings on overseas investment, travel, civil
aviation, British-owned shipping, and financial, banking, insurance and other
services. It accounts for nearly 10 per cent of world invisible receipts (ex¬
cluding government transactions), more than any country except the United
States.
The significant contribution made to export earnings by invisibles is in large
measure a reflection of Britain’s position as a major financial centre. Its banks,
insurance underwriters and brokers and other financial institutions provide
worldwide financial services. The City of London contains perhaps the most
comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
As a result of the ‘Industrial Revolution’ during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries (when a series of inventions led to a complete change in the character
of production), Britain emerged as the first great industrial nation and as a
pioneer of new methods in transport, communications and technology. It

excluding public administration, defence and ownership of dwellings.

l85
The Second
World War
and After
Recent
Developments
occupied a leading position as world manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker
and investor, and its fast-growing economy supported a rapidly increasing
population. In the period from 1870 to 1890 British industry had a clear
though declining lead over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914,
industrial competition from Europe and North America grew, but its effects
on Britain’s export industries, particularly cotton textiles and coal, were offset
by a number of factors including the rise in world trade and the returns on
Britain’s large overseas investments.
Following the first world war Britain’s older industries met increasing com¬
petition, for example, in coal and iron and steel from other European countries
and in textiles from some eastern countries where labour was cheaper. The
difficulties were increased by the world economic depression which began in
1929 and the associated attempts by many countries to reduce imports. The
result in Britain, as in many other countries, was heavy unemployment.
After 1932 levels of production and employment rose. The decade saw a
strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemical and aircraft industries,
while the construction of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the
building and ancillary industries.
During the second world war (1939-45) rapid and far-reaching re-orientation
of the economy towards the war effort was secured by central planning. The
Government involvement in the economy which this implied has remained,
in a modified form, a permanent feature of the British economic system.
In spite of generous aid from the United States and Canada, the war ran
down British domestic capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping
losses, bomb damage, and arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements.
Some £1,000 million worth of overseas investments were sold, nearly half in
North America, and new external debts of £3,000 million were accumulated,
while exports were greatly reduced.
After the war rationing and other controls were relaxed gradually as civil
production expanded and trade recovered. Quantitative restrictions on most
imports were gradually removed, exchange controls on transactions between
the sterling area and the rest of the world were also for the most part lifted, and
convertibility of sterling on current account was introduced for non-residents.
The period after 1945 was one of rising production and, until 1970, a low level
of unemployment (generally 2-5 per cent or lower); but economic growth,
which averaged 2 to 3 per cent up to 1971, was slower than in most other western
European countries. There were also certain persistent economic problems,
particularly the periodic difficulties with the balance of payments. In spite of
the contribution from invisibles, there were substantial deficits on current
account in a number of years.
In the 1960s successive governments sought to deal with these problems
in a number of ways, sometimes restraining the growth in home demand and
implementing policies designed to hold down rises in incomes and prices. Fol¬
lowing the devaluation of sterling in 1967, from $2-80 to $2-40=£i, exports
recovered, leading to a substantial surplus on visible trade and a record current
account surplus in 1971.
In 1973, the economy achieved an annual growth rate of about 5 per cent in
response to government policies introduced from 1971 onwards. However,
with, among other things, general inflation and the abrupt increase in the
prices of commodities in 1972 and 1973, particularly of oil in late 1973, the
world economy entered a phase of recession. At the same time, the very large
i86
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Measures
Against
Inflation
Price Control
balance of payments surpluses of the oil-producing countries following the
rise in oil prices gave rise to a corresponding deficit for the oil-importing
countries collectively, which could not quickly be eliminated. Against this
background, economic activity in Britain declined, but initially less steeply
than in many other industrialised countries as the Government sought to
moderate the depressing impact on employment by increasing public expen¬
diture and reducing indirect taxes. Subsequent policies have been directed
towards three integrated aims: to reduce the rate of inflation to the levels of
Britain’s main trading competitors; to achieve export-led growth based on the
strengthening of manufacturing industry; and to maintain overseas confidence
in sterling.
In the last 30 years successive governments have adopted policies (including
statutory controls of prices or wages or of both) to slow down the rate of
inflation. After the present Government took office early in 1974, counter¬
inflation policy developed within the framework of the ‘social contract’
between the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) which
involved a wide-ranging understanding on economic and social matters. The
Labour Party accepted the need to maintain voluntary collective wage bar¬
gaining without statutory control, to control prices, to help the lower paid and
pensioners and to aim at full employment; while the TUC acknowledged that,
in the absence of a statutory incomes policy, trade unions had loyalties not
only to their own members but to other members of the community, and should
therefore moderate their pay demands.
A reaffirmation of continuing co-operation on economic policy into the
1980s was endorsed by the TUC-Labour Party Liaison Committee (see
p 322) in July 1978.
A voluntary limit on pay increases of £6 a week with no increases for those
earning more than £8,500 a year was universally observed in the period 1975-
76; this resulted in a sharp fall in real earnings and a reduction in the year-on-
year rate of inflation from 26-9 per cent to 12-9 per cent. A second stage,
running from 1 August 1976 to 31 July 1977, provided for an average 4-5
per cent limit on pay increases and was also universally observed. The
inflation rate rose again in the second half of 1976 as the effects of sterling
depreciation and other factors began to work through into the retail price index,
which rose to a peak of 177 per cent in June 1977. Since then, the rate has
fallen, reflecting the effects of earnings limitation through pay policy and of
the improved performance of sterling. A third period of restraint between
August 1977 and July 1978 was based on guidelines of a 12-month interval
between pay settlements and a national earnings increase of no more than 10
per cent (with certain exceptions, notably for self-financing productivity
agreements). In the event, the increase was estimated at around 14 per cent.
The rate of inflation continued to fall, dropping below 10 per cent in January
1978 and standing at 7-4 per cent in the 12 months to June 1978.
A 5 per cent guideline for earnings increases in 1978-79, excluding self¬
financing productivity deals, was set by the Government in July 1978.
Some other limited exceptions and higher increases for the lowest earners
were envisaged.
Since 1973 a strict system of price control has been operated by the Price
Commission, an independent statutory agency originally set up under the
Counter-Inflation Act 1973. Under the Price Commission Act 1977 the
Commission has been given new powers to mount specific investigations; it
can freeze individual prices for up to a year. The price controls set out in the
Money Supply
Other Measures
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 187
Act aim to balance the interests of consumers and the needs of industry to
earn a sufficient return on investment.
The Government is committed to exercising firm control over monetary
growth as an important support for counter-inflation policy. In doing so, care
is taken to ensure that the needs of industry for finance can be met; in particular
the Government has acted to limit the size of the public sector borrowing
requirement, and the Bank of England has issued directional guidance to the
banks requesting them to give priority in their lending to finance for investment
and exports, and to exercise strict restraint in lending to persons, property
companies and for purely financial transactions. The Government’s policy is
to keep interest rates as low as possible, consistent with its objectives for
monetary growth.
Since 1976 the Government has announced specific objectives for the
growth of the monetary aggregates. For the 12 months to mid-April 1979 the
Chancellor announced in his April 1978 Budget a target range of 8-12 per cent
for the growth of the sterling M3 (which comprises all UK residents, sterling
bank deposits, of both public and private sectors, plus notes and coins in
circulation with the general public). This target is subject to reassessment after
six months, in the light of developments in the economy generally, when it
will be rolled forward to cover the succeeding 12-month period. Domestic
Credit Expansion (DCE—which measures the total volume of money gener¬
ated in the domestic economy alone) is to be kept within a ceiling of £6,000
million in the year to mid-April 1979. This ceiling is consistent with the target
range for sterling M3 and the Government’s ceiling of £8,500 million for the
public sector borrowing requirement in the financial year 1978-79.
The Government’s industrial strategy, introduced in 1975 (see p 207), aims
to improve the prospects of some 40 sectors of manufacturing industry.
Measures have also been taken to reduce unemployment (see p 315).
With growing pressure on the exchange rate in the first half of 1976 and
substantial withdrawals of official sterling balances by overseas governments
in the second quarter, the Government drew a first credit tranche from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and obtained a stand-by credit of
$5,300 million from a group of industrialised countries (drawings on which
were repaid in December). The exchange rate came under pressure again
in late 1976, minimum lending rate was raised, and a $3,900 million stand-by
credit was agreed with the IMF, to be available for drawing in 1977 and 1978.
Measures designed to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement were
announced in December 1976, and limits were placed on the expansion of
domestic credit.
An agreement between Central Bank Governors in Basle on the setting up
of a new facility amounting to $3,000 million for the official sterling balances
was announced in January 1977 (see p 366). A seven-year $1,500 million loan
from a syndicate of banks in the Federal Republic of Germany, North America
and Britain was arranged to strengthen the reserves further on a secure
medium-term basis. Final repayment is to be made in 1984.
A marked improvement in domestic and external financial confidence
occurred in 1977. Although Britain’s terms of trade were still about 20 per
cent lower than they had been in 1972, the volume of exports had increased
much more rapidly than the volume of imports over the period since 1973, so
that by the end of 1977 the current account of the balance of payments was
in surplus, partly because North Sea oil had begun to make a positive

contribution. No drawings on the IMF stand-by were taken up after August
1977. Arrangements were made to repay $2,000 million to the Fund and
$1,000 million of commercial loans ahead of schedule; in addition $1,000
million of commercial loans were to be repaid on schedule during 1978.
Real personal incomes rose sharply in the last quarter of 1977 and this higher
level was maintained into 1978. Tax reductions in the April Budget produced
a further increase. Inflation was down to around 7-8 per cent by the summer.
There were signs of a revival in economic activity, with industrial production
increasing again, following a period of little output growth during 1977, and
consumer expenditure on a rising trend.
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
The objectives of the Government in managing the economy are to achieve a
steady and sustainable rate of growth, a high level of employment and a more
equitable distribution of income. This it attempts to do by encouraging invest¬
ment, output and exports within the constraints imposed by maintaining a
satisfactory balance of payments and reducing the rate of inflation. Its policies
are carried out by the main government departments with economic responsi¬
bilities on a national scale: the Treasury, the Departments of Trade, Industry,
Employment, Energy, Prices and Consumer Protection, the Environment,
and Transport, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
An important advisory body on general economic policy is the National
Economic Development Council, which brings together representatives of
government, management and trade unions under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister. It has an independent but publicly financed secretariat and
has established a number of economic development committees dealing with
different industries and services and different aspects of industry. An industrial
strategy (see p 207) was launched at the NEDC in 1975. Other bodies respon¬
sible for advice on specific aspects of policy include the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission (on action to prevent the abuse of monopoly power, see
p 214) and the Office of Manpower Economics (see p 326).
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy, and
problems such as inflation, the Government makes known its purposes, and
keeps in touch with developments throughout the economy, by means of
informal and continuous links with the chief industrial, financial, labour and
other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of economic policy
rests with the Cabinet. For regional economic planning see Chapter 8.
In Britain’s mixed economy, direct state intervention in industry and com¬
merce (as well as in social, cultural and other affairs) is often effected through
special public corporations set up, usually by statute, to deal with a particular
activity. Though not part of a government department, the corporations are
under varying degrees of public control. Among the larger nationalised
industries are the National Coal Board, British Gas and the electricity in¬
dustry ; the British Steel Corporation; the Post Office; British Rail; the National
Freight Corporation; British Airways; British Aerospace; British Shipbuilders;
and the National Bus Company. These industries and services, which together
employ about 8 per cent of all employees, are described in their relevant
sections. The public sector as a whole employs a little over a quarter of the
working population.
Recent developments have included the nationalisation of the shipbuilding
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
189
and aircraft industries and the establishment of the British National Oil
Corporation through which the Government exercises its participation rights
in the exploitation of Britain’s offshore oil resources.
The managing boards and staffs of the nationalised industries are not gener¬
ally civil servants and although accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring depart¬
ments who are responsible for management. The Government intends to
appoint civil servants to the boards of some industries and to encourage
schemes of industrial democracy at all levels. It also sees a role for consumer
members on some boards.
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working of
the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of
each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to how
the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day management.
It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister any informa¬
tion, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In practice, as the
responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy decisions are
reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion for him to issue
a general directive. In order to clarify accountability the Government intends,
subject to the approval of Parliament, to extend the minister’s powers so as to
enable him to issue specific as well as general directives on matters affecting
the national interest.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual statu¬
tory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so that
receipts at least balance outgoings over a period. However, financial targets
have been agreed by the Government for certain industries and targets for the
remaining industries are to be set as soon as possible. The main form of target,
usually set for 3-5 years, is a real return before interest on average net assets
employed. The Government is also discussing with the industries the develop¬
ment of a more direct wray of relating the opportunity cost of capital to financial
performance. The responsible minister is usually empowered, subject to
Treasury approval, to say what shall be done with any surplus revenues which
may accrue. As regards finance for capital expenditure, the present system is
that finance which cannot be met from internal sources is provided mainly by
interest-bearing loans from the Exchequer and by borrowing from abroad.
Other sources of finance include grants and Public Dividend Capital on which
dividends are paid to the Government.
It is usual for the minister responsible for each nationalised industry to be
required by statute to take steps to see that the interests of the industry’s
customers are protected. This is generally done by the establishment of repre¬
sentative consumers’ councils to consider complaints and suggestions, and
to advise the board or the minister on the changes they think desirable.
Government policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are
afforded by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts,
and by answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible
only if concerned with policy rather than details of administration. A House of
Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries examines their
reports and accounts. (Its powers of investigation also include several other
public corporations such as the Independent Broadcasting Authority, Cable
and Wireless Limited and certain activities of the Bank of England.)

NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
The following sections sketch briefly the structure and disposal of Britain’s
national income in recent years.
Output In 1977 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the total
value of goods and services produced at home and net income from abroad) is
estimated to have amounted to £123,791 million. After allowing for price
changes, the increase over the ten years since 1967 was nearly 22 per cent.
Over a quarter of total output can be attributed to manufacturing industry,
rather less than a decade ago. Expanding industry groups in recent years (in

relation to the economy as a whole) have been most of the services, particularly
insurance, banking and finance, public administration and health and
educational services. Table 6 summarises the contribution of each group.
Table 7 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services in 1967,
1972 and 1977 at 1975 market prices.
The main trends since 1967 are a fall in the proportion of total available out¬
put devoted to personal consumption and a significant rise in the proportion
devoted to exports.

b Excluding value of physical change in stocks and work in progress (£1,051 million in
total in 1977).
Sums of component parts differ from totals in some cases owing to the method used to
rebase at 1975 prices.
Personal incomes before tax at current prices rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from £33,850 million in 1967 to £125,140 million in 1977. However, real
personal disposable income fell slightly between 1976 and 1977 (although
there was a large rise in the final quarter as a result of tax changes and rebates).
Consumer expenditure amounted to 68 per cent of total pre-tax income in
1977 compared with 75 per cent in 1967. The difference is accounted for by a
higher incidence of both direct taxation and national insurance contributions
and by increased personal saving.
Income from employment in 1977 totalled £85,839 million and accounted for
about 69 per cent of total personal income (a slightly lower percentage than in
1967). The three other main sources of personal income were self-employment
(9 per cent), income from rent, dividends and interest (10 per cent), and grants
from general government (12 per cent).
The combined effect of taxation and transfer payments and benefits in kind
is to redistribute income on more egalitarian lines. According to studies by
the Central Statistical Office, the effect in 1976 was to raise the share of the
poorest fifth of households from 1-2 per cent of total original income to 9-4 per
cent of all final income. The share of the richest fifth fell from 44 per cent to
35-2 per cent. Similar conclusions about income redistribution were reached
192
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
by the standing Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth
(see p 319), in its fifth report (see Bibliography, p 444). Illustrating trends in
income over a period the report also shows a continuing decline in the share
of the top 10 per cent of income recipients before tax from 29-4 per cent in
1959 to 26-6 per cent in 1974-75 (25-2 per cent to 23-2 per cent after tax). The
increase in the share of the bottom 20 per cent was from 5-3 per cent to 6-2 per
cent before tax (6 per cent to 7-5 per cent after tax). The second report, on

income from companies, shows that rather more than one-third of dividends
go indirectly to about 11 million members of occupational pension schemes,
2-25 million taxpayers receiving occupational pensions and 14 million
taxpayers who save through life assurance.
A rise in the volume of consumers’ spending has been accompanied, in Britain
as in other advanced industrial countries, by changes in its pattern.
Table 8 shows the amounts and proportions of consumers’ expenditure at
current prices in 1967 and 1977. Over this period the proportions spent on
food, tobacco, and clothing and footwear fell while the proportions spent on
alcoholic drink, housing and fuel and light rose. At constant (1975) prices
consumers’ expenditure fell slightly between 1976 and 1977.
Current expenditure on goods and services by the central Government and
local authorities rose by about 20 per cent at 1975 market prices over the period
1967 to 1977 when it amounted to about 20 per cent of the gross domestic
product (at current prices). The main cause of this increase was the growth
over the period of the social services, especially education. In the same period
defence has accounted for a declining share of public expenditure on goods

and services—24 per cent in 1977 compared with 33 per cent in 1967 and
48 per cent in 1953.
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
national insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies (see pp 127 and 175). The Government also makes grants to local
authorities to finance about 60 per cent of their current expenditure.

Gross domestic fixed capital formation (total fixed investment) represents
about 20 per cent of the gross domestic product at factor cost. The total value
of fixed assets in Britain, valued at constant replacement cost, is estimated to
have increased by 42 per cent between 1967 and 1977 when their current
replacement value, net of depreciation, was some £436,700 million, of which
about two-thirds was accounted for by buildings and one-third by plant and
machinery, and vehicles.
Within the total of gross domestic fixed capital formation in 1977 (19,738
million compared with £20,240 million in 1972 and a peak of £21,609 million
in 1973 at constant 1975 prices) private sector investment accounted for 12-9
per cent of the gross domestic product at factor cost (12-9 per cent in 1972),
general government for 3-9 per cent (5 per cent) and public corporations for
3-8 per cent (3-2 per cent). The approximate shares of industry groups in total
fixed investment in 1977 were (1972 figures in brackets): manufacturing,
19 per cent (18 per cent), gas, electricity and water, 5 per cent (6 per cent), pet¬
roleum and natural gas 8 per cent (1 per cent), transport and communications,
10 per cent (13 per cent), distributive trades, 6 per cent (6 per cent), dwellings,
18 per cent (19 per cent), social and other public services, 12 per cent (16
per cent), and other industries, 22 per cent (21 per cent). There is a marked
cyclical pattern in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry; it was
BRITAIN I979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
at a peak in 1970 and 1974, fell in 1975 and 1976 but increased considerably in
1977. Among the trends in recent years has been an increase in investment in
North Sea oil equipment, which reached a peak in 1976.
THE EXTERNAL POSITION
In the years following devaluation in 1967 exports of goods and services
increased rapidly in real terms. Helped by a record surplus on current trans¬
actions of over £1,000 million in 1971, and by massive capital inflows, the
reserves stood at the high level of just over £2,740 million by the end of May
1972, after the repayment of all official short- and medium-term debt.
In 1972 the trade balance began to deteriorate. The marked worsening of
Britain’s visible trade balance in 1973 and 1974 was much influenced by the
increases in world commodity prices, especially oil prices. By 1974 the terms
of trade, which were also affected by a fall in the sterling exchange rate, were
27 per cent lower than in 1972. This was partly offset by a growing volume of
exports relative to imports. Between 1973 and 1977 the volume of exports
increased by about 23 per cent while the volume of imports increased by about
1 per cent. The improved competitive position of British exports, resulting
from the floating of the pound in June 1972, contributed to this, while imports
were held down in part by the low level of domestic demand. In 1975 the
deficit on current account was reduced substantially.
There was a further improvement in 1976, the result of a growing surplus
on the invisible account, and a marked improvement in 1977, largely as a result
of growing production of North Sea oil. In future years increasing supplies of
oil from the North Sea will bring considerable advantage to the balance of
payments; it has been estimated that the benefits should rise to between
£8,000 million and £9,000 million a year in the mid-1980s (at 1977 prices).
For details of overseas trade and payments see Chapter 18.
Exchange Rates In 1971, a general international realignment of exchange rates was agreed at a
meeting held in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, in which all the
main currencies were in effect revalued against the dollar. (The rates of ex¬
change fixed in that agreement are called Smithsonian parities.) As part of this
realignment, the sterling rate for the dollar moved up by just over 8| per cent,
the new middle rate being $2-60571 compared with the old par value of $2-40.
In June 1972 sterling was allowed to float and over the next three years the
rate against the dollar fluctuated between $2-30 and $2-60; in 1975 the rate fell
to just over $2. Sterling came under pressure in 1976 (see p 187) but recovered
somewhat towards the end of the year. Increased confidence in sterling through¬
out 1977 was shown by rises in the official reserves to record levels and by
upwards pressure on the exchange rate. In October 1977 the Government,
believing that a continuance of the massive inflow of foreign currency would
endanger domestic monetary targets, changed the Bank of England’s inter¬
vention policy and allowed the pound to appreciate on the foreign exchange
markets. Since then the sterling/dollar exchange rate has fluctuated within
the range of £1 = $1-79 to almost $2. The effective rate for sterling rose by
nearly 7 per cent during 1977 rising sharply at the end of the year, but then
fell equally sharply to around the levels of mid-1977. At the end of August
1978 it was 62-4 (December 1971 = 100) and the market rate £1 — $1*94.
Five member countries of the European Community (Belgium, Denmark,
the Federal Republic of Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) and
Norway maintain a scheme, usually called the ‘snake’, under which rates

between any two of their currencies cannot diverge from their cross parities
by more than 2j per cent. Britain, France, Italy and Sweden were formerly
members of the scheme.
A second set of amendments to the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) entered into force on i April 1978. (The first amend¬
ments were made in 1969 when the Special Drawing Right—SDR—was
established.) They bring the articles up to date and provide for necessary
flexibility. The amendments were drawn up under the guidance of the Interim
Committee, which succeeded the Committee of Twenty in 1974.
Members undertake a general obligation to collaborate with the IMF and
with other members in order to ensure orderly exchange arrangements and to
promote a stable system of exchange rates. Under the new provisions the
Fund will be able to determine that, in accordance with specified criteria, inter¬
national economic conditions permit the introduction of a system based on
stable but adjustable par values. Each member will then be able, though not
bound, to establish a par value. The amendments provide for a gradual reduc¬
tion in the role of gold in the international monetary system. The function of
gold as the unit of value of the SDR has been eliminated, the official price has
been abolished and members will be free to deal in gold in the market and
among themselves without reference to any official price, and obligatory pay¬
ments in gold by members to the Fund and by the Fund to members have been
abrogated. The IMF’s gold holdings are being reduced; one-sixth is being
returned to members, and a further sixth is being auctioned, the major
proportion of the proceeds from the auctions being disbursed through a trust
fund, set up to provide medium-term balance of payments support to the
poorest developing countries. Changes have been made in the role of the
SDR in order to enhance its status as an international reserve asset. The
amendment also provides for changes in the organisation of the Fund and in
its financial operations.
Discussions on reform have been accompanied by measures designed to help
recycle oil funds and to assist the developing countries with the problems
caused for them by the increases in oil prices and the depression of world
trade. After the oil price increases, the IMF set up a borrowing agreement for
1974 (which was continued in 1975), known as the oil facility through which
countries could draw on funds lent mainly by the oil-producers. Although the
facility was not continued in 1976, the ordinary credit tranches of the IMF were
temporarily widened by 45 per cent.
An extended facility for medium-term assistance to members with special
balance of payments problems caused by structural economic changes
was introduced in 1974. A supplementary financing facility was agreed in
principle in 1977, intended to provide financial assistance to members whose
payments imbalances are large in relation to their economies and to their quotas
in the Fund. By April 1978 a total of more than $10,000 million had been
committed for the financing of this facility.
The entry into force of the second set of amendments enabled quotas to be
increased under the Sixth General Review of Quotas. Total Fund quotas will
be raised from SDR 29,200 million to SDR 39,000 million.
At a meeting in Mexico City in April 1978 the Interim Committee reached
a consensus on the general outlines of the co-ordinated strategy for the world
economy in the medium term. The strategy is designed to promote non¬
inflationary growth, leading to higher employment, a reduction in imbalances
of international payments and conservation of energy.
Industry (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction and gas, elec¬
tricity and water) and distributive trades together account for more than half
of Britain’s gross domestic product, manufacturing for some 28 per cent and
distributive trades nearly 10 per cent. About 30 per cent of Britain’s employed
labour force is engaged in manufacturing industry, while over 80 per cent of
Britain’s visible exports consists of manufactured or semi-manufactured pro¬
ducts. This chapter describes the geographical distribution and structure of
industry and discusses some general industrial topics—such as trends in pro¬
duction and productivity, investment, the Government’s relations with
industry, regional development, fair trading and competition policy. It outlines
the major sectors of manufacturing industry, construction and distributive
and service trades. The chapters following cover other main industries in
Britain.
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
Location The following is a summary of how British industry is distributed through the
eight standard regions of England and in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
South-East Region London is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, and is one of the
world’s most important financial centres. Lying at the head of ocean navigation
on the Thames estuary it is one of the world’s largest cities and largest ports,
though much deep-sea-going traffic has moved down-river to Tilbury docks.
It is the main centre in Britain of printing and the manufacture of clothing,
food and drink, furniture, materials for the arts, precision instruments and
many other specialised products. Small firms predominate in many of these
industries and the average size of manufacturing firms (particularly in the
central area) is well below the national average. London is also important,
especially in its outer ring, for light engineering, chemicals and consumer goods
and has some heavy engineering plants and a number of leading research
establishments. There has been in recent years, however, a considerable drop
in employment and population in London.
Towards the periphery of Greater London and in the surrounding Outer
Metropolitan Area, industry, particularly the electronics and consumer goods
industries, has expanded greatly; some of the largest aircraft plants are in these
areas, for example at Weybridge and Hatfield, as well as two of the four main
motor vehicle manufacturers at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable. There are
other major motor vehicle manufacturing plants at Cowley, Oxford, some 50
miles north-west of London. The computer industry is well represented in
Hemel Hempstead and Letchworth, and Chelmsford is an important centre
for the electronics industry. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries
there are large oil refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering
works and major concentrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
There are centres of manufacturing industry at Crawley, Basingstoke, Slough
and Reading, in the Medway towns and the Aldershot-Farnborough area.
Heathrow and Gatwick airports are also of major importance and are large
employers.
INDUSTRY
J97
South- West
East Anglia
West Midlands
A great part of the Channel coast eastwards from Southampton consists of
built-up areas, many of which are partly residential areas for people working in
London. Holiday resorts fringe the coast. Portsmouth is a naval port with some
shipbuilding and general manufactures. Southampton is one of Britain’s
leading ports for both passengers and freight; its industries include ship
repairing, oil refining, cable-making, electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover,
Folkestone and Newhaven are ferry ports.
Though famous for its tourism, leisure industries and agriculture, the south¬
west of England has a busy manufacturing sector. Bristol, the region’s admini¬
strative and commercial centre, is a leading port and the largest industrial city,
having tobacco, packaging materials, priating, aerospace, chocolate and metal
manufacture as well as a wide range of engineering and other industries; there
are extensive modern docks at Avonmouth, an industrialised suburb with
important basic chemicals and non-ferrous metal plants. Plymouth, with the
naval dockyard and electrical and other industries, is an important manu¬
facturing centre. The towns of Gloucester, Poole, Christchurch, Cheltenham
and Bath are major producers of machinery, instrumentation and other engineer¬
ing products. Swindon has vehicle, electrical and electronic engineering.
Chemical and engineering products are made at Yeovil, Taunton and Bridg¬
water. Clothing and other textile products and footwear are made at several
centres. In the Camborne, Redruth, Falmouth and St. Austell areas of Corn¬
wall there is china clay and tin mining, and machinery manufacture, ship
repairing and other forms of engineering.
Although the smallest of the regions East Anglia has been rapidly growing in
terms of both population and employment. A major contribution to this growth
has been made by the nine towns receiving overspill of population and industry
from London. The area is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the
world and this has provided a firm base for the growth of the food processing
industry, which is concerned mainly with canning, and more recently freezing
local produce. Cambridge is a major centre of research-based industry; Ipswich
and Peterborough are noted for diesel engines, agricultural machinery and
engineering generally and Norwich for footwear and food manufacture. The
east coast ports of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft are important bases for
companies associated with natural gas exploitation in the North Sea.
This is the only landlocked region and it has a greater dependency on manu¬
facturing industry than any other region. However, more than three-quarters of
the land is still used for agriculture and includes some areas of great natural
beauty, particularly in the south and west. The main concentration of industry
is in the West Midlands metropolitan county which includes the districts of
Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolver¬
hampton. The economy is largely dependent upon the metal-using industries
and in particular on motor vehicle manufacture. Other notable industries are
mechanical and electrical engineering, machine tools, castings, tubes, locks,
jewellery, domestic metalware and rubber manufactures. The metropolitan
county also contains the National Exhibition Centre, which is one of the
largest and most modern exhibition complexes in the world.
In north Staffordshire, a smaller conurbation centred upon Stoke-on-Trent
is the centre of the British pottery and china industry and the region’s major
coalmining area. Other industries are rubber and electrical products. Coal¬
mining is also important in the Cannock Chase and north Warwickshire areas.
198
BRITAIN I979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
East Midlands
North- West
Other important centres include Stafford, with heavy electrical and other
engineering; Worcester, mechanical engineering and pottery; Burton-on-
Trent, brewing and rubber; Kidderminster, carpets; and Rugby, electrical
engineering. Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare, is
an international tourist centre.
The two major new towns, Telford and Redditch, have large metal-based
industries.
Although some major industries are heavily concentrated in the East Midlands
(over 60 per cent of Britain’s hosiery and knitwear, 40 per cent of its footwear
and more than 20 per cent of its coal) industry is well diversified. North Not¬
tinghamshire and Derbyshire are traditional coalmining areas where produc¬
tivity rates are high. In the northern part of the region engineering is also
important. In Nottingham a high proportion of employment is in pharma¬
ceuticals, electronics, tobacco and bicycle manufacture. Nottingham lace is
famous throughout the world, but textiles and clothing are of more importance.
Derby is primarily an engineering town with aero-engines, rail rolling stock,
boilers and castings among a wide range of engineering products. The produc¬
tion of rayon is also of considerable importance. Agriculture is significant in
Lincolnshire as well as food processing and engineering, much of which pro¬
duces agricultural and constructional equipment. Lincoln has a substantial
engineering industry. Engineering is also a major industry in Leicestershire,
much of it supplying other local industries such as textiles and footwear.
Electrical engineering is of especial importance in Loughborough. Northamp¬
tonshire is famous for high quality footwear. In recent years light engineering,
much of it related to the motor and electronics industries, has expanded con¬
siderably. Corby has a large and fully integrated steel works.
The North-West comprises the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester
and Merseyside and the counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. The Department
of Industry’s administration of this region extends also into parts of Cumbria
and Derbyshire. The region is one of the most highly industrialised in Britain.
Manchester is Britain’s second most important commercial and financial
centre and an important port. It is one of the chief centres for electrical and
heavy engineering and for the production of a wide range of goods including
computers, electronic equipment, petrochemicals, clothing, dye-stuffs and
pharmaceuticals. Manchester’s traditional role as the centre for the Lancashire
textile industry is only a small part of its present-day activities.
The textile towns, while adapting to the decline of traditional textiles and to
increasing use of man-made fibres and moving into new textile products, such
as carpets, have seen engineering outgrow the textile industry. The largest
towns, Bolton, Stockport, Oldham, Blackburn, Preston, Rochdale, Burnley and
Bury, are diversified with such industries as paper-making, textile and electrical
machinery, light engineering and consumer durables, plastics, foods, chemicals,
nuclear process plant, electronics, aircraft and heavy commercial vehicles.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of export
traffic, links Manchester and Merseyside. It passes through Warrington, with
its metal industries (such as wire-drawing), Widnes, Runcorn with the chemical
industry, and Ellesmere Port with its oil refinery installations, before reaching
the Mersey estuary. St. Helens, to the north of the canal, is famous for glass
manufacture. Liverpool, with its modernised dock system, is one of Britain’s
leading seaports and, after London, the largest centre for processing and con¬
verting imported foodstuffs and raw materials (grain milling, oils, fats and

tobacco, sugar refining and rubber products). The centre of economic activity
in Merseyside is still its port, but its industrial strength has moved from older
industries closely related to the port to the newer industries including motor
vehicles, electrical engineering, heavy industrial plant and chemicals.
To the north of this industrial belt lie Blackpool and Lancaster with light
industries and chemicals and to the south, the Cheshire plain with agri¬
culture, while a variety of industries such as salt, chemicals, motor vehicles,
pharmaceuticals and rail engineering are located among the smaller towns.
The countryside lies close to most towns and the region contains some of
Britain’s most fertile farmland. There is a large tourist industry on the coast
and in historic towns, such as Chester and the four National Parks on or near
its boundaries. There are major airports at Liverpool and Manchester, a highly
developed rail system and one of the most advanced motorway networks in
Britain, providing good access throughout the region, and to the rest of the
country and continental Europe through the east coast ports.
Though some parts of Yorkshire and Humberside are heavily industrialised,
more than four-fifths of the region is open country.
The region’s industrial structure is diverse. About 70 per cent of Britain’s
worsted and woollen industry is located in West Yorkshire. Bradford is the
commercial centre of the wool trade. In addition there are strong sectors of
engineering, printing, textile machinery and carpets. The metropolitan
district of Leeds is an important commercial centre and also has a variety of
industries including men’s clothing and various engineering industries. In the
south, the steel centre based on Sheffield and Rotherham is noted for the manu¬
facture of high quality steels, tools and cutlery. Yorkshire’s coalfields are par¬
ticularly important and production is to be extended to the Selby area, where
major new reserves have been discovered. Doncaster, with tractor and nylon
manufacturing, and Barnsley are the largest towns on the coalfield where
dependence on steel and coal has been reduced by the introduction of new
industries in and around the major towns.
North Yorkshire is mainly agricultural but York, a leading tourist attraction,
is also noted for chocolate and confectionery manufacture. It is an important
railway centre, and has substantial railway workshops.
Kingston upon Hull is the principal industrial town in Humberside, which
is a major centre for maritime trade with ports at Grimsby, Immingham and
Goole in addition to Hull. Besides being important fishing ports, Hull and
Grimsby contain specialised food processing and cold storage facilities. The
Humber ports are strategically situated for direct access to Western Europe.
The British Steel Corporation’s plant at Scunthorpe is one of Britain’s largest
steel producers. Close by are chemical, fertiliser, oil refining, and food pro¬
cessing plants. The north bank of the Humber contains a large proportion of
Britain’s caravan manufacturing industry.
The region has five universities and numerous facilities for further education
with long standing links with commerce and industry.
The greater part of this region (the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear and
the counties of Northumberland, Durham, Cleveland and most of Cumbria) is
an area of hills, lakes and moorland. The tourist industry, already strong in the
Lake District, is developing in other areas. Industrial activity and the bulk
of the population is concentrated in the eastern coastal strip stretching from
the coalfields north of the River Tyne southwards to the River Tees, and to a
lesser extent, on the western coastal strip of Cumbria.

The region is relatively more dependent than other parts of England on the
long-established heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manu¬
facture, shipbuilding and ship-repairing and chemicals (the complex of
chemical plants on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in
Europe). Europe’s largest steelmaking complex is being developed in the
Teesside area. New industries, however, with a broader technological base,
have been successfully attracted to the region and the industrial structure is
becoming more diversified. Manufacture of electrical plant is a major
industry.
Other industries include electric components, plastics, domestic appliances,
pharmaceuticals, machine tools, ropes, paint, glass, clothing and scientific
instruments as well as mining machinery, rolling mill plant and earth-moving
equipment. An aluminium smelter is operating on the Northumberland coast.
Atomic energy is important, with two nuclear power stations and other instal¬
lations in Cumbria, and a further nuclear power station at an advanced stage
of construction at Hartlepool. Considerable investment is taking place in the
coalmining industry to exploit large coal reserves below the sea bed off the
Northumberland and Durham coasts and to boost open-cast coal production.
The region is also involved in the North Sea oil programme. The new oil ter¬
minal at Teesside has a potential capacity of one million barrels a day of North
Sea oil. A major new reservoir at Kielder will, when completed, provide water
supplies for industry on Tyneside and Teesside.
Some two-thirds of the population (which totals 2'8 million) live in industrial
south Wales. This area has a diverse range of modern manufacturing indus¬
tries, including mechanical and electrical engineering, motor vehicle com¬
ponents, plastics, chemicals and textiles. Though coalmining has declined sub¬
stantially, the south Wales coalfield still produces virtually all Britain s
anthracite and much of its steam and other specialised coals. Steel, the other
traditional industry of south Wales, is less dominant than formerly but still
supplies all of Britain’s tinplate and much of its sheet steel. Cardiff, Newport
and Swansea are the largest urban centres and, with Barry and Port Talbot,
are also the major ports of the region. This latter has one of the largest steel¬
making plants in Britain and a deep water harbour for importing iron ore.
Milford Haven is one of the finest natural deep water harbours in the world
and has developed as Britain’s major oil-importing port with four oil refineries
and a link with a fifth at Llandarcy.
The other main industrial area is in north-east Wales. Coal mining has now
contracted in importance but sheet steel, chemicals, man-made fibres and
aircraft construction remain significant sources of employment despite some
shedding of labour in recent years. A range of new lighter industry has been
introduced in the post-war years, particularly around Wrexham, he remainder
of Wales is predominantly rural with agriculture, forestry and tourism the
traditional basis of the economy, but here too manufacturing firms have
been successfully introduced in many towns, and one or two very large scale
undertakings such as an aluminium plant at Holyhead, Anglesey, have been
established.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population of 5'2 million and most of the
industrial activity is concentrated in the central lowlands between the Firth of
Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The principal cities in this area are Glasgow, a
major commercial centre, and Edinburgh, Scotland s capital, an administrative
and cultural centre. There are, in addition, firms which have attracted sub¬
stantial industrial investment. Clydeside, which includes Glasgow, is a major

Structure
shipbuilding and marine engineering centre; it produces a great variety of
general engineering products, which include modules, pumps and other pro¬
ducts for the oil industry. Clydeside is also an important centre for food, drink
and tobacco manufactures, carpets and printing and publishing. The steel
industry, sited mainly in Central Strathclyde, .is being modernised. There are
important coalmining works in the Strathclyde, Central, Lothian and Fife
regions. The electronics equipment industry is represented in Strathclyde,
bife and Dundee, as well as in Edinburgh, where this and other modern
industries are expanding alongside the traditional engineering, printing and
publishing and brewing industries. Large-scale plants producing cars in
Linwood, near Paisley, and commercial vehicles in West Lothian and the
Scotstoun district of Glasgow, are well established, while heavy earth-moving
equipment and tracked vehicles are produced in Uddingston and Airdrie. The
chemical industry is concentrated in Ayrshire and at Grangemouth, where there
is also a major oil refinery. The Firth of Clyde provides central Scotland with
valuable deep water facilities.
Outside the central belt there is considerable industrial concentration in and
around Dundee and Aberdeen. Numerous towns outside these areas have also
attracted light industry in recent years. Dundee’s traditional manufacture,
jute, has been supplemented by office machinery, clocks and watches, tyres
and electronic products.
North-east Scotland is now the centre of the offshore oil industry and a
wide variety of oil-related projects have been established. The older industries
of whisky distilling, paper manufacture and food and fish processing, however,
continue to flourish. In June 1976 between 56,000 and 65,000 people were
employed in Scotland as a whole in work directly or indirectly related to oil.
Much of the rest of Scotland is mountainous and therefore sparsely populated.
In the Highlands and Islands, the main industries include high quality tweed
and knitwear, papermaking and aluminium smelting and there are significant
resources of hydro-electric power. Nuclear power is also generated. The
development of North Sea oil has led to very substantial oil-related activities
including oil platform production yards and a new oil refinery is proposed at
Nigg. In the Borders and south-west of Scotland, the wool, cloth and knitwear
industries are important, together with food processing and chemicals manu¬
facture. Tourism is important throughout Scotland and there are extensive
holiday and recreational facilities.
Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small there is substantial
and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around Belfast, the capital
city, and Londonderry. Britain’s largest single shipyard is in Belfast; other
well-established activities include the manufacture of aircraft, textile machinery
and a wide range of other engineering products, ropes, twine, tobacco and
clothing. Northern Ireland has also long been an important centre for textiles.
The textile industry is extensively diversified and Northern Ireland is one of
the most important areas in Europe for man-made fibre production, providing
over a quarter of Britain’s output. There has also been extensive development
in vehicle components, oil-well equipment, electronic instruments, tele¬
communication equipment, carpets and synthetic rubber.
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from
such large-scale organisations as the General Electric Company (156,000
employees) and Imperial Chemical Industries (125,000), and the public
202

corporations such as the National Coal Board with about 307,000 employees, to
the many thousands of small firms. Most manufacturing is in the hands of
private enterprise (for the role of public enterprise, see p 188). The Aircraft
and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 took into public ownership the bulk of
the aircraft and shipbuilding industries. Most iron and steel production is
already in public ownership. Other state-controlled products include a small
range of chemicals from the plants of the British Steel Corporation; loco¬
motives and rolling-stock built in the workshops of British Railways; military
equipment and supplies made in establishments of the defence services, and
fissile materials and radioactive isotopes. The Government has shareholdings
in various companies; it has major holdings in British Petroleum Ltd., and
the National Enterprise Board (see p 209) controls British Leyland Ltd.
and Rolls-Royce Ltd. ... r , ,
The most recent complete analysis of the size distribution of establishments
and enterprises in manufacturing industry, and of the degree of concentration,
is contained in the Report on the Census of Production igy3. This shows that some
66 per cent (62,500) of the 94,200 or so establishments in manufacturing in¬
dustry had fewer than 20 employees each and accounted for 6 per cent of total
employment; 29,100 establishments had between 20 and 499 employees and
accounted for some 38 per cent of the total labour force; 1,963 establishments,
each with between 500 and 1,499 employees, were responsible for 21 per cent
of employment, while over one-third was in the hands of the 678 establish¬
ments each with over 1,499 employees. A high proportion of the biggest
establishments were in the heavy industries. An enterprise, as defined in the
1973 census, normally consists of either a single establishment or of two or
more establishments under common ownership. In the private sector of
British manufacturing industries in 1973 36 per cent of all employment was
accounted for by the largest 100 private enterprises.
A further indication of company size is the value of capital employed (net
assets). The largest companies, British Petroleum and Shell Transport and
Trading have net assets of over £5,100 million and £4,400 million res¬
pectively; over 80 companies registered in Britain have each more than
£100 million net assets. Of the top 20 industrial groups in Europe in terms of
annual sales, four are British.
Merging and regrouping have continued as the effort to reduce overheads
have intensified and, in many branches of industry, profitable operation has
become dependent on concentration and economies of scale. Larger units or
control have been established in almost all the leading industries and in some
a small number of big companies and their subsidiaries are responsible for a great
proportion of total production. Examples are oil refining, non-ferrous metal
smelting, motor vehicles and aircraft, heavy electrical engineering, electronics,
machine tools, brewing, textiles, basic chemicals, tobacco and magazine
publishing, Shares in these companies are, however, usually distributed
among many holders or are held by insurance companies or pension funds
representing a broad cross-section of the community, and it is rare for a few
holders to have a controlling interest unless they are private companies.
Voluntary associations are formed by private enterprises for a number of
different purposes, including the provision of common services, the exchange
of information and representation of their members’ point of view; the regula¬
tion of trading practices; and negotiation with trade unions on wages and
conditions of work. These associations cover, with varying completeness, most
of British industry. Trade associations, concerned mainly with representation
INDUSTRY
203
Production
to the Government, the provision of common services and the regulation of
trading practices, are normally composed of firms manufacturing (and/or
retailing) a particular product or group of products. Employers’ organisations
which deal with employment matters usually consist of firms engaged in the
same type of operation or manufacturing process. In an industrial sector con¬
cerned wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may under¬
take all the required functions. The national employers’ organisations are
usually concerned with negotiation of wages and conditions of work (see
P 3i7)-
Other voluntary associations include industrial development associations
for particular areas or regions, which are sponsored by trade associations,
individual firms and local authorities. Four of these bodies (the North of
England Development Council, the North West Industrial Development
Association, the Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association and
the Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau) receive government grants,
while the Scottish Council for Development and the Development Corpora¬
tion for Wales receive grants from the Scottish and Welsh development
agencies respectively.
The central body representing British business and industry nationally is
the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), recognised by the Government
as a channel for consultation between government departments and representa¬
tives of both the private and the public sector employers as a whole. The CBI
membership consists of nearly 4>500 parent companies and between 11,000 and
12,000 subsidiaries and about 200 employers’ organisations and trade and
commercial associations and the majority of the nationalised industries. For
its members it acts as an advisory and consultative body providing them with
information and statistics, ascertaining their collective views and representing
them nationally to the Government and the public and also internationally
(see p 323). CBI representatives sit on the National Economic Development
Council, the Manpower Services Commission, the Health and Safety Com¬
mission and other official advisory committees and voluntary bodies concerned
with matters affecting industry.
In matters of common concern the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers
of commerce. These are open to all kinds of producers and traders and exist to
promote the interests of local, regional and national industry and commerce.
Most chambers provide export facilities, including the sponsorship of outward
trade missions and visits. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce,
founded in i860, is the co-ordinating body to which about 85 local chambers are
affiliated, together with 21 British Chambers of Commerce operating in
Europe and elsewhere. These chambers have a membership of about 50,000
firms. In Scotland there is an additional central organisation, the Association
of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, and in Northern Ireland the Northern
Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to which local chambers are
affiliated.
Though industrial production in general has been affected by the world
recession in industry, it rose slightly in 1976 and 1977 over the depressed
levels of 1975 (see Table 9), as measured by the index of industrial production.
Manufacturing production also rose slightly in 1976 and 1977 having increased
by ! 1:7 per cent in the period 1948-77, the highest increases having been in
chemicals and allied industries, in coal and petroleum products, in paper and
board, and in engineering—instrument engineering and electrical engineering
being the sectors that grew most rapidly.

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Productivity
Investment
The improvement of productivity, which by international standards has
shown a relatively slow rate of growth in Britain, is recognised as being of
prime importance for the economy. Productivity, as measured by output per
head, increased by 177 per cent in manufacturing industries between 1970
and 1977. Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity are
influenced by such factors as the rate of capital investment, management,
advances in products, machinery processes and methods of work, sales pro¬
motion and labour. Over the last decade the size of the labour force employed
in industry has fallen steadily.
The improvement of productivity rests mainly with unions and management
in individual enterprises. It is also a prime objective of the Government’s
industrial strategy (see p 207). The Department of Industry is responsible for
co-ordinating measures to improve industrial productivity. It assists the intro¬
duction of advanced machinery and techniques into industry, provides tech¬
nical advisory services and sponsors the Computer-Aided Design Centre and
the National Computing Centre. It is concerned directly with research into
such factors as productivity measurement techniques, group technology and
production engineering. The Department of Employment advises firms on
aspects of productivity connected with manpower utilisation and industrial
relations. Many educational establishments also provide advice and assistance.
Within industry, employers’ organisations often provide technical assistance
and support schemes of vocational education and training, as do many trade
unions. The British Council of Productivity Associations is one of many bodies,
both public and private, concerned with various aspects of productivity. The
council provides information and advisory services to industry through a
national network of 45 local associations.

manufacturing industry tends to reflect the level of demand in the economy as a
whole, with some time lag between the start of an increase in output and the
implementation of investment plans. There is thus a marked cyclical pattern
in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry, and since 1961 there have
been three discernible cycles. Details of investment in the period 1968-77 are
contained in Table 11.

changing the pattern and organisation of many industries and has brought
substantial increases in production and efficiency. Much investment, however,
still consists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more traditional
kind. Industrial technologies of plant maintenance, materials handling, lub¬
rication and corrosion protection, well developed in Britain, make possible
large savings in costs.
In Britain, as elsewhere, it is recognised that managers require special skills and
training. The British Institute of Management (BIM) provides a wide range of
information services and has a particular interest in management education and
training, and is playing an increasingly representative role for the management
and administrative professions. The Institute of Directors also provides
information and other services to directors of all types of company. The
Industrial Society, whose membership includes trade unions as well as
employers and their associations, works to promote better use of human
resources; it advises members and conducts conferences and courses.
A large proportion of management education is provided by polytechnics
and many of the colleges of further education throughout Britain; 12 regional
centres of management education have been established through the associa¬
tion of polytechnics and colleges which have high reputations for management
studies. Universities also make an important contribution, especially the
full-time postgraduate programmes at the business schools of London and
Manchester Universities. Training courses for higher management are offered
by several colleges including the Administrative Staff College, Henley-on-
Thames, and Ashridge College of Management, Berkhamsted. The Council
of Industry for Management Education, jointly sponsored by the CBI, the
BIM and the Foundation for Management Education, works to foster the
development of business and management education. Many firms provide
general management courses for senior executives or systems of informal
training. There are also a number of bodies concerned with specialised
branches of management, for example, the Institute of Personnel Management,
the Institution of Works Managers, the Institute of Administrative Manage¬
ment, the Institute of Supervisory Management, the Institute of Marketing,
the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators and the Institute of
Purchasing and Supply.
The large number of professional people working as management con¬
sultants indicates the concern for improved management performance in
Britain. Such consultancy services are being increasingly used by overseas
clients.
Design is an important factor in improving the quality and competitiveness
of manufactured goods. Improvement of the design of British goods is the
concern of the government-sponsored Design Council and its separate
Scottish Committee.
At the council’s Design Centres in London and Glasgow there are permanent
displays of well-designed modern British goods, together with special exhibi¬
tions illustrating new design developments. There is a third, smaller showroom
in Cardiff. All the products displayed are chosen from the council’s Design
Index, a record of some 7,000 current British products, chosen by independent
committees for their high standards of design, safety and performance. The
council’s services include advice on design matters, the organisation of product
displays at overseas trade fairs, conferences and seminars on design, help for
design education and the publication of a range of material. It provides annual

Design Council Awards for manufacturers of consumer and engineering
products and for medical equipment and motor vehicles.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of
Arts (see p 384), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is the
representative professional body in Great Britain of industrial designers and
the Design and Industries Association, a voluntary association of industrial
companies, designers, and others interested in the promotion of good design in
industry. The Crafts Council of Great Britain, the Crafts Centre of Great
Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre are all grant-aided and work to improve
craft design and to promote closer relations between craftsmen and industry.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making body
incorporated by Royal Charter, funded in part by sale of standards, by sub¬
scription and by government grant. It prepares and promulgates standards
which, variously, specify dimensions, performance and safety criteria, testing
methods and codes of practice for a large range of products and processes in
most fields of production. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manu¬
facturers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies
the specification of requirements. BSI is governed by a council consisting of
representatives of the main organisations of employers and workers, pro¬
fessional institutions and the larger government departments.
THE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY
The Government is giving priority to industrial development, in order to
reverse the relative decline in this sector that has been continuous for many
years. In view of the central importance to the economy of manufacturing
industry, government policy is concerned with improving its competitiveness
while at the same time developing effective solutions to such major problems
as regional imbalance and unemployment. The Government influences
industrial activity in a number of ways—through fiscal and monetary policy,
through the level of public expenditure, by incentives for industrial investment
and by the provision of services, information and advice. For the Govern¬
ment s relations with the public sector of industry, see pp 188-190. Legisla¬
tive arrangements control aspects of employment, monopolies, mergers and
restrictive practices and new industrial and office building and changes in
land use.
The Department of Industry is responsible for industrial policy as a whole on
both a national and regional level; 1975 saw the transfer of certain regional
responsibilities towards industry in Scotland and Wales to the Scottish and
Welsh Offices respectively. In Northern Ireland the Department of Commerce
deals with industry and industrial development.
There is close association between industry and the Government through
such channels as the National Economic Development Council (see p 188) and
the Economic Development Committees. These cover particular industrial
sectors and bring together representatives of government, management and
unions to study, and make recommendations on, the efficiency and prospects of
individual industries.
Since 1975 provision has been made for voluntary planning agreements
between Government and some leading firms.
The Government initiated its industrial strategy in 1975 as a medium-to-
long-term programme to strengthen industrial performance. Some 40 tri¬
partite sector working parties have been set up in the National Economic

Development Council framework; three sets of reports have been produced,
on the basis of which action is being undertaken to help to improve the sectors’
shares of home and overseas markets. Comprehensive programmes for action
covering such matters as investment, marketing, use of resources, research and
development and structure are being developed. There has been special
emphasis during 1978 on the need to improve productivity and to communi¬
cate the findings of the sector working parties to individual companies.
The National Enterprise Board (NEB), established under the Industry Act
1975, is a public corporation whose principal objectives are to assist the national
economy, promote industrial efficiency and international competitiveness and
provide productive employment. The NEB’s activities include the provision of
finance for industrial investment and restructuring. It has a holding company
role for shareholdings previously held by the Government, together with its
own investments. The NEB is expected to exercise a commercial judgement
and to look for an adequate return on its investments. Regional boards promote
NEB investment in the Northern and North West regions.
The Scottish, W elsh and Northern Ireland Development Agencies, estab¬
lished in 1975-76, are designed to stimulate industrial development within
their regions by exercising powers similar to those of the NEB with regard to
the provision of finance to industry and the establishment and management of
industrial undertakings. Where firms are based mainly in Scotland, Wales or
Northern Ireland, the development agencies take the initiative for action;
where they are more broadly based in Britain, the NEB is responsible. Close
consultation takes place between the NEB and the development agencies
\\here\er interests overlap. The Scottish and Welsh agencies also have
responsibilities under the regional development programme (see p 211).
Britain has a generous system of national incentives for industrial development.
Under the Finance Act 1972 incentives to encourage capital expenditure in plant
and machinery take the form of a system of free depreciation enabling the whole
of such expenditure to be written off against profits for tax purposes in the year
in which it is incurred; there is in addition a 54 per cent initial allowance on new
industrial buildings and structures and an annual writing down allowance of
4 per cent thereafter. Direct investment from overseas is also encouraged, and
o\ erseas firms are offered the same facilities and incentives as those applying to
British-owned companies. Under the Industry Acts 1972 and 1975 other
assistance may be provided throughout Britain where it is judged to be in the
national interest. Selective financial assistance is available for certain key
sectors of industry to encourage modernisation and increase efficiency.
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due partly to the
steady decline over the years of older industries, such as coalmining and ship¬
building, causing a high level of unemployment in certain regions and such
adverse factors as poor amenities, derelict buildings and land and net outward
migration. In addition, the newer and expanding industries have tended to
develop mostly in the Midlands and the South-East, and unemployment has
remained a persistent problem in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and some
parts of England, particularly the North and Merseyside. The ending of regional
imbalance has been an objective of successive Governments. Financial and other
aid to areas of high unemployment began in the 1930s and has been expanded
considerably over the years.
The map opposite shows those areas where assistance is offered by the Govern¬
ment to encourage industrial development and the movement of office and

other service employment. The assisted areas cover the whole of Scotland
and Wales, and in England the Northern, North-West and Yorkshire and
Humberside regions; parts of the South-West and East Midlands regions;
and Oswestry in the West Midlands. There are three categories of assisted area:
special development areas, where the economic situation and consistently high
rates of unemployment give rise to the most urgent need for assistance;
development areas with similar but rather less severe problems; and the inter¬
mediate area, where some assistance is necessary but where the need is rela¬
tively less acute than in the other types of area. Northern Ireland is covered by
separate legislation. The incentives available are outlined on p 211.
Under the Industry Act 1972 regional development grants are available in the
assisted areas to help to meet the costs of buildings and works on premises used
wholly or mainly for specified activities in manufacturing, and, in the special
development and development areas only, towards the cost of plant and
machinery as well. These grants are not limited to projects creating employ¬
ment, and are thus available to help with improvements and modernisation.
In addition they are not treated as reducing the capital expenditure which
qualifies for tax allowances.
The Industry Act also provides for selective financial assistance for projects
which are likely to provide, maintain or safeguard employment in any part
of the assisted areas. Assistance may be provided in a number of forms, the
usual ones for employment-creating projects being loans at concessionary
rates of interest, interest relief grants, removal grants and service industry
grants.
Other forms of assistance available include the provision of modern fac¬
tories for rent or purchase, free use of government training services, and grants
to assist the transfer of key workers to posts in the assisted areas. In the develop¬
ment and special development areas firms are given preferential treatment
when tendering for contracts placed by government departments and nationa¬
lised industries.
Special measures to improve the infrastructure in the assisted areas include
provisions under the Local Employment Act 1972 for grants towards the
improvement of basic services (such as transport, power and water facilities)
and towards the acquisition and clearance of derelict land (see p 166).
Broadly speaking, responsibility for regional industrial development is exer¬
cised in England through the Department of Industry and in Scotland and
Wales through the Scottish and Welsh Offices respectively. An important
exception, however, is the regional development grant scheme, which is
operated throughout Great Britain by the Department of Industry.
In England the regional offices of the Department of Industry in the main
assisted areas (the North, North-West and Yorkshire and Humberside
offices) can handle applications for loans of up to £2 million under the selective
financial assistance scheme without reference to the department’s headquarters.
The Secretary of State for Industry has access to advice from the Industrial
Development Advisory Board, a statutory body composed of prominent
members of the industrial and financial community, which makes recommen¬
dations on industrial opportunities and on applications for selective financial
assistance. Non-statutory industrial development boards have also been
established for the North, North-West, South-West and Yorkshire and
Humberside regions.

In Scotland and Wales, day to day work is carried out by the Scottish
Economic Planning Department and by the Industry Department of the
Welsh Office. Statutory Scottish and Welsh Industrial Development Advisory
Boards advise the respective Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. The
Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies are responsible for the provision of
factories for rent or purchase and are also charged with the reclamation of
derelict land and with certain powers to allocate selective financial assistance.
Under separate legislation (the Industries Development Acts 1966 and 1971)
the Northern Ireland Department of Commerce offers a full range of incen¬
tives comparable to those available in the assisted areas of Great Britain.
All firms establishing factories in Northern Ireland, without regard to the
number of jobs created, are eligible for capital grants at the rate of 30 per cent
of the cost of new buildings, machinery and equipment; for selective employ¬
ment premiums; for grants towards training and free use of government training
services; for grants towards the cost of transferring key workers; and for the
derating of industrial buildings by 75 per cent. The capital grants, like regional
development grants in Great Britain, are not treated as reducing the capital
expenditure which qualifies for tax allowances.
Projects which are especially attractive because of the number of jobs
created can obtain special benefits which include industrial development
grants of up to 50 per cent of the cost of new buildings, machinery and equip¬
ment (as an alternative to capital grants); contributions towards setting-up
costs; grants of up to 100 per cent of the cost of transferring plant and machi¬
nery; modern factories for rent or purchase; and loans, loan guarantees and
interest relief grants.
Grants of up to 50 per cent are available for research and development pro¬
jects (up to a maximum of £250,000 for any one project).
Assistance is also available to firms in the service sector which have a genuine
choice of location within Britain and which create additional net employment.
Projects serving primarily local needs are not assisted. The forms of aid avail¬
able to the manufacturing sector may also be offered to service sector projects.
The Northern Ireland Development Agency may also assist financially with
industrial development projects.
The Government also influences the location of industry by requiring in¬
dustrial development certificates before planning permission can be sought
for the building of new factories (or for extensions to existing ones) above pres¬
cribed limits outside the development areas, special development areas and
Northern Ireland. New office development in south-east England is controlled
in a similar way by a system of office development permits. However, under a
new urban strategy outlined in i977> the Government is encouraging industrial
and office development in deprived inner-city areas, whether or not these are in
the assisted areas.
The European Regional Development Fund was set up in 1975 to assist regions
of the European Community suffering from problems of a preponderance of
agriculture, industrial change and structural under-employment. In particular
payments are made from the fund in respect of approved industrial and infra¬
structure projects in the assisted areas. Britain’s share of the fund in the period
I975“77 was about £150 million.
Under a scheme introduced in 197^) loans are available from the European
Investment Bank to firms in the development areas, special development areas

and Northern Ireland. These loans protect the borrower from any risk of
loss due to movements in the sterling exchange rate.
Encouragement for the development of rural industries in England is provided
under the aegis of the Development Commission set up in 1909. Through the
agency of the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas (CoSIRA), the
commission provides business advice, credit for manufacturing and service
industries in rural areas, and loans for tourism projects in the rural parts of the
development and special development areas. In addition the commission
provides factory premises in rural areas and lends support for pioneering and
experimental schemes bearing on the rural economy, for voluntary bodies
aiming to enrich social and cultural life in the countryside, for miscellaneous
marketing and co-operative schemes in agricultural and fishing communities,
and for surveys and other work in rural areas.
In Scotland and Wales these services are provided by the Scottish and Welsh
Development Agencies. Separate bodies, however, cater for particular rural
areas. In Scotland the Highlands and Islands Development Board, set up by
Act of Parliament in 1965, provides assistance to the Highland region, and
surrounding islands, and to parts of the Strathclyde region. It provides grants
and loans to industrial and commercial enterprises, builds factories, and has
powers to acquire land and set up businesses. The Development Board for
Rural Wales has the general function of promoting and undertaking measures
for economic and social development in the county of Powys and the districts
of Meirionnydd and Ceredigion. It has a particular responsibility for new
towns in those areas and can acquire land, carry out building and provide basic
services. Within its area the board owns and manages Government estates and
factories and also acts as agent for the Welsh Development Agency in the pro¬
vision of assistance to industry.
The Department of Industry has a separate division which is the focal point
for the formation of policy towards small firms. In association with the Scottish
and Welsh Offices, the division operates a chain of Small Firms Information
Centres throughout Great Britain, which work in co-operation with local
business organisations and are linked to a central information bank in London.
A number of new measures to assist small firms were taken in 1977-78. These
included tax concessions (see p 339), continuation of the scheme to encourage
collaboration between small firms and extension of the small firms counselling
service. A small firms employment subsidy (see p 315), originally introduced
in special development areas, was extended in 1978 to include small manu¬
facturing firms within all the assisted areas and the inner city partnership
areas (see p 161).
In Northern Ireland the Local Enterprise Development Unit, established
to promote the development of smaller industries, provides grants, loans,
premises and management advice to new and expanding companies.
Government assistance for tourism is provided under the Development of
Tourism Act 1969. The Act established four independent but government-
financed statutory bodies—the British Tourist Authority, which is responsible
for the overseas promotion of tourism in Britain and has a general responsi¬
bility for tourism within Great Britain, and the English, Scottish and Wales
Tourist Boards which are responsible for encouraging the development and
improvement of facilities and amenities for tourists in their respective coun¬
tries, and for tourist promotional work and publicity within them. (In Scot¬
land, however, the Highlands and Islands Development Board exercises these
INDUSTRY
213

Protection
responsibilities within its area—see p 212). The Act enables the tourist
boards to give financial assistance to selected tourist projects in the develop¬
ment areas. Government policy is to encourage growth in tourism in hitherto
unexploited areas (particularly in the development areas) while sustaining
the industry in recognised tourist centres. The Northern Ireland Tourist
Board, established under separate legislation, has a function broadly similar
s to that of the other British tourist boards. Financial assistance to tourism
projects is available from the Northern Ireland Department of Commerce.
CONSUMER PROTECTION AND COMPETITION POLICY
The encouragement of fair trading, with the particular aim of helping con¬
sumers and safeguarding their rights, has become an increasingly important
part of government policy in recent years. The Government is also concerned
with competition policy and the control of restrictive trade practices. The
Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, set up in 1974, is responsible
for policy and legislation on consumer affairs and competition policy. The
Office of Fair Trading, a government agency, is concerned with the conduct of
trade and industry in Britain. Legal redress can, where necessary, be sought
by consumers in the county courts in England and Wales and the sheriff courts
in Scotland.
The Fair Trading Act 1973 provides machinery (headed by the Director
General of Fair Trading) for the continuous review of consumer affairs and for
action to meet new problems as they arise, including powers to deal with
trading practices which unfairly affect consumers’ interests, and to deal with
persistent offenders under existing law. Other legislation to safeguard the
consumer s economic interests deals principally with cjuantitv, performance
and service, price information and credit facilities.
The other major area of legislation is concerned with the prevention of the
sale of dangerous or harmful consumer goods. The principal laws here are the
Consumer Protection Acts 1961 and 1971, and the Consumer Safety Act 1978
which empower the Government to make regulations to ensure the safety of
any class of goods.
Provision of consumer information and advice is an important function of
those in local and central Government, and of several independent organisa¬
tions, concerned with consumer protection. The main outlets are the Citizens
Advice Bureaux (see p 134) and the Consumer Advice Centres run by local
authorities, both of which receive financial assistance from central government.
The independent, non-statutory National Consumer Council (and associ¬
ated councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), which also receives
government finance, ensures that the consumer’s view is made known to those
in Government and industry whose decisions affect consumers.
Consumer councils for the energy and rail nationalised industries and for the
Post Office investigate questions of concern to the consumer, while some trade
associations in industry and commerce have established codes of practice
designed to protect the consumer. In addition several private organisations
work to further consumer interests. The largest is the Consumers’ Association,
funded by the subscriptions of its membership of 59L000. The association
conducts an extensive programme of comparative testing of goods and investi¬
gation of services; its views and test reports are published in its monthly
magazine W hich? or its satellite publications. The association also provides an
ad\ ice service on subscription. Consultancy work on European legislation is
undertaken by the association on behalf of the Department of Prices and

Consumer Protection. Local consumer groups, such as the National Federa¬
tion of Consumer Groups, also promote consumers’ interests and provide
information and advice.
Competition policy has led to the development of machinery for scrutinising
and regulating monopolies, mergers and restrictive trade practices and of
powers to regulate any structural changes or uncompetitive practices which
operate against the public interest. The Fair Trading Act 1973 contains all
current legislation on monopolies and mergers. The Director General of Fair
Trading has certain statutory responsibilities in respect of monopolies, mergers
and restrictive practices, in addition to his work on consumer protection.
The objective of the competition policy of the European Community is to
promote free and fair competition in trade between member countries. The
Community’s rules of competition, which are set out in the Treaty of Rome,
apply to industrial and commercial practices likely to affect trade and prevent,
restrict or distort competition in the Community. Agreements which fall
within the rules must be notified to the European Commission; the Commission
has limited powers to exempt agreements which, though restrictive of com¬
petition between member countries, benefit the Community in defined
ways.
The Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection and the Director
General of Fair Trading can refer monopoly situations for investigation by the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The market share by reference to
which monopoly is defined is one-quarter; local monopoly situations and
arrangements which prevent, restrict or distort competition, and monopolies
in public sector industries can also be referred to the commission. If the com¬
mission finds that a monopoly situation operates against the public interest, the
Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection has powers to make
orders and otherwise to remedy or prevent the harm which the commission
considers may exist. It is more usual, however, for the Director General to be
asked to negotiate undertakings to remedy the adverse effects identified by the
commission.
A merger situation (defined as occurring when two enterprises are brought
under common ownership or control) may be referred to the commission by
the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection if it results in, or
intensifies, a monopoly situation, or if the value of gross assets taken over
exceeds £5 million. There are special provisions relating to newspaper and
certain other mergers.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 requires the entry in a public register
of the particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements which affect the
supply of goods or commercial services for the British market. Such agreements
must be notified to the Director General of Fair Trading who has a general
duty to refer registered agreements to the Restrictive Practices Court.
Unless the restrictions in them are abandoned, the court has powers to
prohibit the operation of any which are held by them to be contrary to the public
interest. Registration and judicial examination has applied to agreements
relating to goods since 1956 and to services since 1976- Not all registered agree¬
ments are taken before the court; those containing only insignificant restric¬
tions may be allowed to continue without reference to the court. The Secretary
of State for Prices and Consumer Protection may exempt from registration
proposed agreements of substantial importance to the national economy or
agreements designed to keep prices down. Restrictive agreements relating
INDUSTRY
215
exclusively to exports are not subject to registration but they must be notified
to the Director General of Fair Trading and to the Commission of the European
Communities if they fall within the rules of competition of the Treaty of Rome.

expansion has been particularly marked in those industries using advanced
technologies such as electronics (and more recently, micro-electronics), the
newer branches of mechanical engineering, instrument engineering, most
sectors of the chemical industry and man-made fibres. In other long-established
industries (for example, shipbuilding and marine engineering and electrical
engineering) extensive reorganisation, re-equipment and modernisation have
become essential to meet changing economic conditions.
A major stimulus has been provided by the various needs of the offshore oil
and gas industries.
In the following sections, relating to individual branches of industry in 1977,
employment statistics are the latest available from the Department of Employ¬
ment Gazette and refer to numbers in Great Britain at March 1978. Sales
and output figures are taken from the latest available Business Monitor
produced by the Business Statistics Office of the Department of Industry
and compiled from returns made by firms in industry. Export figures come
from Overseas Trade Statistics of the United Kingdom published by the
Department of Trade. Unless otherwise stated, export and manufacturers’
sales figures include parts.
Some sales figures are given in metric terms, where statistics for an industry
are normally published in this form. Conversion tables can be found on p 431.

Most of the early developments in iron and steel production originated in
Britain, today the world’s eighth largest steel-producing nation. The Iron and
Steel Act 1967 brought together into public ownership 14 major steel companies
and created the British Steel Corporation (BSC). BSC currently produces over
85 per cent of Britain’s crude steel and is the largest steel undertaking in
Europe. It employs some 197,000 people, of which 173,000 are involved in
iron and steel manufacturing and 24,000 in other activities, such as construc¬
tional engineering and chemicals. The remaining private sector companies are
represented by the British Independent Steel Producers’ Association whose
members employ some 70,000 people and account for over one-third of the
value of the industry’s turnover. The private sector is particularly strong in
the manufacture of alloy and stainless steels and of finished products for the
engineering industry. The main steel producing areas are Yorkshire and
Humberside (32 per cent of crude steel output in 1977), Wales (29 per cent),
the Northern region (14 per cent), Scotland (10 per cent) and the West Midlands
(7 per cent).
BSC has invested heavily in modernising its production capacity. Its deve¬
lopment strategy includes the replacement of open-hearth steelmaking by
basic oxygen steelmaking (for bulk production) and the electric arc process
(for more specialised tasks) and the concentration of bulk steelmaking at five
main sites (Port Talbot and Llanwern in Wales, Ravenscraig near Glasgow,
Lackenby in Cleveland, and Scunthorpe) which have good access to deep
water for iron ore imports. During 1977 and 1978 the industry was faced with
the serious problem of world over-capacity. In March 1978 the Government
published proposals for BSC’s capacity to move more into line with demand
INDUSTRY
217

Metals
in order to achieve financial viability. These included the deferral of a number
of planned new steel making developments and the closure of a number of old
steelworks, in advance of the dates previously agreed. About 80 per cent of
production is used by home industry and the remainder for direct export, the
major markets for which are the rest of the European Community and the
United States. A large part of the steel used by industry in Britain is also
subsequently exported as part of other finished products. The BSC is a
member of the European Nuclear Steelmaking Club, established to define a
strategy for the application of nuclear energy to steelmaking.
In the production of iron castings, a few large firms are responsible for more
than a quarter of total output while fewer, more highly developed units are
replacing the numerous small foundries. The main users of iron castings are
the motor vehicle industry, the general engineering industry, the manufac¬
turers of pressure pipes and fittings, the building and associated industries
and the steel industry. The Government is providing financial assistance for the
modernisation of the industry.
Britain’s non-ferrous metal processing and fabricating industry is one of the
largest in Europe. Its major products are aluminium (both virgin and secondary
metal); secondary refined copper, lead and primary zinc. Tin mining in Corn¬
wall supplies about 30 per cent of Britain’s tin requirements (see p 262) but
otherwise British metal smelting and refining industries are based on imported
ores and concentrates except for substantial secondary production from scrap
metal. Britain is also a major producer of the newer specialised metals including
uranium, zirconium and beryllium for the nuclear energy industry, niobium
for aircraft production and selenium, silicon, germanium and tantalum for
electronic apparatus. Titanium and titanium alloys are also produced and
used in aircraft production, power generation and North Sea oil production,
where their lightness, resistance to stress, flexibility and resistance to oxidisa¬
tion are especially valued. Nearly half the industry is situated in the Midlands.
Other centres include south Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth,
where a zinc smelter of some 100,000 tonnes capacity operates. Three large-
scale aluminium smelters provide almost 75 per cent of Britain’s require¬
ments for primary aluminium. The large non-ferrous metals fabricating
industry uses large quantities of imported refined metals such as copper, lead,
zinc and aluminium. A wide range of semi-manufactures is produced in these
metals and their alloys, and, particularly in aluminium, firms are engaged in
smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing: advanced
techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure die-castings are also employed.
In recent years considerable progress has been made in the development of
‘superplastic’ alloys, which are more ductile and elastic than conventional
alloys.
Scientific and technological research for the industry is conducted by the
Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Industry and by the British
Non-Ferrous (BNF) Metals Technology Centre.
The main products exported, including alloys and semi-finished products,
are copper, nickel, aluminium, lead, tin and zinc, Exports of aluminium and
aluminium alloys reached £194 million in 1977, while exports in the same
year of copper, brass and other copper alloys totalled over £215 million.
Exports of silver, platinum and other metals of the platinum group totalled
nearly £203 million in 1977. The major export markets for the whole industry
are the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The mechanical engineering industry comprises a group of industries manu¬
facturing all types of machinery, machine tools, industrial engines, mechanical
handling equipment, construction equipment and industrial plant. About half
the industry’s production is for the home market. The major customers for the
heavy equipment sectors are the nationalised fuel industries, the chemical
industry and the British Steel Corporation. A wide range of equipment is
supplied to the building and construction industry. Demand for other types of
equipment comes from all the production industries in Britain.
Britain was the birthplace of the machine tool industry and many of the more
advanced types of metal-working machine tools are produced in Britain.
Almost all machine tools produced are purchased by the engineering, vehicles
and metal goods industries. Seven large groups account for about 35 per cent of
machine tool sales and exports. Dependent as it is on the manufacturing
industries and their capital investment plans, demand for the industry’s
products is highly cyclical.
The most important types of metal cutting machine tools are milling, grind¬
ing and turning machines. Manual control for many of these tools is being
replaced by automatic control and Britain is an important producer of numeri¬
cally controlled machine tools, including machining centres. In addition, a
range of different sizes and types of metal forming machine tools are manu¬
factured in Britain. The largest export markets for the industry in 1977 were
the rest of the European Community, the United States and Poland. The
Machine Tool Trades Association represents most of the industry and is
responsible for the international machine tool exhibition held in Britain every
four years, the next being due in 1980. The Machine Tool Industry Research
Association carries out research into design and performance of tools and into
production methods.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial (including
process) plant and steelwork (for nuclear power station construction see
Chapter 13). Of particular importance are fabricated products such as pressure
vessels, heat exchangers and storage tanks for chemical and oil refining (process)
plant, steam-raising boilers (including those of high capacity for power sta¬
tions), sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, lime and cement kilns,
nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant and fabricated steelwork

for bridges, buildings and industrial installations. The industrial plant
industry comprises both equipment manufacturers and contractors responsible
for the design, engineering, construction and commissioning of complete plants
for process industries. British manufacturers have contributed to major ad¬
vances in process technology: there has been a rapid expansion in the number of
plants completed for the chemical, petrochemical, oil refining and gas in¬
dustries, particularly for North Sea oil and gas operations, and British firms
are carrying out major plant projects in many overseas countries. Gas turbine
engines for industry, in particular for power generation in the fuel industries,
are another thriving section of the industry, where exports have done well in
recent years. Three large firms are pre-eminent in the manufacture of industrial
engines, including those derived from aero-engines. Industrial pumps, valves
and compressors are vital components in many industrial processes, particu¬
larly in the chemicals, oil and electric power industries: over half the production
of all types of such equipment is exported. The fluid power industry makes oil
hydraulic and pneumatic equipment for operating machinery and construction
and other equipment. There are many new areas where these powerful and
flexible systems may be used.
Machines and accessories for the manufacture and processing of yarns and
fabrics from all types of natural and man-made fibres are produced by the
textile machinery industry in Britain, which is noted for the range, scale and
versatility of its operations. British inventions have remained the foundation
of many textile processes in use internationally and progress has been made in
developing automation in the industry. In 1977 the industry sold 87 per cent
of its output to export markets. Research and development is carried out by
the large firms and the four research associations connected with the textile
industry. Machinery for food and drink preparation, processing and sterilisa¬
tion is another important sector.
Refrigerating machinery (excluding domestic equipment) is used for food
and drink processing, but the industry also covers plant for ships and vehicles
and equipment for conserving drinks, food and ice-cream for the distributive
and catering industries.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is pro¬
duced, including excavating, earth-moving and road-making equipment, pile
drivers and quarry crushing and screening plant. Overseas sales of construction
equipment and of mining machinery and equipment, including coal cutting and
coal face loading machinery, are increasing. Mechanical handling equipment
is used not only for construction and related activities but throughout industry
generally. It extends from individual units and accessories to complete
operating systems, the main products being cranes and bridge transporters,
lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators, hoists and powered industrial trucks
including forklift trucks. Electronic control and completely automated hand¬
ling systems are widely available.
Britain produces a wide range of equipment for general and special use, includ¬
ing many special purpose machines such as hop-picking machines, fruit har¬
vesters and improved root harvesters (for tractors see p 223). Mechanisation
is extensively used in the arable farming and dairy farming sectors. Much of
the new machinery is designed for use in a variety of conditions to meet the
needs of overseas farmers. A large-scale annual exhibition of the industry’s
products is the Royal Smithfield Show and Agricultural Machinery Exhibition
held in London in December. The main trade association for the industry is the
Agricultural Engineers Association.

Sales by this industry have been expanding rapidly. Many products have an
increasingly electronic content, particularly in the use of micro-electronics. A
large proportion of the industry is owned by multinational companies. The
industry includes non-electronic data processing and handling equipment,
duplicators, typewriters, accounting machines and cash registers, and elec¬
tronic calculators. (For electronic computers and data processing equipment
see p 222.)
The other major products of the mechanical engineering industry include
printing, bookbinding and paper goods machinery, space heating, ventilating
and air-conditioning equipment, packaging and bottling machinery, portable
power tools and miscellaneous non-electrical machinery, such as boot and
shoe-making machinery, laundry equipment, automatic vending machines,
plastic working machinery and other types of specialised equipment.
General Alongside the firms manufacturing the products of the mechanical engineering
Mechanical industry are enterprises which supply parts and components and undertake
Engineering general sub-contracting, fabricating and repair work. Particularly important
is the production of ball, roller, needle and other bearings, about 25 per cent
of which is for the motor vehicle industry, and of other components, such as
precision chains, gears and drop-forgings.

Instrument engineering is a particularly important sector of the engineering
industry. Electronic techniques are widely used, particularly in the industrial
instrument sector, which comprises industrial and process measuring and
control instruments and equipment, optical instruments and appliances,
electrical measuring and testing instruments, nucleonic and ultrasonic testing
equipment, analytical instruments and a diverse group of others. About half
the market for analytical instruments is in the medical field. The chemicals,
power, petroleum and iron and steel industries account for about 80 per cent
of process control applications, the largest sector of the industry and one
which is expanding. Major advances have been made in automatic testing
equipment and analytical instruments for medical diagnosis and pollution
control. The industry is served mainly by five trade associations—the Scientific
Instrument Manufacturers Association, the Control and Automation Manu¬
facturers Association, the British Industrial Measuring and Control Apparatus
Manufacturers Association, the Electronic Engineering Association and the
British Photographic Manufacturers Association. The Sira Institute con¬
ducts research on behalf of the industry.
Photographic equipment includes photographic and cinematographic
cameras, projectors and document copying machines. Other sectors of the
instrument industry are concerned with watches, clocks and time recorders and
with surgical instruments and appliances and related products.

The electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufacture and installa¬
tion of a wide variety of equipment, which includes all types of generating,
transmission and distribution equipment, motors, telecommunications and
broadcasting equipment and domestic electrical appliances. The electronics
industry, which makes a vital contribution to the efficiency of many branches of
the country’s economy, has become one of the most important sectors of
British industry.
Leading representative organisations are the British Electrical and Allied
Manufacturers Association, the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic
Appliances and the Electronic Engineering Association, a member of the
Conference of the Electronics Industry which brings together the six principal
trade associations for the electronics industry. Scientific and technological
research is carried out by the Electrical Research Association.
The main product categories are power equipment (generators, motors,
converters, transformers and rectifiers) and switchgear, starting and control
gear. Mergers in the industry led to the creation of the General Electric
Company, one of the leading electrical engineering groups in Europe for
producing equipment used in generating, transmitting and distributing
electric power.
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
for telecommunication networks and other purposes; its products include
submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of materials. Four
major groups are responsible for more than half the industry’s output and for
a large proportion of the world’s submarine cable requirements.
A few large firms also dominate the market for other electrical goods,
including domestic appliances. Domestic equipment includes heating and
cooking equipment, washing machines and dryers, refrigerators, vacuum
cleaners, irons and electric kettles. Other major sectors are electrical equipment
for motor vehicles and aircraft; electric lamps and light fittings, and batteries
and accumulators.
The British electronics industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive
in Europe and British scientists and companies have made important contri¬
butions to electronics technology. Because of the diversity of the range of
products, an exact definition must be arbitrary, biit the sectors included are
telecommunication equipment, components, consumer goods, computers and
communication and other capital equipment, as well as electronic process
control and industrial instrumentation (see p 220).

The dependence of the telecommunications industry on electronic techniques
is increasing as new switching systems are introduced. The main products are
telephone exchange equipment, switching equipment for telegraph and telex,
data transmission equipment, facsimile, viewdata and other subscribers’
apparatus and long-distance communication equipment. The Post Office is
the main customer in the home market, which is largely supplied by four
companies and carries out research and development work in co-operation
with companies.
The components sector manufactures the whole range of active and passive
electronics components, including integrated circuits (in which many circuits
are placed on a tiny chip of semiconductor raw material), mainly for the
electronics equipment industry. Though the market is dominated by United
States manufacturers, some joint ventures with British firms are developing;
the NEB (see p 209) is also investing in circuit development.
The major consumer goods produced are radio and television sets, music
centres and high-fidelity audio equipment. In the audio field, British manu¬
facturers have a reputation for high-quality goods but are less strong in the
mass market.
In the computer sector, an extensive range of computer systems, central
processors and peripheral equipment, from large computers for large-scale data
processing and scientific work to mini- and micro-computers for use in control
and automation systems, are produced. Essential to the sector is the ‘software’
industry, which produces programs and associated services and complements
the hardware industry, enabling the systems manufacturers to provide complete
solutions to meet the requirements of users.
An expanding sector of the industry is that which covers the manufacture of
radio communication equipment, radar and radio navigational aids for ships
and aircraft, alarms and signalling equipment, public broadcasting equipment
and other capital goods. An important development in this sector has been
the X-ray scanner systems for brain diagnosis and whole body examination
manufactured by Electrical and Musical Industries. British equipment is used
extensively overseas, for defence, civil aviation, shipping, health, educational
and other purposes.

The motor vehicle industry comprises the manufacture of cars and commercial
vehicles, caravans and trailers, and parts and components. Output of cars and
commercial vehicles is dominated by four large groups (British Leyland, in
which there is a majority public shareholding, Ford, Chrysler United Kingdom
and Vauxhall) which account for over 99 per cent of car production and some
98 per cent of commercial vehicle output; the remainder is in the hands of
smaller, specialist producers of cars, heavy commercial vehicles, buses and

coaches. Although there is a balance of trade deficit in cars this is outweighed
by a surplus in commercial vehicles and component parts; in 1977 the motor
vehicle industry as a whole contributed about £700 million to the British
balance of payments.
The principal trade association for the industry is the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders which holds a biennial motor industry show at
the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham.
Britain is the third largest producer of tractors in the world and the world’s
largest exporter. Agricultural tractors account for the bulk of wheeled tractors
produced. Production is dominated by two large firms, with three others
responsible for most of the remainder.
In recent years the motor cycle industry has contracted and the domestic
market is largely supplied by imports.
British Rail s requirements of locomotives and rolling stock are now largely
met by their own workshops but there are several major companies in the
private sector building these for export as well as components and other
equipment such as traction and control gear, signalling, heating and ventila¬
tion systems. The private sector also builds the trains for London Transport
and other rapid transit networks and is developing a growing export trade.
Britain s aerospace industry is the largest and most comprehensive in Western
Europe and second only to that of the United States in the Western world.
The products of the industry include civil and military aircraft, helicopters,
aero-engines, guided weapons, hovercraft, space vehicles and a comprehensive
range of aircraft and airfield equipment and systems.
The public sector, represented by the nationalised corporation British Aero¬
space (BAe, which was formed in 1977) and the publicly owned companies,
Short Brothers and Rolls-Royce, is responsible for the greater part of aircraft,
guided weapon and aero-engine manufacture in Britain. BAe, which acquired
the assets and manufacturing capacity of the British Aircraft Corporation,
Hawker Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish Aviation,
is the largest of the aircraft and guided weapons manufacturers while Rolls-
Royce (see p 202), which is one of the world’s three leading aero-engine
manufacturers, is responsible for almost the entire output of aero-engines.
The private sector is composed of a number of aircraft companies, including
Westland Aircraft and its subsidiary, Westland Helicopters, which specialises
in helicopter design and manufacture, together with nearly all of the aviation
equipment sector.
Current production of BAe includes such civil aircraft as the HS 748 feeder-
liner, the HS 125 business jet, and the BAC One-Eleven airliner. Short
Brothers, which is based in Belfast, produces the Skyvan and the 330 com¬
muter airliner. The private sector produces such successful aircraft as the
Britten-Norman Islander and Trislander light transports. Military aeroplanes
include the unique Harrier vertical/short take-off and landing aircraft (which
has achieved substantial sales to the United States), the Hawk advanced trainer
aircraft, the Anglo-French Jaguar tactical fighter/operational trainer and the
Tornado multi-role combat aircraft, a collaborative venture by Britain, the
Federal Republic of Germany and Italy. Westland Helicopters manufacture
the successful Sea King and are the British partners in the Anglo-French col¬
laborative programmes on the Puma, Gazelle and Lynx helicopters which are
being produced for the armed forces of Britain, France and other countries.

The industry is also a major producer of guided weapons which include a
number of export successes, in particular the Rapier ground-to-air missile.
Collaborative guided weapon projects between Britain and its NATO partners
are also becoming of increasing importance.
Rolls-Royce aero-engines in production include the Pegasus vectored-
thrust engine for the Harrier, the Gem engine for the Lynx helicopter, the
quiet RB 211-22 engine and its more powerful derivative, the RB 211-524.
The new RB 211-535 engine is now being developed. Industrial versions of
aero-engines such as the RB 211 and the Olympus (which powers Concorde),
are being produced for use in oil and gas transmission and as stand-by power
generators while versions for marine use, in particular of the Olympus and
the Tyne, are being used to power a new generation of warships for the
Royal Navy and many overseas navies.
The aviation equipment sector provides a wide range of systems essential
to the design of engines and aircraft, including engine and flight controls,
electrical generation, mechanical and hydraulic power systems, cabin furnish¬
ings and flight deck information displays, which are sold both in domestic
and overseas markets. It also supplies equipment for ground operation includ¬
ing that needed for radar and air traffic control, ground power suppliers and
flight simulators, to airports and airlines throughout the world.
The industry is extensively involved in the manufacture of space systems,
including satellites for communications and other purposes, and in scientific
research in other European collaborative programmes. It carries out an
extensive programme of research and development on airframes, aero¬
engines and equipment, including avionics, while considerable research is
also undertaken by universities and Government research establishments.
Production and exports in the industry, which are fairly evenly divided
between the three sectors of airframes, aero-engines and aviation equipment,
including avionics equipment, have made considerable progress over the past
few years and now stand at record levels. The principal destinations for exports
are the United States, France and the Federal Republic of Germany.
The main trade association for the industry is the Society of British Aero¬
space Companies which organises a major international air show at Farn-
borough, Hampshire, every two years. Major suppliers of avionics equipment
are also members of the Electronic Engineering Association.
Britain has a long-established tradition of shipbuilding. Employment in the
industry has contracted in recent years as a result of the world economic
recession and an over-capacity in shipping, particularly of oil tankers. There
have been programmes of reorganisation and modernisation in most major
British shipyards, including construction of several covered-berth ship
‘factories’. British yards are among the most modern and efficient in the world.
Nineteen of the principal shipbuilding companies, five companies manu¬
facturing slow-speed diesel marine engines and three training companies and
their subsidiaries were taken into public ownership in 1977 under a public
corporation, British Shipbuilders. The public sector accounts for about
97 per cent of merchant shipbuilding, 99 per cent of warship building, all
slow-speed marine diesel manufacture and some 50 per cent of ship-repairing.
The sector also includes a number of companies engaged in general engineering
work connected with the marine industries. In addition to conventional ship
types, marine structures and modules associated with the offshore oil industry
are constructed. In all, British Shipbuilders employs more than 85,000 people.
A number of yards in the private sector build smaller vessels, including
INDUSTRY
225
patrol boats, fishing and harbour craft, supply vessels, tugs, cargo ships, small
tankers and ferries.
About 35 per cent of the output of British yards is exported. Private sector
companies in the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries are represented
by the Shiprepairers and Shipbuilders Independent Association. Research
into shipbuilding and marine engineering is undertaken by the British Ship
Research Association.

A range of metal products other than those described in previous sections are
produced by a group of industries made up of a very large number of firms. One
of the main groups, in which small firms predominate, manufactures engineers’
small tools and gauges, which include jigs and fixtures, press tools and moulds,
hard metal-tipped tools and other metal cutting tools. Another group manu¬
factures cutlery and tableware (including safety razors and blades). Although
small firms predominate, seven relatively large concerns are responsible for
over half of output.
A wide variety of domestic utensils, such as saucepans, buckets and dustbins,
made mainly from aluminium and wrought steel, are produced by the hollow-
ware industry, together with industrial hollow-ware, such as kegs, drums and
barrels. The manufacture of hand tools, including files, saws, hammers, axes
and spades, is a long-established industry. About half of its total production is
for export. Jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious metals is
an industry in which British craftsmen are world famous: five relatively large
firms are responsible for about 60 per cent of total output. Other main groups
of metal goods are bolts, nuts and screws, cans and metal boxes, metal furniture,
metal windows, metallic closures, metal small-ware such as needles and pins,
safes, locks and keys, domestic gas appliances and drop forgings.

second largest in Europe and the fourth largest in the Western world and
its exports of £4,076 million in 1977 (accounting for 11-7 per cent of total
British exports) placed Britain among the top five chemical exporting
nations. The industry is undertaking a substantial investment programme.
The largest British chemicals group, Imperial Chemical Industries, is the fifth
largest chemicals company in the Western world, accounting for about 20 per
cent of chemical sales in Britain. A further 30 per cent is in the hands of 24
other large- and medium-sized companies. The industry as a whole is repre¬
sented by the Chemical Industries Association. Research and development
work is financed by the companies themselves. The rest of the European Com¬
munity and the United States are the major export markets.
About 22 per cent of the output of the general chemicals industry consists of a
limited number of relatively simple inorganic chemicals, such as sulphuric acid
and metallic and non-metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for industry.
Substantial quantities of inorganic chemicals are used in the manufacture of
such products as fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass and metals.
Organic chemicals include the heavy organics produced in bulk and the
speciality intermediate products. Over 80 per cent of the output of organic
chemicals is made up of petroleum-based chemicals. The most important
products (by weight) are ethylene, propylene and benzene. The main outlets
for organic chemicals are solvents, plastics and synthetic resins, synthetic
rubber, man-made fibres and detergents.
Outside the inorganic and organic sectors is a wide range of general
chemicals formulated for specific uses. Radioisotopes are produced by The
Radiochemical Centre Ltd.; over half the centre’s production is for export.
The whole range of medicines is produced in Britain, where many of the
basic products were discovered and developed. These include antibiotics,
sulphonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics,
vaccine sera and naturally occurring drugs. Manufacturers in Britain are
among the world’s leading producers and exporters of preparations for the
treatment of human and animal diseases. This sector is one of the major
growth areas of the chemical industry.
Many of the basic discoveries in plastics, including polyethylene, were made in
Britain. Plastics manufacture is one of the fastest growing sections of industry
and 40 per cent of total production is exported. Expansion in recent years
has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of which the most important are
polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—notably for foodstuffs),
polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for a wide range of industrial
purposes and consumer goods), polystyrene (a material used for toys, light
mouldings and many consumer goods) and polypropylene (which can be
fabricated as mouldings, films and fibres). A new group of plastics materials
reinforced with carbon fibres is also in commercial production in Britain;
they have up to three times the strength but are only half the weight of steel.
High styrene rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use
where oil resistance is required, are also in large-scale production, together
with neoprene rubber.
The development of chemical fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
British scientists. Production is dominated by three firms, together with a

number of firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal con¬
stituents—nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium—and is almost entirely for the
domestic market. The use of ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate and
urea is resulting in more concentrated fertilisers. Notable discoveries by the
British crop protection industry include the insecticidal property of BHC
(benzene hexachloride), the first selective hormone weed-killer, MCPA, and
Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide. Herbicides are the largest
category of sales of pesticides and allied products.
Britain is a major producer of paints, varnishes and allied products. In
recent years many improved techniques have been introduced into the paint
and varnish industry, including new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments,
non-drip, quick-drying paints and paints needing only one application.
These industries include soap and detergents, toilet preparations, cosmetics
and perfumes. Many of the firms in the toiletries industry are owned or
financed by United States companies but there are a number of long-estab¬
lished British perfume and soap makers. Both sectors are significant exporters.
There is a varied group of chemical products which account for about 10
per cent of the industry’s net output. It includes formulated adhesives,
printing ink, colours and dyestuffs, photographic chemical materials and
floor and furniture polishes.

The historical branches of the industry, based on the natural fibres of cotton
and wool, linen and jute, have retained their separate identities but the
boundaries between them are becoming blurred with the increasing use of
man-made fibres. The growth of man-made fibres has stimulated the develop¬
ment of new processes and new types of yarn and cloth and has strongly
influenced the structure of the industry. A small number of large multi-fibre,
multi-process groups have emerged, although in many sectors there is still a
preponderance of small firms engaged in just one or two operations.
Research for the industry is provided by the Shirley Institute (cotton, silk
and man-made fibres), the Lambeg Industrial Research Association, WIRA
(the Wool Industries Research Association) and HATRA (the Hosiery and
Allied Trades Research Association). The Department of Industry sponsors
research and development both for these research associations and also
directly within the industry.
Much of the early development of man-made fibres took place in Britain and
continuing extensive research has produced a wide variety of types with their

own special characteristics. The two main types are still those first developed—
the cellulosic fibres, such as rayon, and the synthetic fibres, such as nylon and
polyester, made wholly by chemical processes. Acrylic fibres, including
Courtelle (a British discovery), Acrilan and Orion are important products, as
are the elastomeric or spandex fibres which have inherent properties of stretch
and recovery, anti-static synthetic yarns embedded with carbon and various
fire-resistant yarns. More recently there has been a greater use of the poly¬
olefins (polypropylene and polyethylene) in the carpet and carpet backing
and packaging fields and still more recently in household textiles and clothing.
Output in the man-made fibre industry is concentrated in the hands of a few
large firms and has expanded rapidly in recent years.
During the nineteenth century cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods
industry and cotton piece goods its largest export. Low-cost competition has
cut progressively into British markets and made necessary extensive re¬
organisation, modernisation and the introduction of new techniques. Pro¬
duction includes single and double cotton yarn, spun man-made fibre and
mixture yarn, woven cotton cloth and man-made fibre and mixture cloth.
The largest markets for cotton fabrics in 1977 were the rest of the European
Community, the United States, Zaire, Togo, Finland, and South Africa.
The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland, where the lighter types of
fabrics for apparel, furnishings and household textiles are produced. The
heavyweight canvas for sailcloth, tents, awnings and tarpaulins is mainly
produced in Scotland.
The wool textile industry, of importance to Britain since medieval times, is
one of the largest in the world and includes the world’s biggest wool textile
company, Illingworth, Morris. There are two main branches, woollen and
worsted. An increasing amount of man-made fibre is now blended with wool.
West Yorkshire is the main producing area but Scotland and the West of Eng¬
land are also famous as specialised producers of high quality yarn and cloth.
Large quantities of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain to prepare it for
spinning. Government assistance is being given to encourage structural
changes in the industry in terms of mergers and rationalisation and to stimulate
investment. The largest markets for woollen and worsted fabrics are Japan,
the United States and the rest of the European Community.
The hosiery and knitwear industry includes about 500 firms, mainly in the
East Midlands and Scotland, of which most are small to medium in size. The
industry produces fabrics, outerwear, underwear, tights, socks, stockings and
accessories.
Some 70 per cent of the output of the carpet and rug industry is made up of
tufted carpets, in the production of which the pile, usually with a high man¬
made fibre content, is inserted into a pre-woven backing. Woven carpets, such
as Axminster and Wilton, account for most of the remainder of sales. There is
a higher wool content in woven types, although they too are making more use
of man-made fibres. The volume of tufted carpets exported is now more than
twice as large as that for woven ones, but the high quality and variety of design
of the latter make Britain the leading producer of woven carpets.
Jute products are manufactured in the Dundee area. Jute yarn and the man¬
made polypropylene yarn are used in the manufacturing of carpets, cordage

and ropes and woven into fabrics for a wide range of applications in the
packaging, upholstery, building and motor car industries. New uses for jute,
for example as a plastics reinforcement, are also being considered.
British textile firms manufacture a wide variety of other goods, including lace,
narrow fabrics and household textiles, such as blankets, sheets, towels and
tablecloths. Rope, twine, nets and netting are manufactured by the cordage
industry, which is one of the largest in Europe. A recent development by
British manufacturers is the production of non-woven fabric by the melded
process, in which the conventional weaving and knitting stages are omitted.
The British clothing industry is one of the largest in Europe; it is highly labour
intensive and dominated by small firms, with over 6,000 firms accounting for
only 4 per cent of Britain’s total employment in manufacturing. The negotiation
of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (see p 357) has encouraged investment and exports increased sub¬
stantially in 1977. The Clothing Export Council, which represents a major
part of the industry, co-ordinates its promotional activities.

British Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association.
The British footwear industry is one of the largest in the world. The industry is
largely made up of small firms. Production in recent years has been severely
affected by the recession and an increase in imports especially in the lower
priced categories.

About two-thirds of the bread in Britain is manufactured in large mechanised
bakeries, most of which use a process developed by the industry’s principal
research organisation, the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association,
and now widely used in other countries. Two groups are predominant. In
smaller bakeries production of cakes and other flour confectionery is usually

allied to bread production. Biscuits and related products are a major sector of
the industry and have gained a world-wide reputation. Another sector is grain
milling and the production of various specialised flours and meal.
The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small
number of very large manufacturers and many medium-sized and small firms.
A substantial proportion of total world exports of chocolate and sugar con¬
fectionery are supplied by Britain.
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and pre¬
serving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the
preparation of extracts and pastes. In addition to the output of quick-frozen
fish, small quantities are also canned.
Fruit and vegetable products include canned, frozen and dried fruit and
vegetables, jam, marmalade, pickles and sauces. Other products of the food
processing industry include sugar, sugar preparations and honey, dairy
products and eggs, vegetable and animal oils and fats, coffee, cocoa, tea and
spices and cereal preparations.
Of prime importance among the alcoholic beverages produced in Britain, and
in the food and drink industry as a whole, is whisky. Scotch whisky accounts
for almost all whisky production in Britain. About four-fifths of annual sales
are to overseas buyers; the United States imports a third of the distilled
alcoholic beverages exported from Britain. The rest of the European Com¬
munity and Japan are the other largest markets. Production of gin in Britain
has risen steadily since the early 1950s. One company accounts for a large
proportion of output. Some of the larger manufacturers also own distilleries
abroad.
In the brewing and malting industry there are seven major brewery groups
whose products are sold nationally and about 80 smaller enterprises who
mainly supply locally, or regionally. Firms have introduced new production
methods, including continuous brewing processes, and automated batch pro¬
duction plants are well established. The main raw materials used are malt,
hops and some sugar. British malt, which is made almost entirely from home¬
grown barley, is used by brewers throughout the world. In recent years the
popularity of lager has increased considerably.
Three major groups account for much of the cider and perry produced in
Britain. The industry is based mainly in Devon, Somerset and Herefordshire.
Imported grape and fruit juices are used in the production of most of the made
wine. A much smaller, though expanding viticultural industry produces wine
from grapes grown in vineyards, mostly in southern England.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. There
are some very large firms among about 20 producing brands which are marketed
on a national scale, while other firms supply regional markets. There is some
specialisation among firms in the production of various types, such as car¬
bonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and
‘mixers’, fruit juices and health drinks.
The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and tobacco goods
sold in Britain. Two big manufacturing groups account for over 90 per cent of
total output. Exports, mainly of cigarettes, are shipped to a large number of
overseas markets, including Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands and Belgium.
Tobacco is imported in large amounts from the United States, Canada and
India.

Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products, including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, but most manu¬
facture is now based on highly mechanised systems. One company, the London
Brick Company, supplies about 40 per cent of total brick deliveries. Refractory
goods include firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks, chrome-magnesite
bricks and alumina bricks.
The cement industry is chiefly concerned with the manufacture of Portland
cement for the home market. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824,
this material and the methods of its production have been the subject of
continuous technical improvement and intensive research. One new variation,
glass-reinforced cement composites, consists of ordinary Portland cement
and sand combined with an alkali-resistant glass fibre. The capacity of the
industry as a whole has been substantially expanded in recent years.
The pottery industry, centred largely in Staffordshire, supplies almost all home
needs for domestic and industrial pottery. It uses largely indigenous clay from
Cornwall and Devon. There has been considerable re-equipment in the
industry; kilns fired by gas or electricity have replaced all the coal-fired
kilns, and new decorating techniques and automatic and semi-automatic
machinery, such as automatic glazing machines, have been introduced.
Domestic pottery, including china, earthenware and stoneware, accounts for
about half of the industry’s output; the other main divisions are glazed tiles,
sanitary ware and electrical ware, and such specialised industrial products as
acid-proof stoneware, porous ceramics and laboratory porcelain. Production
of tableware is concentrated in two major groups. Britain is the world’s
principal manufacturer of fine bone china, much of which is exported; famous
makes include Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Minton,
Coalport and Royal Crown Derby.
Britain s glass industry is one of the biggest in the world. The largest section
of the industry is devoted to the manufacture of flat glass in its various forms,
chiefly float glass, a process developed in Britain and licensed to glassmakers
throughout the world. The use of glass for internal decoration and as a finish
for internal and external walls has greatly increased in recent years. Large
quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor and other industries.
Other products include tubular glass, mirrors, lamp and bulb glass, scientific
and medical glassware, glass fibres, and all types of glass containers (mostly
made automatically). A traditional product is hand-made lead crystal glassware
of very high quality. Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass
Industry Research Association, and much research work is also carried out
by the Department of Ceramics, Glasses and Polymers of Sheffield University.

The British paper and board industry is one of the largest in Europe. The larger
British groups hold considerable interests abroad, including pulp and paper
producing mills in the United States, Canada, other parts of the Common¬
wealth and Europe. In recent years paper production has concentrated on
printing and writing papers and boards and speciality grades. There has also
been a significant trend towards waste-based packaging grades, in order to
reduce the industry’s reliance on imported woodpulp supplies. Domestically
produced woodpulp represents only a small percentage of raw material
supplies and the use of recycled waste paper is increasing: together they
currently provide nearly 60 per cent of the industry’s needs. The Govern¬
ment’s recently introduced Paper and Board Industry Scheme has assisted
the increased use of both recycled paper and board and of home-produced
wood pulp. The main types of paper and board produced are printing and
writing papers and board, packaging board, wrapping papers, newsprint,
household tissues and industrial and special purpose papers.
The packaging and converting industries manufacture a variety of
converted products, including cardboard boxes, cartons, fibreboard packaging
and business stationery products.
The printing and publishing industry produces a wide range of products,
including national and provincial newspapers, periodicals, books, business
stationery and greeting cards. Mergers have led to the formation of large groups
in the newspaper, magazine and book publishing sectors, but general printing,
engraving, bookbinding and a large part of publishing remain essentially
industries of small firms. Production processes include high-speed printing
equipment, including electronic engraving, advanced processes of photo¬
graphic reproduction and computer typesetting. Security printers (of, for
example, banknotes and postage stamps) have a high reputation and are
important exporters.
The most important overseas markets for printed matter are the United
States and Australia.

and accessories, conveyor belting, cables, hose, latex foam products and
rubber footwear, gloves and clothing. Rubber is also used for inflatable
liferafts, containers for fuel and other industrial liquids and seals for storage
tanks and other products where there are problems of air exclusion and vapour
suppression. One of the largest tyre groups in Europe, Dunlop-Pirelli
Union, resulted from a merger in 1971 of Britain’s leading rubber and tyre
company and its Italian equivalent. Tyre manufacturers include several
subsidiaries of United States and other overseas companies. The industry’s
consumption of rubber includes natural, synthetic and recycled rubber.
Numerous enterprises manufacture furniture in Britain (including domestic,
office, school and other furniture) with a few large firms predominating. In
recent years the industry has experienced a sharp increase in demand from
overseas. Exports have risen from £98-5 million in 1975 to £211 million in
^11 ■ The industry comprises wooden, metal and plastic furniture, upholstery,
bedding and soft furnishings. A Development Council for the industry has
existed since 1949. Scientific research and technical and other information
services are provided by the Furniture Development Council and the Furni¬
ture Industry Research Association.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain and includes highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft units.
Domestic production of timber has been steadily increasing but the timber
industries are mainly dependent on imported supplies. A large proportion of
timber sales are dependent on the construction industry. Chipboard is the
fastest growing sector of the industry; other important sectors are hardwood
and plywood.
In addition to the plastics components and accessories supplied to many
different industries, the plastics products industry manufactures a wide range
of building materials, such as pipes, sheeting for roofs, sanitary ware, tanks and
other products. It also supplies flexible foams, used in the vehicle, furniture
and other industries; rigid foams; packaging products, including bottles,
containers and bags; domestic and industrial hollow-ware, many kinds of
household goods, vinyl and other floorcoverings and leathercloth.
The industry manufactures toys, games, sports equipment and children’s
carriages. There are about 600 toy and games makers in Britain but some 20
companies dominate the market. The greatest expansion has been in the field
of craft and hobby kits. British diecast toys and model construction kits are
well known overseas; about half of the output of toys and games is for export.
The Federal Republic of Germany and the United States are the major
markets for toys while the United States and Canada are the main markets for
sports equipment.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry, which accounts for about 7 per cent of the total
domestic income, includes firms engaged on the design, construction, altera¬
tion, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage and
sewerage systems, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works, offshore
structures, electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, the extractive
and materials producing industries, and structural work connected with
thermal and hydroelectric power stations and telecommunications. About
i-6 million people are engaged on construction, including the self-employed,
and they represent some 7-5 per cent of the total labour force. About 6-5 per

cent are employed by public authorities. Some 32 per cent of output consists of
maintenance work, and about 45 per cent of all new work is commissioned by
public authorities.
Construction work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. In 1977 about 87 per cent of the
work was done by private firms. Although there were 50,000 firms employing
two or more people 92 per cent of them employed fewer than 25 people.
Public authorities as a whole employed about 252,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these were engaged on repair and maintenance work for
local authorities.
Some 42 per cent of operatives were occupied on building maintenance,
valued at about £2,580 million annually. The total labour force included about
869,000 skilled craftsmen (of whom about 76,000 were trainees), most of
whom had been trained under the industry’s apprenticeship schemes. The
normal apprenticeship period is three years.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake respon¬
sibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the smallest
projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either by
architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects, by
consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a client,
embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans and the
supervision of the construction work by the contractor.
The Property Services Agency, which is an integral part of the Department
of the Environment (see p 45) is responsible for the construction programmes
undertaken directly by the Government, including work for the armed forces
both in Britain and overseas. The Department of the Environment is respon¬
sible for the sponsorship of the construction industry. Among other things,
this involves consultation with the industry through the National Consultative
Council for the Building and Civil Engineering Industries and less formal
contacts. The Department is also responsible for co-ordinating research and
development in construction throughout Government and seeks to influence
techniques and methods within the industry.
The value of work done in 1977 amounted to £13,491 million, of which £1,640
million represented work carried out by the labour employed directly by public
authorities. Private contractors carried out the remaining £11,851 million
(£8,879 million on new work and £2,972 million on repair work).
Some 275,500 houses and flats were started in 1977 and 313,500 were com¬
pleted, of which 143,300 were for private owners. Of the £3,513 million of new
housing carried out by private contractors, £1,786 million, or over half, was for
private owners and the remainder for public authorities. Industrialised build¬
ing methods employing prefabricated components are used in some of the work.
The National Building Agency is an independent advisory body, managed
by a board of directors appointed by the Secretaries of State for the Environment
and for Scotland and Wales. Its main function is to encourage the adoption of
advanced methods of house building, and to provide technical advice and
services to government departments, local authorities and other clients.
The Association of Building Centres represents the interests of the 12
building centres throughout Britain most of which provide both a compre¬
hensive permanent exhibition and information services on building materials
and products, building services and techniques.

Among important construction projects in hand in Britain in 1978 were
conventional and nuclear power stations (see p 258), offshore production
platforms and onshore terminals for North Sea oil, hospitals, large-scale
housing developments, the first stage of the new Jubilee underground line
in London, and roads, tunnels and bridges, including the new bridge being
built across the river Humber (see p 287).
The overseas earnings of all sectors of the construction industry exceeded
£2,000 million in 1976-77. This figure is made up of some £320 million from
British contractors working abroad, their overseas branches and subsidiaries,
a contribution of £250 million from the related professions of consulting
engineers, architects and surveyors, and a balance of £1,450 million from the
export of building materials, plant and machinery.
In 1976-77 British building and civil engineering firms won new overseas
contracts worth £1,700 million in over 100 countries, an increase of £383
million on 1975-76.
A substantial amount of overseas work is being carried out by British
engineers, architects and surveyors. British members of the Association of
Consulting Engineers were engaged on overseas projects worth £31,000
million at the beginning of 1978.
The Government and the construction industry are represented on the
Exports Standing Committee of the National Consultative Council for the
Building and Civil Engineering Industries.
\\ ithin the Department of the Environment, the Building Research Establish¬
ment (BRE) is concerned with all aspects of construction research. In addition,
the Building Research Advisory Service of the BRE provides technical advice
over a wide range of construction problems. An Agrement Board tests and
certifies building products and methods.
The construction industry is served by several of the industrial research
associations, while the major construction firms have research departments
working on plant, materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with research
include the universities and colleges of technology. The larger producers of
primary building materials do some research into production methods and
new developments.
DISTRIBUTIVE AND SERVICE TRADES
Internal trade can be divided into two broad categories: trade in raw materials,
capital goods and intermediate products (for example, packaging materials)
and trade in consumer goods, involving the network of distributive trades by
which home-produced or imported goods reach the consumer. (For the pattern
of consumers’ expenditure, see p 192.)
While some of the trade in consumer goods passes through wholesalers to
retailers, sales are also made directly to consumers through producers’ own
selling organisations (including their own retail outlets and mail order
businesses), and other sales are made directly by producers to retailers.
Closely connected with the distributive trades are those which offer a service
directly to the public, notably catering and hotel trades, laundries and dry
cleaners, garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and shoe repairers.
There have been several major official statistical inquiries into the distri¬
butive trades. For wholesale trades, a large-scale inquiry was carried out in
respect of 1965, and more recently for 1974, while for service trades there was a
large-scale inquiry into the catering trades for 1969 and into motor trades for
236

1972. The 1971 Census of Distribution covered the retail and certain other
service trades. These large-scale periodic inquiries are being replaced by
smaller annual sample inquiries in Great Britain that will eventually cover most
distributive and service trades. For retailing, the first of these was conducted
in 1977 in respect of 1976, and for catering in 1978 in respect of 1977. In
Northern Ireland a Census of Distribution has been taken in respect of 1975.
About 2-5 million people in Great Britain were employed in wholesale and
retail distribution in 1977.
The main areas in which wholesalers are dominant are groceries and provisions,
petroleum products and ores and metals. The book value of stocks held by
wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1977 was about £5,212 million; fixed
capital expenditure by wholesale distributors amounted to about £151 million
in 1977 (valued at 1970 prices).
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers (who
may sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or, increasingly,
is sold by contract to fryers and processors, or direct to retailers. Fruit and
vegetables may be sold (or sent on a commission basis) to primary wholesalers
who dispose of the produce either to secondary wholesalers or direct to retailers;
alternatively the grower may deal direct with retailers or may sell his crop, under
contract, to a food-processing company for canning or freezing. The sale of
some agricultural products such as milk, hops and potatoes, is regulated by
statutory marketing boards.
London’s wholesale markets play a leading part in the distribution of food¬
stuffs. Every year the new Covent Garden market handles over 1 million tons
of fruit and vegetables, and about 159,000 tons of carcase meat and 50,000 tons
of poultry pass through Smithfield market; Billingsgate is the principal
distributing centre for fish.
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
organisation to serve the needs of retail societies. The sales of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS), whose membership is restricted to incorporated
organisations, amounted to £ 1,435 million in 1977.
The number of Cash and Carry wholesale warehouses has increased in recent
years. By bulk purchasing and limiting their expenditure on premises and
credit and delivery facilities they can offer large price discounts to their
customers. In 1976 there were about 640 warehouses of this type with total
sales of over j£ 1,600 million. Cash and Carry wholesalers accounted for
nearly half of all grocery warehousing by turnover in 1976.
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under four main headings: (1)
multiple traders with ten or more branches; (2) retail co-operative societies;
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small multiple
stores (that is, chains of stores with nine or fewer branches); and (4) department
stores. Other retail outlets include gas and electricity showrooms and mail order
businesses (see p 239). Multiple traders have tended to bypass the wholesaler
by having their own buying and distribution organisations. In response many
wholesalers have joined with independent retailers to form voluntary organisa¬
tions. This has helped to preserve the existence of retail outlets for the whole¬
saler and has given to smaller retailers the advantages of bulk-buying and
co-ordinated distribution without significant loss of independence. About
30,000 grocers’ shops, over a third of all independent grocers, are members
of voluntary groups.

Out of this total, grocery and other food retailing groups numbered nearly
198,000 and the clothing and footwear group over 81,000. Provisional results
of the retailing inquiry for 1976 (see Table 13) recorded some 400,000 estab¬
lishments, of which grocery and other food retailing groups accounted for
126,000 and the clothing and footwear group 61,000.
The total value of retail trade in Great Britain (inclusive of electricity and
gas showrooms and mail order business), after allowing for price changes, rose
by about 6 per cent between 1971 and 1976. Rates of growth (measured in
turnover) varied appreciably between different types of trade. The slowest
growth was in confectionery, tobacconist, newsagent, clothing and ‘other food’
sectors. The fastest growth was in department stores, mail order business,
combined gas and electricity showroom sales, household goods, groceries and
provisions, and ‘other non-foods’. However, the growth of sales on a commo¬
dity basis has been affected by increased diversification. The results of the
retailing inquiry for 1976 indicate a continuation of the trend for a larger
volume of trade to be handled by rather fewer shops, particularly in the food
sector, along with the continuing expansion of large multiple firms relative to
other types of shop. Independent shops accounted for about half of the value
of Britain s retail trade, although they made up more than four-fifths of the
number of shops.
A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. Seven
shops had a turnover in 1971 exceeding £10 million. At the other extreme there
were some 6,500 shops with a turnover of less than £1,000 a year. In addition
there were market and street traders, whose volume of business may be very
small.
Fixed capital expenditure by retail distributors in 1977 amounted to about
£412 million (at 1970 prices).
According to the retailing inquiry for 1976 there were some 169,000 shops
owned by multiples (including multiple department stores) in 1976 with a total
turnover of over £2^,000 million; their share of total turnover was about 65'3
per cent.
Total sales of the retail co-operative societies in 1977 were over £2,600 million,
being about 7 per cent of all retail trade. Their share of food shops turnover
was some 13 per cent.

The retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisations controlled by
their members. Membership is open to anyone paying a small deposit on a
minimum share, which entitles the member to an equal voice with other
members in the society. Share investment by individual members is limited to
£5,000 (less in some societies) and only a low rate of interest is normally paid on
the shares. One large society has introduced a scheme of bonus shares carrying
a higher rate of interest than the ordinary shares.
Traditionally the trading surplus was paid out to members in the form of a
dividend in proportion to their purchases. A large number of societies, account¬
ing for over four-fifths of total co-operative sales, have introduced dividend
stamps redeemable for cash, other goods, or credit to a share account, at
different redemption rates.
At the end of 1977 there were 231 retail co-operative societies. Amalgama¬
tions are rapidly diminishing the number of societies (the total in 1958 was
1,015). The largest single society in Britain is Co-operative Retail Services
Limited which in 1977 had 1,300 retail outlets and a turnover of £356 million.
Independent shops have been giving ground gradually in the face of increased
competition from the larger undertakings, but the decline has been partly
reduced by the existence of voluntary buying groups (see p 236). The
retailing inquiry for 1976 observed that the independent shops’ share of trade
has continued to fall (to 34-3 per cent); however, they still play an important
role, often in terms of convenience, service, and range of goods stocked. The
proprietors of some smaller shops have other means of livelihood.
Department stores were defined for the purposes of the 1971 census as having
25 or more persons engaged in selling a wide range of commodities, notably
clothing and household goods. There were 818 department stores in Britain,
according to the 1971 Census of Distribution, with a turnover of £950 million:
242 were owned by multiples; 343 by independents; and 233, with a turnover
of nearly £160 million, by co-operative societies.
The development of self-service trading has been a feature of the last two
decades. In 1971 there were over 28,000 stores operating wholly or partly on
self-service lines, compared with about 9,500 at the end of 1961. This develop¬
ment has been accompanied by a trend to larger shops in terms of both floor
space and staff, though the number of staff per square foot of floor space has
tended to decrease.
Supermarkets are defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling area of
2,000 square feet (186 square metres). According to estimates of the Institute
of Grocery Distribution there were 6,190 supermarkets in 1977 with sales of
£5,097 million. Their share of total retail grocery sales amounted to some
53 per cent.
The number of very large stores, generally known as ‘hypermarkets’ and ‘super¬
stores’, is increasing. They generally operate a selling area of between 20,000
and 100,000 square feet (1,860 and 9,290 square metres respectively); hyper¬
markets having a minimum selling area of 50,000 square feet (4,645 square
metres). These stores operate on supermarket lines but with a much wider
range of goods including food and non-food items. They are generally associated
with exclusive car-parking facilities and situated away from established central
shopping areas.

Mail order trading, through a mail order business or direct from retailer,
wholesaler or manufacturer was one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain between 1961 and 1966. Its growth rate slowed between 1966 and 1971,
but has since increased again. The retailing inquiry for 1976 showed that
total mail order sales by retail organisations were £1,875 million, accounting
5 Per cent of total retail sales. The main products sold through mail order
in 1976 were clothing, textiles and soft furnishings.
Some 31,790 mobile shops and market stalls were reported in the Census of
Distribution for 1971, with sales amounting to £147 million. Co-operative
societies accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food shops, against
12 per cent in ordinary food shops. Mobile shops were mainly concerned with
food sales; about two-fifths were travelling grocers, and greengrocers and
butchers each accounted for over one-fifth. Only a small proportion were shops
not selling food, and these specialised mainly in paraffin supplies and hardware.
There are about 500,000 automatic vending machines in use in Britain, many
of them installed in offices and factories. It has been estimated that sales from
vending machines in 1971 totalled some £155 million while sales from the
62,500 machines in use in the retail trade totalled some £12 million. The main
items sold in them are cigarettes, drinks, confectionery, prepared foodstuffs
and other commodities such as postage stamps.
Forms of consumer sales promotion include reduced price offers, competitions,
gift schemes, and stamp trading. Trading stamps are normally exchanged for
goods but, by law, have to be marked with a cash value and, where their aggre¬
gate value is £0-25 or more, redeemed for cash on request.
Sales by the 30 manufacturing and importing companies which are members of
the Direct Sales and Service Association Limited and which sell all their
products directly to consumers amounted to about £450 million in 1976.
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such as
cars, furniture, washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and cookers, has
been greatly helped by instalment credit facilities including hire purchase.
Total new credit extended by finance houses and retailers in Great Britain in
1977 amounted to £4,392 million, 22 per cent more than in 1976; about
53 Per cent was advanced by retailers and the rest by finance companies.
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating in Northern Ireland amounted in 1977 to £78-9 million.
The credit card is widely used in Britain. The cards enable users to have their
signatures accepted on bills in participating shops, hotels and restaurants. The
issuers, which include banks, then meet the bills and recover the money from
the card-holder through a single account presented periodically.
About 2-3 million people in Great Britain were employed in trades offering a
service directly to the public in 1977.
There were over 130,000 establishments concerned with catering (defined to
include public houses, canteens and fish and chip shops, as well as licensed
hotels and restaurants) in Britain in 1969. There were 203 catering contractor
organisations and over 18,000 industrial and office canteens.

The value of total turnover of all caterers in 1977 was £6,510 million while
that of licensed hotels and holiday camps was £1,260 million and that of public
houses £3,520 million.
In 1971 there were over 8,400 laundry, launderette, dry cleaning and towel,
linen and overalls hiring organisations. Turnover in 1971 amounted to some
£212 million.
There were 46,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain in 1972 with 55>000
establishments and a total turnover of £8,100 million. These trades include
motor repairers, distributors, garages and petrol stations. Sales of new vehicles
accounted for some 36 per cent of the 1977 total of some £17,200 million and
sales of second-hand vehicles for 16 per cent. Sales of accessories, receipts
from sales and servicing and sales of petrol and oil accounted for the remaining
48 per cent.
The 1971 census recorded some 47,200 hairdressing establishments with a
total turnover of £166 million. About two-thirds of the number are ladies’
hairdressers.
In 1971 there were some 5,500 boot and shoe repair establishments; total
takings amounted to £22-4 million.
In Britain the expansion of self-service shops, the spread of branded and
standardised products, and developments in partly prepared foods, for example,
ready-washed vegetables and ready-made cake mixes, have all been major
factors in the changes which have taken place in packaging methods. Packaging
products of paper and board remain the most extensively used (turnover of some
£900 million in 1976). Other important materials are tinplate, plastics and
glass. New uses have been found for tinplate, especially in the canning of soft
drinks and beer. The use of plastics continues to develop, particularly poly¬
ethylene film and film products and low-density polyethylene bottles used as
an alternative to the traditional glass bottle.
Some £1,499 million was spent on all forms of advertising in 1977, as a
proportion of the gross national product (1*22 per cent) and of consumer
expenditure (i*8 per cent), about the same as in 1956. Of this figure £1,020
million was spent on display advertising and £481 million on classified,
financial and industrial advertising. Most of the advertising is planned by
agencies, which, in some cases, also provide marketing, consumer research and
other services; their representative organisation is the Institute of Practitioners
in Advertising. The trade association for the whole industry, including agencies,
advertisers and media owners, is the Advertising Association. It was responsible
for the setting up of the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body
whose objective is the promotion and enforcement of the highest standards of
advertising, in particular through the British Code of Advertising Practice.
Industry and commerce pay great attention to improving public understanding
of their work and objectives. Many have their own public relations advisers and
staff, while consultancy firms provide general services and assistance for special
public relations activities. The Institute of Public Relations, founded in 1948,
is the largest professional public relations organisation in Europe, with some
2,500 members in commerce, industry, public relations consultancies, national
associations, and central and local government.
Resources
Much of Britain’s energy requirement is supplied from domestic fuel
minerals (coal, oil and natural gas), and minerals in general make an important
contribution to the economy. The approximate value of minerals produced in
1976 was £3,921 million, of which coal contributed 59 Per cent, crude oil 15
per cent and natural gas 6 per cent. The discovery and exploitation of oil¬
fields and gasfields under the British sector of the North Sea are increasing
the importance of domestically produced fuel minerals to the economy very
considerably. Over the past ten years the production of non-fuel minerals has
also increased.
Water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial require¬
ments, supplies are obtained from surface sources such as mountain lakes and
from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
Ownership of Apart from gold, silver, oil, natural gas (which are owned by the Crown), coal,
Mineral Rights and some minerals associated with coal, all minerals in Great Britain are
privately owned. On the United Kingdom Continental Shelf the right to
exploit all minerals except coal is vested in the Crown. The exclusive right to
extract coal, or license others to do so, both on land and under the sea, is
vested in the National Coal Board. Normally, ownership of minerals runs with
the ownership of the land surface but in some areas, particularly where
mining has taken place, these rights have become separated. Mining and
quarrying, apart from coal, are usually carried out by privately owned
companies.
ENERGY
Four main primary sources of energy—petroleum, coal, natural gas and
nuclear power are used in Britain, together with some water power; second¬
ary sources produced from these are electricity, coke and very small quantities
of town gas. Inland consumption of energy amounted to 338’4 million tonnes
of coal equivalent in 1977, 2-6 per cent higher than in 1976. About three-
quarters of all primary energy consumed comes from indigenous sources and
the proportion is increasing as growing supplies of oil and gas are obtained
from the British sector of the North Sea. These are of major importance as
they will enable Britain to become self-sufficient in energy for a number of
years from 1980 onwards and will benefit the balance of payments through
substantial import savings. The share of natural gas in total consumption has
increased substantially, supplies from the North Sea discoveries having
expanded rapidly since the first quantities were piped ashore in 1967.
Reserves of coal, Britain s richest natural resource, are sufficient to enable
production to continue for about 300 years at current rates of extraction. Al¬
though coal has accounted for a declining proportion of energy consumption,
a major capital investment programme is in progress to end the contraction
242

of the industry. A nuclear power programme has been in progress since 1955
and nuclear power provides a significant share of electricity supplies.
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of most of the petroleum
industry and part of that concerned with the extraction of natural gas, are
under public ownership. The publicly owned fuel and power industries in
Britain employ in total some 600,000 people, 2’3 per cent of the working

population, and their annual turnover is about £10,800 million and capital
investment about £1,500 million. In Great Britain the Secretary of State for
Energy is responsible for these industries, except for electricity in Scotland
which is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
The Government wishes to ensure the best use of indigenous resources. It is
continuing to develop an integrated approach to energy policy and in February
1978 put forward in a consultative document proposals for developing a long¬
term energy policy by means of a flexible strategy based on the creation of
further capacity in the coal industry, a capability for a quick expansion of
nuclear power in the late 1980s and 1990s if this proves economically desirable
and publicly acceptable, the avoidance of too rapid a decline in offshore oil and
gas production, research and development into alternative sources of energy,
and exploitation of the opportunities for energy conservation. The strategy is
to be kept under regular review by the Energy Commission, a body set up in
I977 t0 advise on major issues of energy policy and consisting of representa¬
tives of management and employees in the main energy industries and of
consumers, industry and other interests.
Britain, which has the richest energy resources of any member State of the
European Community, is co-operating fully in the development of the
Community’s energy policy, a basic objective of which is to reduce depen¬
dence on imported energy supplies. Britain is one of the 19 members of the
International Energy Agency, an organisation attached to the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is engaged on a pro¬
gramme of international co-operation to deal with world energy problems.
Trends in primary energy consumption are shown in Table 14 and in the
diagram on p 242. In 1977 petroleum accounted for 40-4 per cent of primary
consumption, coal 36-3 per cent, natural gas 18-5 per cent, nuclear power 4-2
per cent and hydro-electric power o-6 per cent. Energy consumption by final
users in 1977 amounted to 58,532 million therms1 on a ‘heat supplied’ basis.
Industrial users consumed about 39 per cent, domestic users 26 per cent,
transport 22 per cent, public services 6 per cent and agriculture 1 per cent.

Although Britain has sufficient supplies of oil and gas for a number of years,
worldwide difficulties of energy supply are expected from about the 1990s on¬
wards. Accordingly, energy conservation is an integral part of Britain’s energy
policy, as in many other countries. The role of the Government is to set a good
example in its use of energy, and to guide and stimulate consumers to use
energy more efficiently. Britain’s continuing energy conservation programme

involves a combination of advisory, financial and mandatory measures aimed
at all energy-using sectors. The development of the programme is overseen by
a Committee of Ministers on Energy Conservation, while the Secretary of State
for Energy is also advised by an independent Advisory Council on Energy
Conservation. Studies on energy conservation and alternative sources of
energy are undertaken by a number of organisations, notably the Energy
Technology Support Unit of the Department of Energy at Harwell (Oxford¬
shire).
In the last four years the Government has introduced a wide range of measures
designed to encourage energy saving including an 11-point programme in
December 1977. In April 1978 it announced further help for industry and a
scheme of grants to private householders for basic insulation. Conservation
measures contributed to energy savings estimated at around £2,000 million
in the four years to the end of 1977.
Many firms have achieved significant economies through measures such as
better use of heating and lighting, improved operational and maintenance
techniques, and the installation of draught-proofing and additional insulation.
The Government has encouraged firms to appoint energy managers (of
whom there are some 3,000) to draw up and administer energy conservation
measures in factories and offices. Several schemes are in operation to assist
industry and commerce. Standards of thermal insulation required in new
dwellings have been virtually doubled and many householders and organisa¬
tions have improved thermal insulation in existing properties. In 1977 a ten-
year programme was initiated to bring public sector housing up to a basic
minimum standard of insulation; over 2 million dwellings will be treated.
Other conservation measures have included compulsory limits on heating
levels in commercial and industrial buildings; publication of official fuel con¬
sumption figures for new cars, so that potential purchasers can assess the petrol
usage of different models; and a major government publicity campaign to
promote the efficient use of energy.
Substantial oil and gas reserves have been discovered in the United Kingdom
Continental Shelf under the North Sea and their total value is estimated at
about £300,000 million. It is one of the world’s most attractive offshore areas
for oil and gas, the average success rate for exploration drilling comparing very
favourably with other offshore areas. Seismic prospecting began in the early
1960s and full-scale exploration activities in 1964. Five rounds of production
licensing have been held and a sixth round is planned. The Government’s
policy is to license small areas of territory at frequent intervals to maintain
activity at a constant level. The total area covered by production licences is
some 60,000 square kilometres (23,200 square miles) out of a total designated
area of about 624,600 square kilometres (241,200 square miles), over which
Britain has exercised its rights to explore and exploit the seabed and subsoil.
Work on the development and production of Britain’s offshore oil and gas is
proceeding rapidly. By the end of July 1978, 781 exploration or appraisal
wells and 448 production wells had been drilled or begun; of these 105 and
96 respectively were drilled in 1977.
Large-scale investment is taking place in offshore exploration and develop¬
ment, estimated at £2,000 million in 1977. A further £6,000 million is
expected to be invested in the three years 1978 to 1980.
The Department of Energy’s Offshore Supplies Office seeks to ensure that
British industry can compete effectively for orders for offshore equipment

by helping firms to identify the needs of offshore operators, assisting operators
to identify British suppliers of offshore equipment and services, and pro¬
moting new ventures to increase British involvement in the industry. British
companies increased their share of the offshore market, worth ^1,295 million
in 1977, from between 25 and 30 per cent in 1973 Per cent in I977 an<^
are increasingly involved in supplying other offshore markets.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coalfields. The Scottish shale
deposits, yielding similar products, were worked between 1858 and 1962.
With the rapid growth of oil consumption during this century, however,
Britain became almost totally dependent on imported supplies. The first dis¬
covery of oil in the British sector of the North Sea was made in 1969 and the
first oil was brought ashore in 1975. Production has increased rapidly and the
first large-scale benefits to Britain, in the form of exports and of imports
saved, are being realised. (For estimates of the growing economic benefits of
North Sea oil revenues see p 194.)
By mid-1978, nine fields in the British sector were producing oil: Brent and
Forties, two of the largest offshore oilfields in the world; Argyll; Auk; Beryl;
Claymore; Montrose; Piper and Thistle. A further nine fields are under
development, while more than 40 further significant finds that have been made
may prove to be commercial after further appraisal. Production from most
large fields is controlled from production platforms of either steel or concrete
which have been built to withstand severe weather including gusts of wind of
up to 257 km/h (160 mph) and waves of 30 metres (100 feet).
Offshore oil production from the British sector amounted to nearly 38
million tonnes in 1977, more than three times the level of output in 1976, and
was equivalent to nearly half of Britain’s primary oil consumption. Production
is expected to continue to rise rapidly, reaching between 55 million and 60
million tonnes in 1978, about 100 million tonnes by 1980, and between 100
million and 150 million tonnes a year in the early 1980s, placing Britain among
the world’s ten leading oil producing countries. Proven reserves of oil in the
United Kingdom Continental Shelf amount to 1,405 million tonnes while the
total reserves of the United Kingdom Continental Shelf could be as high as
4,500 million tonnes.
The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 provided for the establish¬
ment of the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC); tighter controls over
exploration, development, installation of pipelines and refining capacity; and
control over the rate of depletion to ensure that offshore oil is used at a rate
which secures the greatest long-term benefit for Britain. The Government
considers that majority State participation in licences for commercial oilfields
provides the best means for the nation to share fully in the benefits of off¬
shore oil. Majority participation through the BNOC in existing commercial
oilfields has been achieved by negotiations with the licensees; by mid-1978
participation agreements had been concluded with 62 companies. The
BNOC or the British Gas Corporation has a majority share in licences awarded
under the fifth round of offshore petroleum production licensing and similar
arrangements are planned for the sixth round.
The British National Oil Corporation was set up as a public corporation in
1976 when it took over the British offshore interests previously held by the
National Coal Board. It subsequently acquired a majority of the North Sea

interests held by the Burmah Oil Company. The Corporation also holds the
Government’s participation interest in production licences. It has powers to
explore for, produce, transport and refine petroleum; store, distribute and buy
and sell petroleum; and provide advisory services and carry out research and
training. Other activities, which can be undertaken only with the Govern¬
ment’s consent, include overseas exploration and production. The Corporation
has a share in the Thistle oilfield and the Viking gasfield, in four oilfields under
development and in a number of other oil and gas finds. With its equity and
participation interests, the BNOC will have access to substantial amounts of
North Sea crude oil in the 1980s. The BNOC’s board consists of between
eight and 20 members including two civil servants.
Onshore production of crude oil in Britain is much less significant than off¬
shore production, amounting in 1977 to 99,000 tonnes. Twelve onshore fields
are in operation, notably Beckingham, Bothamsall and Egmanton in Notting¬
hamshire, Gainsborough in Lincolnshire and Kimmeridge in Dorset.
Britain’s largest onshore field, at Wytch Farm (Dorset), should start full
production early in 1979.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1977 totalled 83-2 million tonnes including 27-8 million
tonnes of fuel oil, 19-6 million tonnes of gas and diesel oil (including derv fuel
used in road vehicles), i7'3 million tonnes of motor spirit and 6-8 million
tonnes of kerosene. Deliveries for electricity generation accounted for 37 per
cent of fuel oil deliveries in 1977. The largest industrial users of fuel oil
are the steel, chemicals and paper-making industries.
In 1978 gross refinery capacity in Britain amounted to 1427 million tonnes a
year. Of the 20 refineries in operation, 17 have a capacity of over 1 million
tonnes and are shown on the map on p 245. Four have an annual capacity of
over 10 million tonnes: Fawley, near Southampton (18-2 million tonnes);
Stanlow, in Cheshire (17-6 million tonnes); one of the four in the area of
Milford Haven, Dyfed (15-4 million tonnes); and Isle of Grain (10-5 million
tonnes) on the Thames Estuary. Outline planning permission has been given
for new refineries at Cliffe (Kent) and Nigg Bay (Highland), and for two
projects at Canvey Island (Essex). In future new projects for the construction
of refineries of over 1 million tons or the extension of existing refineries by
more than 500,000 tons will require an authorisation from the Secretary of
State for Energy under the Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption)
amounted to 86-3 million tonnes in 1977. In 1977 Britain’s imports of crude
and process oils were 70-2 million tonnes, valued at ^4,094 million, 107 per
cent less in value than in 1976. Saudi Arabia supplied approximately 25 per
cent of crude oil by value, Iran 18 per cent, Kuwait 13 per cent and Iraq
8 per cent. Imports are expected to continue to decline, although heavy crude
oil will still be imported for particular uses.
The British sector produces high quality premium oil, much of which has
been refined in Britain, although substantial quantities have also gone overseas
for refining. Exports have risen considerably and in 1977 were valued at £903
million of crude oil and ,£1,062 million of petroleum products. Most oil
exports are sent to other countries in Western Europe.
Oil Pipelines
Five main crude oil pipelines are in operation in Britain from harbours or
offshore moorings capable of berthing very large tankers to refineries (see map,
248

p 245): from Finnart to Grangemouth; from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to
Llandarcy; from Tranmere to Stanlow; from Amlwch (Gwynedd) to Stanlow;
and from a single buoy in the Humber estuary to Killingholme. About 700
miles (1,127 kilometres) of submarine pipeline have been built to bring ashore
oil from the North Sea. Pipelines connect the Forties field to Cruden Bay
(Grampian) and the refinery at Grangemouth, the Piper and Claymore fields
to a terminal at Flotta (Orkney), the Ninian and Heather fields to a terminal at
Sullom Voe (Shetland), the Brent and several neighbouring fields to Sullom
Voe and the Norwegian Ekofisk field to Teesside.
Pipelines also carry refined products and petrochemical feedstocks to major
marketing areas; for example, a 300-mile (480-kilometre) pipeline runs from
Milford Haven to the Midlands and Manchester.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(British Petroleum), Ellesmere Port in Cheshire, and Woodstock in Kent
(Shell), and Abingdon, in Oxfordshire (Esso). Work in progress includes the
evolution of new and improved fuels and lubricants, and the development of
new uses for petroleum products and of new products based on petroleum,
especially chemicals. The main Government research and development
effort in offshore technology is undertaken by the Department of Energy
with the advice of the Offshore Energy Technology Board (see p 377). In
1978-79 the Department of Energy expects to spend some £15 million in
support of offshore technology.
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain began in the early nineteenth
century in Westminster in central London using gas produced from coal. Gas
was originally used almost exclusively for lighting, but between the two world
wars it was displaced from this function by electricity. It is now used for
domestic cooking and heating and for many industrial and commercial pur¬
poses. During the 1960s there was a fairly rapid switch to producing town
gas from oil-based feedstocks instead of coal. In 1965 the first commercial
natural gas discovery in the British sector of the North Sea was made and pro¬
duction started in 1967. Natural gas has now replaced town gas as the source
of gas for the public supply system in Great Britain.
The Gas Act 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain under public
ownership and control in 1949. As a result of the change to natural gas
necessitating more centralised control of production and transmission, the
British Gas Corporation was set up in 1973 under the Gas Act 1972 to replace
the Gas Council and 12 area gas boards. The Corporation’s powers in connec¬
tion with its main duty of developing and maintaining an efficient, co¬
ordinated and economical system of gas supply and of satisfying reasonable
demands for gas are: to search for and extract natural gas and any oil dis¬
covered in the course of searching for gas; to manufacture or acquire,
transmit and distribute gas; to manufacture, supply, or sell by-products; and
to manufacture, install, maintain or remove gas plant and fittings. It has about
100,000 employees.
Natural gas is not available in Northern Ireland and the industry there,
which is controlled by nine municipal undertakings and four private sector
companies, uses town gas produced from oil feedstocks.

Indigenous natural gas accounted for 96 per cent of primary gas demand in
1977. Between 1972 and 1977 the quantity of gas sent out by the public supply
system in Britain increased by 44 per cent to 15,323 million therms. Seven
major gasfields are now in production (Leman Bank, Hewett, Indefatigable,
Viking, West Sole, Rough and Frigg) and their output totalled 40,166 million
cubic metres in 1977. Gas supplies are expected to continue to rise as output
from the Frigg field, which straddles the boundary between the British and
Norwegian sectors of the North Sea, builds up and as gas produced in associa¬
tion with oil in the Brent and Piper fields is brought ashore. Gas has also
been found in a number of smaller structures and in association with oil in a
number of other fields; exploration is continuing. Total proven gas reserves
remaining in known discoveries in the United Kingdom Continental Shelf at
the end of 1977 amounted to 744,000 million cubic metres and total possible
reserves in known discoveries amounted to 1-5 million million cubic metres.
The pipeline system commissioned in 1964 for the delivery of liquefied
natural gas imported from Algeria has been expanded to form a national high-
pressure pipeline system (see map, p 249) for transmission of natural gas
derived mainly from British fields in the North Sea. By March 1978 some
3,500 miles (5,633 kilometres) of pipeline were in operation. The national
transmission system is supplied by feeder mains from the four North Sea shore
terminals and from the Canvey Island terminal for liquefied Algerian gas.
Three new pipelines have been built to carry gas from St Fergus (Grampian)
to central Scotland and northern England. In the northern North Sea the first
of the two 225-mile (362-kilometre) pipelines has been laid between the Frigg
field and St Fergus, while the longest offshore pipeline in the British sector of
the North Sea has been laid for 281 miles (452 kilometres) between the Brent
field and St Fergus.
There are considerable quantities of gas in the North Sea in fields which
are too small for economic exploitation. Gas Gathering Pipelines (North Sea)
Ltd was therefore set up to investigate the economic feasibility of an inte¬
grated network of pipelines to collect gas, mainly from oilfields and gas
condensate fields. Its final report, submitted in April 1978, is being considered
by the Government.
Various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions are
being investigated. Storage facilities for liquefied natural gas have been
installed at four sites and further facilities, including three salt cavities at
Hornsea (Humberside), are under construction.
Over half of all gas sold by the British Gas Corporation to its 14-5 million
consumers is for industrial and commercial purposes, most of the remainder
being for household use. Total consumption increased rapidly during the late
1960s and early 1970s, but is now growing at a more modest rate, with sales in
Britain rising by 4-2 per cent in 1977 to 14,579 million therms. A phased
programme of converting all gas appliances to use natural gas was completed
in Great Britain in 1977. Gas is used particularly in industries requiring the
control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy such as the pottery
industry and certain processes for making iron and steel products. Natural gas
not required by the fixed tariff domestic, commercial and small industrial
markets is being used in bulk fuel markets and as a chemical feedstock. In
I977> 5,883 million therms of gas were sold to industry in Britain, 519
million therms to public supply and transport power stations and 1,587
million therms to commercial users. The domestic load includes gas for

cookers, space heaters, water heaters and refrigerators, but an increasingly
large part of domestic demand is for gas for central heating. In 1977, 6,590
million therms were sold to domestic users, 6-4 per cent more than in 1976.
In 1977-78 the turnover of the British Gas Corporation and its subsidiary
companies amounted to ^2,568 million, of which sales of gas accounted for
£2,218 million. After interest payments there was a profit of £180-3 million.
Capital investment amounted to £201 million. The borrowing limit for the
Corporation has been fixed by the Gas Act 1972 at £2,500 million, to be
raised by order if necessary up to £2,700 million.
The British Gas Corporation conducts research at four research stations into
all aspects of gas supply and use. Research is also done on behalf of the Cor¬
poration at a number of universities and colleges. The Corporation’s total
expenditure on research and development and on technical service and testing
amounted to £23 million in 1977-78. The Corporation is undertaking various
coal gasification projects at its Westfield Development Centre in Fife in
collaboration with groups of North American sponsors.
Coalmining in Britain can be traced back to the thirteenth century. It played a
crucial part in the industrial revolution of the early nineteenth century and
in its peak year, 1913, the industry produced 287 million tons of coal, ex¬
ported 94 million tons and employed over a million workers. In 1947 the coal
mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal Industry Nationali¬
sation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board (NCB) as a statutory
corporation to manage the industry.
The NCB has, with minor exceptions, exclusive rights over the extraction of
coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to license private operators to work
small mines and opencast sites. Under the Coal Industry Act 1977 the NCB
has been given powers to work other minerals, where discoveries are made in
the course of searching for, or working, coal; and to engage in certain petro¬
chemical activities beneficial to the future of the coal industry; and wider
powers to undertake overseas activities, subject to the consent of the Secretary
of State for Energy. It has no monopoly in coal distribution and retail sales
remain largely in private hands, although it makes bulk sales to large industrial
consumers. Two holding companies, wholly owned by the NCB, run most of
its non-mining activities. NCB (Ancillaries) Ltd’s responsibilities include
certain retail fuel distribution operations, computer services and engineering.
NCB (Coal Products) Ltd is responsible for solid smokeless fuel manufacture
and chemical and by-products plants.
At the end of March 1978 there were 231 NCB collieries in operation
grouped into 12 areas, each controlled by a director responsible to the NCB.
The main coal-bearing areas are shown on the map on p 253 and the main
trends in the coal industry are shown in Table 15.
Coal accounted for 90 per cent of primary energy consumption in 1950, but
growing competition from oil and gas and the elimination of steam trains on
the railways contributed to the fall in demand from the mid-1950s. In
internal consumption of coal was 119-7 million tons, of which 65 per
cent went to power stations, 14 per cent to coke ovens, 9 per cent to domestic
users, 7 per cent to industry and 5 per cent to other inland markets.
Exports of coal in 1977-78 were t-8 million tons, almost all of which went
to Western European countries, while imports amounted to 2-6 million tons.

In 1977-78 output of 119 million tons comprised 104-6 million tons from the
NCB’s deep mines, 13-3 million tons from opencast mines and i-i million tons
from licensed mines and other sources. Productivity in the NCB’s deep mines
doubled between 1947 and 1972-73, but thereafter began to decline. However,
the upward trend was resumed in 1977-78 following the introduction of a
productivity incentive scheme, and output per manshift at the coalface for the
year averaged a record 155-7 cwt (7'9 tonnes).
Advances in mining technology are concentrated on the introduction of
computerised automatic monitoring and remote control of machines, together
with the installation of heavy-duty equipment capable of sustained high
performance with minimum maintenance.

In 1977-78 the NCB’s income was £2,904 million including sales of coal of
£2,334 million and grants under the Coal Industry Acts of £75 million. The
trading profit was £108-7 million; after interest payments and other items
there was a net surplus of £20-4 million. Government assistance to the industry
took the form of grants towards the social costs of mine closures, contributions
towards the mineworkers’ pension scheme, aid towards the cost of stocking
coal and coke, and assistance to promote the sale of coal for electricity genera¬
tion in south Scotland and south Wales. The NCB’s borrowing limit is £1,800
million, with provision for further increases up to £2,600 million, subject to
parliamentary approval.
Capital expenditure on collieries amounted to £334 million in 1977-78. In
1974 the Government, the NCB and the coalmining trade unions carried out a
tripartite study of the policy towards the coal industry. As a result the Govern¬
ment accepted the Board’s Plan for Coal as a general strategy for the follow¬
ing ten years, involving maintenance of deep-mined capacity at the annual
level of around 120 million tons and an increase in opencast production
to 15 million tons a year. The total cost of the plan is £3,710 million at March
J977 prices including £1,770 million on major projects up to the late 1980s
which will generate new deep-mined capacity of 42 million tons a year to
replace that lost by exhaustion of old collieries. Since 1974 the NCB has
approved over 125 major projects designed to provide about three-quarters
of this new capacity at an estimated cost of about £1,000 million including
some £500 million for a mining complex at Selby (North Yorkshire) which
254

should be producing 10 million tons of coal a year in the late 1980s. Over 30
projects have been completed and new coal mines have been opened at
Royston (South Yorkshire) and at Betws (Dyfed).
Although many good seams of coal have now been worked out due to the
early development of the industry, total coal reserves in Britain are estimated
at 190,000 million tons, of which about 45,000 million tons (sufficient for at
least 300 years at present rates of consumption) are recoverable using existing
mining technology. The NCB’s national exploration programme is proving
fresh reserves of economically workable coal at the rate of 500 million tons a
year, four times the annual consumption of coal. Major new finds have been
located in the North-east Leicestershire coalfield (with recoverable reserves
of over 500 million tons), Park (Staffordshire), west of Coventry, under the
Firth of Forth off Musselburgh (Lothian), at Margam (West Glamorgan),
and in north Oxfordshire.
The NCB has two main research organisations: the Coal Research Establish¬
ment, at Stoke Orchard (Gloucestershire), concerned with the combustion
and utilisation of coal; and the Mining Research and Development Establish¬
ment at Stanhope Bretby (Staffordshire), for research on mining methods and
equipment, including underground transport and coal preparation.
In 1977-78 the NCB spent ^27 million on research. Following the report in
May 1978 of a tripartite group on coal technology, comprising representatives
of the Government, the NCB and mining trade unions, the Government is to
provide financial support of up to two-thirds of the cost for three new research
and development projects designed to convert coal to liquid fuels (including
petrol), to produce chemical feedstocks from coal, and, in a project which will
be undertaken by the British Gas Corporation, to produce substitute natural
gas from coal.
Agreements to exchange technical information have been signed by the
NCB with several countries. Britain is responsible through an NCB sub¬
sidiary—NCB (IEA Services) Ltd—for managing a programme of inter¬
national coal research projects on behalf of the International Energy Agency.
A programme of five collaborative coal research projects, including a £17
million project to develop pressurised fluidised bed combustion (a method of
steam-raising for power generation, which, compared with conventional
techniques, uses low-quality coals efficiently and in an environmentally clean
way), is being based in Britain.
The first public supply of electricity in Britain was in 1881, at Godaiming
(Surrey). A measure of public control has always been a feature of the industry
and in 1948 all municipal and private undertakings in Great Britain were
acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British Electricity
Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where they
became the responsibility of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board
(NSHEB), which had been set up in 1943. Two subsequent Acts (1954 and
1957) effected a measure of decentralisation and gave the industry its present
structure. Electricity supply employs about 183,000 people, including 6,600
in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), which is responsible for the operation
and maintenance of power stations and the main transmission system (national
grid), and it is distributed by 12 separate area electricity boards. Co-ordination

is effected by the Electricity Council, the central body of the supply industry
with a general responsibility for promoting electricity supply and for advising
the Secretary of State for Energy; it is also responsible for a number of
common services, principally capital financing, research and industrial
relations. The Council consists of a chairman and two deputy chairmen, the
chairman and two designated members of the CEGB, the chairmen of the
area electricity boards and not more than three other members. Under the
Government’s proposals for the reorganisation of the industry in England and
Wales, the Electricity Council and boards would be replaced by a new central
body with responsibility for the industry as a whole.
In Scotland two boards, the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB), generate, distribute and sell electricity. The boundary separat¬
ing their areas runs from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on
the Firth of Tay (see map, p 255). Each board has a chairman and between
four and eight members, one of whom is the chairman of the other board.
In Northern Ireland generation, transmission and distribution are carried
out by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service which came into operation
in 1973 as the result of the amalgamation of four former electricity under¬
takings. Power stations are located in Belfast, Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh,
and a new station is under construction in Kilroot.
In 1977-78 the income of the electricity supply industry in England and
Wales was £4,779 million and its profit after interest payments was £133
million. In Scotland the income of the SSEB and the NSHEB was £408
million and £146 million respectively and their profits were £5-6 million and
£i-8 million. In 1976-77 the Northern Ireland Electricity Service’s income
totalled £133 million and it made a net loss of £19-8 million. Annual capital
investment amounts to £671 million in England and Wales, £106 million in
Scotland and £66 million in Northern Ireland. The statutory limit to borrow¬
ings by the industry in England and Wales is £6,500 million, in Northern
Ireland £650 million and in Scotland £1,500 million, with provision for a
further increase up to £1,950 million.
Generation for the public supply in Britain reached a record 262,045 gigawatt
hours (GWh)1 in 1977, 2-8 per cent more than in 1976. Conventional steam
power stations provided 84 per cent of the total, nuclear stations 14 per cent
and gas turbine, hydro-electric and diesel plant 2 per cent. Public supply
power stations in Britain consumed 114 million tonnes of coal equivalent in
1977 of which coal accounted for 70 per cent and oil 16 per cent. The output
capacity of the 229 generating stations of the electricity boards in Britain at the
end of 1977 totalled 67,276 megawatts (MW) including 1,908 MW in Northern
Ireland. An analysis of electricity generation by and output capacity of the
public supply system in Great Britain is given in Table 16.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small
—21,157 GWh in 1977. The major sources outside the fuel industries are the
chemical, engineering, paper, and iron and steel industries and the nuclear
power plants of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)
and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL). In 1977 these nuclear plants supplied
3,096 GWh of electricity to the public supply system.
Average thermal efficiency (the ratio of the electrical energy output to
the heat energy input of the fuel consumed) of conventional steam stations

Advances have been made in the design of steam-generating plant with the
introduction of 500 MW and 660 MW single-shaft generating units. Some 46
units of 500 MW have been installed in 13 stations and 11 units of 660 MW
have also been installed. Station capacities have increased and there are 11
stations each with a capacity of 2,000 MW including Kingsnorth (Kent),
Europe’s largest mixed-fuel station burning either coal or oil, while Britain’s
largest power station is at Longannet (Fife), a 2,400 MW station with four
cross-compound units. About 15,000 MW of plant are under construction in 12
power stations including a 3,300 MW oil-fired station at Grain (Kent), which
will be the largest in Europe, a 2,000 MW coal-fired extension to the Drax
station (North Yorkshire), a 1,320 MW station at Peterhead (Grampian),
which will be able to burn natural gas as well as oil, and three nuclear power
stations (see p 258).
Large gas turbine units of 55 to 70 MW, based on aero jet engines, have
been introduced since 1965 for peak load operation, while others of 17 to 35
MW capacity are being used in new stations to safeguard auxiliary supplies to
the large new steam units and also to provide capacity for peak operation.
Two 51 MW prototype units at Leicester are powered by industrial gas
turbines. Britain’s first new power station since 1959 designed to sell waste
heat from electricity generation to neighbouring firms is to be built at
Hereford. It will be a 15 MW station with diesel generators and thermal
efficiency is expected to be around 76 per cent.
Britain has been implementing a substantial nuclear power programme since
the mid-1950s, the primary purpose being to produce an additional energy
source for the generation of electricity. In 1956 the world’s first large-scale
nuclear power station, at Calder Hall (Cumbria), began to supply electricity
to the national grid.

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are 11 nuclear power stations in operation controlled by the electricity
authorities, while a further five stations are controlled by the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority (see p 377) or British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. The
UKAEA has three experimental or prototype stations which feed electricity
into the national grid: the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) at Windscale,
Cumbria (32 MW); the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor at Winfrith,
Dorset (100 MW); and the Prototype Fast Reactor (PER) at Dounreay, High¬
land (250 MW). BNFL operates the two original Magnox stations, both of
198 MW, at Calder Hall and Chapelcross (Dumfries and Galloway).
Under the first commercial programme, nine Magnox stations with a total
design capacity of 4,800 MW were commissioned between 1962 and 1971.
They range in size from Berkeley (Gloucestershire) with a design capacity of
276 MW to the most recent, Wylfa (Gwynedd), which has a design capacity of
1,180 MW. Two 1,320 MW AGR stations at Hinkley Point B (Somerset) and
Hunterston B (Strathclyde) began operating in 1976 and the three other
stations being built under this second programme (Dungeness B, Kent, 1,200
MW; Hartlepool, Cleveland, 1,320 MW; and Heysham, Lancashire, 1,320
MW) should be commissioned by about 1981. Commercial nuclear power
stations, which have lower operating costs than conventional stations, generated
36,420 GWh in 1977, about 14 per cent of public supply electricity production
in Britain. As a result of a government review of future policy on thermal
reactors, two further AGRs are to be built, at Heysham and Torness (Lothian),
and the Government has endorsed the electricity industry’s intention to
develop the option of proceeding with a pressurised water reactor system in
the early 1980s. The Government is considering its policy on fast reactor
development including whether or not to proceed with a full-scale demonstra¬
tion fast reactor, which would use as fuel a mixture of plutonium and uranium
dioxides in stainless steel cans and be capable of releasing some 60 times as
much energy from uranium feedstock as present nuclear power stations. Any
decision to proceed would be subject to a wide-ranging public inquiry.
BNFL provides nuclear fuel services covering the design and development of
plant, procurement and processing of uranium, uranium enrichment, fuel
element fabrication, transport and reprocessing of spent fuel, and the manu¬
facture of specialised components and preparation of radioactive materials.
All of BNFL’s shares are held by the UKAEA. BNFL is organised into three
divisions covering uranium enrichment, based at Capenhurst (Cheshire),
where a ^50 million plant using the gas centrifuge process was opened in
September 1977; fuel manufacture at Springfields (Lancashire); and repro¬
cessing at Windscale (Cumbria) where uranium, plutonium and radioactive
wastes are separated from irradiated fuel. It is engaged on a ten-year invest¬
ment programme, costing about £ 1,500 million. This includes the refurbishing
of facilities for storing and reprocessing spent fuel from Magnox power
stations, the manufacture of centrifuge enrichment plant, a new thermal
oxide reprocessing plant (THORP) at Windscale which will deal with spent
fuel from Britain’s AGRs and will also reprocess spent fuel for a number of
overseas electricity authorities, and a demonstration plant for vitrifying
radioactive waste (see p 171).
Hydro-electric generation is confined almost entirely to Scotland and Wales.
Most of the water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with
their own natural catchment areas. In 1977-78, 2,880 GWh were sent out by
the NSHEB from 54 main and 25 small conventional hydro-electric stations

with a total installed capacity of 1,052 MW; the largest station, Sloy, has a
capacity of 130 MW. The NSHEB also operates pumped-storage schemes at
Cruachan, Strathclyde (400 MW), and Foyers, Highland (300 MW). (In
pumped-storage schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to
pump water to high-level reservoirs from which it descends to drive turbines,
rapidly providing a large supply of electricity at peak periods or to meet
sudden increases in demand.) Work is in progress on the construction of a
pumped-storage station at Dinorwic (Gwynedd), which will be the largest of
its type in the world when completed in 1983 and will have an average
generated output of 1,681 MW.
The British system is the largest fully interconnected power network under
unified control in the western world. By 31st March 1978 the main transmission
lines of the CEGB totalled 13,958 circuit kilometres, of which 11,555 circuit
kilometres were at 400,000 volts and the remainder at 275,000 volts. Primary
distribution in England and Wales is at 132,000 volts, secondary distribution
at 33,000 volts, tertiary at 11,000 volts or below and general low voltage
distribution at 240 volts single phase. In Scotland there were 8,406 circuit
kilometres of main transmission lines at the end of March 1978, of which 340
kilometres operated at 400,000 volts, 3,025 circuit kilometres at 275,000 volts
and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Primary distribution in Scotland is at
33,000 volts. The national grid in England and Wales is divided into seven
grid control areas and the operations are co-ordinated by a National Control in
London. The grid in Scotland is operated from the control centres at Pitlochry
(NSHEB) and at Kirkintilloch (SSEB).
Twin cross-Channel cables between Lydd and Boulogne are capable of
transmitting up to 160 MW; by this means advantage is taken of the differences
between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads. The CEGB and
Electricite de France are negotiating on proposals for a 2,000 MW cable link
between the two countries.
Sales of electricity in 1977 amounted to 225,655 GWh. Industry took 39 per
cent of the total, domestic users 38 per cent and commercial and other users
23 per cent. About one-fifth of domestic sales is for space heating, one-quarter
for water heating and one-tenth for cooking. Electricity is used in industry
almost entirely for motive power, melting, heating and lighting.
The electricity industry supplies 22*6 million consumers of whom 20
million are in England and Wales; of the remainder i-6 million are supplied by
the SSEB, 520,000 by the NSHEB and 512,000 by the Northern Ireland
Electricity Service.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State for
Energy, is responsible for drawing up a general programme of research
comprising direct research carried out by the Council and electricity boards
supported by co-operative research with selected industrial research associa¬
tions and by research contracts placed with universities and other organisa¬
tions. Collaboration on research between the supply industry and the plant
manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power Engineering Research Steering
Committee. The research establishments run by the CEGB comprise the
Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead (Surrey), the
Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories in Gloucestershire and the Marchwood
Engineering Laboratories on Southampton Water. Research on distribution
technology and electricity utilisation is undertaken at the Electricity Council
Research Centre at Capenhurst (Cheshire) and by the area boards.

RENEWABLE
SOURCES OF
ENERGY
Exploration
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
on their own and in co-operation with other electricity authorities.
Research is proceeding on alternative sources of energy (sea-wave, wind and
tidal power for electricity generation, and solar and geothermal energy for
low-grade heat for domestic and industrial uses). Little contribution to
Britain’s energy supply is expected before the year 2000, although the con¬
tribution could begin to become more significant in the first quarter of the
twenty-first century. In principle, the most promising long-term alternative
sources are wave power (because of Britain’s long coastline and favourable
geographical position) and solar heat.
Research on wave power is concerned with examining the feasibility of the
large-scale extraction of power from waves. Four main devices are being
evaluated, while work is under way on problems common to all the devices,
such as that of bringing power ashore. The programme aims to produce a full-
scale prototype for testing at sea by the mid-1980s, and work on two devices
has progressed to trials on models at 1:10 scale. In 1977 a four-year govern¬
ment-funded programme of research and development on solar energy was
inaugurated to identify its potential contribution and to stimulate the develop¬
ment of cost-effective solar technologies, particularly on water and space heat¬
ing in houses (the areas of greatest potential return).
Research on geothermal energy involves collection of data in the areas
considered to have the most suitable conditions and identification of the
markets for the relatively low-grade heat produced. The Department of
Energy and an industrial consortium are working on a project to establish the
technical and economic potential for generating electricity from wind power.
Work includes a detailed design study for a large aerogenerator and an
examination of suitable sites in Scotland with favourable wind conditions.
Studies have been made of a project for harnessing the tides in the Severn
Estuary, one of the world’s most suitable sites for tidal power, and the Govern¬
ment has set up an independent Severn Barrage Committee to assist in
reaching a decision on whether to proceed with such a project.
NON-FUEL MINERALS
Although much of Britain’s requirements of industrial raw materials is met
by imports, non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make an important con¬
tribution to the economy. Output of non-fuel minerals in 1976 totalled 330
million tonnes, valued at £750 million. The total number of employees in the
industry was 42,500 in 1976. The geographical locations of some of the more
important minerals produced in Britain are shown on the maps on p 261.
The exploration for and exploitation of indigenous mineral resources to meet
the requirements of British industry are being encouraged by the Government
to minimise dependence on imports. Under the Mineral Exploration and
Investment Grants Act 1972 there is provision for financial assistance of up
to 35 per cent of the cost of searching for mineral deposits in Great Britain
and on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf, and evaluating them for com¬
mercial purposes. Minerals included in the scheme are the ores of non-ferrous
metals, fluorspar, barium minerals and potash. By the end of March 1978,
45 companies had sought assistance totalling £2-6 million in respect of 156
exploration projects, mainly for non-ferrous metals. Work on 107 projects
had been completed.

The Institute of Geological Sciences is carrying out on behalf of the Depart¬
ment of Industry a programme aimed at identifying areas with the potential
for economic extraction of minerals. It also has an annual programme for the
Department of the Environment to assess resources of sand and gravel, and
limestone.
In 1976 the production of metal from non-ferrous ores totalled 16,600 tonnes,
valued at £29 million. Tin was first worked in Cornwall over 2,000 years
ago. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Britain was a leading world
producer of copper, lead and tin, but subsequently overseas competition led
to the closure of many mines and falling production. In 1976 output of tin-in-
ore was 4,000 tonnes, supplying 30 per cent of Britain’s tin requirements.
Small amounts of copper, zinc, tungsten and silver are produced in association
with the tin. Production of lead-in-ore, mainly from northern England, was
7,100 tonnes in 1976. Production of iron ore (4-6 million tonnes in 1976)
has fallen substantially in recent years.
Britain is a major world producer of several important industrial minerals
including china clay, ball clay, fuller’s earth, salt, fluorspar and gypsum, and
also produces significant amounts of limestone, dolomite, chalk, industrial
sands and fireclay, mostly for consumption in Britain. China clay is used
mainly as a filler and coater for fine-quality paper, for making high-quality
pottery and also in the paint, rubber, plastics, insecticide and fertiliser
industries. Most of the output of china clay and about half the output of
ball clay are exported. Fuller’s earth is used in refining, as a bonding agent in
foundry moulding sands, for oil-well drilling muds and in civil engineering.
Fireclay is used for ceramic ware and refractory products.
Britain is virtually self-sufficient in salt, output in 1976 being 8 million
tonnes valued at £33 million. In 1976 production of fluorspar for the chemical
and metallurgical industries was 217,000 tonnes valued at £9 million and of
gypsum for the construction industry was 3’3 million tonnes worth £11
million. Potash, used mainly for fertiliser manufacture, is being produced by a
new mine at Boulby (Cleveland) and another mine is planned at Egton Low
Moor (North Yorkshire).
In 1976 production of limestone and dolomite totalled 89 million tonnes,
valued at million, of which about 14 per cent was used in the iron and
steel, chemicals and other manufacturing industries excluding construction.
Chalk production in 1976 amounted to 16 million tonnes worth £15 million,
of which some 2 million tonnes were used in agriculture and industry.
Industrial sands are used primarily in the glassmaking and foundry industries;
output in 1976 was 6 million tonnes.
Britain also produces small amounts of barytes, talc, diatomite, calcspar,
chert and flint, celestite and anhydrite.
Production of sand, gravel and crushed rock as aggregates for use in construc¬
tion constituted over half of Britain’s output of non-fuel minerals in 1976.
Sand and gravel, used for concrete, is the most important of these minerals and
the largest user of land. Of the total output of 118 million tonnes of common
sand and gravel in 1976, worth £210 million, 15-9 million tonnes were marine-
dredged and Britain is the world’s largest producer of marine-dredged aggre¬
gates. Production of limestone and dolomite for aggregates was 61 million
tonnes in 1976. Output of sandstone in 1976 was 14 million tonnes valued at
£42 million and of igneous rock 37 million tonnes valued at ^ 115 million. Small

amounts of limestone, sandstone, igneous rock and slate are used as building
stone and architectural facing material.
Production of limestone, chalk and clay as raw materials for cement
manufacture was 10 million, 13 million and 3 million tonnes respectively in
1976. Some 17 million tonnes of clay and shale were produced for the manu¬
facture of bricks, pipes and tiles.
WATER
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, normally
sufficient for domestic and industrial requirements. Supplies are obtained
partly from surface sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in
upland gathering grounds and river intakes (one-third comes from rivers), and
partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits and boreholes. In
i975_76 the driest period of weather since records began to be kept in 1727 led
the Government to pass the Drought Act 1976, which enabled water authorities
in England and Wales to limit or prohibit the use of water and, if necessary, to
restrict domestic water supplies. Subsequent very heavy rainfall replenished
surface and underground sources by the spring of 1977, but the Act has been
retained as providing important reserve powers. Water consumption in
Britain continues to increase and in 1976 amounted to about 17-2 million
cubic metres a day (mcmd), comprising 16-6 mcmd of potable (drinkable)
v/ater and o-6 mcmd of non-potable water. Average daily consumption per
head amounts to around 309 litres.
In general, householders pay for their domestic water supply, sewerage and
sewage disposal services through charges based on the rateable value of their
property, whereas industrial users are charged for their water supply according
to actual metered consumption.
Water services in England and Wales are being consolidated and developed
within a reorganised national industry. Responsibility for promoting a national
policy for water in England and Wales rests with the Secretaries of State for
the Environment and for Wales and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food who, under the Water Act 1973, are charged with responsibility for
securing the conservation, augmentation, distribution and proper use of
water resources and the provision of water supplies; the provision of sewerage
and sewage disposal services; the restoration and maintenance of the whole¬
someness of rivers and other inland waters; the use of inland waters for
navigation and recreation; the provision of land drainage; and the protection
and development of fisheries.
The National Water Council advises and assists ministers and water
authorities. It consists of a chairman appointed by the Secretaries of State, the
chairmen of the water authorities, and ten other members with special
relevant knowledge, of whom eight are appointed by the Secretaries of State
and two by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
Nine regional water authorities in England and the Welsh Water Authority in
Wales are responsible for the management of water services; the develop¬
ment of water resources; water distribution and supply; the prevention of
pollution (see p 168); sewerage and sewage treatment; river management,
land drainage; sea defences; recreation; and freshwater fisheries. The board of
each water authority consists of a chairman and several members appointed by
264 BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Secretary of State for the Environment (or, in the case of the Welsh
Authority, by the Secretary of State for Wales), a few members appointed by
the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a small majority, usually
of only one, of members appointed by the county and district councils within
the area of the authority. District councils usually also act as agents of water
authorities for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of public
sewers in their areas.
Statutory Water The Water Act 1973 provides for 29 existing statutory water companies to
Companies continue to supply water. In 1976 they accounted for 19 per cent of total
supplies. Special arrangements govern the relationship of statutory water
companies to the water authorities.
Central Water The Central Water Planning Unit, part of the Department of the Environ-
Planning Unit ment, provides a common service to the Government, the National Water
Council and the v/ater authorities. Its principal functions are to keep under
review national and strategic aspects of water services planning and operation.
Water Data Unit The principal functions of the Water Data Unit, also part of the Department
of the Environment, are to advise on information required for water manage¬
ment purposes, to ensure common standards and methods of data collection
and to publish such data on a national basis.
Supplies Some 13,429 million cubic metres of water were abstracted in England and
Wales in 1976. Public water supplies, reaching over 99 per cent of the popula¬
tion, accounted for 5,451 million cubic metres. The Central Electricity
Generating Board took 4,743 million cubic metres, primarily for cooling in
connection with electricity generation, other industry 3,121 million cubic
metres and the remainder was used in agriculture. Water authorities’ revenue
totalled ,£1,141 million in 1977-78. Capital expenditure in 1977-78 on water
supply, sewerage and sewage disposal is estimated at £470 million.
The provision of piped supplies for rural areas has been assisted by grants
under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1971. By March
1978 schemes costing some ,£129 million had been completed or were in
progress with the aid of grants under these Acts totalling £36 million.
Nezv Proposals The Government has announced its intention of strengthening the industry
at the centre by introducing legislation to establish a National Water Authority
(NWA) which will replace the National Water Council, and incorporate
the Water Research Centre, the Central Water Planning Unit and part of the
Water Data Unit. One of the NWA’s main tasks will be to prepare a national
water strategy which will form the framework for the plans, investment pro¬
grammes and operations of the industry.
Scotland In Scotland responsibility for public water supply, sewerage and sewage
disposal rests with the nine regional and three islands councils. Additionally
the Central Scotland Water Development Board, established under the
Water (Scotland) Act 1967, is primarily responsible for developing large
water sources and supplying water in bulk to its six constituent member
authorities, the regional councils in Central Scotland.
Scotland has a relative abundance of unpolluted water from upland sources.
Over 98 per cent of the population has a public water supply. About 820
million cubic metres of water were abstracted in Scotland in 1976 for public
water supplies. Capital expenditure in 1977-78 on water supply, sewerage and
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Northern

sewage disposal is estimated at £52 million. The Secretary of State for
Scotland is responsible for the promotion of the conservation of water
resources and of the provision by water authorities of adequate water supplies,
and also has a duty to promote the cleanliness of rivers and other inland waters
and the tidal waters of Scotland. The Scottish River Purification Advisory
Committee advises the Secretary of State on matters relating to the cleanliness
of rivers in Scotland.
Northern Ireland has abundant potential supplies of water for both domestic
and industrial consumption. Over yo per cent of the population has a piped
supply. The Government is responsible for water supply and sewerage
services, and these are provided by the Northern Ireland Department of the
Environment. Capital expenditure during 1977 amounted to around ^23
million.
The largest source for water supply is Lough Neagh and in order to
conserve the potential and to co-ordinate the various interests and demands
on this water resource system a comprehensive water management programme
has been prepared.
The central research organisation for the water industry in Britain is the
\\ ater Research Centre at Henley-on-Thames (Oxfordshire). The Centre’s
laboratory at Stevenage (Hertfordshire) is concerned with water pollution
including sewage and industrial waste water treatment, sludge treatment and
disposal, flow measurement, estuarine pollution and the development of
analytical methods and quality monitoring systems. Its laboratory at Med-
menham (Buckinghamshii'e) deals with water resources, water treatment,
health aspects of water quality, distribution and operational research.
I he Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of the Environment
at Wallingford (Oxfordshire) predicts the performance of hydraulic civil
engineering works and their effects on the environment. Its work covers
background research and specific investigations into the flow of water over
weirs and spillways, the performance of flood prevention and sea defence
works, silting in rivers and estuaries, and harbour and offshore structure
design.
The Institute of Hydrology of the Natural Environment Research Council
at Wallingford studies the whole hydrological cycle, and the Meteorological
Office (see p 383) is concerned with rainfall.
AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for nearly half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its most
important industries. It occupies 661,000 people or 27 per cent of the total
civilian working population, provides about 2-5 per cent of the gross domestic
product, and uses 19 million of the 24 million hectares (47 million of the 60
million acres) of land. Exports in the agricultural sector (including machinery
and fertilisers) in 1977 amounted to nearly £3,400 million.
The soils of the country are varied (see p 4). Land used for farming is con¬
ventionally divided into land suitable for cultivation (crops and grass) and
rough grazing. In hill country the area of cultivated land is often small, but is
usually supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
There are 12 million hectares (30 million acres) under crops and grass.
Cultivated land, rough grazing, woodland and other land on agricultural
holdings together represent 78 per cent of the land area. The rest is mountain
and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The area available for farming
is gradually decreasing to meet the needs of housing and industry; so far, the
loss has been offset by the increase in productivity on the land being farmed.
There are about 261,000 farming units in Britain. Some 50 per cent are very
small units, mostly farmed part-time, and accounting for less than 10 per cent
of the industry’s total output. Of the 127,000 full-time farm businesses some
29,000 are classified (by standard man-days) as large farm businesses (capable
of employing four or more men full-time); these, accounting for less than 10
per cent of the number of holdings, produce about half of the industry’s total
output. There are about 45,000 medium-sized (two-three men) and some
53,000 small full-time farm businesses.
Amalgamation of small farms into larger, more viable units has been
encouraged by successive governments. The average size of full-time holdings
is about 113 hectares (279 acres) of crops and grass and rough grazings.
Some 32,000 of the total of significant farming units are in Northern Ireland;
their average size is 25 hectares (62 acres). Over half of these units provide a
full-time occupation for the owner. Other holdings, of which there are about
21,000, are either extremely small or let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops
or grazing).
In Great Britain more than half of the farms, and in Northern Ireland
almost all farms, are owner-occupied.
The increasing use of intensive methods of production both in crops and in
animal husbandry has led to greater specialisation. Three-fifths of the full¬
time farms in Britain are devoted mainly to dairying or beef cattle and sheep;
one in six is a cropping farm and the remainder specialise in pigs, poultry or

horticulture, or are mixed farms. The farms devoted primarily to arable crops
are found mainly in the eastern parts of England and Scotland. Large-scale
potato and vegetable production is characteristic of the Fens (south Lincoln¬
shire and Cambridgeshire), the alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and
Humber and the peaty lands in south Lancashire. Early potatoes are an impor¬
tant crop in Dyfed and south-west England. Elsewhere, horticultural crops
are widely dispersed amongst agricultural crops.
Dairying occurs widely, but there are concentrations in south-west Scot¬
land, the western parts of England and south-west Wales, where the wetter
climate encourages the growth of good grass. Sheep and cattle are reared in the
hill and moorland areas of Scotland, Wales and northern and south-western
England. Beef fattening takes place partly in better grassland areas and partly
in yards on arable farms.
In Northern Ireland dairying is the main occupation on 41 per cent of the
full-time farms, while a further 37 per cent concentrate on beef and sheep
production. The remainder are either specialised cropping and horticultural
holdings, intensive pig and poultry units, or mixed farms with no predominant
single enterprise.
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with 519,000
tractors in 1977 or one to every 13 hectares (33 acres) of arable land. Power-
take-off implements now characterise arable farming; and some 58,000
combine harvesters were in use in 1977. A wide variety of machines for
harvesting and preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are
installed on all except the smallest farms.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply and
accompanying equipment. Through machinery syndicates farmers have the
use of expensive equipment whose capital cost is shared among members.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out by
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering.
The increase in production which has occurred over the past decades is a
result of the effort of individual farmers, of farmers’ organisations, of research
workers and advisers and of government action. The role of the Government
is described on pp 273-7. Some production is carried out on a co-operative
basis (see p 273).
The steady expansion in production and in yield per hectare of arable land
which has taken place since 1936 despite falling manpower is summarised in
Table 17 which also shows the effect of the drought during 1975-76. Total
cattle stocks reached a record of 15-2 million in 1974 but fell to 13-9 million
in 1977. Over the past decade there has been a substantial growth in the
number of beef cattle and poultry and a less marked increase in the number of
dairy cattle, sheep and pigs. Arable production has shown a greater diversi¬
fication since the second world war. Total cereals production reached about
17 million tonnes in 1977. Potato production is susceptible to weather con¬
ditions but, on average, adequate supplies are maintained from a steadily
declining area. Increases in output of meat and milk have been associated with
higher consumption of feedingstuffs, mostly from home resources. In 1977
some 5"5 million tonnes of concentrated feeds were imported; the level of
imports depends, however, on the size of the home crop of cereals.
The index of agricultural net product (1975 =: 100), which stood at 103 in
1967, is estimated to have risen to 112 in 1977. The lower levels in 1975 (the
base year) and 1976 (89) were the result of unfavourable weather.

Wheat is grown mainly in the eastern half of England. About 5-3 million
tonnes were harvested in 1977, with average yields estimated at 4*90 tonnes
per hectare (1*95 tons per acre). About one-half of the wheat crop is normally
used for flour milling, the remainder going mainly for animal feed.
Since i960 the area under barley has increased by about 75 per cent. In

recent years, between 15 and 23 per cent of the crop has been used for malting
and distilling; most of the remainder is used as feed for livestock.
The universal use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also often
used on a co-operative basis.
The total area of fodder crops has fallen since i960 because in many cases
farmers can provide winter feed more economically by increased grass produc¬
tion and improved methods of conservation. The principal fodder crops are
turnips, swedes and kale in England, and turnips and swedes in Scotland.
Their principal use is to supplement conserved grass (mainly hay and silage)
for winter feeding.
Beet is grown under contract to the British Sugar Corporation Ltd. (the sole
British processor) which also provides technical advice and assistance. The
corporation contracts annually for the area from which it will buy beet; the
contracted area has risen over the past few years to about 209,000 hectares
(517,000 acres) in 1978. At normal yields this should produce about one
million tonnes of sugar—about 42 per cent of total British consumption. (The
balance is largely supplied, under the Lome Convention (see p 358), by
developing countries which export raw cane sugar.)
First supplies of early potatoes normally come at the end of May, and the
lifting of maincrop varieties usually starts in September. Seed potato production
for Britain and for export is chiefly centred in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The total area planted with potatoes in 1977 was 232,000 hectares (575,000
acres) and the average yield per hectare was 28-5 tonnes. Although potato
production is becoming increasingly mechanised, much hand labour is still
needed.
Hops, which are grown for the brewing industry, occupy only about 6,000
hectares (14,000 acres) but have a very high yield per hectare and value by
weight.
The British climate suits grassland farming. Grassland is important in the
economy of most farms. Grassland production has been enhanced over recent
years by the development and application of new techniques, notably the
increased use of fertilisers, new methods of grazing control, improved herbage
conservation for winter feed and irrigation. Rough grazings are used for
extensively grazed flocks and herds, producing young animals for fattening
elsewhere.
A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. Substantial sales of animals and semen are made to
overseas buyers seeking to replenish and improve their herds and flocks. In
recent years farmers have introduced a number of breeds from the continent
of Europe.
Artificial insemination plays an important part in cattle breeding, about
60 per cent of the dairy herd in England, Scotland and Wales being bred in
this way.
In England, Scotland and Wales more milk goes for liquid consumption
than for manufacture, but in Northern Ireland the greater part of the milk is
used for manufactured products. Average consumption of liquid milk per
head in 1977 was 2-71 litres (about 4-7 pints) a week.

Average yields per dairy cow have increased during the last decade by about
23 per cent and were some 4,450 litres (979 gallons) in 1977. Freedom from
tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and a campaign to eradicate brucellosis
is well advanced. Milk production has been stimulated by advances in grass¬
land management, new methods of grass conservation and controlled concen¬
trate feed programmes.
The average size of dairy herds has also been increasing over the years and
in 1977 was some 44 cows a herd, the largest in the European Community.
Although there are several breeds of beef cattle, about two-thirds of home-fed
beef production derives from the dairy herds, some females being mated to beef
sires. Large numbers of store cattle are moved for fattening from hill and
upland areas to lowland pastures, on which cattle imported from the Irish
Republic are also fattened.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep production, and more than 40 breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in the country. Research has provided
vaccine and sera protection against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
Draft ewes and lambs are brought every autumn from the hill areas, where
winters are usually severe, to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages:
first, to farms at intermediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a
larger and more rapidly maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on
to the milder lowland conditions, where they become crossed again with Down
rams for fat lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness, and the
lowland sires fecundity and early maturity. Store and fat lamb production
provides the main source of income for sheep farmers but wool is also of
considerable importance, especially to farmers in hill areas.
Pig production is carried on in most parts of Britain but is particularly
important in the eastern and southern counties of England and in Northern
Ireland. There is an increasing concentration into specialist units and larger
herds. Artificial insemination is available nationally.
About 30 per cent of the pigmeat is used for bacon and 70 per cent for pork
and manufacturing into sausages and other processed forms.
The British poultry industry has expanded rapidly in recent years, aided by
the application of improved husbandry and management techniques in
intensive production units and by genetic improvements in stock. Some
80 per cent of the laying birds on farms are in flocks of 5,000 or more, while
about 75 per cent of the broilers are in flocks of 50,000 or more. The average
yield of eggs per bird is about 240 a year. Nearly all eggs and poultry meat
consumed in Britain are home-produced.
The horticultural industry produces a wide variety of fruit, vegetables and
flower crops which are worth about 10 per cent of the total value of agricultural
output; in 1977 their value was estimated at £704 million.
At the June 1977 census the land on which these crops were grown amounted
to nearly 300,000 hectares (740,000 acres), about 2-5 per cent of the land used
for crops and grass. Fruit accounted for about 65,000 hectares (161,000 acres),
vegetables, excluding potatoes, for about 221,000 hectares (547,000 acres)
and flowers, bulbs and nursery stock for about 13,000 hectares (32,000
acres). Crops under glass, plastic and in sheds, including mushrooms,
occupied about 2,000 hectares (5,000 acres).
Horticultural crops are largely grown on specialised holdings, but some,

particularly vegetables for processing, are produced on arable farms. Most
horticultural enterprises are increasing output per unit area with the help of
improved planting material, new techniques of cultivation and environmental
control, and the widespread use of machinery.
Field vegetables, with approximately 74 per cent of the horticultural output
and about 221,000 hectares (547,000 acres) in area (excluding potatoes), are
the most important horticultural sector. They are widely spread over the
country, with the most intensive concentrations in the Thames Valley and
Hereford and Worcester and extensive production in the eastern counties.
Some 38 per cent are destined for processing.
Of the land used for fruit growing in 1977, 16,000 hectares (39,000 acres) were
devoted to soft fruit and the remainder was under orchards. The area of
apple orchards (excluding cider apples) is some 31,000 hectares (76,000 acres).
Dessert apples are the most important fruit crop. England and Northern
Ireland are among the few countries which grow varieties of apples especially
suitable for cooking. There are about 4,000 hectares (11,000 acres) in the
western Midlands and the south-west of England devoted to cider apple
production.
Although pears thrive best in the warmer continental climate, some high-
quality varieties are produced in the east and south-east of England, where
the conditions are most suitable. Cherries and plums are grown in Kent, and
plums also in the Vale of Evesham and parts of East Anglia. Around Perth in
Scotland is the largest concentration of raspberry plantations in the world.
Strawberries are the most widely grown soft fruit, accounting for some 6,000
hectares (16,000 acres), with early production in the south and west of
England. Blackcurrants are also widely grown in Britain, mainly for the
preparation of juice for the manufacture of soft drinks and flavours for
confectionery. Other fruits include gooseberries, red and white currants,
loganberries and blackberries.
Much of the glasshouse sector of the horticultural industry has been re¬
equipped since the mid-1960s with the aid of grants. Widespread use is now
being made of units with automatic control of heating and ventilation, and
semi-automatic control of watering coupled with carbon-dioxide enrichment
of the atmosphere. Tomatoes form the most important glasshouse crop, and,
together with lettuce and cucumbers, represent some 95 per cent of the total
value of glasshouse vegetable output. The area under sweet peppers and celery
has increased significantly. Mushrooms, whose farmgate value is estimated at
over £35 million for 1977, are grown in specially constructed sheds in most
parts of Britain, with concentrations in the eastern and northern counties of
England.
Bulbs occupied some 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) and hardy nursery stock
some 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) in June 1977; flowers in the open took
about 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres).
Britain now produces just over half of its total food requirements or about
two-thirds of those supplies that can be produced in temperate climates.

MARKETING
AND
CO-OPERATION
Agricultural products are marketed in many ways: mainly through private
trade channels, through producers’ co-operatives or through marketing
schemes. Marketing schemes are established under the Agricultural Marketing
Act 1958 or under similar Northern Ireland legislation; they are essentially
producers’ organisations with certain statutory powers to regulate the market¬
ing of particular products. There are ten schemes, each of which must be
approved by Parliament, and also in Great Britain by a majority of producers
of the regulated product. Each scheme is administered by a board, the majority
of whose members are elected from among registered producers; a small
minority of independent members are appointed by agricultural ministers
(see pp 273-4). Various safeguards exist to protect the public interest
generally, including the interests of individual producers and consumers.
Marketing boards fall into two categories: first, those which are sole buyers
of the regulated product from all producers not specially exempted, or those
which control all contracts between producers and first buyers; and, secondly,
boards which maintain only a broad control over marketing conditions, leaving
producers free otherwise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for hops,
milk and wool, and the Northern Ireland pigs and seed potato boards fall into
the first category, and the Potato Marketing Board into the second.
For certain other commodities there are broadly based organisations
representing producer, distributor and independent interests.
The Home-Grown Cereals Authority was set up to improve the marketing
of home-grown cereals. It provides a market intelligence service, and promotes
research and development. It also acts as agent for the Intervention Board
for Agricultural Produce (see p 274) in respect of the support buying, storage
and disposal of cereals and oilseed rape.
The Meat and Livestock Commission’s wide range of functions covers the
promotion and improvement of many activities concerning livestock and live¬
stock products in Great Britain, extending from breeding to retail distribu¬
tion ; the Commission illso acts as agents for the agricultural departments and
the Intervention Board in administering price support schemes. In Northern
Ireland, the Livestock Marketing Commission promotes better organisation,
development and marketing in the livestock and livestock products’ industry.
The Eggs Authority has the general duty of improving the marketing of eggs.
It provides market intelligence, carries out promotional work and undertakes
research and development projects.

THE ROLE
OF THE
GOVERNMENT
Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community (see
p 274) a wide range of horticultural produce is subject to common quality
standards which, with certain minor exceptions, apply at all stages of distribu¬
tion. The Community standards apply to all produce entering Britain and to
British produce sold on the domestic market. Community regulations prescribe
grades consisting of a range of up to four classes, and specify requirements
concerning colour, size, packaging, presentation and labelling. All fruit and
vegetables subject to the standards, and exported from or imported into the
Community, must meet the requirements of at least Class II.
Agricultural co-operatives are concerned with supply of farmers’ requirements,
with marketing, production, and services. There are, in addition, pest control
societies and machinery syndicates.
The Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation
promotes and develops co-operation in agriculture and horticulture, and
administers a scheme of grants. The Agricultural and Horticultural Co-opera¬
tion Scheme 1971 provides grants (including capital grants) for co-operative
production and marketing of agricultural and horticultural produce.
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agri¬
cultural producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments.
The aggregate net income of farmers in 1977 is estimated at £1,348 million
(excluding stock appreciation). Of the total farm output, estimated at £6,473
million in 1977, nearly two-thirds is in the form of livestock and livestock
products.
Feedingstuffs amount to approximately one-third of agriculture’s total cost,
and wages and machinery (including depreciation) to about one-fifth each.
In recent years agricultural workers’ earnings have risen considerably in real
terms, but this has been offset by the manpower economies made possible by
increasing mechanisation and larger farms. Labour productivity rose by nearly
4 per cent a year between 1967 and 1977.
It is estimated that £258 million was added to the value of buildings and
works and £614 million was invested in new plant, machinery and vehicles in
1977. Most of the capital for investment is generated from within the farm
business; however, outside capital is also important, with bank advances
providing the main source of short- and medium-term credit. Agricultural
merchants are also an important source of short-term credit. Mortgage loans
form the chief source of long-term credit and are provided by specialised
financial institutions (see pp 275-6) and private sources.
In 1976-77 the average net income for farms of different types in England
and Wales was generally within the range of £50 to £140 per hectare (£20 to
£57 per acre) with the exception of pig and poultry farms and horticultural
holdings, which are more intensive in their use of land. Net income per hectare
on dairy and arable farms has nearly always been higher than on stock-rearing
farms, which are generally larger in area than the other types and are situated
on poorer land.
In England the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (see p 42)
operates through functional divisions. Its relations with individual farmers are
conducted mainly through its local offices, grouped in regions, with Chief
Regional Officers.

Annual Review
Common
Agricultural
Policy
Responsibility for agricultural and fisheries functions in Wales was trans¬
ferred from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Secretary
of State for Wales on 1 April 1978 and is discharged through the Agriculture
Department of the Welsh Office.
The Advisory Council for Agriculture and Horticulture in England and
Wales provides the agricultural ministers (Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food and Secretary of State for Wales) and their departments with
independent advice on any agricultural or horticultural subjects remitted
to it.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The
Secretary of State for Scotland also appoints the members of the Crofters
Commission (see p 276) and the Red Deer Commission, which deals with the
conservation and control of red deer.
The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy. It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for which it acts as agent in the administra¬
tion in Northern Ireland of British agricultural schemes.
Within the machinery of the Economic Development Committees (see
p 207) there is a committee for agriculture, comprising representatives of
farmers, workers and landowners, as well as official and independent members.
Since February 1973 Britain has applied the European Community system
of agricultural support under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) (see
below). Market arrangements under the CAP are administered by the Inter¬
vention Board for Agricultural Produce which is responsible to the agricultural
ministers.
Each year, in accordance with the requirements of the 1947 Agriculture Act,
the agricultural ministers review the economic condition and prospects of the
agricultural industry in consultation with representatives of producers. The
conclusions drawn from the review contribute, together with views expressed
on behalf of agricultural workers, landowners, consumers and the food industry,
to the formulation of government agricultural policy.
The prices of most agricultural commodities produced in Britain are supported
through the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community
(CAP). (For products supported by Britain’s national price guarantees, see
p 275.) Under the CAP, producers’ returns for most of the main commodities
are supported by a combination of charges on imports from outside the
Community and internal support prices which, for some of the more important
products, are maintained by intervention buying when necessary. In addition,
export refunds enable Community exporters to sell on world markets when
world prices are below Community price levels. There is also provision for
certain direct payments to producers, including beef premiums. The Com¬
munity’s support price levels have been operating fully in Britain since the
beginning of 1978, following a five-year transitional period. These prices, and
levels of aid, are converted into the currencies of the member states by means
of fixed representative or ‘green’ rates (for Britain the ‘green pound’) in order
to avoid fluctuations as market exchange rates change. Monetary compensa¬
tory amounts, based on the percentage difference between the representative
and market rates of each currency, are applied to prevent distortions in trade.
They operate as import subsidies and export levies for countries whose
currencies’ market rates are below the representative rates, and as import
levies and export subsidies in the opposite case.

Credit
The level of support prices under the CAP is reviewed by the Community
each year, and the results of the British Annual Review (see p 274) help to
shape the Government’s approach to the negotiations on CAP support.
Some of the grants paid to farmers under the schemes mentioned below
also come within the scope of the CAP.
In the light of the British Annual Review, agricultural ministers determine
guaranteed prices for the coming year for potatoes, fat sheep, and wool.
Guaranteed prices for other commodities have been terminated in accordance
with the Treaty of Accession (see p 72).
Sheep producers receive guarantee payments if the average market prices
fall below the guaranteed levels. For wool the Government operates the
guarantee through the British .Wool Marketing Board (see p 272), to which
a fixed price is guaranteed for every kilogram of fleece wool it buys from
producers.
For potatoes ministers fix each year a target area designed to achieve self-
sufficiency. In Great Britain the Potato Marketing Board ensures, as far as
possible, that this area is planted, and may with government agreement under¬
take support buying of any surplus, re-selling as much as possible for stock-
feed. In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture undertakes any
support measures. Most of the cost is met by the Government.
In addition to market support under the CAP and the British guaranteed
prices, producers also receive support through certain capital and production
grants. These include grants to help producers with the costs of capital
investment under the Farm Capital Grant Scheme and the Horticulture
Capital Grant Scheme. Grant aid is also available to producers undertaking
development plans under the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme.
There is also a Payments to Outgoers Scheme designed to assist in the im¬
provement of farm structure and a Milk Non-Marketing and Conversion
Scheme under which grants are available to farmers who cease production of
milk for sale, with advantageous rates if they also convert to beef or sheep
production. Special financial assistance, involving headage payments on
breeding cows and ewes, and higher rates of capital grant, is also available
under Community arrangements for farmers in less favoured (hill) areas.
Community assistance may also be made available for improvements to
facilities for the marketing and processing of agricultural products.
Estimated 1977-78 expenditure in Britain on price guarantees, grants and
subsidies is about £204 million, of which about £27 million is expected to be
reimbursed from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund
(FEOGA). Expenditure in Britain under CAP market regulation in 1977-78
is estimated at about £204 million, of which some ^146 million is likely to be
reimbursed from FEOGA.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agricultural
land and buildings is available on the security of a first mortgage from the
Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd., a company which enjoys a measure of
government financial backing but raises its funds on the London capital
market. The Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd. fulfils a
similar role in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Department of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds.

In any part of Britain, where a farmer, grower or co-operative requires a
bank loan for business purposes but cannot provide sufficient collateral, the
Agricultural Credit Corporation Ltd. may be able to provide the bank with a
guarantee. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has power to
make grants to the Corporation where the guarantees have to be fulfilled; and
in some circumstances the minister can also meet the guarantee charges
normally paid to the Corporation by the borrower.
In England and Wales scientific, technological and management advice and
services are available through the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) which operates mainly from the regional and divisional
offices of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and of the Welsh
Office. The Service also helps to identify problems requiring investigation and
research, to suggest priorities for such work, and, where appropriate, to
contribute to possible solutions. ADAS provides free, impartial advice to
landowners, farmers and growers, but charges are made for certain services.
In Scotland the agricultural advisory service is provided by the three
regional independent colleges of agriculture which are financed almost
entirely by public funds.
Advisory work in Northern Ireland is under the direction of the Chief
Agricultural Officer of the Department of Agriculture, and Advisory Centres
are located in the main provincial towns. The resources of the agricultural
colleges, the research centres and the specialist divisions of the Department are
available to the advisory service.
Local authorities provide about 8,500 smallholdings in England and about
1,000 in Wales. In England about 800 lettable holdings are provided by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The minister and local authorities
may make loans of up to 75 per cent of required working capital to their
smallholding tenants.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which owns and maintains about 169,000 hectares (418,000
acres) of land settlement estates, comprising some 2,850 crofts and holdings.
Within the crofting areas of Scotland (situated in Strathclyde, Highland,
Western Isles, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands) much of the land is held
by crofters, that is, tenants whose holdings are generally either rented at a
cost of not more than £100 a year or have an area not exceeding 30 hectares
(75 acres).
The Crofters Commission is responsible for the administration and regula¬
tion of crofting. It also acts as the Secretary of State for Scotland’s agent in
administering grants to crofters for cropping and land improvement.
A code of landlord-tenant relationships has been written into legislation in
order to protect the respective interests of landlords and tenants and to
eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and obligations.
Legislation in Great Britain provides for any tenancy of agricultural land,
with the exception of certain short-term lettings, to continue in force from
year to year until terminated by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions
the tenant can contest it by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then
becomes inoperative unless the landlord obtains consent to its operation from
an independent body (in England and Wales the Agricultural Land Tribunal
and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court).
There is a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled on termination

of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and tenant and
may be varied by agreement or, failing agreement, by arbitration.
There are provisions for succession of a close relative on the death of a
tenant farmer.
The Agricultural Branch of the Health and Safety Executive (see p 327) is
responsible for the enforcement of regulations relating to the health and
safety of workers in agriculture. These regulations cover such matters as the
guarding of field and stationary machinery, farm safety, the fitting of safety
cabs to tractors, and the use of agricultural chemicals. The executive’s Agri¬
culture Industry Advisory Committee assists it in resolving problems of health
and safety in agriculture, including horticulture and forestry.
Ten regional water authorities are responsible for land drainage (including
flood protection) in England and Wales. In Scotland local authorities deal
with the coast protection and flood prevention, while arterial drainage of
agricultural land is the owners’ responsibility.
Most of the funds needed by the water authorities are obtained from local
authorities, but the Government pays grants toward the cost of improvement
schemes, varying from 10 per cent to 80 per cent according to the financial
position of the authority, with an additional premium for sea defence works.
Within the water authority areas, in low-lying areas where there are special
local problems of land drainage, there are 282 internal drainage districts
administered by internal drainage boards which carry out work for the special
benefit and protection of their districts. The boards finance their work from
drainage rates levied on owners and occupiers. They also receive a government
grant at a flat rate of 50 per cent for improvement schemes.
Local authorities in England and Wales also have general land drainage
powers and may receive government grants of between 20 per cent and 50 per
cent of the cost of improvement work. In Scotland 60 per cent grants (70 per
cent if for the benefit of less favoured (hill) areas) are available to owners or
occupiers of agricultural land who carry out arterial drainage work.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture is the drainage authority
for watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or minor water¬
courses, and also has responsibility for urban drainage.
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
practising veterinary surgeon. Control of animal disease in Great Britain in
accordance with the Government’s policy is the responsibility of the Agri¬
cultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS). The ADAS Veterinary
Service also deals with the welfare of farm livestock.
The work of the Veterinary Service is backed by extensive laboratory
facilities. In addition, in England and Wales 24 investigation centres perform
work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on disease problems to
private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is provided by the investiga¬
tion centres of the three Scottish agricultural colleges.
Great Britain has been free from many serious animal diseases for a number
of years. Strict veterinary controls are exercised on the import of all animals,
meat and meat products, live poultry and other captive birds and poultry meat
so as to prevent the introduction of animal or poultry diseases into Great
Britain. Sheep scab, eradicated in 1952, reappeared in 1973, and rigorous
measures are being taken to eradicate it again. Enzootic bovine leucosis was
found for the first time in 1978; a survey is being carried out to furnish a

basis for long-term policy; meanwhile, legislation provides for the slaughter
of affected animals and the payment of compensation to owners. The campaign
to eradicate swine fever was successfully completed in 1966 and, although three
cases of the disease occurred in 1971, the infection was quickly eliminated. An
epidemic of a previously unknown swine vesicular disease began in December
1972 and has been combated by a stringent slaughter policy; the last outbreak
occurred in June 1977. Foot-and-mouth disease was eradicated after the
1967-68 outbreak. In i960 the whole of Britain became a bovine tuberculosis
attested area. The incidence of the disease is now very low; cattle (except for
certain categories) are tested at regular intervals and reactors to the test are
slaughtered; compensation is paid to the owners. Voluntary schemes for the
eradication of brucellosis have been in operation since 1967; compulsory
eradication on an area basis began in 1972. By March 1978, 80 per cent of all
herds in Great Britain were declared free of the disease. Newcastle disease
(fowl pest) has declined to a low level due to the operation of a vaccination
policy.
Non-farm animals are subject to import licence and six months’ quarantine
as a precaution against the introduction of rabies, and there are severe
penalties for those breaking the law. There have been only two cases of rabies
in animals outside quarantine in Great Britain since 1922 and both were in
imported animals.
In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are organised similarly to those
in Great Britain but are administered separately by the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland. Animal health control policies and the
geographical situation have kept the country free from rabies and nearly all
the major epizootic diseases, including swine vesicular disease. A Brucellosis
Eradication Scheme has been successfully carried out and in December 1971
Northern Ireland was declared brucellosis-free. The full-time veterinary
service is supplemented by the central veterinary laboratory.
The plant health services, operated by the agricultural departments, are
responsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones from
abroad. They also issue the health certificates required by other countries to
accompany plant material imported from Britain. Certification schemes are
operated to encourage the development of healthy, vigorous and true-to-
type planting stocks. The Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertford¬
shire, and the Agricultural Scientific Services Station, East Craigs, Edinburgh,
provide scientific and technical advice on which statutory controls and
certification schemes are based.
The Pest Infestation Control Laboratory at Slough, Berkshire, undertakes
research and provides advice on harmful mammals and birds and on insects,
mites and moulds associated with grain and other stored food products. The
Laboratory is responsible for regional pest officers who advise farmers, local
authorities and others on control techniques. In Scotland the Agricultural
Scientific Services of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have a
similar function and maintain close liaison with the Laboratory.
Safeguards against the dangers which could arise from uncontrolled use of
pesticides have been devised and are operating successfully. Products must be
cleared for safety under the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme (see p 168),
and may be submitted through the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme
for efficacy approval.

The Medicines Act 1968 provides through a system of licensing for the
control of the manufacture, sale and supply of veterinary medicinal products
(including those used in animal feedingstuffs). The licensing authority (the
agricultural ministers) is advised by the Medicines Commission, the Veterinary
Products Committee, whose functions are to advise on the safety, quality and
efficacy of veterinary medicinal products, and by other expert committees. (For
other provisions of the Act, see p 120.)
An outline of the organisation of agricultural research and development in
Britain, including that carried out by the Agricultural Research Council and
the universities, is given on p 372. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food carries out research and development at its own laboratories and on the
22 experimental husbandry farms and horticulture stations operated by ADAS,
and commissions work from the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural
Environment Research Council and outside research organisations. In Scotland
the three colleges which provide the advisory services (see p 276) also undertake
development and experimental work. In England and Wales, research in
agricultural economics is undertaken by 12 university departments of
agricultural economics. At the University of Reading, the Centre for Agri¬
cultural Strategy provides an assessment of British agriculture with a view
to developing long-term strategies.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has four economic divisions
and two statistics divisions. In Scotland, agricultural economists are on the
staff of three agricultural colleges and the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture has nine research
divisions.
Fifteen British universities provide degree and postgraduate courses in
agriculture or agricultural sciences. The National College of Agricultural
Engineering at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, offers degree and postgraduate courses.
Sandwich courses leading to a Higher National Diploma are available at eight
agricultural colleges in England and Wales and there are nearly 50 local
authority and other agricultural colleges providing full-time courses on
different aspects of agriculture, horticulture, forestry and farm management.
A centre for European agricultural studies is based at London University’s
Wye College at Ashford.
In Scotland the three agricultural colleges which have the advisory and
development functions are also teaching establishments. They mainly provide
sandwich courses leading to Higher and Ordinary National Diplomas, post¬
diploma courses and certain short courses. In Northern Ireland degree courses
in agriculture and food science are provided at Queen’s University, Belfast.
Courses below this level are provided at three residential colleges run by the
Department of Agriculture.
Local education authorities throughout Britain provide full-time and part-
time courses for farmers, farm workers and horticulturists, as well as an advisory
service for domestic producers.
In Great Britain the Agricultural Training Board provides a training
advisory service, organises training courses and pays training grants. In
Northern Ireland training courses are organised by the Department of
Agriculture.
FISHERIES
The industry catches demersal fish (caught on or near the bottom of the sea),
28o

pelagic fish (caught nearer the surface) and shellfish. The major element of
the catch (about 54 per cent by weight) is demersal fish; the catches of
pelagic fish comprise over 37 per cent and the shellfish about 9 per cent of the
total catch. The principal demersal fish (in terms of value) are cod, haddock
and plaice. The most important pelagic species are herring and mackerel.
Shellfish include Crustacea (such as lobsters and crabs) and molluscs (such as
mussels and oysters).
From the beginning of 1977, Britain’s fishery limits have been extended to
200 miles (or, where the distance between two countries’ coasts is less than
400 miles, up to the median line, that is, half-way between the two countries’
base lines). This followed the European Community member states’ agree¬
ment to adopt such limits jointly, after similar extensions, with resulting
restrictions on Community vessels, had been announced by many maritime
nations.
Community countries and non-Community countries having temporary
agreements with the Community have the right to fish up to 12 miles off the
British coast. Access to waters within 12 miles is restricted; no foreign vessels
are permitted within 6 miles and only certain authorised countries (Norway
and Community countries) may fish in specified regions within 6 to 12 miles.
With the extension of fishery limits to 200 miles, it is necessary to revise the
Community fisheries’ internal regime to allow for controlled Community
fishing in the greatly extended area. Britain has a particularly strong interest
in such control, since about 60 per cent of the total catch within the new limit
is taken in British waters, while the loss of fishing opportunities in distant
waters (such as Iceland) has reduced the British industry’s total catch more
than that of other Community states. As a result, the British fishing industry
is looking for a substantial share of the quotas proposed for the fish stocks
around Britain’s coasts.
There is also a need for effective and enforceable conservation measures
within the waters of member states. The Government is continuing to work
towards a common fisheries policy which meets these needs. In the absence
of an agreed Community policy, the Government has introduced a number
of conservation measures, some of which implemented Community decisions
often taken as a result of a British initiative. Other essential elements of a
comprehensive revised internal regime are rules which set common standards
of enforcement and give member states the responsibility for operating them
in their own waters, and a common structural policy (see p 281).
The Community has negotiated exchanges of fishing rights within member
states’ limits for reciprocal rights within the waters of several non-member
countries; for 1978, reciprocal quotas have been negotiated with Norway and
the Faroe Islands, which are the countries of greatest interest to British fisher¬
men, and also with Sweden. Quotas have also been granted to the Community
by Canada and the United States. Framework agreements, intended to
establish the general lines of fishery relations between the Community and
each of the other countries, have been reached with the Faroes, Sweden and
the United States, and the text of an agreement with Norway has been worked
out. British fishermen have been excluded from the traditionally important
grounds off Iceland, and reciprocal fishing with the Soviet Union and the
rights of certain other East European states to fish in member states’ waters
have been terminated.

From February 1973 those provisions of the common fisheries policy which
are based on the establishment of a common organisation of the market and
a common structural policy have applied in Britain. The common organisa¬
tion of the market aims at assisting in the adaptation of supplies to marketing
requirements, while ensuring, as far as possible, a reasonable return to pro¬
ducers, by means of the establishment of a common grading and price system,
and common rules on competition. Provision is also made for the protection
of the Community market against disruption by imports from non-member
countries. The responsibility for market organisation is placed largely in the
hands of the industry itself through producers’ organisations'. In 1977, fol¬
lowing transitional arrangements similar to those applying to industrial
products (see p 72), tariffs on intra-Community fish trade were abolished,
and the common external tariff became applicable. The common structural
policy aims at promoting the harmonious and balanced development of the
fishing industry and the rational exploitation of resources. It includes common
measures for the financing of the improvement of the structure of the fishing
industry and the provision of an equitable standard of living for those
engaged in it.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, North Shields, Lowestoft, Plymouth, Brixham, Newlyn and Milford
Haven. In Scotland the chief ports are Aberdeen, Peterhead, Fraserburgh,
Lerwick, Ullapool, Mallaig, Ayr and Stornoway. In Northern Ireland the
main fishing ports are Kilkeel, Portavogie and Ardglass.
In the British fishing industry in 1977 there were about 16,350 fishermen
in regular employment and some 5,500 occasionally employed; about 48 per
cent of the former and 28 per cent of the latter were based on Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 540 regular fishermen and about 285 part-
time. It is estimated that for every fisherman there are between three and five
jobs in associated trades.
Fishing is an important source of employment and income in certain areas of
Britain, in many of which unemployment is well above the national average.
Maintenance of fishing opportunities, through conservation of stocks and
through the preservation or restoration of British fishermen’s access to their
traditional distant grounds, is thus vital to Britain.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling and seining on the sea bed
and, in midwater, by trawling and purse-seining. Bottom trawling is carried
out in the distant and near waters for all species of demersal fish. Seining is
also used for catching demersal fish all the year round, mainly in the North
Sea, the Minches, the Firth of Clyde and the Irish Sea. Lines and set nets are
also used to catch demersal fish. Midwater trawls and purse-seines are used to
catch pelagic fish, especially herring, mackerel and sprats.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessel and
methods of capture. They yield all sorts of fish, and shellfish are important;
there are extensive fisheries for crabs, lobsters, shrimps, mussels, escallops,
cockles and oysters, and off Scotland and north-east England and in the Irish
Sea there are valuable catches of Nephrops (Norway lobsters or Dublin Bay
prawns).
At the end of 1977, the deep-sea fleet comprised some 329 vessels; of these,
distant-water trawlers, which operate mainly from Hull and Grimsby,
282

numbered 97. They are 140 feet (427 metres) and over in length and are of two
types, the older, traditional side trawlers, which can only preserve their catches
on ice, and modern stern freezer/factory trawlers (38 in number). Traditionally
all have fished in the north-east Arctic and still do within the constraints of
quota agreements which have reduced activity. Some side trawlers have been
diverted to North Sea grounds hitherto fished by middle-water trawlers.
Stern trawlers also fish the north-east Arctic but have recently been successful
in local mackerel fishing. Middle-water trawlers between no and 140 feet in
length (33‘5-427 metres) have also had to diversify their activity into northern
North Sea grounds consequent upon reduced quota allocations off the Faroes.
The inshore group consists of some 2,024 vessels of over 40 feet (12-2 metres)
and about 4,600 smaller vessels.
In 1977 landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels totalled 916,000 tonnes (496,000 tonnes of demersal fish,
342,000 tonnes of pelagic and 78,000 tonnes of shellfish), valued at £252
million. Cod accounted for 34 per cent of the total value of demersal and
pelagic fish landed by British vessels; haddock (21 per cent) and plaice (7 per
cent) were the other most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Increasing attention is being paid to the culture of fish and shellfish, and
the farming of some species of sea fish is being developed.
Imports of all fresh, frozen and cured fish and shellfish totalled 202,000
tonnes valued at £210 million. Imports of canned and preserved fish and shell¬
fish amounted to 82,000 tonnes valued at nearly ^114 million. Imports of fish
meal amounted to 214,000 tonnes, worth £60 million, and those of fish oils to
185,000 tonnes worth nearly ^51 million. Exports and re-exports of fish and
fish products amounted to 156,000 tonnes and were valued at nearly ^92
million.
Total fish consumption was running at a level of approximately 17-6 lb
(8 kg) a head in 1977. Home production provided about 88 per cent of supplies.
The growth of quick-frozen fish production radically altered the structure of
the processing industry. With the increase in quick-freezing, export outlets
for white fish account for about 75 per cent of the total exports of fish and
fish preparations. Experiments are being carried out in the catching and
processing, for human consumption and fish meal, of previously under¬
exploited species of fish (for example, blue whiting and mackerel) of which
large stocks are known to exist in the sea adjacent to the British Isles.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal feed. Home production of fish meal in 1977 was about 78,000 tonnes.
Fish oil production was about 21,000 tonnes.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in a wide area around the British Isles outside the 12-mile
zone. Within the zone drift netting and certain other methods are prohibited
off the coast of Scotland but are permitted under licence off England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. In Scotland salmon fishing is a private right. In England
and Wales, water authority licences are required for coastal and estuary
netting. The landed value of the salmon catch in 1977 was approximately
£1,550,000 in England and Wales, about £3’^ million in Scotland, and some
£352,000 in Northern Ireland. Eels worth about £968,000 were caught in
Northern Ireland in 1977.

The principal method of distribution is through wholesalers, located at the
ports, who buy fish at the auctions and sell to inland wholesalers as well as
directly to retail outlets. Fish lorries, including insulated and refrigerated
vehicles, transport the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, although
rail transport is still used from some ports. The principal inland wholesale
distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate Market in London. The increasing
popularity of quick-frozen consumer packs has encouraged trawler-owning
companies to enter the marketing and distribution system.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry and for fisheries research are the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland, the Welsh Office Agriculture Department (see
p 274) and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The safety
and welfare of crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping
generally are provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts administered by
the Department of Trade.
The Herring Industry Board was set up to reorganise, develop and regulate
the herring industry. Its members are appointed jointly by the Minister of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Secretaries of State for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. The Board, whose activities are financed partly
by levies and licence fees and partly by government grants and loans, is
advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council, which represents all
sections of the industry and consumers.
The functions of the Board include the promotion of sales of herring and
the application of the benefit of technical progress to the industry. In England,
Scotland and Wales, the Board administers the government grant and loan
schemes which provide for assistance towards the purchase of new fishing
vessels and the improvement of existing vessels. Up to 31 December 1977
about ^7-5 million in loans and ^8-6 million in grants had been approved by
the Board.
The function of the White Fish Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate
the white fish industry, and that of its Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland is to advise the authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Membership is by ministerial
appointment. The White Fish Industry Advisory Council, which represents
the various interests of the fishing industry, advises the Authority about the
exercise and performance of its functions.
In England, Scotland and Wales the Authority administers government
grant and loan schemes for the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines
and the improvement of existing vessels. It also administers loans to pro¬
cessors, co-operatives, etc., for the acquisition, reconditioning or improvement
of facilities. Up to 31 March 1978 about £53 million in loans and £64 million
in grants had been approved. Its other activities are financed by levies on
first-hand sales of most white fish, and a government grant towards research
and development. In 1973 the Herring Industry Board and White Fish
Authority formed a unified administration for the development of fisheries
administration under the European Community’s marketing and structural
policy (see p 281).
The Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland operates grant and

FORESTRY
The estimated total area of woodland in Britain is 2,056 million hectares
(5-084 million acres), or about 8-5 per cent of the total land area; 44 per cent of
the area is in England, 12 per cent in Scotland, 12 per cent in Wales and the
remainder in Northern Ireland.
The area of productive forest in Great Britain managed by the Forestry
Commission, at 0-841 million hectares (2-078 million acres), constitutes 50 per
cent of this category. The annual rate of productive forest expansion is
currently 23,100 hectares (57,080 acres) by the Commission mainly in Scot¬
land, and some 7,700 hectares (19,000 acres) by private woodland owners.
The Commission’s programme includes considerable planting in upland
areas, and consists mainly of conifers because of the difficult site conditions
encountered.
Total employment in state and private forests in Great Britain was estimated
at 21,150 in 1977.
Except for the period of the two world wars, when felling was abnormally
heavy, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s consumption of wood and wood products, as less than half
of the Commission’s woodlands are yet in production. Britain imports more
than 90 per cent of its needs, the total import cost of wood and wood products
including pulp and paper being £2,000 million in 1977.
The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority charged with
promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the
production and supply of timber in Great Britain. The Commissioners comply
with directions given by the forestry ministers, who are the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland has its own separate organisation (see p 285). In pursuing
its main objective, that is, timber production, Great Britain’s forestry policy
also takes into account amenity, environmental and employment criteria.
The Commission’s total estate covers some 1-250 million hectares (3-09o
million acres) of which 0-841 million hectares (2-078 million acres) are under
trees in 249 forests. All these forests are covered by management plans which
are concerned not only with planting and timber production but also with
facilities for public recreation, wildlife conservation and the landscaping of
plantations.
As more of its coniferous woods reach the production stage, the Commission
has assumed an increasingly important role as a timber seller and has
encouraged the setting up of some 20 major new timber-using industries since
the mid-1960s.
Production of timber from the Commission’s woodlands amounted to 1-85
million cubic metres in 1977-78. The timber is used in coal mines (for roof
props), in the pulp industry, in sawmills, and in factories producing chipboard,
fibreboard and wood wool.
The expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners is paid out of the Forestry
Fund, into which are paid amounts voted annually by Parliament, together
with the Commission’s receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other

sources. In the period ended 31 March 1978, expenditure amounted to about
£61 million, and receipts were approximately ^36 million.
Privately owned woods comprise 57 per cent of the total forest area in Great
Britain. About half of the private woodland area is in ownerships of under 80
hectares (198 acres) in extent.
The effective management of private woodlands is encouraged by the
provision of grants administered by the Forestry Commission in return for
which owners accept a continuing obligation to manage their woodlands in
accordance with sound forestry practice. Woodland owners are represented, in
their relations with the Forestry Commission, by the Forestry Committee of
Great Britain, which co-ordinates the work of the Timber Growers’ Organisa¬
tion (for owners in England and Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners’
Association.
The Home Grown Timber Advisory Committee advises the Forestry Com¬
mission on certain statutory functions, including promoting the interests of
forestry and the production and supply of timber. It includes representatives
of associations of woodland owners, timber merchants, processors, and other
major timber users and the trade unions.
The Forestry Commissioners also maintain National Committees for
England, Scotland and Wales, which act in an advisory capacity, particularly
on the social, recreational and amenity aspects of the Commissioners’ activities
and relationships with other land users. The Commissioners also maintain a
regional advisory committee for each conservancy and a consultative panel for
the New Forest.
Forestry education is the responsibility of the central government education
departments (see p 138). Degree courses in forestry and associated studies
are provided at four universities and there are supervisory, craft and mana¬
gerial level courses.
The Forestry Training Council, set up by the Forestry Commission, assists
the development of systematic training and the co-ordination of training in
the state and private sectors.
The Furniture and Timber Industry Training Board is concerned with
training for private-sector employees in the home timber trade.
Forestry research is carried out by the Forestry Commission, universities
and other institutions (see p 379).
The Department of Agriculture is the forest authority for Northern Ireland.
The Department may acquire land for afforestation and give financial and
technical assistance for private planting. It has introduced measures to control
felling, fires near plantations and damage by certain animals. Financial pro¬
vision is made annually by Parliament.
The state forest area has grown steadily since the end of the second world
war. By 1978, 67,700 hectares (167,300 acres) of plantable land had been
acquired of which 50,100 hectares (123,800 acres) were planted. There were
about 12,000 hectares (30,000) acres of privately owned forest.
Some 1,700 people worked in state and private forests in 1978, of these,
about 800 were employed under the Urban and Rural Improvement Campaign
for developing recreational facilities, mostly in state forests.
Communications
Government
Policy
The application of technological developments to Britain’s transport and
communications network is helping to make travel quicker and more con¬
venient. Major improvements in the movement of passengers and freight
within Britain or between Britain and other countries have resulted from the
construction of a network of motorways, the extension of fast inter-city rail
services (such as those operated by high speed trains), the modernisation of
many ports, the increased use of containers and other modern methods in
shipping, the use by airlines of larger or speedier aircraft (such as the Concorde
supersonic aircraft) and the expansion of facilities at many of Britain’s airports.
Transport and communications contribute 8 per cent of Britain’s gross
national product and are responsible for a rather higher proportion of the
nation’s gross domestic fixed capital formation. These activities employed
some i’4 million people in Great Britain in March 1978 and accounted for 6
per cent of the employed labour force. Of these, 396,000 employees were
engaged in road passenger transport and road haulage contracting, 207,000 in
railways, 405,000 in postal services and telecommunications, 147,000 in sea
transport, port and inland water transport, 82,000 in air transport and 153,000
in other transport services and storage.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain is carried mainly by road.
However, rail, coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, pipelines and inland
waterways are important in carrying certain types of freight, particularly bulk
goods. In 1976 about 67 per cent of freight, in terms of tonne-kilometres,
travelled by road, 16 per cent by rail, 14 per cent by coastal shipping, and
3 per cent by pipeline and inland waterway. Much of the inland transport
system of Great Britain is publicly owned, although road haulage and coastal
shipping are almost entirely in the hands of private enterprise.
In mid 1978 there were 17-7 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads
of Great Britain. Of these 14 million were motor cars, 1-7 million road goods
vehicles, 1*2 million motor cycles, scooters and mopeds and 112,000 public
road passenger vehicles (including taxis). Private ownership of cars has been
growing rapidly for many years and the car is now the most popular form of
travel within Great Britain.
The Government’s transport policy is directed towards helping economic
growth and higher national prosperity, and ensuring a reasonable level of
personal mobility, while improving safety, particularly on the roads, mini¬
mising damage to the environment and taking account of energy considerations.
In a major policy statement in June 1977, the Government announced that
higher priority would be given to maintaining public transport, with particular
help for rural areas, and that local government would be given more responsi¬
bility for planning and integrating local transport. It also announced a more

selective approach to roadbuilding, with emphasis on specific schemes instead
of a strategic network.
There are three main categories of road in Great Britain: trunk roads (including
most motorways) on which much of the long-distance traffic travels; classified
roads; and unclassified roads. Road mileage in Britain totalled 222,752 miles
(352,484 kilometres) in mid-1977 (see Table 19). Motorways and other major
roads are shown on the map at the end of the book.

c In addition, there were 59 miles (95 kilometres) of local authority motorway in use in
England and 9 miles (14 kilometres) in Scotland.
The Government’s programme of trunk road construction and improvement
in England concentrates on improving the main routes between the major
centres of population and industry, ports and airports, although there are also
some local schemes on the less important trunk roads. The general aim is to
enable journey times, accidents and vehicle operating costs to be reduced,
while many towns and villages also benefit by the removal of heavy through
traffic. Priority in the programme is being given to the orbital route around
London and to other schemes of industrial importance. In Wales the Govern¬
ment’s priorities are to complete the motorway across south Wales, reconstruct
the coast road in north Wales and improve roads which are important for
industrial redevelopment. The main objectives of the programme in Scotland
are to complete the remaining links in the motorway/dual carriageway network
in central Scotland and to continue improving roads which are important for
North Sea oil-related activities. Priority for new roads in urban areas of Great
Britain is being given to those designed to meet the needs of industry and
commerce, serve new industrial or housing estates, provide links to the
national trunk road network or to complement traffic management schemes.
Motor vehicle traffic in Great Britain rose in 1977 by i-8 per cent to a record
259,382 million vehicle-kilometres, of which cars and taxis accounted for
80 per cent.
and The suspension bridges across the Firth of Forth and the Severn Estuary,
completed in the mid-1960s, both incorporated major advances in suspension
bridge design. Their main spans are among the longest suspension bridge
spans, but the bridge being built across the river Humber and due to be opened
in 1979 have a span of 1,410 metres (4,626 feet), longer than any existing
bridge span in the world.

A few road tunnels have been built to cross major estuaries, notably the
Mersey, the Thames, the Tyne and the Clyde. A second crossing of the Thames
at Dartford (Kent) is being built and is due to be completed in April 1979.
In England the Secretary of State for Transport, in Scotland the Secretary of
State for Scotland, and in Wales the Secretary of State for Wales are responsible
for the administration of trunk motorways and other trunk roads, and the costs
of their construction, improvement and maintenance are paid for by central
Government. Work on major trunk road and motorway schemes in England
is controlled by regional road construction units which include staff from the
Department of Transport and county councils. The highway authority for
non-trunk roads in England and Wales is, in general, the county council in
whose area the roads lie, and in Scotland the regional or islands council.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment
is responsible for public roads and bears the cost of maintenance and
construction.
The road accident record in Great Britain is considerably better than that of
many other countries, even though it has one of the highest densities of road
traffic in the world; in 1977, 6,614 people were killed on the roads, about 81,700
seriously injured and 259,800 slightly injured.
Modern roads, designed for present-day traffic and segregating pedestrians
from vehicles, have been shown to produce a marked decrease in casualties.
There are two classes of national speed limit: a limit of 70 mph (113 km/h)
on motorways and other dual carriageway roads; and a limit of 60 mph
(97 km/h) on single carriageway roads. In built-up areas there is a general
limit of 30 mph (48 km/h). To meet local needs the urban limit can be raised
and the other limits lowered on specific stretches of road. Other measures
directed primarily towards road safety include pedestrian crossings and the
system of road markings and traffic signs. A computer-controlled signalling
system has been installed on most busy motorways to warn motorists of
advisory speed limits in certain conditions and of lane closures.
The design of vehicles, their use on the roads, and the maintenance of their
mechanical condition are controlled by regulations which are amended when
necessary in the interests of safety or for control of pollution and noise. On
1 August 1978 a ‘type approval’ scheme came into operation whereby the use
of cars manufactured after 1 October 1977 i® n°t permitted unless they are of
a type that has been certified as meeting the required standards. In Great
Britain private cars and light vans which are three or more years old must be
tested annually at private garages authorised as test stations. (In Northern
Ireland private cars seven or more years old are tested at official vehicle inspec¬
tion centres.) Heavy goods vehicles are tested annually at government test
stations. Public service vehicles must be specially approved before being
licensed to carry passengers, and are tested at regular intervals. Any vehicle
may be stopped on the road at any time by the police and examined.
Minimum ages for driving are: 16 for driving invalid carriages and mopeds;
17 for cars and other passenger vehicles with nine or fewer seats (including that
of the driver), motorcycles and goods vehicles not over 3*5 tonnes maximum
permissible weight; 18 for goods vehicles over 3-5 but not over 7'5 tonnes;
and 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine seats and goods vehicles over 7-5
tonnes. All drivers of motor vehicles, unless they have either held a full British
licence or passed the driving test in the last ten years, are required to pass the
test before being granted a full licence to drive. Until they pass the test they

; TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 289
must hold a ‘provisional’ licence, display ‘L’ (learner) plates on their vehicle
and be accompanied while driving (with certain exceptions) by a qualified
driver. In Northern Ireland a driver having passed the test is required to
display an ‘R’ (restricted) plate for a one-year period during which he must
not exceed 45 mph (72 km/h). There are schemes for special licensing and
testing of drivers of heavy goods vehicles and public service vehicles.
The Road Traffic Acts embody most of the law relating to road users. A
person convicted of any of the most serious offences is liable to be disqualified
from driving for a specified period. The standard of conduct for all road
users and a summary of the requirements of the law are set out in the Highway
Code. A failure to observe the code does not render a person liable to criminal
proceedings but may be taken into account in such proceedings. The Road
Safety Act 1967 strengthened existing measures to discourage drinking and
driving, and set a maximum permissible blood alcohol level of 80 milligrams
of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The Government intends to introduce
further measures to tighten the law on drinking and driving. Legislation will
also be drawn up requiring the wearing of seat belts where they are fitted in
the front seats of cars or vans. Riders of motor cycles, who are very vulnerable
in accidents, are required to wear safety helmets and are encouraged to wear
clothes that can be easily seen by other road users.
Campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads are con¬
ducted nationally by government departments and the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents and locally by local authorities. In recent years
major publicity campaigns have been undertaken to increase the wearing of
seat belts, to reduce casualties to child pedestrians and to riders of motor
cycles, and to reduce the incidence of drinking and driving.
Traffic in the centres of cities and towns in Britain is increasingly being
managed so as to minimise congestion and its environmental effects, and to
improve road safety. Local authorities have powers to introduce a range of
measures which, when combined, form comprehensive traffic management
schemes covering a particular area. Such schemes may include one-way
systems, streets reserved for pedestrians, bus priority measures, parking
controls and limited road construction.
Parking control is an important element of comprehensive traffic manage¬
ment. In most town centres parking is restricted and waiting limits apply.
Major city centres often have controlled parking zones, where payment is
required for on-street parking.
Several cities have new shopping precincts, some of them enclosed, which
are specially designed for pedestrians and from which motor vehicles are
excluded. In the centres of many towns, areas containing several streets have
been wholly or partly converted to pedestrian use, and this has resulted in a
more attractive environment.
Urban traffic control systems, which link traffic signals and some traffic
signs to a central computer, represent an important addition to local authori¬
ties’ ability to control traffic. They are confined to large towns and cities, but
they are being adapted and extended for use in smaller towns. The Department
of Transport is sponsoring two of the new systems at Torbay and Hull;
these are due to become operational in 1979.

by the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport,

developing and implementing the Government’s transport policy. It employs
nearly 1,000 people of whom about half are scientists and engineers.
Goods vehicle traffic reached a record 42,700 million vehicle-kilometres in
1977. Considerable growth is taking place in international road haulage traffic
and British hauliers are increasingly running goods vehicles to the rest of
Europe and as far afield as North and West Africa and the Middle East. Much
internal road haulage traffic is carried over short distances with about three-
fifths of the tonnage being carried on hauls of 25 miles (40 kilometres) or less.
A growing number of larger, more efficient and better designed road haulage
vehicles are being operated.
Road haulage is predominantly an industry of small businesses. Many of the
124,400 holders of an operator’s licence in September 1977 had only one
vehicle and the average size of a vehicle fleet is only about four. Most of the
industry is privately owned, but the biggest operator in Great Britain is
the publicly owned National Freight Corporation (NFC). Turnover of the
NFC’s freight transport subsidiaries amounted to £373 million in 1977 and
at the end of 1977 it had 40,100 employees and owned or leased 20,300
vehicles, 14,400 trailers and 12,200 containers and demountable bodies.
Public haulage (private road hauliers and the NFC carrying other firms’ goods)
accounts for 63 per cent of freight carried in Great Britain in terms of tonne-
kilometres. In Northern Ireland the biggest operator is Northern Ireland
Carriers Ltd, owned jointly by the Northern Ireland Transport Holding
Company and the NFC.
Those operating goods vehicles of over 3J tonnes gross weight (with certain
special exemptions) require an operator’s licence, obtained on showing good
repute and ability to maintain vehicles properly and control loading and hours
worked by drivers. Licences are divided into restricted licences for firms
carrying their own goods and standard licences, sub-divided into ‘national
only’ and ‘international’, for hauliers operating for hire or reward. Proof of
professional competence is required to obtain a standard licence. Over 1 mil¬
lion goods vehicles not exceeding 3! tonnes gross laden weight are exempt
from operators’ licensing. A wide-ranging review of the operators’ licensing
system is in progress.
Regulations control the emission of smoke and noise by lorries and the
carriage of dangerous goods by road. There are limits on the hours worked by
drivers of goods vehicles. International road haulage is governed mainly by
bilateral agreements, which are in force with 23 other European countries
and allow British road hauliers to carry goods to or through these countries.
Permits are required in some cases and with special exceptions these are
limited to a quota negotiated annually. Within the European Community
there is also a quota which authorises holders of a limited number of permits
to carry out hire and reward operations between any two member countries;
a similar arrangement exists between the 19 states (including Britain) which
are members of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport.
Bus and railway services in Britain are provided mainly by publicly owned
operators, coach and air services partly by publicly owned bodies, and taxis
and hire cars almost entirely by privately owned businesses. Buses and coaches
account for about 12 per cent of passenger mileage within Great Britain, rail
for 7 per cent and air 0-5 per cent.

In the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West
Midlands, Tyne and Wear, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, the
metropolitan county council, acting as the passenger transport authority
(PTA) is responsible for local transport policy as a whole, and appoints
a professional passenger transport executive (PTE) to be responsible for
day-to-day management and operations. In Scotland the Strathclyde Regional
Council is the PTA for Greater Glasgow although the passenger transport
area does not cover all of the region. The PTEs operate bus services in their
areas and are responsible for reaching agreements with other passenger trans¬
port operators in their areas, including the British Railways Board, concerning
the provision of such services as are considered necessary by the PTAs. In
London the bus and Underground rail services are operated by the London
Transport Executive which is responsible to the Greater London Council.
In the public sector in Great Britain 23,000 vehicles are operated by the
National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group, 11,000 by the
seven PTEs, 6,800 by the London Transport Executive and 6,000 by other
local authority undertakings. There are some 6,000 privately owned under¬
takings (of which the majority have fewer than five vehicles) comprising about
28,000 vehicles; only a small proportion of these operators are concerned with
scheduled bus services.
Improvements to bus services are being undertaken in many areas of Britain
to try to halt the substantial decline in their use due primarily to the growth
in ownership of private cars. These include express and/or limited-stop bus
services, ‘park and ride’ bus services between suburban car parks and town
centres, and ‘postbus’ services (Post Office minibuses carrying mail and
passengers) in rural areas. Bus operators have taken action to contain costs
and to improve productivity by introducing larger buses, increasing the pro¬
portion of bus services operated by one man and reducing or rationalising
services. Many uneconomic bus services have been withdrawn, particularly in
rural areas, leaving some villages without access to public transport. To assess
ways of meeting the transport needs of rural communities, experimental
transport schemes, co-ordinated by a government steering committee, have
been introduced in four areas (north Devon, Dinefwr in Dyfed, North York¬
shire and south Strathclyde). The Government is also providing substantial
financial support, estimated at £150 million in 1977-78, to ensure the main¬
tenance of essential local bus services.
The National Bus Company operates in England and Wales through locally
based subsidiaries, such as the Western National Omnibus Company, Ribble
Motor Services Ltd and Crosville Motor Services Ltd, and has a network
of long-distance coach services. At the end of 1977 it owned some 18,800
vehicles and employed 65,100 people. In 1977 passenger journeys on the
Company’s buses amounted to 1,800 million, gross revenue was £392 million
and the Company had a net surplus of £9-6 million.
The Scottish Transport Group (with about 4,000 vehicles) operates all the
main bus services in Scotland outside the major cities. It also runs shipping
services to the main islands off the west coast of Scotland; modernised
vehicle ferries have been introduced on many of these services.
In Northern Ireland almost all road passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Citybus
Ltd operates services in the city of Belfast and Ulsterbus Ltd operates most
of the services in the rest of Northern Ireland. These companies have 320
and 930 vehicles respectively.

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are 11 traffic areas in Great Britain each under the jurisdiction of an
independent body of three traffic commissioners. The commissioners are
responsible for ensuring the fitness of vehicles used to carry passengers for
hire or reward, and for licensing public road passenger services in order to
secure proper co-ordination and to avoid unnecessary competition; to this
end they may settle routes, timetables and fares. Under the Transport Act
1978 the licensing system has been modified to allow regular car-sharing
schemes and to reduce restrictions on community buses run by volunteers.
There are about 36,000 taxicabs in Great Britain, mainly in urban areas,
especially London where some 12,500 taxicabs that ply for hire in the streets
are privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are licensed annually
by the Metropolitan Police. There are about 16,500 licensed cab drivers in
London. Numerous car-hire firms are also in operation. Elsewhere taxis are
licensed by local authorities.
There are underground railway services in three British cities: London,
Glasgow and Liverpool. London Transport has 4,323 railway cars and serves
278 stations, while its trains operate over 255 miles (410 kilometres) of railway,
of which nearly 100 miles (161 kilometres) are underground.
Urban rail projects are proceeding in several areas. London Transport is
engaged on a 20-year modernisation programme for the Underground. The
Piccadilly line was extended to Heathrow Airport in December 1977, enabling
passengers to travel directly between Heathrow and central London by the
Underground. The first stage of the new Jubilee line, which is projected to
link north-west and central London, should be opened in 1979. Two major
rail projects are in progress in Glasgow, one of which involves the com¬
plete modernisation of the underground railway which should be reopened
in 1979. A light rapid transit system under construction on Tyneside involves
the electrification of two suburban railway lines, linked by new tunnels under
Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead, and a new bridge over the Tyne. The
first section should be open in 1979 and the whole system, 34 miles (55 kilo¬
metres) long with over 40 stations, should be in operation by the mid-1980s.
The project is the largest provincial urban transport scheme to have been
undertaken in Britain in the twentieth century.
Railways were pioneered in Britain, and the Stockton and Darlington Railway,
opened in 1825, was the first passenger public railway in the world to be
worked by steam power. Under the Transport Act 1947 the four large railway
companies in Great Britain were brought under public ownership and in 1963
the British Railways Board was set up to manage railway affairs and subsidiary
activities. The Government has confirmed support for the present rail net¬
work through the Railways Act 1974, under which the Secretary of State for
Transport has directed the British Railways Board to provide a public service
generally comparable with that provided in December 1974.
In 1977 the railway network operated by British Rail amounted to 11,168
route-miles (17,973 kilometres) of which 2,341 miles (3,767 kilometres) were
electrified. A total of 702 million passenger journeys was made, representing
18,200 million passenger-miles (29,290 million kilometres). Some 170 million
tonnes of freight were carried by rail and freight business amounted to 12,534
million net tonne-miles (20,172 million tonne-kilometres). Receipts amounted
to j£593'4 million from passengers and £348-2 million from freight.
In 1977 the Board had an operating surplus of £68-4 million, £54-7 million
more than in 1976. It received £364 million from the Government and the

At the end of 1977 the Board employed 240,100 people, of whom 178,200
were engaged on the railways (12,600 less than at the end of 1973)- British
Rail operated 3,290 diesel and 320 electric locomotives, 76 high speed tram
(HST) power cars and 302 HST passenger carriages, 3,313 diesel and 7,343
electric passenger multiple-unit vehicles, 6,086 other passenger coaches and
a fleet of 166,900 freight vehicles.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd, a
subsidiary of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates the
railway service on 200 miles (322 kilometres) of track.
Other Activities British Rail has a group of other companies, of which British Rail Engineering
Ltd (BREL) has the largest number of employees, about 35,000 at 13 engi¬
neering factories. BREL mainly constructs locomotives, coaches, wagons and
containers for British Rail, and undertakes heavy maintenance and overhauls.
It also carries out work for export and won export orders worth £42 million
in 1977. Transmark, which provides consultancy services overseas on railway
and associated operations, undertook consultancy work on 47 projects in 31
countries in 1977. British Transport Hotels Ltd runs 29 hotels and controls
Travellers-Fare, which is responsible for catering facilities at stations and on
trains, and provides meals and snacks on more trains than any other railway
company in Europe. British Rail’s Shipping and International Services
Division, with 43 vessels, is the largest partner in the international Sealink
consortium, and operates passenger and ferry services between Great
Britain and Ireland and on the short-sea routes to the continent of Europe, as
well as on some domestic routes. British Rail Hovercraft Ltd provides
hovercraft services in conjunction with Societe Nationale des Chemins de
Fer Fran^ais under the Seaspeed banner (see p 3°i)- The Railway Technical
Centre at Derby is the largest in the world; its most important achievement
has been the development of the advanced passenger train (APT), capable of
speeds up to 155 mph (250 km/h). Development work has involved funda¬
mental research into the guidance and stability of railway vehicles which
would enable these high speeds to be attained on existing track.
Development In recent years the main developments have been the improvement of inter-city
passenger services with the emphasis on speed, reliability, comfort and better
train connections; and an increase in freight trainload traffic, allowing higher
speeds and greater mechanisation in the carrying of coal, other bulk com¬
modities and containers. The standards of track and signalling are being
raised to allow faster running speeds and improved operating efficiency.
Passenger Services The passenger network (see p 293) comprises a fast inter-city network,
linking the main centres of Great Britain; local stopping services; and com¬
muter services in and around the large conurbations, especially London and
the South East. British Rail introduced the world’s fastest diesel rail service,
known as Inter-City 125, in October 1976 on the route from London to Bristol
and south Wales. The service is operated by 27 high speed trains, which travel
at maximum sustained speeds of 125 mph (201 km/h). The first six of 32
further HSTs inaugurated a similar service between London and Edinburgh
in May 1978 and the construction of HSTs to operate between London and
south-west England and on the route linking Edinburgh, Newcastle upon
Tyne, Birmingham, and south-west England or south Wales has been
approved by the Government. Three prototype electric APTs are being built

and the first set will enter service between London and Glasgow in 1979,
covering the 400-mile (644-kilometre) journey in just over four hours.
Electrification is continuing and work started in 1977 on an ^80 million
scheme to electrify the line between London and Bedford. Proposals for
commuter services include the development of new electric multiple-unit
trains to replace old stock, while several urban railway projects are in progress
(see p 292). The Government is reviewing with the British Railways Board
the case for further main-line electrification.
The most important freight commodities handled in 1977 were coal and coke
(94 million tonnes) and iron and steel (26 million tonnes). Other commodities,
such as petroleum products, cars, refuse, roadstone and construction materials,
are becoming more important and British Rail is concentrating on traffic
particularly suitable for carriage by rail, especially long-distance and bulk
trainload traffic. Trainload traffic accounts for about 80 per cent of freight
tonnage, compared with 31 per cent in 1968.
Increased efficiency is being obtained as new types of wagon are introduced
with larger capacities and capable of higher speeds. A network of ‘Speedlink’
high-speed freight services using these new wagons is being established
between the major industrial centres. Over 30 Speedlink trains run each day
and the number is being increased to around 50 by the end of 1978. Freight
traffic is being concentrated at fewer and better equipped and sited marshalling
yards and terminals. A computer-based total operations processing system,
which monitors continuously all consignments and freight train and wagon
movements in Great Britain, has reduced costs by allowing the more intensive
use of rolling stock and the withdrawal of many obsolete freight vehicles. The
‘merry-go-round’ system, whereby trains are loaded and discharged auto¬
matically while in motion, is being used increasingly where there are heavy
flows of mineral traffic, such as the carriage of coal to power stations and
iron ore to steelworks.
The Government provides grants of 50 per cent towards the cost of con¬
struction or modernisation of privately owned rail freight facilities where this
leads to significant environmental benefits by the removal of heavy goods
vehicle traffic from the roads. By mid-1978, 43 schemes had been approved
for grants totalling ^10 million.
There are several small privately owned passenger-carrying railways in
Great Britain, mostly operated on a voluntary basis and providing limited
services for tourists and railway enthusiasts; the principal aim of many of
these railways is the preservation of steam traction. Some are narrow gauge
railways, while others run on former British Rail track.
Inland waterways are popular for recreation (see p 423), continue to carry
freight and are important for land drainage and water supply. Of the 2,000 miles
(3,219 kilometres) of canal and river navigations controlled by the publicly
owned British Waterways Board, some 340 miles (547 kilometres) are main¬
tained as commercial waterways for use by freight-carrying vessels. Freight
traffic of about 4 million tonnes a year is carried on the Board’s commercial
waterways. In addition, some freight is carried on about 600 miles (966 kilo¬
metres) of inland waterways owned by other bodies. The Board also operates
docks, warehouses and inland freight terminals, and has two freight carrying
fleets, although most of the traffic on its waterways is conveyed by independent

carriers. Limited improvements are being undertaken for freight traffic. The
Board is operating on some of its commercial waterways a specially designed
‘push-tow’ barge system.
In 1977 the Board’s turnover amounted to ^10-7 million and it received
government grants of nearly ^12-4 million, most of which were used to
maintain its waterways to statutory standards. As part of the Government’s
proposals to reorganise the structure of the water industry (see p 264), the
British Waterways Board would be merged within a centralised structure to
form the nucleus of a national navigation authority.
PORTS
There are some 250 port authorities or public wharf operators in Britain, and
about 800 other undertakings engaged in various harbour operations, such as
stevedoring, towage, warehousing and lighterage. Port authorities are of four
main types: nationalised bodies, public trusts, local authorities and statutory
companies.
Ports run by nationalised undertakings represent over a quarter of total
capacity, the majority, including Southampton, Hull, Immingham, Newport,
Cardiff and Swansea, being owned by the British Transport Docks Board. In
1977 shipping arrivals and departures at the Board’s docks totalled 129-8
million net registered tons (including fishing vessels) and total cargo handled
was 77-2 million tonnes. The Board’s revenue totalled ^110-5 million and it
achieved a net surplus of ^7-3 million. The British Railways Board controls
certain ports, including Fishguard, Folkestone, Holyhead, Parkeston Quay
(Harwich) and Stranraer, which are largely used for its shipping services, while
the British Waterways Board owns Sharpness (Gloucester) and Weston Point
in Runcorn. Major ports controlled by public trusts include London, Milford
Haven, Tees and Hartlepool, Medway, Forth and Clyde. Local authorities
own about one-third of Britain’s ports, including Bristol and Sunderland.
Port undertakings owned by statutory companies include Manchester and
Liverpool. Many private ports deal with the traffic of individual industrial
firms in commodities such as china clay and petroleum.
Port authorities, in the main, operate with statutory powers and responsibili¬
ties set out in private Acts of Parliament. Most are members of the British
Ports Association which aims to further the common interests of port authori¬
ties in their relations with the Government, shipowners and traders.
The National Ports Council, set up under the Harbours Act 1964, is financed
principally by a levy on port authorities. It advises the Government on major
port developments and has various responsibilities in relation to research,
training, statistics and charges.
Over 336 million tonnes of cargo a year pass through the ports of Great
Britain. Coastal traffic accounts for over 100 million tonnes consisting largely
of petroleum and coal. Of some 158 million tonnes of imports from overseas,
about 81 million tonnes consist of petroleum and petroleum products.
Manufactured goods form about 30 per cent of exports.
A large proportion of the general cargo traffic through British ports is
handled by unitised transport methods in containers and roll-on goods
vehicles, which carried 35 million tonnes of goods in 1977. Felixstowe, Dover,
London, Southampton and Hull all handled large amounts.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 297
London is Britain’s largest port for non-fuel traffic. In 1977, 43 million tonnes
of goods were handled, including 22 million tonnes of petroleum. South¬
ampton is the main trading port on the south coast. Medway is important for
petroleum and petroleum products, while some of the other ports in the
South East and East Anglia are growing rapidly with modern facilities especially
for roll-on/roll-off and container traffic. Dover is Britain’s leading port for
passengers and roll-on/roll-off passenger and goods vehicles.
Liverpool is a very important export outlet, especially to countries outside
Europe and the Mediterranean. The inland port of Manchester, reached from
the Mersey via the 58-kilometre (36-mile) Manchester Ship Canal, exports
particularly chemicals and petroleum products.
The port of Tees and Hartlepool handles petroleum products, chemicals,
iron and steel, and iron ore. Some of the ports on the north-east coast of
England, such as Blyth and the Tyne, have an important outward trade in
coal. Grimsby and Hull are Britain’s two main fishing ports. Immingham
handles imports of iron ore and crude oil and exports of ferrous and petroleum
products.
Milford Haven, handling 37 million tonnes a year, is Britain’s major oil port.
Much of the traffic through the south Wales ports is connected with the local
steel industry—imports of iron ore and exports of iron and steel, and tinplate.
In Scotland the principal port facilities serving the central industrial area
are Greenock (handling particularly petroleum and petroleum products,
containers and raw sugar) and Glasgow (iron ore and grain) on the Clyde, and
Grangemouth (containers and timber) and Leith (grain and whisky) on the
Forth. The Clyde and Forth estuaries have major crude oil terminals.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and with Larne handles
the main traffic across the Irish Sea.
Most of the oil tankers coming to Britain to discharge crude oil are berthed at
special tanker terminals owned and operated by the oil companies to serve
their refineries. Milford Haven can accommodate fully laden vessels of up to
275,000 deadweight tons on all tides at five private oil company terminals and
Finnart on the Clyde will accept vessels of 325,000 deadweight tons. At Tetney
Haven, off the mouth of the Humber, tankers discharge oil at an offshore buoy
and it is carried by pipeline to the shore; the first oil was discharged at a similar
buoy at Amlwch (Gwynedd) in 1977.
The first purpose-built terminal for oil from the British sector of the North
Sea was completed at Hound Point on the Forth in 1975 and other terminals
have been built on the Tees and at Flotta (Orkney). The oil port being built
at Sullom Voe in Shetland is expected to become the largest in Britain and
should handle its first oil later in 1978. Of the four jetties being built, three
are designed to take tankers of up to 300,000 deadweight tons.
Modernisation of Britain’s ports is in progress, primarily to accommodate
technological changes, notably the growth in size of tankers and bulk carriers
and the increase in the proportion of goods carried in container ships and
roll-on vessels, and the changing nature and direction of Britain’s trade.
However, port investment in real terms has been declining in the 1970s and
most current developments are concerned with specific energy or industrial
needs or to accommodate specialised container or roll-on services rather than
with general purpose port facilities.
Recent major schemes have included a £16 million container terminal at
Tilbury (London) covering 64 acres (26 hectares), which is due to open later

in 1978, making Tilbury the world’s largest terminal for refrigerated con¬
tainers; the £37 million Royal Portbury Dock at Bristol, containing six berths
and the largest entrance lock in Britain; and one of the world’s biggest
hoverports, a £12 million terminal at Dover to handle cross-Channel hover¬
craft, which became fully operational in July 1978. A terminal for handling
iron ore and coal is being built at Hunterston on the Clyde and will be able to
accommodate ships of up to 350,000 deadweight tons. It is the biggest
terminal of its type in Europe and should be operational towards the end of
x978.
The exploration for, and production of, offshore oil and gas has led to other
port developments, mainly in Scotland. Supply bases for offshore vessels have
been built at a number of ports including Leith, Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen,
Peterhead, and Lerwick in Shetland.
At the end of 1977 about 65,000 people were employed in Britain’s ports
industry; of these, 29,000 dockers responsible for the physical and mechanical
handling of cargo were registered with the National Dock Labour Board
(NDLB), which administers the Dock Workers Employment Scheme. The
system of casual labour common among dock workers in the past has been
virtually eliminated. The Dock Work Regulation Act 1976 enables statutory
control of dock work to be modified to meet changing conditions in the
industry. The NDLB has been reconstituted as a statutory corporation with
wider representation.
SHIPPING
Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over at 1 January
1978, 8 per cent was registered in Britain, making the British merchant fleet
at 31-2 million gross tons the fourth largest in active employment after those
of Liberia, Japan and Greece. The oil tanker fleet (14-6 million gross tons) was
the world’s third largest and the ore and bulk carrier fleet (8 million gross tons)
the fifth largest. The British fleet is one of the most modern in the world with
some 42 per cent of the tonnage less than five years old. In the last ten years
some ^4,500 million has been spent on new ships and other capital investment
by Britain’s 300 shipping companies.
The Department of Trade is the government department responsible for most
matters connected with merchant shipping, including general policy towards
the industry and Britain’s relations with other governments and international
organisations on shipping matters. Under the Merchant Shipping Acts it
administers many regulations for marine safety and welfare, and for preventing
and cleaning up pollution from ships (see p 169). For instance, it certifies the
load-line (or Plimsoll line) that shows that a ship is not overloaded; ensures
that standards of safety are observed in ship construction; ensures the pro¬
vision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment; and deals
with the discipline, professional standards, health and accommodation of sea¬
men. These duties are carried out from marine survey offices and mercantile
marine offices located at various ports. The Acts also contain certain reserve
powers for protecting shipping and trading interests from measures adopted
or proposed by overseas governments. In the offices of the Registrar General
of Shipping and Seamen, at Cardiff, a record of all British ships is kept.
1 One gross ton = 100 cubic feet (2-83 cubic metres). One deadweight ton = 1
long ton (2,240 lb or 1,016 kilogrammes). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity
of the enclosed space on a ship. Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which
a vessel can carry before submerging the load-line.

THE MERCHANT
FLEET
OWNERSHIP
TRAFFIC
In July 1977, 29-4 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons and
over were both owned and registered in Britain.1 These ships are usually
employed as follows: 15-3 million gross tons as tankers; 9-2 million gross tons
as tramps and 5 million gross tons as passenger and cargo liners. Rapid techno¬
logical change in the merchant fleet is reflected in the current composition.
Vessels are becoming obsolete over a shorter period and as they do so are being
replaced by larger ships, incorporating labour-saving devices.
The tendency to greater size has been most marked in tankers, bulk carriers
and container vessels. Tanker size has increased from a maximum of 30,000
deadweight tons in the early 1950s to about 500,000 deadweight tons for the
largest ocean-going tankers. The largest modern container ships of up to
60,000 gross tons have a capacity of 2,800 containers of 20-foot (6-metre)
equivalent units.
Lloyd’s Register of Shipping surveys and classifies ships with particular
regard to their safety and operational efficiency.
Nearly the whole of the British merchant fleet is privately owned, apart from
some ships which are owned and/or operated by nationalised industries as
part of their normal commercial operations, one example being British Rail
(see p 294). Over half of the tanker fleet belongs to the oil companies, although
there are a few independent tanker operators. British liner tonnage is dominated
by a relatively small number of large groups, the largest liner company being
the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. Some shipowners
have delegated the management of their fleets to specialist ship management
companies. Several companies are participating in consortia, particularly
where heavy investment in ships and facilities is required, as with container
and bulk cargo vessels. Chartering of ships of all nationalities takes place on
the Baltic Exchange, the largest market of its type in the world. The represen¬
tative body for shipowners (excluding owners of fishing vessels) is the General
Council of British Shipping.
Almost all Britain’s overseas trade by weight, over four-fifths by value, is
carried by sea. Ships registered in Britain carry 35 per cent by weight, 44 per
cent by value, of seaborne trade between Britain and other countries. Tanker
cargoes, mostly imports of crude oil, account for nearly half this trade by
weight but only about 13 per cent by value, and foodstuffs and manufactured
goods account for over three-quarters by value.
Traffic in container or roll-on/roll-off vessels is accounting for a growing
proportion of general cargo trade. Many of the deep-sea liner services from
Britain are operated by container ships. Roll-on services, accommodating
passengers and their cars and, in some cases, commercial vehicles are increasing
in number, particularly between Britain and the continent of Europe. Several
roll-on services for freight only operate to the Irish Republic, the continent
of Europe, and to more distant countries, especially in the Middle East, North
Africa and West Africa.
The proportion of passengers travelling to or from Britain by sea is about
one-third, compared with about one-half in the early 1960s. Almost all pas¬
sengers travel to or from the continent of Europe or the Irish Republic,
services on other routes having virtually ceased as a result of the growth of air
services. Remaining long-distance passenger ships are used for cruising and
about 100,000 passengers a year embark on pleasure cruises from British ports.
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft, Ministry
of Defence vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries.

SAFETY AT SEA
Sea Rescue
British shipping companies operating liner services have associated with each
other and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes
in a series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of
rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential
principle of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates
to be applied by each member line. Each conference regularly reviews existing
rates and the share of the trade carried by member lines. Rates are reviewed
in consultation with shippers’ organisations. There are about 100 conferences
dealing with trade to and from Britain.
Various qualifications are required for employment on board ship in certain
grades. Responsibility for holding examinations and issuing certificates of
competency rests with the Department of Trade, except in the case of radio
officers where this is the function of the Home Office.
There are some 50 establishments providing full-time vocational training
for seafarers. Most deck and catering junior ratings are trained at the National
Sea Training College at Gravesend (Kent), the world’s largest ratings’ estab¬
lishment, which can accommodate some 2,000 ratings a year. The Merchant
Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies of apprentices,
cadets and ratings who are preparing for their examinations for the various
certificates of competency.
Wages and conditions of employment of most seafarers are negotiated by the
National Maritime Board, composed of equal numbers of representatives of
the General Council of British Shipping and seafarers’ trade unions. The
Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, introduced in 1947, removed a
great deal of the uncertainty formerly associated with seafaring. Under the
latest scheme seafarers are employed either as ‘registered seafarers’ or they
may enter into a company service contract, for a minimum of one year, for
employment on the ships of a particular company. Registered seafarers receive
special benefits between voyages in addition to the normal state benefits. The
benefits paid to company service contract seafarers must be at least equivalent
to those paid to registered seafarers. The industry is studying ways of improving
seafaring conditions of work and leisure.
The Department of Trade’s responsibilities for safety include administration
of the Marine Survey Service, the Coastguard Service, and certain administra¬
tive functions concerning lighthouses and pilotage. The Department makes
regulations to ensure safety of navigation at sea and conducts inquiries into
shipping casualties and accidents. Britain’s merchant fleet is one of the safest
in the world; it has a consistently lower record of ship losses than the world
average.
The Coastguard Service co-ordinates search and rescue action for vessels in
distress off the coasts of Britain, and gives direct assistance where appropriate.
There are some 600 regular coastguards and about 9,000 voluntary auxiliary
coastguards. Constant watch is maintained all the year round at certain main
stations and at times of casualty risk at a number of others. During 1977 life¬
saving action was taken on 4,030 occasions and 7>433 Pe°ple were rescued.
The Coastguard Service calls upon shipping, the lifeboats of the Royal
National Life-boat Institution (RNLI), and Service aircraft to assist as
necessary. It can also call upon the services of a long-range civilian helicopter
based at Aberdeen. The RNLI is supported entirely by voluntary contribu¬
tions, and depends for its operation on voluntary workers. Lifeboats were
launched 2,737 times in 1977 and rescued 1,131 people.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

Lighthouses The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which is administered by a
board of Elder Brethren elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the
Northern Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. These
authorities control about 350 lighthouses, many minor lights and buoys, and a
number of lightships, some of which are being replaced by unattended sea
marks or by light towers.
Pilotage In Britain there are 46 pilotage authorities for the 86 pilotage districts and
over 1,500 licensed pilots. Trinity House is the chief pilotage authority,
licensing some 700 pilots in 41 districts in England and Wales. In some cases
the harbour authority or local council is the pilotage authority.
Traffic There are a number of traffic separation schemes around the shores of Britain.
Control Observance of traffic separation schemes adopted by the Inter-Governmental
Maritime Consultative Organisation (a United Nations agency with head¬
quarters in London) has been required of British shipping since 1972 and in
1977 it became mandatory for vessels of countries contracting to revised
international collision regulations. The most important scheme affecting
British waters is in the Dover Strait, one of the world’s busiest seaways. It
consists of traffic lanes for shipping passing through the strait and inshore
traffic zones for use by local shipping. The number of collisions has fallen
considerably since the introduction of the scheme. Britain and France operate
radar surveillance services which keep watch on ships not conforming to the
traffic separation scheme and broadcast navigational information to ships in
the Dover Strait. ‘Mancheplan’, a joint contingency plan for handling maritime
disasters in the English Channel and the Dover Strait, was brought fully into
force by the British and French Governments in May 1978. The Anglo-
French Safety of Navigation Group, comprising representatives of British and
French government departments, is responsible for improving safety in the
English Channel.
HOVERCRAFT The hovercraft, a vehicle which rides on a cushion of air over both land and
water surfaces, was invented in Britain and has been in regular public passen¬
ger service since the mid-1960s. Services are concentrated on cross-Channel
routes and on routes across the Solent between Southampton and the Isle of
Wight. Two operators provide cross-Channel services: Seaspeed with routes
between Dover and Boulogne, and Dover and Calais; and Hoverlloyd Ltd,
which has a purpose-built hoverport at Pegwell Bay for its car and passenger
ferries between Ramsgate and Calais. A hovercraft crossing takes about one-
third of the time taken by ships and hovercraft have gained about one-third
of the short-sea traffic in this area. Several hovercraft have had or are to
have their capacity increased to meet the growing demand. In the summer of
1978 Seaspeed placed in service the world’s largest hovercraft, a British
Hovercraft Corporation SR.N4 which has been structurally enlarged to
accommodate 416 passengers and 60 cars.
CIVIL AVIATION
Britain has a growing civil aviation industry which is continuing to develop
to meet the increasing demand for air travel, particularly international travel.
Airline services are operated by British Airways and by a number of indepen¬
dent airlines. The most modern types of aircraft are operated including

wide-bodied aircraft and the Concorde supersonic aircraft with which British
Airways inaugurated in 1976, jointly with Air France, the world’s first super¬
sonic passenger services. To cater for the growing number of air passengers,
many airports are being substantially modernised and new terminals installed.
The Secretary of State for Trade is responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with other countries, the
licensing and control of public transport operations into Britain by overseas
operators and British participation in the activities of international aviation
bodies), airports policy, amenity matters such as aircraft noise, aviation
security policy and investigation of accidents.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an independent statutory body,
responsible for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the
industry; the provision by the National Air Traffic Services, jointly with the
Secretary of State for Defence, of air navigation services and the aerodrome
navigation services at certain British airports; and the operation of eight
aerodromes in Scotland. The Secretary of State for Trade appoints the
members of the CAA, and issues a written guidance on the general policies to
be followed, which requires approval of both Houses of Parliament.
The CAA has been given the objective of recovering as soon as possible the
whole of its costs and a reasonable return on capital from the users of its
services. Meanwhile the Government is paying the CAA a grant to meet the
deficit on its revenue account; it amounted to ^16-6 million in 1977-78.
Since 1962 more passengers have entered or left Britain by air than by sea.
In 1977 a total of some 34-6 million passengers travelled by air (international
terminal passengers), compared with 18-3 million by sea. Total capacity offered
on all services by British airlines amounted to 10,279 million capacity-tonne-
kilometres in 1977, 57 per cent more than in 1976. British Airways accounts
for some 92 per cent of scheduled services flown by British airlines, whereas
the charter market is dominated by independent companies.
The value of overseas trade by air rose by 28 per cent in 1977 to ,£10,973
million, and the proportions of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air amounted
to 17 per cent of the value of exports and 14 per cent of imports. Air freight is
important for the carriage of goods with a high value-to-weight ratio, especially
where speed of movement is essential. Precious stones (particularly diamonds),
live animals, medicinal and pharmaceutical products, clothing, leather and
skins, and scientific instruments are major categories where a relatively high
proportion of exports is sent by air.
British Airways is one of the world’s leading airlines, and in terms of inter¬
national passengers carried and of international passenger-kilometres flown
it is the largest in the world. During 1977-78 British Airways’ turnover was
j£i,355 million (including ,£1,156 million from airline operations), and it made
a net profit of ,£33 million. Overseas earnings amounted to ,£775 million.
In March 1978 British Airways employed about 57,300 staff. Its assets of
£819 million included ,£662 million of aircraft and spares and ,£99 million of
land and buildings. In 1977 a reorganisation of the airline, involving the
replacement of three airline divisions by a number of functional departments,
was implemented to create a unified airline, with a simpler organisation, and
to increase efficiency and profitability.

British Airways’ route network covering some 579,800 kilometres (360,200
miles) of unduplicated route is among the largest in the wrorld. The airline
serves 149 destinations in 78 countries. In 1977-78 some 13-4 million pas¬
sengers were carried on scheduled services, which are operated to the rest of
Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia, East and South Africa,
North America and Guyana in South America. Within Britain it runs over
1,000 services a week to 26 towns and cities throughout the country. The
airline’s Concorde services are operated from London (Heathrow) to New
York, Washington and Bahrain. Initial experience has exceeded expectations
with high passenger load factors on the routes to the United States. In 1975
British Airways inaugurated Europe’s first air ‘shuttle’ service (a regular
scheduled no-reservation service with back-up aircraft to carry extra
passengers) between Heathrow and Glasgow, and similar services have been
introduced from Heathrow to Edinburgh and Belfast. Joint shuttle services
with national airlines to a number of other European countries are being
investigated.
British Airways Associated Companies Ltd is responsible for the group’s
investments connected with a number of hotel companies and air companies in
different parts of the world. British Airways Helicopters Ltd operates a
scheduled service between Penzance (Cornwall) and the Isles of Scilly,
undertakes charter work, provides links between oil rigs in the North Sea and
the mainland and operates air-sea rescue services from Aberdeen. Engine
overhaul work for British Airways and other airlines is carried out by British
Airways Engine Overhaul Ltd. International Aeradio Ltd plans, installs,
operates and maintains airport technical services and general communications
and manufactures specialised equipment for use in these services.
British Airways operated 208 aircraft and helicopters in 1978. Aircraft included
25 BAC One-Elevens, 9 Boeing 707-4363, 11 Boeing 707-3363, 25 Boeing 747s,
5 Concordes, 2 HS 748s, 5 Merchantmen (converted Vanguard passenger
aircraft), 15 Trident Ones, 16 Trident Twos, 25 Trident Threes, 9 TriStar is,
15 Super VCios, and 19 Viscounts. Major orders include 19 Boeing 737s,
19 Boeing 757s an<^ 6 TriStar 500s, Helicopters operated comprise 23 Sikorsky
6iNs, 2 Sikorsky 58TS, 1 Bell Jet Ranger and 1 Bell 212.
The independent airlines carry nearly 4 million passengers a year on scheduled
services and over 9 million on charter flights. The main independent scheduled
airline is British Caledonian Airways, which operates a fleet of 27 aircraft and
carries over 1 million scheduled service passengers a year. Its scheduled
services are primarily to the continent of Europe, West and Central Africa,
South America and Houston in the United States. Other independent
operators of scheduled passenger services include British Island Airways,
British Midland Airways and Dan-Air Services. A pioneering development
in transatlantic air travel was the inauguration in September 1977 by Laker

Britannia Airways, Dan-Air Services, Laker Airways and Monarch Airlines
are the leading independent airlines running charter passenger services.
Over 290 aircraft operated by some 130 public transport companies are

men, but are being employed increasingly in operations connected with the
development of Britain’s offshore oil and gas resources. Light aircraft and

helicopters are also involved in other activities, such as charter operations,
search and rescue services, crop-spraying, aerial survey and photography, and
flying instruction.
Under the CAA’s air transport licensing system, British operators apply for
licences for scheduled and charter services, or for revocation or variation of
existing licences including alterations to fares. With certain exceptions the
CAA is required to license only one British airline to provide scheduled
services on a long-haul international route. British Airways is the preferred
airline for all long-haul routes other than those to the areas in the ‘sphere of
interest’ of British Caledonian Airways, as defined in the policy guidance of
1976. The CAA also licenses air travel organisers. The Air Transport Users
Committee advises the CAA on the interests of passengers and other airline
users, and investigates individual complaints against airlines.
The CAA is responsible for the regulation of the safety of civil aircraft
registered in Britain. Its Operations Division deals with the preparation and
application of safety requirements concerning airline operations, flight crew
licensing and training, aerodromes, and fire and rescue services. The Air¬
worthiness Division is responsible for functions such as the airworthiness
certification of aircraft, the licensing of aircraft maintenance engineers, the
approval of work schedules to which transport aircraft are maintained, and
the publication of the British Civil Airworthiness Requirements, a code
with which all aircraft built in Britain or flown by British airlines must
comply. It has similar duties in relation to hovercraft. The CAA is advised
in these duties by the Airworthiness Requirements Board. Recent safety
measures have included a mandatory system of reporting of incidents and
structural or mechanical defects, and the requirement for fitting ground
proximity warning systems in public transport aircraft registered in Britain.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain weight used for public transport
must possess an Air Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the CAA when
it is satisfied that the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of its
aircraft. The CAA’s flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline
pilots) check that satisfactory operating standards are maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Applicants for professional
pilots’ licences are required to attend approved courses of training before
attempting qualifying examinations and flight tests.
Responsibility for civil and military air traffic control over Britain and the
surrounding seas rests with the National Air Traffic Services. The planning
and provision of the facilities necessary for control of aircraft at the higher
flight levels are carried out in conjunction with Eurocontrol, a European
international agency of which Britain is a member.
A system of airways, introduced in 1950 and covering the main traffic routes
with control zones around the major airports, has been gradually extended.
The primary navigation aids have been the very high frequency omni¬
directional ranges (VORs) and distance measuring equipment. Re-equipment
with the more accurate Doppler VOR system began in 1974 and should be
completed before 1980. During the last few years virtually the whole of the
airspace over Britain above 5,000 feet (1,500 metres) has been brought under

surveillance by modern primary and secondary radar equipment. There are
two main air traffic control centres, located at West Drayton (Greater London)
and Prestwick, and a subsidiary centre at Manchester. Extensive use is made
of automatic data processing and other advanced electronic techniques.
The development of all-weather landing systems, on the basis of an im¬
proved version of the standard instrument landing system, was pioneered in
Britain and most of Britain’s major airports use this improved version.
Of the 128 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain, just over one-quarter each
handles more than 100,000 passengers a year. In 1977 Britain’s civil airports
handled a total of 47-1 million passengers (45-9 million terminal passengers
and i*2 million in transit), 2-6 per cent more than in 1976, and 705,000 tonnes
of freight. The two major airports in the London area (Heathrow and Gatwick)
handled most passengers, 23-8 million and 67 million respectively. Other
leading airports were Manchester 2-9 million passengers, Glasgow i-8 million,
Luton, Birmingham and Belfast. While the number of air passengers has, in
general, risen in recent years, there has not been a corresponding increase in
air transport movements owing to the growing use of wide-bodied aircraft.
The British Airports Authority (BAA), an independent statutory body
operating on a commercial basis, owns and manages seven airports—Heath¬
row, Gatwick and Stansted in the south-east, and Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Prestwick and Aberdeen in Scotland—which handle 75 per cent of air passen¬
gers and 85 per cent of air cargo traffic in Britain. In 1977-78 the BAA’s income
was £125-1 million and it recorded a pre-tax profit of £24-3 million.
Eight small aerodromes in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland are
controlled by the Civil Aviation Authority and Belfast’s airport (Aldergrove)
is managed by Northern Ireland Airports Ltd, a subsidiary of the Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company. Most of the other public airports are
controlled by local authorities. All airports and aerodromes in Britain (apart
from those controlled by the Government or by the CAA) must be licensed
annually by the CAA. Stringent requirements, such as the provision of adequate
fire-fighting, medical and rescue services, suitable runways, and of air traffic
control services and visual aids, must be satisfied before a licence is granted.
Strict security measures are in force at airports. Policing of airports is generally
the responsibility of the local police forces.
A major £73 million modernisation programme is almost complete at Heath¬
row, the world’s busiest centre for international travel, to develop the capacity
of the three terminals to their ultimate limit of about 30 million passengers a
year. Plans for a fourth terminal, raising Heathrow’s annual capacity to 38
million passengers, are being considered at a local planning inquiry. Gatwick
airport, 28 miles (45 kilometres) south of London, is the second major airport
for the London area and was the first in the world to bring together road, rail
and air transport connections in one unit. A £100 million redevelopment
programme has been virtually completed, increasing Gatwick’s annual capacity
to some 16 million passengers. The Government has announced measures
to ensure greater use of Gatwick so as to relieve congestion at Heathrow.
Work is in progress to develop facilities at several of Britain’s other airports.
A five-year development scheme, costing some £15 million, started in 1977
for the expansion of terminal facilities at Aldergrove. Conditions at Edinburgh
airport have been improved considerably as a result of a £15 million rede¬
velopment scheme which involved the construction of a 2,560-metre (8,400-ft)

runway and of a new terminal building. Offshore oil and gas activities have
stimulated a major expansion programme at Aberdeen airport, where a new
terminal was opened in 1977 and which has become the world’s busiest
heliport, and developments at other airports including Inverness and
Sumburgh (Shetland).
In 1978 the Government set out its policy for the development of airports in
Great Britain up to 1990, to accommodate the substantial increase expected
in the number of air passengers. The emphasis is on developing existing air¬
ports rather than on constructing new ones. The Government envisages a
build-up of traffic to use the large modern facilities at Gatwick and a limited
expansion of other airports in the London area. Manchester has been desig¬
nated as the principal ‘gateway’ international airport in England and Wales
outside the south-east. Developments in the rest of England and Wales will
be concentrated at the selected regional airports of Birmingham, Cardiff-Wales,
East Midlands, Leeds/Bradford and Newcastle upon Tyne.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides postal, telecommunications, data
processing and Giro services. It was set up as a public authority under the
Post Office Act 1969, having previously been a government department. The
chairman and other members of the board are appointed by the Secretary of
State for Industry. With some 401,000 employees, it is the largest commercial
employer in Europe.
In 1977-78 the Post Office’s income, excluding internal transactions, v/as
£4,183 million and a profit of £3677 million was recorded, with profits of
£325-5 million on telecommunications and £40-4 million on posts. Capital
expenditure on fixed assets amounted to £870 million in 1977-78. Some £56
million a year is spent on research and development, mostly at the Post
Office’s research centre at Martlesham Heath (Suffolk).
The Post Office pioneered postal services and was the first service to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance payment for mail. It provides
deliveries each working day to 22 million addresses. In 1977-78 the Post Office
handled some 160 million parcels and 9,325 million items of other correspon¬
dence (including 8,840 million inland letters).
Postal operations are being mechanised and by 1984 there will be a national
network of 83 mechanised high-speed sorting offices. Large parcel centres,
each serving a group of counties, are gradually taking over the work of the
1,200 offices which handle parcels manually. Mechanised sorting is aided by
the use of postcodes, of which there are 1-5 million; Britain’s postcode system
is one of the most sophisticated in the world.
Britain has 22,900 post offices, of which nearly 1,600 are operated directly by
the Post Office and the remainder on an agency basis by sub-postmasters.
At a post office counter, besides making use of its postal and telegraph facilities,
a person may draw a pension or a family allowance, buy a dog licence, a tele¬
vision receiving licence, renew a motor vehicle licence, obtain a British visitor s
passport, buy national insurance stamps, and use the facilities of the National
Savings Bank (see p 346) and of the National Girobank (see p 344)- much
of its counter service the Post Office acts as agent for government departments
and local authorities.

The Post Office provides a range of 40 specialist services, mainly for com¬
merce. ‘Datapost’, a door-to-door overnight delivery service originally for
computer data, has been expanded to include documents, medical samples
and spare parts, and handles 2-7 million packets a year. There are International
Datapost links with 12 countries. An ‘Expresspost’ messenger service, for
rapid delivery of mail within or between cities, was started in London in
1976 and has been extended to 15 centres. About one-third of the Post Office’s
philatelic business, which mainly involves the sale of stamps to collectors or
dealers, is conducted by the Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh. The British
Postal Consultancy Service offers advice and assistance on all aspects of postal
business to overseas postal administrations, and over 20 countries have used
its services.
Britain has the world’s third largest telecommunications system, after the
United States and Japan, with more than 23 million telephones, 15 million
exchange connections, 72,000 telex connections and 50,000 data transmission
terminals (more than in any country except the United States). The Post
Office’s telecommunications business employs 225,000 people, has assets of
nearly £6,500 million, and runs eight factories and a fleet of nearly 49,000
telecommunications vehicles.
In 1977-78 some 17,454 million telephone calls were made in Britain com¬
prising 14,600 million local calls, 2,703 million trunk calls and 151 million
international calls. Virtually all local and trunk calls can be dialled direct.
To back up its nationwide system of cables, the Post Office has built a network
of radio towers for transmitting telephone calls, television programmes and
computer data over microwave channels.
Several specialised services are available by telephone, including the ‘999’
emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected rapidly and
free of charge to the police, ambulance or fire brigade. Of the 534 million
calls a year made to recorded information services, 383 million are to the
speaking clock. Other recorded information services include weather forecasts,
motoring information, recipes, cricket scores, Financial Times Share Index
and Business News Summary, and ‘Dial a Disc’.
Over 870 electronic exchanges are in use in Britain and orders for a further
300 have been placed. They are more reliable than conventional electro¬
mechanical exchanges as they have very few moving parts and so require less
maintenance. Most electronic exchanges are of the TXE2 type, with a capacity
of up to 7,000 lines. Larger TXE4 exchanges, with a capacity of up to 40,000
lines, have been brought into service since February 1976.
Britain leads the world in the provision of international direct dialling; about
85 per cent of Britain’s telephone subscribers can dial direct to 76 countries.
About 88 per cent of all international calls are dialled direct. The demand for
international calls is doubling every four or five years and the Post Office has
substantially increased the amount of equipment in its international exchanges
and raised the number of cable and satellite circuits linking Britain with other
countries from nearly 3,000 in 1970 to 26,000 in mid-1978. Over 60 per cent
of the intercontinental telephone traffic to or from Britain is carried by satellite.
Three aerials at the Goonhilly earth station in Cornwall provide commercial
telecommunications services via high-capacity geostationary satellites posi¬
tioned over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Britain has the second largest

interest, after the United States, in the world space communications satellite
network and a second earth station is being built at Madley (Hereford and
Worcester) to cope with the growth in international traffic.
Some 243 submarine cables, covering a total of 905 nautical miles (1,677
kilometres), are part of Britain’s internal cable network. There are 28 cables,
covering a total of 4,445 nautical miles (8,237 kilometres), from Britain to the
continent of Europe, the Irish Republic, the Channel Islands and the Faroe
Islands, and four cables between Britain and North America.
The Post Office provides day-to-day communications links and radio services
for shipping of all nations through one long-range and 11 medium-range
radio stations around the coastline of Britain. At all medium-range stations a
continuous watch is maintained on the international distress frequencies, as
part of a safety of life at sea service provided on behalf of the Department of
Trade. A number of remotely controlled short-range coast radio stations are
being installed to provide radiotelephone links with ships at sea at a range of
up to 50 miles (80 kilometres).
Oil and gas production platforms in the North Sea are linked to Britain’s
telecommunications network by transhorizon radio. Two new radio stations
have been built in south Shetland and one near Fraserburgh (Grampian).
Post Office Datel services provide for transmission of information for com¬
puters and other automatic processors. A wide variety of data transmission
facilities, at speeds from 50 bits a second to 48,000 bits a second, are provided
using Post Office circuits. The services consist of a suitable telegraph or tele¬
phone line and, when necessary, a modem (which converts digital signals into
voice frequencies for transmission). The Post Office will introduce in 1978 a
service at 4,800 bits a second over the public telephone network. An inter¬
nationally compatible Datel service at 2,400 bits a second was introduced in
1977.
The British telex service is fully automatic. Demand for inland and inter¬
national telex services is growing and the number of connections has nearly
doubled since 1971. Customers can dial direct to over 110 countries and 98 per
cent of all international calls are dialled direct.
International telegrams are transmitted through the Post Office’s computer-
controlled Telegram Retransmission Centre in London, the largest of its kind
in the world, which has greatly improved efficiency by reducing the average
handling time of international telegrams. It has direct access to terminals in
over 90 countries.
The Post Office is developing several new telecommunications services. A
public test service of ‘Prestel’, the new Post Office viewdata service, in which
people can telephone for information stored in a computer and have it dis¬
played on a television set in words and simple diagrams, started in June 1978.
Prestel will be the world’s first public viewdata service when it is established
in the first quarter of 1979 and will have an initial capacity of over 100,000
pages of information. Plans are being drawn up for Prestel centres in London,
Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester and Norwich. The
Post Office has exported the system to telecommunications authorities in a
number of countries.

DATA
PROCESSING
A radiopaging service, which provides direct dialling access to very high
frequency pocket ‘bleepers’ over the public telephone network, is operating
in three areas (Greater London, Birmingham and the Thames Valley) and
a service in other major centres is planned to start between late 1978 and
mid-1979.
The Post Office Experimental Packet Switched Service, which came into
full operation in 1977, is Europe’s first public service for sending computer
data by this technique, in which it is assembled in blocks, or packets, each
with a built-in address to route the data independently through the network
to its destination. A service to the United States started in July 1978 and a
European service, known as Euronet, is due to start in 1979.
A series of new switching and associated systems for telephone exchanges,
known as System X, using microelectronics technology, integrated digital
transmission and switching, stored program (software) control and common
channel signalling, has been developed. The first production exchanges are
expected to be ordered before the end of 1978 and they should enter service
three years later.
The Post Office has a corporate Data Processing Service for internal services,
and a comprehensive bureau service, known as National Data Processing, for
industry and commerce. It operates some of the most comprehensive data
processing systems in Europe and has implemented more than 400 projects.
As a major industrial country, Britain has a labour force characterised by a
high level of technical and commercial skill which has often shown its capacity
to adapt to changing economic conditions and technical progress. To ensure
as far as possible that Britain’s working population, like the country’s other
economic resources, is fully utilised, the Government intervenes in the labour
market in a number of ways: by providing public employment and training
services; by policies to promote regional development and labour mobility;
by measures to alleviate unemployment; through legislation to regulate terms
and conditions of employment and improve industrial relations; by providing
for security of employment and incomes; and through legislation relating to
health and safety at work.
THE WORKING POPULATION
The total working population of Britain at the middle of June 1977 was 26'3
million, about 48 per cent of the total population. If the unemployed, the self-
employed, and the Armed Forces are omitted from the working population,
there remained 22-7 million employees (i3'4 million men and 9-3 million
women) in employment. The percentage of women (particularly those working
part-time) in the labour force continues to rise, although at a reduced rate
compared with previous years. The great majority of the working population
work for a wage or salary, but nearly 2 million are employers or self-employed.
The working population increased slowly until 1966, then declined between
1966 and 1971, since when it has been rising again (see Table 20). One reason
for the fall after 1966 was the increased number in full-time education. During
the next few years the male labour force is expected to increase slowly, while
the number of females is expected to continue to increase. In June 1977 men
accounted for 59 per cent of all employees and women for 41 per cent (about
two-fifths of whom worked part-time).

Though successful development policies in the less-prosperous regions may
raise the working population above the levels forecast, any increasing demand
for labour must in general be met by better deployment of manpower, improved
productivity and more training. In general, non-employed married women
form the only substantial reserve.
The distribution of employees by industry in 1970 and 1977 is shown in
Table 21.
The total working population of Northern Ireland, including employers and
self-employed, was about 623,000 in June 197? (394>000 males and 229,000
females). The number of employees in employment was about 489,000. The
largest non-service industries are agriculture, engineering, textiles and
clothing. Most of the agricultural workers in Northern Ireland are family
workers. Farmers and small-holders working their own holdings account for
about 6 per cent of the working population.
MANPOWER POLICY
In Great Britain the Department of Employment is generally responsible for
employment policy, industrial relations and pay policy, and for the payment of
unemployment benefit, but the Manpower Services Commission (MSC)
advises the Government on manpower policy issues and, with the agreement of

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Government, has set itself the long-term aim of developing a comprehen¬
sive manpower policy with a dual function: to enable the country’s manpower
resources to be developed and contribute fully to economic well-being; and
to ensure that there is available to each worker the opportunities and services
he or she needs in order to lead a satisfying working life. Responsibility for the
activities of the MSC in Scotland and Wales rests with the Secretaries of State
for Scotland and Wales respectively, while, in Northern Ireland, corresponding
responsibilities are undertaken by the Department of Manpower Services.
The MSC, which is separate from the Government but accountable to the
Secretaries of State for Employment, Scotland and Wales, has a chairman and
nine other members appointed after consultation with employers and em¬
ployees, and local government and educational interests; responsibility for the
management and development of the commission’s services thus belongs
directly to representatives of those who use them. Scottish and Welsh com¬
mittees of the MSC consider special Scottish and Welsh dimensions of man¬
power issues.
The MSC carries out its functions within a general policy framework agreed
with the Secretaries of State, and was responsible for expenditure of about
£432 million in 1977-78. Most of its activities are financed from public funds.
The MSC is advised by a network of district manpower committees
on which employers, employees and other local interests are represented, to
secure the full benefit of local knowledge and the co-operation of employers
and employees. The main statutory duty of the MSC is to make such arrange¬
ments as it considers appropriate for assisting people to select, train for, obtain
and retain employment, and for assisting employers to obtain suitable
employees. The services in Northern Ireland are run on similar lines by the
Department of Manpower Services but there are some variations related to
the much smaller area of administration.
The main public employment services (other than the careers service) are
provided in Great Britain by the MSC’s employment service division, the
principal aim of which is to provide a comprehensive service for employers
needing staff and for people, whether or not already in employment, seeking
jobs. It operates through a network of nearly 1,000 local employment offices
and ‘jobcentres’, which handle the full range of occupations and deal with
full-time, part-time and temporary vacancies. Employment offices are being
replaced by jobcentres which provide self-service facilities in addition to other
services.
Though use of the service by both employers and job-seekers is voluntary,
in the year to March 1978 over 5-8 million people registered for employment,
2-4 million vacancies were notified and i-6 million were placed in employment.
Special employment services include services to the disabled, occupational
guidance, services to assist the geographical mobility of workers, Professional
and Executive Recruitment and the Careers Service.
The public employment service has long provided a resettlement service to
disabled people. This is provided by over 500 specialised disablement resettle¬
ment officers (DROs) who also give advice on the various courses of rehabilita¬
tion or training available, and to employers on aspects of employing disabled
people and the grants available for adaptation of equipment. The DROs
administer the quota scheme which, under the Disabled Persons (Employ¬
ment) Act 1944, requires employers to include a percentage of registered
disabled people among their workforce. Employment rehabilitation is provided

at 26 centres (including one linked with a medical rehabilitation unit); in
1977 some 15,000 people attended the wide range of courses available. The
MSC also gives financial assistance to voluntary and local authority bodies
concerned with specific disabilities such as blindness, cerebral palsy and
psychiatric disorders; in 1977 more than 650 people passed through these
courses.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at ‘skillcentres’,
educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more seriously
disabled there are special residential training colleges run by voluntary organi-
stations with the help of the MSC’s training services division. Grants are
available to disabled people qualified to undertake study or training for pro¬
fessional or comparable employment.
Sheltered employment is provided for the severely disabled in Great
Britain by Remploy Ltd, a non-profit making company, and in Northern
Ireland by Ulster Sheltered Employment Ltd, a company constituted
similarly to Remploy, and by local authorities and voluntary organisations.
The MSC also works in close co-operation with the National Advisory
Council on Employment of Disabled People.
In 1977 the MSC and the Northern Ireland Department of Manpower
Services helped with the cost of providing places for over 13,000 severely
disabled people, of which approximately 2,000 were blind or partially sighted
and some 200 were trainees.
Occupational Guidance is a free advisory service available to anyone seeking
advice on changing or choosing a job. It operates through a national network
of 49 occupational guidance units, helping about 55,000 people a year. The
service is based on interviews with specially trained staff who can call on the
services of occupational psychologists if necessary.
In order to ease unemployment, particularly in the assisted areas (see p 209),
the MSC administers various grants and allowances under the Employment
Transfer Scheme to enable the unemployed, and those under threat of
redundancy, to take up jobs in other areas; the Job Search Scheme to provide
the cost of fares and subsistence in order to attend interviews and to move to
other areas temporarily to look for work; and the Key Workers Scheme, which
helps people who move temporarily or permanently to occupy key posts in
establishments set up by their employers in assisted areas.
Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER) provides a specialist employ¬
ment service at managerial, professional, scientific and technical levels. It is
organised separately from the rest of the MSC and operates through a network
of 36 offices staffed by experienced consultants. PER has a computer-assisted
matching and selection system but also offers an interviewing service and an
advertising service. The service is free to candidates while employers are
charged a fee on all successful placings based on the starting salary. A broadly
similar service, free to both employers and candidates, is operated in Northern
Ireland.
Local education authorities have a statutory obligation under the Employ¬
ment and Training Act 1973 to provide a careers service, a vocational guidance
service for people attending all educational institutions (except universities)
and an employment service for those leaving them. Authorities also provide
an employment service for people, especially young people, in their early
years at work. There is close co-operation with the MSC’s employment service
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
division which also caters for those who have left school and choose to use its
facilities in preference to those of the careers service.
In Northern Ireland the careers service is an integral part of the Depart¬
ment of Manpower Services.
The Careers and Occupational Information Centre (COIC) publishes a
wide range of material to help people looking for jobs to make an informed
choice, and distributes careers literature to some 15,000 schools, careers
offices and other centres.
In general, people coming to Britain for employment (including Common¬
wealth citizens who do not have the right of abode, see p 12, but excluding
nationals of European Community countries and Gibraltar) need a work
permit issued by the Department of Employment. This must be applied for
by the prospective employer for a specific person and is issued for a specific
job and for a fixed initial period not exceeding 12 months in the first instance.
People admitted as holders of work permits may change their jobs only with the
approval of the Department of Employment. Normally further leave to remain
will be given on application to the Home Office if they remain in approved
employment. Under current immigration rules the Home Office will consider
an application to remove the conditions attached to their stay after four years
in approved employment, and if granted, a worker may change employment
without restriction. Among other conditions, work permits are issued only
for work requiring a professional qualification, skill or experience, where the
Department of Employment is satisfied that the worker is necessary and there
is no suitable resident worker to fill the post offered, and where the wages and
conditions are not less favourable than those generally available in the area for
similar work.
Permits for nursing auxiliaries and resident domestic workers in hospitals,
schools and similar establishments and private households are subject to
overall numerical limits decided annually. Permits for resident domestic
employment are issued only for unmarried people and for married couples if
they are to work in a joint post. They are not issued to those with children
under 16 years of age. Permits for nursing auxiliaries are issued only for un¬
married people without dependants.
Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals (other than nationals of
European Community countries and Gibraltar) are generally eligible for
permits on the same terms. In addition, Commonwealth citizens may be
admitted for fixed periods of training ‘on the job’ arranged in advance if they
hold trainee permits issued by the Department of Employment. Foreign
nationals may also enter Britain as holders of student employee permits for
short-term employment to enable them to improve their English and widen
their business experience.
European Community regulations establish the rights of workers to move
freely between member States (of which Britain is one, see p 71) for the
purposes of employment. European Community workers entering another
member State are entitled to be treated in the same way as nationals of that
State as regards facilities of the national employment services, pay and
working conditions, trade union rights, vocational training and retraining
facilities, access to housing and property, and social security and industrial
injury benefits. Workers who wish to remain in the United Kingdom for
longer than an initial period of six months must apply to the Home Office for
a residence permit. If they are in permanent employment the residence
permit is normally valid for five years. If the employment is temporary (that

is, for less than a year) the permit is valid for the expected duration of the
employment.
Race relations employment advisers, based in the Department of Employment’s
regional offices, provide advice and information to employers, trade unions and
other organisations with the aim of improving employment opportunities for
workers from the ethnic minorities.
In common with many other industrial countries, unemployment in Britain
has risen in the 1970s to the highest level for 40 years, though the seasonally
adjusted level fell slightly towards the end of 1977, a trend which continued
during the first half of 1978. Over recent years it has been increased by the
growth of the labour force, due mainly to larger numbers of young people and
married women seeking work.
Unemployment has been relatively low in the south-east of England, and
consistently higher in those parts of the country which have the greatest
dependence on shipbuilding, coalmining, and certain branches of the heavy
engineering and metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scotland
and Wales, and north-east England and Merseyside. The general unemploy¬
ment rate in Great Britain in July 1978 was 5-6 per cent: the areas with the
highest rates were Wales and Scotland and the north of England.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In July 1978 it was n-2 per cent of all
employees.
The Government’s programme for alleviating unemployment (which rose
particularly rapidly during 1975 and 1976) has to be viewed within the context
of a succession of measures designed to assist industrial investment and help
industry generally (see p “209). These measures have been introduced pro¬
gressively since August 1975 to check the rise in unemployment and at the
same time to safeguard and expand Britain’s industrial potential so as to
provide the base for more jobs in the medium term.
The measures include: a temporary employment subsidy for firms who agree
to defer redundancies which would otherwise have taken place; a small firms
employment subsidy for extra jobs provided by small manufacturing firms in
certain areas; a youth opportunities programme to provide a range of training
and work experience opportunities for young people; a special temporary
employment programme to provide worthwhile temporary jobs for adults who
have been unemployed for a long time; a ‘job release’ scheme to encourage
older workers, close to pensionable age, to leave work early and release jobs
for younger unemployed people; and a ‘job introduction’ scheme for disabled
people.
From April 1975 until March 1978 expenditure on the special employment
and training measures amounted to £560 million. The estimated expenditure
for these measures in 1978-79 is £530 million. It is estimated that by March
1979 some 400,000 people will be being assisted under these schemes.
The main responsibility for carrying out industrial and commercial training
lies with individual employers, but in recent years the MSC, with government
support, has evolved a comprehensive strategy to help to improve the supply
of trained manpower needed by the. economy, to provide opportunities for
individuals to acquire new skills, and to improve the efficiency and effective¬
ness of training generally. The MSC’s training services division is responsible
for putting these programmes into effect.

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are 23 industrial training boards and one industrial training com¬
mittee, covering firms employing nearly 60 per cent of all employees, which
are responsible for promoting training in their respective industries. They
receive Exchequer funds to meet their advisory service and other costs and to
enable them to pay grants to employers to encourage training activities of
national importance (supplemented, during the current economic recession,
by special grants to support craft and technician training). The boards’ five-
year strategies and short-term operating plans and budgets are agreed with
the MSC. From 1979 grant support will be subject to strengthened criteria
designed to increase the responsibility of employers for removing skill im¬
balances and securing a more flexible workforce.
The MSC also promotes training for some 11 million people employed in
industries not covered by industrial training boards, maintaining liaison with
major training organisations in this sector.
The Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) is intended to supplement the
training given in industry and commerce by providing individuals over the age
of 19 with the opportunity to acquire new skills. Training is carried out at 68
‘skillcentres’ and at many colleges and employers’ establishments. Skillcentre
courses concentrate mainly on engineering, construction and automotive
trades and those at colleges on clerical and commercial skills, but in all about
600 different courses are available in a wide range of occupations. Trainees are
paid allowances which vary with domestic responsibilities and may receive,
among other things, an earnings-related supplement, travelling expenses and
a lodging allowance. Some 78,500 adults were trained under TOPS in 1977-78.
The MSC also provides a number of other direct training services to employers.
The Training Within Industry (TWI) scheme is intended to develop the
skills of supervisors in developing leadership, instructing and communicating,
improving methods and improving safety practices. Special courses are
available for supervisors employed in offices, retail distribution and hospitals.
Courses in international trade procedures are available for staff employed in
export/import offices and (at advanced level) for customs entry clerks. Courses
in instructional techniques are available to skillcentre staff and industrial and
commercial firms at the MSC’s two instructor training colleges (one in England
and one in Scotland) and at three instructor training units attached to skill-
centres. In-plant courses are also available.
Employers are able to sponsor their own employees for refresher and up¬
grading training at skillcentres, on courses designed specifically to meet the
needs of the employer and of the employees concerned. There is also a
complementary mobile instructor service for employers, which provides
specific training for employees in their own workshops.
Training services at skillcentres and courses at instructor training colleges
are also available to trainees from overseas. These facilities are increasingly
being used by overseas governments and organisations, and in every case
programmes are structured to meet agreed training objectives.
EMPLOYMENT LAW
Britain has been a pioneer in the introduction of protective legislation for the
safety, health and welfare of employees. The determination by statute of
minimum wages, holidays and holiday pay was until recently confined in
principle to those trades and industries where the organisation of employers
Discrimination
Wage Rates
and Earnings
EMPLOYMENT 317
or workers, or both, was inadequate to negotiate collective agreements and to
ensure their observance. However, recent legislation, in particular the Employ¬
ment Protection Act 1975, provides considerable safeguards for the employee
in his terms of employment as well as working conditions. This Act also
provides machinery, under certain conditions, for enforcing the observance
of the relevant terms and conditions of employment. The Contracts of
Employment Act 1972 requires an employer to give an employee written infor¬
mation on his terms and conditions of employment, the disciplinary rules ap¬
plicable to him and the procedure available to him where he has a grievance
about his employment or is dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision relating to
him; it also lays down the right of both employers and employees to minimum
periods of notice when employment is to be terminated. Under the Redun¬
dancy Payments Acts 1965 and 1969 employees with a minimum period of
service of 104 weeks are entitled to lump-sum redundancy payments if their
jobs cease to exist (for example, because of technological improvements or
because of a fall in demand) and their employers cannot offer suitable alter¬
native work, the cost being partly met from a fund subscribed to by industry.
The Trade Union and Labour Relations Acts 1974 and 1976 give protection
against unfair dismissal by providing machinery under which an employee
may complain against an employer of unfair dismissal, and obtain reinstate¬
ment, re-engagement or compensation; and give legal support to the right to
trade union organisation by making it unfair to dismiss a person because of
his membership or participation in the activities of an independent trade
union. The Employment Protection Act 1975 improves the remedies for
unfair dismissal and extends the rights of employees regarding dismissal
and penalisation short of dismissal because of trade union membership or
activities, and payment when work is not available for reasons other than as a
result of a trade dispute. It also introduces maternity rights for women
employees which include protection from dismissal because of pregnancy,
maternity pay, and the right to return to work after confinement.
The Race Relations Act 1976 (see p 136) makes unlawful, discrimination on
grounds of colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national origin, in employ¬
ment, training and related matters. Employers may not discriminate when
recruiting workers or in their treatment of employees in regard to their terms
and conditions of employment, promotion, transfer, training and access to
other benefits, and dismissal.
The employment provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act (see p 134)
make sex discrimination unlawful in employment, training and related
matters. An employer may not discriminate between men and women either
in recruitment or in treatment of existing employees in such matters as pro¬
motion, training, transfer, benefits and facilities and dismissal. It is also
unlawful for a married person to be treated less favourably than a single person
of the same sex.
PAY, HOURS OF WORK AND HOLIDAYS
Pay for manual occupations, and increasingly for non-manual occupations, is
normally set by collective bargaining (see p 324). In a small number of indus¬
tries, legally enforceable minimum rates are set by wages councils.
Basic rates of pay vary widely, though in private industry local rates nor¬
mally exceed the rates specified in national agreements. Higher rates are
usually paid for overtime and shift work, and weekly earnings may be further
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
increased by incentive bonus schemes. Piecework, or payment-by-results, is
still common, though of declining importance as production methods in a
number of industries increasingly dictate employees’ output.
Earnings, vyage rates, retail prices, wages and
salaries 1973-78 average 1970 —100 log scale
According to the latest annual survey conducted by the Department of
Employment into earnings and hours of work, the average weekly earnings of
full-time male adult manual workers in April 1977 were, including overtime,
£71-50; while for full-time female adult manual workers they were £43-70. The
corresponding figures for non-manual workers were £88-90 and £53'8o.
Women’s earnings are thus markedly lower than those of men, partly because
on average they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at premium rates,
and partly because they tend to be concentrated in the less well-paid jobs. The
Equal Pay Act 1970 requires that a woman doing the same or broadly similar
work to a man qualifies for equal pay and conditions of employment.
Between April 1970 and April 1977 the average weekly earnings of manual
workers before tax and national insurance deductions increased by 167 per cent
for men and by 220 per cent for women. Part of the increase has been offset by

a rise in retail prices of about 140 per cent and by larger national insurance
contributions and income tax. For trends between 1973 and 1978 in earnings,
wage rates, retail prices, wages and salaries, see the diagram on p 318.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally by
annual salary paid monthly, often on a scale carrying annual increments, and
such careers generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher
remuneration. Starting salaries may be in the range of ^2,500 to £3,000 (lower
for trainees from 16-18 years of age and higher for some graduates entering
industry).
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
command salaries in the range of £10,000 to £15,000 a year gross before tax.
The posts with salaries in the range of £15,000 to £30,000 a year include those
of Cabinet Ministers, top-ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions
in government departments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of
daily newspapers, some persons outstanding in their professions and in the
higher managerial posts in industry, commerce and banking. Salaries of
chairmen of major companies exceptionally exceed £50,000 a year gross,
though highly successful people (such as star entertainers) often receive more
through fees or fixed contracts. The range of net incomes in the country as a
whole is, however, reduced by a system of progressive taxation and by
provisions for social security.
The Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income and Wealth was set up
in 1974 to examine and report on various aspects of the distribution of personal
incomes, both earned and unearned, and wealth as are referred to it by the
Government. The commission has produced six reports both on the general
state of, and trends in, income distribution, and on specific subjects such as
higher incomes and lower incomes. The Government attaches great impor¬
tance to the results of the commission’s inquiries, as a means of establishing
a sound basis for policy guidance on such matters as pay, industrial relations
and social security.
The normal working week in Britain is in the range 39-40 hours for manual
work and 37-38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually worked.
Actual hours worked in manual occupations differ from their standard hours;
in October 1977 they were 44-2 for men compared with 37-4 for women. Men
and women in non-manual occupations generally work less overtime than
manual workers.
National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for women
and young people in a number of industries or trades—the maximum, with
limited exceptions, being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day for
6-day-week workers) in premises covered by the Factories Act for adult women
over 18 and young people between 16 and 18. The employment of women and
young people at night is prohibited in industrial undertakings, except for
young men over 16 working in some continuous-process industries (subject to
certain conditions). The Department of Employment can make exemptions
from these restrictions on grounds of public interest. In general the hours of
work of adult men, or of people not working in factories, are not restricted by
statute.
Holiday entitlements are normally determined by collective agreements.
These generally provide for at least three weeks paid holiday a year. However
about one-third of manual workers covered by agreements have entitlements

Security

of four weeks. Non-manual workers generally have longer holidays than
manual workers. Additional holidays, dependent upon length of service, are
also quite common.
In addition to annual holidays, most agreements provide for bank holidays
or public holidays. In England and Wales, in addition to Christmas Day and
Good Friday, regular bank holidays take place on New Year’s Day, Easter
Monday, the last Monday in May, the last Monday in August and 26 Decem¬
ber, and there is also a holiday in respect of May Day. In Scotland public
holidays are declared locally; regular bank holidays are New Year’s Day, 2
January, Good Friday, the first Monday in May, the last Monday in May, the
first Monday in August, Christmas Day and 26 December. The English and
Welsh bank holidays apply also to Northern Ireland, where in addition St
Patrick’s Day (17 March) and 12 July are public holidays; in certain areas
the Tuesday after Easter is also a customary holiday for industry and trade.
Provision for an alternative day to be observed is made when any bank or
public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday.
A variety of additional benefits exist in varying degree. It has been estimated
that at the end of 1975 11-5 million employees were covered by occupational
pension schemes. Many employees are also covered by occupational sick pay
schemes, additional or complementary to the State schemes (see p 129). A
smaller number are covered by schemes for redundancy payments above the
statutory minimum. Such benefits are more usual among clerical and pro¬
fessional employees receiving a standard salary than among manual workers,
who have a chance to increase their pay—for example, by working overtime.
Senior members of firms may use a company car and some firms provide
profit-sharing and share-saving schemes.
Social security benefits, which include unemployment, sickness and industrial
injury benefits, are described in the Social Welfare chapter.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
The structure of industrial relations in Britain has been established mainly
on a voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly on the organisation of em¬
ployees and employers into trade unions and employers’ associations, and on
freely conducted negotiations between them at all levels. The State is ready to
provide assistance where the organisation of employees, employers, or both, is
inadequate to conduct negotiations, or where the usual methods of resolving
disagreements have failed.
For the most part, this voluntary system (supported by certain basic legal
provisions) results in good industrial relations, and the closer involvement of
the trade union movement in economic management in recent years has
resulted in a considerable reduction in the number and extent of industrial
disputes.
According to figures published by the International Labour Office covering
the mining, manufacturing, construction and transport industries, over the
ten years 1967-76 Britain lost fewer days per 1,000 employees through
industrial disputes than several other major industrial countries; moreover,
there was a considerable decline in strike activity in 1975 and 1976. Figures
for the number of strikes and the number of working days lost through
strikes in 1977 were broadly in line with Britain’s record on average over the
EMPLOYMENT
321
last ten years. The results of research carried out by the Department of
Employment and published in 1976 and 1978 show that in the period 1971-75
an average per year of 98 per cent of manufacturing plants in Britain were
free of strikes.
Northern Ireland’s industrial relations record is better than that of the rest
of Britain, with proportionately fewer disputes and working days lost through
strikes.
TRADE UNIONS In nearly all industries and occupations some workers (and in some industries
nearly all workers) are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over many years and, consequently, their form
and organisation vary considerably, as do their traditions. In the last decade or
so, trade unionism has again increased particularly among clerical, super¬
visory, technical and administrative workers. Trade unions may be organised
either by occupation (for example, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever
employed) or by industry. Some are based on a combination of both principles.
At the end of 1976 the total membership of British trade unions was 12*4
million. There were 462 unions, but nearly 80 per cent of all trade unionists
were in the 25 largest unions, each with a membership of 100,000 or over,
while only o-6 per cent were in the 250 smallest unions with under 1,000
members each.
The Certification Officer appointed under the Employment Protection Act
1975 is required to maintain a list of trade unions. To be eligible for entry on
the list a trade union must show that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the regulation of relations between
workers and employers, or between workers and employers’ associations.
Under the Employment Protection Act 1975 and other legislation, certain
rights and privileges are reserved for independent trade unions. A trade union
on the list may apply to the Certification Officer for a certificate that it is
independent, such a certificate being conclusive evidence of independence.
The central organisation of most large unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by and responsible to the annual conference of delegates
from local branches. Between conferences, councils are the highest authority of
unions, and carry out policy decisions made by conference delegates. Most
unions also have regional and district organisations. At the level of the individual
member there are local branches, covering one or more factories. Members may
attend branch meetings, make suggestions about terms and conditions of
employment, discuss the work of the union, and take part in the election of the
union’s officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered to be
entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its views on wider issues for
action by the union’s national or regional bodies. The organising of members in
individual places of work, and the negotiation of local pay agreements with
managements at the factory or plant, may be done by full-time district officials
of the union, or, increasingly, by ‘shop stewards’, who are chosen by their
fellow members in the place of work to represent them. Trade unions vary in
the degree to which shop stewards are integrated into their organisation. Where
two or more unions have members in the same workplace, shop stewards’
committees may be formed to discuss matters of common concern.
Unions often provide dispute benefit (‘strike pay’) for members involved in
official industrial action. They also provide legal advice for members who suffer
injury or contract diseases at work, and may pay members’ legal costs where a
case for compensation goes to court. Some unions pay benefits in case of illness,
accident, death and retirement (additional to those payable under the national
322
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
insurance scheme) financed out of membership contributions. Many trade
unions are affiliated to the Labour Party.
Trades Union In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the TUC, which
Congress was founded in 1868. The TUC’s objects are to promote the interests of its
affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and social conditions of
working people. Its affiliated membership comprises 115 trade unions which
together represent 11-5 million workpeople, or 93 per cent of all trade unionists
in Britain. The TUC deals with all general questions which concern trade
unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance on questions
relating to particular trades or industries.
The annual Congress convenes in September to discuss matters of concern to
trade unionists and to employees generally. It elects a General Council which
represents it between successive Congresses and is responsible for carrying out
Congress decisions, watching economic and social developments, providing
educational and advisory services to unions, and presenting to the Government
the trade union viewpoint on economic, social and industrial issues. The council
is also empowered to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain circumstances,
and uses its authority to deal with unauthorised and unconstitutional stoppages
of work, as well as official disputes.
The TUC as well as many individual unions conduct extensive educational
services for members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade
unionism and the principles and practice of industrial relations.
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through
its affiliations to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British workers’
delegation to the annual International Labour Conference.
There are eight TUC regional councils in England, based on the Govern¬
ment’s eight planning regions (see p 158) with a further similar body for Wales
known as the Wales Trades Union Council. These bodies, whose function is to
make representations to the Government’s various regional bodies, co-ordinate
the activities of trade unions in the regions and keep them in touch with the
policy of the TUC at national level.
Scotland and Scottish trade unions also have their own national central body, the Scottish
Northern Ireland Trades Union Congress (STUC), which in many respects is similar in con¬
stitution and functions to the TUC. Trade unions whose membership includes
Scottish workers may affiliate to the STUC and a number of trade unions are
in fact affiliated to both bodies. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are repre¬
sented by the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU), though the majority of trade unionists in Northern Ireland
belong to unions based in Great Britain. Almost 90 per cent of Northern
Ireland trade unionists are members of organisations affiliated to the ICTU,
while the majority belong to unions which are also affiliated to the TUC.
TUC-Labour Party The TUC-Labour Party Liaison Committee was set up in 1972 after the
Liaison Committee General Council of the TUC, the national executive committee of the Labour
Party and the parliamentary committee of the Labour Party had agreed to
establish a liaison committee to discuss policies on industrial relations and
management of the economy. In 1973 the committee reached an agreement on
the ‘social contract’ (see p 186) which was reaffirmed in July 1976.

EMPLOYERS’
ORGANISATIONS
Confederation
of British
Industry
Legal
Framework
Many employers in Britain are members of employers’ organisations, a large
number of which are wholly or partly concerned with labour matters. The
primary aims of such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and
conditions of employment, including a sound wage structure and proper
standards of safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with em¬
ployees and the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of settling
any disputes which may arise. They may also represent members’ points of
view as manufacturers or traders to the Government on commercial matters.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. A few are purely local in character or deal with a section of
an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole of an
industry. In some of the main industries there are local or regional organisations
combined into national federations, while in others, within which different
firms are engaged in making different principal products, there is a complex
structure with national and regional federations for parts of an industry as well
as for the industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 150 national employers’
organisations, which negotiate the national collective agreements for their
industry with the trade unions concerned. Many of these national organisations
belong to the CBI.
The final authority of local or small national organisations may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local organisa¬
tions or through regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council or central committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect committees and to ratify
their work. A paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the day-to-day
work of the organisation. There is usually a small working group, consisting
of senior officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent
questions and co-ordinate the work of committees. Employers’ associations (as
defined in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974) may apply to the
Certification Officer for inclusion in the list of employers’ associations main¬
tained by the officer.
The central body of employers is the CBI which deals with all matters affecting
the interests of employers and represents them nationally to the Government
and the public and also internationally, for instance, in the International
Labour Organisation and in the various institutions of the European Com¬
munity. It is also the British member of the Union of Industries of the
European Communities (UNICE) and the Business and Industry Advisory
Committee to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop¬
ment, and a member of the British national committee of the International
Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The majority of national employers’ organi¬
sations and nationalised industries and a large number of individual
companies, both large and small, belong to the CBI, whose representatives
or nominees sit on various official bodies and take part in the discussion of
matters of importance to the national economy through their membership of
the NEDC (see p 188).
The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 defines the status of trade
unions and employers’ associations and sets out certain legal requirements
which they must observe. The Act confers immunities on trade unions in
respect of actions taken in support of a trade dispute, allows peaceful picketing,

and also provides that collective agreements shall not be legally enforceable
unless they are written agreements and specifically provide for this.
The Employment Protection Act 1975 extends the rights of employees in a
number of respects and strengthens voluntary collective bargaining. The Act
placed the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) on a
statutory basis, provided for the appointment of a Certification Officer and for
the setting up of the Central Arbitration Committee; and established an
Employment Appeal Tribunal to hear appeals concerning decisions of the
Certification Officer and of industrial tribunals. (Industrial tribunals deal, in
general, with complaints from employees on infringements of individual rights
under a number of Acts concerning, for example, redundancy payments,
contracts of employment, equal pay, unfair dismissals and sex discrimination.)
Northern Ireland has a similar but separate system of industrial relations under
which certain responsibilities devolve upon the Labour Relations Agency.
Industrial relations legislation enacted in 1976 has brought the province
largely into line with similar legislation enacted in Great Britain since 1974.
In most industries terms and conditions of employment and procedures for
the conduct of industrial relations are settled by negotiation and agreement
between employers and trade unions. Whereas in the past the emphasis has
been on formal industry-wide agreements supplemented as necessary by
informal local agreements in firms or factories, a gradual change of attitude and
structure has led to increasing emphasis being placed on agreements at firm and
factory level (plant bargaining), though there have been some important
exceptions to this trend, for example in the motor industry. In some industries,
firms and factories, negotiations are conducted by meetings held when neces¬
sary, while in others, joint negotiating councils or committees have been
established on a permanent basis. The scope of the various joint bodies (from
the national joint industrial councils for whole industries to the works councils
and committees in individual workplaces) varies widely, and has frequently
been extended to cover such additional matters as production plans, absen¬
teeism, training, education and welfare (see below). Normally these arrange¬
ments for collective bargaining suffice to settle all questions which are raised,
but provision is sometimes made for matters not so settled to be referred
for settlement to independent conciliation or arbitration. The Employment
Protection Act 1975 makes provision for information needed for collective
bargaining purposes to be disclosed by employers to trade unions, subject to
certain safeguards.
Standing arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the
Government, the TUG, the CBI, and the nationalised industries through the
National Economic Development Council on matters in which employers and
workers have a common interest. The operation of collective bargaining has
from time to time been restricted in an attempt to control inflation (see p 186).
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) is charged with
the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial relations, and in
particular of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining and the
development and (where necessary) reform of collective bargaining machinery.
ACAS was placed on a statutory basis under the Employment Protection Act
in 1976, and is controlled by a council consisting of a chairman and nine
other members experienced in industrial relations, of which three are nomina¬
ted by the CBI, three by the TUC, and three are independent.
EMPLOYMENT
325
Central

Industrial
Democracy
The service may offer conciliation in industrial disputes in both the public
and private sectors of industry where this is thought to be helpful, and has
discretion in meeting requests for conciliation subject only to the need to
pay regard to -agreed procedures in the industry or area of employment
concerned.
At the joint request of the parties in dispute, and having regard to the need to
safeguard negotiating procedures, ACAS may appoint single arbitrators or
boards of arbitration to determine differences on the basis of agreed terms of
reference. Alternatively ACAS may refer cases for arbitration to the Central
Arbitration Committee (see below). Some 300 joint requests for arbitration
were made to ACAS during 1977.
Although ACAS has prime responsibility for intervention in disputes, the
Secretary of State retains powers to appoint a court of inquiry or committee of
investigation into a dispute, whether existing or foreseen.
The service gives advice on all aspects of industrial relations and personnel
management. It conducts surveys to diagnose the causes of industrial relations
problems and suggests remedial action to management and trade unions or
employee representatives. It also carries particular responsibility for attempting
conciliation on complaints of infringement of individual employee rights (such
as individual complaints of unfair dismissal, complaints under the Equal Pay
Act 1970 and complaints on employment matters under the Sex Discrimination
Act 1975).
The service is concerned with the long-term improvement of collective
bargaining and, with the consent of the parties involved, conducts detailed
inquiries in particular firms or industries. It also considers claims by in¬
dependent trade unions that they should be recognised by an employer.
The Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) is a permanent body for the
settlement of disputes by voluntary arbitration. Disputes may be referred to
the CAC by ACAS at the joint request of the employers and trade unions con¬
cerned.
The committee is also called upon to arbitrate on claims made under various
Acts, including the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Employment Protection Act
1975, and acts as the independent tribunal to which the Secretary of State for
Employment refers questions relating to the payment of wages and conditions
of employment observed by Government contractors.
The need for better communication between management and workers has
led to movement towards greater industrial democracy, that is, towards
enabling workers to have a more decisive voice in the way in which their
firms are run. There are worker directors in certain nationalised industries
and public corporations; moreover, some private sector companies have long
had a system of works councils, while others are conducting experiments in
greater worker participation in one form or another.
In May 1978 the Government published a White Paper giving its views on
the majority recommendations of the report of the Committee of Inquiry on
industrial democracy (the Bullock report, see Bibliography, p 449) that,
among other things, employees should have a right to representation on the
boards of management of companies with 2,000 or more employees, follow¬
ing an application for such representation from a recognised trade union and
confirmation by a ballot of all employees. The White Paper proposes that
employees in companies employing 500 or more people in Britain should have
a statutory right to have all major proposals of the company affecting them
326 BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
discussed with their representatives before decisions are taken; but that the
development of industrial democracy should otherwise proceed on a step-by-
step basis.
Public While industrial relations in government service and in the nationalised indus-
Authorities tries are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry,
there are some special features.
Central and Local
Government
Nationalised
Industries
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are dealt with by the Civil Service Department, are
permitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service unions
and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by
means of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils. Unresolved
disputes may, subject to certain limitations, be reported to the Secretary of
State for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an independent
body appointed by the Secretary of State. Government industrial employees
are similarly encouraged to belong to trade unions and machinery exists for
joint consultation. There are four Trades Joint Councils on which representa¬
tives of the Government and the trade unions sit to consider pay and conditions
of employment affecting individual grades and certain other limited matters.
A Joint Co-ordinating Committee, on which the Government and Trades
Joint Councils are represented, deals with national pay negotiations, conditions
of service and other matters of general application. In the main employing
departments there are departmental joint councils for the discussion of
domestic matters. Disputes on wages or conditions of employment that cannot
be resolved by the existing machinery can be referred to the Central Arbitration
Committee.
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils for the
main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical employees)
which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other matters. There
are corresponding regional and district councils.
The major nationalised industries have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining and for joint consultation with their
employees. Unlike firms in the private sector, the corporations are not usually
members of employers’ associations (although the majority are public sector
members’ of the CBI). In some industries they are sole or main employers, but
even where part of the industry is in private hands, as for example in road
transport, the corporations are separately and directly represented on wage¬
negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of management and trade unions
at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local bodies,
similarly representative, to deal with local issues but not normally to negotiate
separate local agreements. Most of the industries use the facilities for arbitra¬
tion offered to industry generally by the ACAS, but coalmining and rail
transport have their own special arrangements. Consultation at all levels,
including the workplace, has been arranged in all the nationalised industries.
Office of
Manpower
Economics
The Office of Manpower Economics, established in 1971 as an independent
non-statutory body, acts as secretariat for the three review bodies set up to
advise on the remuneration of certain groups in the public sector for which
negotiating machinery is not appropriate, such as chairmen and members of
boards of nationalised industries, the higher judiciary and senior civil

servants; the armed forces; and doctors and dentists. It also services special
inquiries on particular pay structures and related problems.
In a number of industries and trades where the organisation of employers or
employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis for successful
voluntary arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating bodies, known as
wages councils. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of
employers and employees in the respective sectors of industry, with three
independent members. Wages councils publish proposals for minimum
remuneration, holidays, holiday remuneration and other terms and conditions
of employment. After considering any representations the councils make
orders giving statutory force to such proposals. The Department of Employ¬
ment’s Wages Inspectorate enforces the provisions of these wages orders.
About 2-8 million workers are covered by such arrangements.
Agricultural wages boards (there are boards for England and Wales and for
Scotland) perform similar functions in relation to employment in agriculture.
The Secretary of State for Employment has power to convert a wages
council into a statutory joint industrial council (SJIC), a body which functions
in the same way as a wages council, except that it has no independent mem¬
bers. Such conversion is intended to assist in the development of collective
bargaining, an SJIC being seen as a halfway stage between the statutory
system and full voluntary collective bargaining.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Employers have a duty at common and criminal law to take reasonable care of
their employees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a
duty of care towards each other and also to take care for their own safety. In
addition, minimum required standards of safety in certain kinds of workplaces
or work are laid down under a number of statutes; some of these also deal with
health and welfare. The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 reorganised
the system under which safety and health at work was safeguarded and exten¬
ded it to cover everyone at work and to further the protection of the general
public from industrial hazards.
The Health and Safety Commission, appointed by the Secretary of State for
Employment after consultation with the TUC, CBI and local authorities, has
responsibility for supervising the application and enforcement of health and
safety legislation. Its operational arm is the Health and Safety Executive, con¬
sisting largely of the government inspectorates covering factories, mines and
quarries, agriculture, explosives, nuclear installations and alkali works; the
Employment Medical Advisory Service; and the Health and Safety Labora¬
tories, which include the Safety in Mines Research Establishment.
The basic obligations laid down in the Act are supported by ministerial
powers to make regulations dealing with a wide range of health and safety
matters. Regulations will be supplemented where appropriate by codes of
practice approved by the commission, and by guidance notes and other codes.
In particular the Act gives inspectors the power to issue improvement and
prohibition notices, which enable them to require practical improvements to
be made within a specified time or to require preventive measures immediately
without first having to obtain a court order. There are provisions for appeals
to industrial tribunals against such notices.

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Safety
Regulations
Other Measures
About 207,000 industrial premises (factories, warehouses, shipyards, docks and
construction sites) are regulated under the Factories Act 1961, which is enforced
mainly by the Factory Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive.
Likewise about 770,000 premises are subject to the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act 1963, whose enforcement is shared by the Factory Inspectorate
and the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate (also part of the new Executive), the
Railway Inspectorate (see below) and local authorities.
The Acts and regulations made under them are designed to secure the health,
safety and welfare of employees, and deal with such matters as the fencing of
machinery; precautions against the exposure of people to toxic gases and dusts;
precautions against fire, dangerous substances and special risks; the safe
condition of premises; and cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventilation.
They also contain provisions concerning the employment of women. Anyone
intending to employ other people in industrial or commercial premises to
which either the Factories Act or the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises
Act applies has to notify the enforcing authority of his intention and there is a
statutory duty to report every accident which is either fatal or causes more than
three days’ incapacity. The Factories Act includes provisions for the com¬
pulsory notification and investigation of certain types of dangerous occurrence.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and
quarries, agriculture and transport (including aviation and shipping,
the responsibility of the Department of Trade). As with the Factories Act
these other provisions are, with some exceptions, enforced through inspec¬
torates—the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, the Agricultural Inspectorate,
and the Railway Inspectorate of the Department of Transport. Safety require¬
ments in all other places of work including hotels, places of entertainment and
educational establishments but excluding domestic work in the home, are
covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act or (in respect of their
offices and shops) by the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, while fire
authorities are responsible for general fire precautions and means of escape.
The Health and Safety Executive, through its Nuclear Installations Inspec¬
torate, is the authority concerned with the granting of nuclear site licences for
commercial nuclear installations. No such installation may be constructed or
operated in Britain without a licence granted by the executive under sections
of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 which are relevant statutory provisions
under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. Conditions attached to such
licences in the interests of safety are imposed and enforced by the inspectorate.
The Health and Safety Commission also has responsibility under the
Mineral Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 and the Petroleum and
Submarine Pipelines Act 1975 for the health and safety of all persons (in¬
cluding divers) engaged in the offshore oil and gas industry.
Transport operators and ministries concerned with road and air travel give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every effort is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities by im¬
proving the design of vehicles and transport equipment, by control of standards
of maintenance, by traffic regulations and by training crews in safety awareness.
To minimise the hazards which may arise from the use of pesticides, a
voluntary scheme has been established under which pesticides are vetted by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s Advisory Committee on
Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals (see p 168) before being marketed. The
committee gives clearance for specific uses, subject to its recommendations on
such matters as safety precautions and labelling being agreed to.

Training and
Research in
Safety
There are also the Health and Safety Laboratories, which are concerned
with research into health and safety problems in industry (see p 382).
Legislation forbids any employment of children under 14 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of children who have not reached
the statutory minimum school-leaving age (now 16); of women and young
people underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations (for
example, certain processes connected with lead manufacture); and of women in
factories and workshops within four weeks after childbirth. It also limits and
defines the permissible hours of employment for women and young people.
The Health and Safety Commission encourages the development of voluntary
central organisation within each industry at national level for the considera¬
tion of safety matters and the formulation of policy and accident prevention.
Its inspectorates, besides inquiring into notified accidents and safety aspects
of machine design and specification, circulate expert advice to both sides of
industry and to the general public, and maintain a health and safety centre in
London, at which various types of guards for machinery are displayed, as well
as a wide range of protective clothing and equipment. Regulations coming
into force in October 1978 provide that recognised trade unions may appoint
safety representatives to represent the employees in a workplace; also, two or
more such representatives may make a written request to the employer to
establish a safety committee, which must then be set up within three months
of the request being made.
Organisations in industry participate also in joint standing and advisory
committees appointed by the Secretary of State for Employment, but these
arrangements are being superseded. The Health and Safety Commission has
appointed four major advisory committees in addition to the Committee on
Major Hazards set up in 1975; these include one on asbestos, one on toxic
substances, one on dangerous substances and one on medical matters. Pro¬
posals have also been made for the appointment of 18 industry-based com¬
mittees, four of which have already been set up. The Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and the British Safety Council are national
bodies concerned with accident prevention and sponsor a number of local
accident prevention groups.
Training is important in accident prevention and the Manpower Services
Commission provides a course in job safety for supervisors in its Training
Within Industry scheme (see p 316). The industrial training boards include
specific provisions for safety training in their training recommendations.
RoSPA provides a variety of safety courses for special needs, mainly at its
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham, and also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing publicity and organising conferences; its
regional industrial safety officers work to promote safety activity among top-
level managers. The British Safety Council also offers safety training courses.
Other courses are organised by local accident prevention groups and organisa¬
tions such as the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities and
other academic bodies, and government research organisations into problems of
guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards, nuclear
safety, protective personal equipment, construction methods, fires and ex¬
plosions, psychological factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in
particular sectors of industry. Industrial research associations include among

their more purely economic research projects the improvement of working
conditions and the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board conducts courses of safety training for workmen
and officials. Its research programme includes a number of projects with a direct
bearing on safety. In addition, the Health and Safety Executive has a statutory
responsibility for research concerning the safety and health of coal miners,
largely exercised through its Safety in Mines Research Establishment.
The University of Aston in Birmingham helps to meet the need for academic¬
ally trained safety officers and engineers whose careers will be concerned with
the technical aspects of insurance and forensic work.
The Employment Medical Advisory Service (EMAS), set up under the Employ¬
ment Medical Advisory Service Act 1972 and now part of the Health and Safety
Executive, provides a nation-wide service of advice on the medical aspects of
employment problems to employers, employees, trade unions, doctors and
others. It carries out medical examinations of workers in hazardous occupa¬
tions and surveys of employment hazards, advises the staff of the Manpower
Services Commission on medical aspects of job placement, rehabilitation and
industrial training and co-operates with school medical officers and careers
officers in helping to solve the employment problems of handicapped school
leavers. The service, headed by the Health and Safety Executive’s Director of
Medical Services, has over 100 employment medical advisers based in the
country’s main industrial centres. The TUC, the CBI and other interested
organisations are associated with the work of the service through advisory
committees.
The Occupational Medicine and Hygiene Laboratories (which are part of the
Health and Safety Laboratories, see p 327) at Cricklewood, north London,
provide laboratory services and undertake research in the field of occupational
health. Among other things these laboratories assist EMAS in the analysis of
blood and urine samples; while the Factory Inspectorate also looks to the
laboratories as a main source of laboratory assistance.
Research facilities are provided by government agencies such as the Medical
Research Council; by university faculties of industrial health and social
medicine; and by the research departments of various industries and large
industrial concerns. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory
Inspectorate, which has specialised technical branches, and by the EMAS.
Many employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their employees
over and above the statutory requirements. The big employers, including the
State and the boards of nationalised industries, have taken the lead but a
number of smaller factories also provide medical services and in a few cases
have joined together in group medical services.
An increasing number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational facilities.
Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become
usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Many offices and
shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff have adopted
luncheon voucher schemes.
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting better
human relationships in industry. The Government has sought to extend by
research the available knowledge of the factors influencing human relations in
EMPLOYMENT
331
industry and human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or conducted by the
Social Science Research Council (see p 375) and the Medical Research
Council (see p 373). In addition, the Department of Employment’s Work
Research Unit provides information on how particular jobs can be redesigned
to create greater satisfaction, helps industry and others in initiating and
evaluating changes in the content of work, and administers a research pro¬
gramme. Voluntary organisations include bodies which deal with management
problems and provide a service to subscribing firms; professional associations,
linking individuals with a common interest in particular functions of manage¬
ment; and bodies providing specialist services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
Safety, Health
and Welfare
in Northern
Ireland
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been the
subject of legislation which is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland)
1965 and the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. A number
of firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and industrial safety groups,
supported by representatives of industry, insurance companies and public
authorities, make a valuable contribution to accident prevention.
Legislation for Northern Ireland in line with the Health and Safety at
Work etc. Act 1974 (see p 327) has been passed and will come into effect
during 1979.
17 Finance
PUBLIC
EXPENDITURE
Planning and
Control of Public
Expenditure
THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Public expenditure comprises the current and capital expenditure of central
government and local authorities (collectively known as general government),
excluding expenditure charged to the operating account of trading bodies;
central government finance in the form of grants, loans or public dividend
capital provided towards the cost of capital investment by the nationalised
industries; the capital expenditure of other public corporations; the con¬
tingency reserve; and those debt interest payments which constitute a charge
on taxation. Public expenditure, excluding debt interest, in 1977-78 amounted
to about £54,300 million (at 1977 Survey prices) of which 70 per cent was
undertaken by the central Government; and 28 per cent by local authorities,
the remaining 2 per cent representing the capital expenditure of public
corporations other than the nationalised industries.
The wide range of functions and purposes of this expenditure and its
distribution is shown in Table 22.
The social services programmes accounted for nearly 53 per cent of the
total programmes, and defence expenditure for about 12 per cent.
Out of the total public expenditure of £56,220 million in 1977-78 some
£32,372 million or 58 per cent was spent by the public sector directly on goods
and services (wages and salaries, other current expenditure on goods and
services, gross domestic fixed capital formation and stocks). Transfer pay¬
ments to individuals, companies and other institutions in the private sector
(for example, social security payments, capital grants, subsidies, and debt
interest) made up the balance. Unlike public authorities’ direct purchases of
goods and services, transfer payments do not represent a direct demand on
the nation’s resources. The gross sums transferred create a proportionately
lower indirect demand for goods and services because of taxes paid and savings
made by the recipients.
Between 1972-73 and 1977-78 total public expenditure programmes grew
in real terms by about 5-3 per cent. The growth previously envisaged in the
expenditure programme after 1976-77 was reduced to make possible a shift
of resources into industrial investment and exports. The low level of economic
activity led to further downward adjustments to the medium-term expendi¬
ture plans during 1976. The improvement in Britain’s financial situation in
1977, however, enabled the Government to plan for resumed expansion of
many expenditure programmes including an addition of £1,000 million to the
plans for 1978-79. The Government has also stated its aim of having a greater
degree of stability in public spending than has been achieved in recent years.
Major importance is attached to adequate planning and control of public
expenditure. There are three principal and interdependent ways in which
this is done. First, the annual public expenditure survey, which leads to the
publication of a report describing the Government’s medium-term expendi¬
ture plans on a constant price basis; secondly, the Supply Estimates by means
of which Parliament votes the cash required to run certain central government
services in the coming financial year; and thirdly, the system of cash limits

under which, for the financial year immediately ahead, the volume of expendi¬
ture at constant prices shown in the survey plans is translated into cash pro¬
vision which will not normally be exceeded. These arrangements are described
in more detail below.

Each year a survey is made of the whole range of projected public expenditure
covering the period five years ahead. It is carried out by officials in the
Treasury and other government departments, under the direction of the
Public Expenditure Survey Committee.
The primary purpose of the survey is to present to ministers an up-to-date
assessment of the cost of their existing policies and proposed changes as a
basis for decisions about the total and the composition of public expenditure
in the five-year period covered. This gives the Government the opportunity
to plan ahead any necessary changes without causing wasteful disruption in
existing services, and to have regard to the overall economic outlook when
taking decisions.
A report on the survey is prepared in the first half of the year. This is
followed by ministerial consideration of the report and then by the publication

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of the Government’s public expenditure plans (see Bibliography, p 450).
This provides the basis for an annual public expenditure debate in the House
of Commons. The plans contain a contingency reserve to provide for additions
to the programmes set out. This has been developed into a more operational
instrument, as one of the means of securing that actual expenditure is kept
within the plans. The object is, as far as possible, to limit claims on the reserve
by meeting the cost of new measures, or increased estimates for existing
measures, within existing departmental totals. Recourse to the reserve to meet
additional expenditure is subject to the approval of Treasury ministers, who
may refer the larger or more difficult claims for consideration by the Cabinet
as a whole.
Each department submits its estimates of cash requirements to the Treasury
in the December before the financial year beginning on the following 1
April. Estimates cover central Government’s own expenditure. (Not all
this expenditure is classified as public expenditure—for example, payments to
local authorities. Only when the money is spent by the local authorities is public
expenditure recorded.) After they have been approved by the Treasury, the
Supply Estimates are presented to Parliament shortly before the Budget (see
p 335) and are approved by Parliament for one year ahead, by means of an
annual Appropriation Act, in July (expenditure to this date from 1 April is
covered by a Vote on Account approved by Parliament before the beginning of
the financial year). There are 29 allotted days (known as supply days) in each
session on which the choice of subject for debate rests with the Opposition
and on which estimates can be debated. Broad issues of policy are normally
discussed.
Certain expenditures are not approved annually, but are covered by Acts
of Parliament allowing payments to continue from one year to another and are
paid direct from the Consolidated Fund. These include the financial provision
for members of the royal family, and salaries and pensions of judges. The
Consolidated Fund, into which tax revenue and other receipts are paid,
finances most of the Government’s expenditure; its balance is held in the
Exchequer account at the Bank of England. The National Loans Fund covers
most of the Government’s domestic lending and borrowing, and is operated
as an official account at the Bank of England. The two funds deal only with
sterling receipts and payments; official dealings in foreign exchange are carried
out by the Exchange Equalisation Account (see p 343).
Cash limits, first introduced on an extensive scale in 1976-77, have been
applied to public spending wherever they can make a useful contribution to
financial discipline. They also contribute to the Government’s policy for
reducing inflation and help in forecasting the Government’s maximum
financing requirements. About half of public expenditure is covered by cash
limits. Certain services such as social security payments are excluded because,
once policy and rates of payment have been determined, cash spending in the
short term depends on factors outside the Government’s direct control. Cash
limits are also placed on the financial assistance given to local authorities by
central Government and on local authority capital expenditure. The estimates
of the financing requirements of the nationalised industries are also treated
as a form of cash limit.
Spending departments and authorities are required to provide within their
cash limits for any increase in costs due to pay and price changes. The cash
limits for 1978-79 were published in April 1978 (see Bibliography, p 450).

Expenditure by government departments is monitored by the d reasury and

the financial year in accordance with the approved Public Expenditure Survey,
Supply Estimate and cash limit provisions.
The Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the Crown and his
independence of the Executive is secured by specific statutory provisions.
Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller he ensures that all
revenues and other public money payable to the Consolidated Fund and the
National Loans Fund are duly paid over and that all issues from these funds
are authorised by statute; and as Auditor General he audits departmental and
other accounts and, as required by statute, submits his reports on Appro¬
priation Accounts and other accounts to Parliament. For many years and with
the encouragement of the Public Accounts Committee (see below) his
statutory audit functions have been extended to include general financial
administration, cost-effectiveness and cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The House of Commons Select Committee on Expenditure considers papers
on public expenditure and estimates presented to the House. As part of its
activities it examines ministers and senior officials, and questions whether the
policies underlying the planning figures may be carried out more economically;
and examines critically the form and content of the Public Expenditure Plans
and Estimates. The Committee’s reports provide information for the House
for its debate on public expenditure. The Committee operates by means of
sub-committees which cover, for example, general government financial
control and the efficient execution of government policies; and individual
public expenditure programmes such as defence and external affairs, educa¬
tion and social services. The sub-committees are able to call for oral and written
evidence from departmental ministers and officials; they also take evidence
from witnesses outside central government. The committee is appointed for
the life of a Parliament.
The Public
Accounts
Committee
THE BUDGET
The accounts of each department and the reports of the Comptroller and
Auditor General upon them are considered by a House of Commons select
committee called the Public Accounts Committee. This was established in
1861 to ensure that expenditure was properly incurred in accordance with
the purposes for which it was voted and with the relevant Acts of Parliament.
The committee’s terms of reference are simply that it must examine and
report upon the accounts laid before Parliament and these terms are widely
interpreted. Successive committees have investigated whether full value has
been obtained for the sums spent by departments and have reported in detail
on cases in which administration appeared faulty or negligent. The committee
has become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste or inefficiency.
It embodies its findings in regular reports to Parliament and its recommenda¬
tions are given serious consideration by departments. The Government’s
formal reply to these reports is presented to Parliament by the Treasury in the
form of a Treasury Minute, and the reports and the Minute are made the
subject of an annual debate in the House of Commons.
The Budget (an old word which meant a bag containing papers or accounts)
is a set of proposals, usually put forward in March or April, for financing
government expenditure. Supplementary budgetary measures may also be
introduced at other times of the year. The proposals are described by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget speech, against the background of
336
Public Sector
Accounts
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a statement of the Government’s past and prospective revenue and expendi¬
ture, and his assessment of the position and prospects of the economy.
The Budget speech is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means
resolutions, in which the proposals are embodied. These resolutions, when
passed by the House, become the foundation of the Finance Act, which
expresses the proposals in statutory form.
A major function of the Budget is to act as an instrument of economic
management, and the Budget statement is normally the main occasion for a
review of general economic policy. The scale of public expenditure and taxa¬
tion has an important influence on the general level of output and distribution
of resources. The Budget judgment is therefore concerned with the balance
between the total of goods and services which are likely to be available to the
nation and the total claims which are likely to be made on them. Through taxa¬
tion the Government can exert a considerable influence on the demand for
goods and services; its measures can also have a broader influence on the
pattern of demand and the long-term performance of the economy.
The Budget deals with the means of financing expenditure and particularly
with changes in taxation and not primarily with expenditure itself. On occa¬
sions, changes affecting expenditure, such as increases in pensions and family
allowances, have been announced in the Budget statement as have financial
and monetary measures such as changes in exchange control policies. Such
measures, however, are not generally reflected in the resolutions or the
Finance Act but are applied by the appropriate procedure, that is, separate
legislation, statutory instruments or administrative action.
The scope of the Budget and that of the Finance Act which follows it are
different although they are closely interrelated. The Budget is essentially
concerned with the measures that give effect to the Chancellor’s decision to
increase or reduce to an appropriate extent the predicted level of demand on
economic resources by use of the instruments at his disposal, and especially
by increasing or reducing the yield of central government taxes. The tax
changes proposed on the basis of the Budget judgment are enacted in the form
approved by Parliament in the Finance Act, which also provides the annual
opportunity for non-Budgetary changes in the tax system and for certain other
financial matters, such as provisions relating to Government borrowing.
The bulk of the taxation proposals in the Budget are concerned with changes
in the rates or coverage of existing taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the
abolition of existing ones, and changes in the administrative machinery relating
to taxation. In two cases (income tax and corporation tax), however, annual
Ways and Means resolutions followed by a Finance Act clause are necessary
to maintain the taxes in existence at all, since they are annual taxes. Thus a
Budget at or about the beginning of each financial year is a necessity.
New taxes and changes in certain existing taxes, like other changes in statute
law, do not come into effect until the appropriate Bill—in this case the
Finance Bill—has received Royal Assent (in the case of the spring Budget,
normally about the end of July) or at some other date laid down in the Bill.
Some changes, however, come into effect earlier, usually from Budget Day or
from the start of the tax year, under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act.
This enables the Government to collect certain taxes provisionally, income
tax for example, either at the rates previously in operation or at new rates
following the passing of the appropriate Ways and Means resolutions.
The economic background to the spring Budget and the transactions of the
central government and the public sector as a whole are presented in the
FINANCE
337
SOURCES
REVENUE
Financial Statement and Budget Report (see Bibliography, p 450) which is laid
before the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when
he presents the Budget. The report is in three parts: the economic context
of the Budget; the accounts of the public sector for the past financial year
and the one immediately ahead; and the accounts of the central government
for the same two years. The accounts are designed to assist in assessing the
impact of changes in revenue and public expenditure on the economy.
The accounts of the public sector show the transactions of the central
government, local authorities, nationalised industries and other public cor¬
porations combined into a consolidated account covering the whole of the
public sector. The transactions within the public sector cancel out on consoli¬
dation and the net balance on the consolidated account represents therefore the
borrowing which is required by the public sector from the private and overseas
sectors.
The accounts of the central government show transactions both on the
conventional cash basis of Exchequer accounting and in accordance with the
framework of the national income accounts.
To raise the money it requires over and above tax revenue the Government
offers a great variety of claims on itself designed to attract different types of
lender. Broadly there is marketable debt, and non-marketable debt. Market¬
able debt is made up of short-term floating debt consisting of Treasury bills,
and funded or longer-term debt made up of government securities which are
of varying maturities and publicly quoted on the Stock Exchange. Non-
marketable debt comprises the various forms of national savings designed to
attract the smaller saver; certificates of tax deposits; and ways and means
advances, which basically is very short-term internal government borrowing.
The bulk of public corporations’ borrowing is met by central government
through the National Loans Fund, although public corporations’ temporary
borrowing needs are met largely from the market under Treasury guarantee.
That part of local authority borrowing met by central government is dealt
with through the Public Works Loan Board which has recourse to the
National Loans Fund. The local authorities also borrow directly from the
market, both short-term and long-term, through a range of different invest¬
ments. Some public corporations also borrow, under special statutory power
and with Treasury consent, in foreign currencies.
After allowing for the changes introduced by the Budget of April 1978 the
central government’s borrowing requirement for 1978-79 was expected to be
£7,957 million, compared with an estimated outturn of £4,494 million in
i977-?8 and that for the public sector as a whole £8,537 million compared
with an estimated £5,713 million in 1977-78.
Table 23 shows total revenue from taxation and other sources in 1977-78
and the forecasts for 1978-79 together with the effects of the Budget changes.
OF The three principal sources of tax revenue are first, taxes on income, which
include income tax and corporation tax; second, taxes on capital, which in¬
clude capital transfer tax and capital gains tax; and third, taxes on expenditure
(including taxes on the ownership or use of certain assets)—these include
protective and excise duties, value added tax (VAT), the National Insurance
Surcharge, local rates (see p 67), stamp duties and licence duties (for example,
on motor vehicles). Taxes on individual (but not corporate) incomes are
progressive in that larger incomes bear a proportionately higher rate of tax.
The Board of Inland Revenue assesses and collects the taxes on income and
capital and the stamp duties; the Board of Customs and Excise collects the

remainder.
Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6 April. The
rates of tax introduced in the Finance Act 1978 are as follows: a new lower tax

total income less deductions and personal allowances) with up to a further
£750 if there are wife’s earnings, after which a basic rate of 33 per cent is
charged on the balance of taxable income of up to £8,000, 40 per cent on the
£8,00i-£9,000 band of taxable income and thereafter the rate for successive
bands rises generally in steps of 5 per cent until a maximum rate of 83 per cent
is reached at a level of over £24,000 of taxable income. These rates are
charged on both earned and investment incomes. Investment incomes are also
liable to a surcharge on the amount by which they exceed £1,700 (£2,500 for
the elderly); the surcharge is 10 per cent on the first £55° °f investment
income (£500 for the elderly) above the relevant threshold and 15 per cent on
the remainder. The tax imposed on an individual is graduated by means of
personal allowances and reliefs. In general, married couples receive higher
allowances than a single person. Husband and wife may choose to have the
wife’s earnings charged separately for tax on condition that the former receives
the single instead of the married personal allowance. But even then the married
couple are taxed jointly on their investment income.
For 1978-79 a single person earning £5,000 a year pays £1,264-95 in income
tax, while a married man with the same earned income pays £1,083-45; if he
has two children under the age of 11 and his earnings plus child benefits total
£5,000 his tax falls to £929-27. The amount of tax payable by a single person
varies from, for example, £274-95 on an earned income of £2,000 a year to
£9,091-25 on an earned income of £20,000.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay as
You Earn’) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons resident in the
United Kingdom. Interest on certain United Kingdom government-securities
belonging to persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is exempt.
The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many countries pro¬
viding for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are not in force
unilateral relief is allowed.
Companies pay corporation tax at a single rate on all their profits, whether
distributed or not. Only a proportion of any capital gains is included in total
profits, with the result that chargeable gains as a whole are subject to a
lower effective rate of tax. Income tax is not deducted from dividends but a
company which distributes profits to its shareholders is required to make to
the Inland Revenue an advance payment of corporation tax. In general, this
payment is set against a company’s corporation tax bill and the recipient of the
distribution in respect of which the advance payment was made is entitled to a
tax credit, which satisfies the liability to income tax at the basic rate.
The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the Budget for the past
financial year; for the financial year 1977 (1 April 1977-31 March 1978) it
is 52 per cent with a reduced rate of 42 per cent for small companies (as
defined in the Finance Acts 1972, 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1978). The tax is
assessed on the profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate for
the financial year in which the accounting period falls. Where an accounting
period straddles 31 March the profits are apportioned on a time basis. Relief is
given by an interim scheme for the rise in the value of stocks and work in
progress due solely to inflation between the beginning and the end of each
accounting period. The form of a permanent scheme will be considered when

the outcome of the current debate on inflation accounting becomes clear and
its methods have been reviewed in practice. Meanwhile legislation is planned
for introduction in 1979 which would limit the build up of deferred tax
liabilities.
Under the Oil Taxation Act 1975 a petroleum revenue tax of 45 per cent
(deducted in computing profits for corporation tax) is charged on profits from
the winning, as opposed to refining or other form of processing, of hydro¬
carbons under licence in Britain and on its continental shelf. The Government
proposes to increase petroleum revenue tax to 60 per cent on 1 January 1979.
Each licensee of an oilfield is to be charged on the profits for that field, com¬
puted for half-yearly periods.
A comprehensive tax, capital transfer tax, applies to transfer of personal
wealth in three main areas: lifetime gifts; transfers on death; and transfers
relating to settled property (that is, any property held in trust). The tax is
chargeable in respect of a person’s lifetime transfers as they occur and on a
cumulative basis. The final stage of cumulation is the inclusion of the property
‘passing’ on an assumed transfer of the whole of the deceased’s estate immedi¬
ately before the death. The rates of tax applicable are progressively higher on
successive slices of the cumulative total of chargeable transfers, with a lower
scale of tax for lifetime transfers than for transfers on death. Under both scales
the first £25,000 of transfers is exempt; the rates on the remainder rise from
5 per cent on the slice between £25,000 and £30,000 to 75 per cent on the
excess over £2-oi million for lifetime transfers and from 10 per cent on the
slice between £25,000 and £30,000 to 75 per cent on the excess over £2-01
million for transfers on death.
Capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax
or, in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax is normally
30 per cent, but in the case of individuals may be less, depending on their
circumstances. For small businesses the tax on gifts and certain deemed
disposals of business assets may be deferred until the assets are sold. Certain
assets may be exempt from tax, including the principal private residence,
chattels worth less than £2,000 (and any chattels, except those used for the
purpose of a trade, with a predictable life of less than 50 years), private motor
cars and National Savings Certificates. An individual is exempt from capital
gains tax where the total net gains do not exceed £1,000 in any year; where
the gains do not exceed £5,000, the excess over £1,000 is charged at a reduced
rate of 15 per cent; where the gains exceed £5,000, liability is limited to tax
of £600 plus half of the excess over £5,000. This marginal relief runs out at
£9,500. In addition, the gains on gilt-edged securities are exempt from the
tax if the securities were held for more than 12 months.
The Development Land Tax Act 1976 introduced a development land tax
(DLT) on development value in place of the charge on development gains
and on first letting introduced in the Finance Act 1974. The rate of DLT is
80 per cent but the first £10,000 of development value realised in any financial
year is completely exempt and for a transitional period up to 31 March 1980
the next £150,000 in any financial year will be liable at a rate of 66-6 per cent.
Exemptions from DLT include the sale or development of owner-occupied
residences.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the
Board of Customs and Excise namely, VAT, car tax and the excise duties on

tobacco, hydrocarbon oil and alcoholic drinks and betting and gaming, and
the protective duties, chargeable as Community customs duty in accordance
with the EEC Common Customs Tariff (no such duties are chargeable on
goods which qualify as Community goods). These taxes are usually referred
to as indirect taxes since they are normally paid by the importer, manufac¬
turer, or wholesaler, who adjusts the prices charged to customers accordingly.
All the excise duty goods (other than hydrocarbon oil) are subject to the
standard rate of VAT. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has power to vary
between Budgets the amounts of the VAT rates by up to 25 per cent, and the
rate of any of the other main groups of excise duties (that is, tobacco, alcoholic
drinks, oil and the minor excise duties) by up to 10 per cent. This power,
known as the ‘regulator’, requires annual renewal. The April 1978 Budget
imposed a supplementary duty on cigarettes with a higher tar yield.
Value added tax (VAT) is collected at each stage in the production and distri¬
bution process. The final tax is borne by the consumer. A taxable person
(generally, a trader carrying on a business with a turnover of more than
.£10,000 a year) is charged by suppliers of goods and services with VAT
(‘input’ tax). The trader then charges the customer with VAT on goods and
services supplied (‘output’ tax). The trader pays to Customs and Excise the
difference between output and input tax. Although VAT falls on imported
goods, most exports are zero-rated and VAT entering directly into export
costs can be reclaimed.
VAT is a broadly based tax falling on final consumers’ expenditure except
where there are strong social or economic reasons for giving relief. There are
two basic methods by which supplies of goods and services may get relief
from VAT: zero-rating, when a trader does not have to charge tax to a
customer, but can reclaim any input tax paid to suppliers, and exemption,
when a trader does not have to charge a customer any output tax but is not
entitled to deduct or reclaim any input tax relating to the goods or services
which he sells. The most important supplies to which zero-rating applies are
most types of food (except in the course of catering); books, newspapers and
periodicals; fuel (except for petrol and other fuels for road use); construction
of buildings; exports (goods and many services); public transport fares; young
children’s clothing and footwear; and drugs and medicines supplied on
prescription. Exemption applies to land (including rents), insurance, postal
services, betting, gaming other than by means of a gaming machine and
lotteries, finance, education, health and burial and cremation.
VAT is chargeable at a standard rate of 8 per cent except for certain goods
which are charged at a higher rate of 12-5 per cent. These include petrol, most
domestic electric appliances (excluding cookers, space heaters and fitted
water heaters), radios, televisions, hi-fi equipment, boats, aircraft, caravans,
cameras, binoculars, furs and jewellery.
New cars and motor caravans, whether British made or imported, are charge¬
able with car tax at 10 per cent on the wholesale value. VAT falls on the
price including car tax.
The principal betting duties are: the pool betting duty (which applies to
football pools and betting by coupon at fixed odds) charged at a rate of 40 per
cent of the stake money; and the general betting duty, which is charged at the
rate of 7-5 per cent of stake money except for on-course betting which is
charged at 4 per cent. Gaming is taxed at different rates mainly by licence fees.

taxed by unladen weight, and taxis and buses by seating capacity.
The national insurance surcharge is a new tax which took effect from the start
of the 1977-78 financial year. It takes the form of a levy paid by employers,
along with their national insurance contributions, in respect of their employees
and is equal to 3-5 per cent of employees’ earnings up to £120 per week
(earnings of less than £17-50 per week are exempt). Generally it is assumed
that the incidence of this tax will be passed forward into prices, so that it
ranks as a tax on expenditure.
On 31 March 1978 the total National Debt was estimated at £79,083 million,
of which £4,629 million was repayable in currencies other than sterling,
mainly to the United States Government. Of the £74,454 million of internal
debt, £12,703 million was short-term debt, mainly in the form of 91-day
Treasury bills, while the long-term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds,
loans and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest and with fixed or indeter¬
minate dates of repayment.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole. The
major sources of revenue are the main national taxes imposed by the United
Kingdom Parliament over the whole country. The Northern Ireland share of
the yield of United Kingdom taxes is paid out of the Consolidated Fund of
the United Kingdom into that of Northern Ireland. Revenue also accrues
from local resources such as the regional rate and from certain non-tax
revenue. There is also an annual grant-in-aid voted by Parliament (£682
million in 1977-78 which together with the attributed share of United King¬
dom taxes, rates and miscellaneous sums, amounted to a total of £1,601
million). Loans from the United Kingdom National Loans Fund are available
(up to a limit of £1,000 million) to finance capital expenditure programmes in
Northern Ireland.
Various funds have been established in Northern Ireland, in addition to
statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific purposes. In general, these
funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the principal funds being those
relating to national insurance and government loans. The latter constitutes a
pool of money available mainly for local and public authority borrowings; on
31 March 1978 a sum of approximately £290 million was outstanding against
such borrowers.
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The British banking system comprises a central bank; deposit banks which
perform the usual main banking services; the British offices of domestic and
overseas banks whose main business is in other countries; merchant banks
and other specialised institutions.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal
Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by the
FINANCE
343
The Deposit
Banks
Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. As the central bank, the
Bank acts as banker to the Government, to overseas central banks and to
deposit banks and is the lender of last resort to the banking system; it is the
note-issuing authority and the registrar for some 200 government, nationalised
industry, local authority, public board and Commonwealth government
stocks. As agent for the Government the Bank administers exchange control.
On behalf of the Treasury it manages the Exchange Equalisation Account
(EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves of gold, foreign exchange and
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) on the International Monetary Fund. Using
the resources of the EEA, the Bank may intervene in the foreign exchange
market both to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange value of sterling
and to conserve the means of making payments abroad.
As banker to the Government, the Bank examines and seeks to anticipate
banking and financial problems and undertakes the appropriate operations
in the money, capital and the foreign exchange markets; consequently it has
a major responsibility for advising the Government on the formulation of
monetary policy and for its subsequent execution. It is also the main channel
of communication between the deposit banks and other financial institutions
of the City of London on the one hand and the Government on the other.
The Bank’s implementation of monetary policy is carried out primarily
through control over interest rates and through direct controls over the
banking system. It administers directly the official discount rate, known as
Minimum Lending Rate (MLR), which is the rate at which the Bank will
normally provide funds to the discount market as a lender of last resort.
MLR in turn can be expected to have an influence on other short-term
interest rates. In addition, the authorities can influence interest rates through
their daily operations in the money market and the terms on which they offer
gilt-edged stock.
The Bank’s direct controls over the banking system include the setting of
a 12-5 per cent minimum ratio of specified reserve assets to total eligible
liabilities (broadly, sterling deposits drawn from outside the banking system
with an original maturity of two years or less plus the banks’ net foreign
currency liability). Second, the Bank can call for special deposits as a per¬
centage of total eligible liabilities, which generally bear interest at the Treasury
bill rate but which do not count as reserve assets and which therefore contract
the banks ability to lend. In addition, a supplementary special deposits
scheme can be operated; this requires a bank to place non-interest bearing
supplementary special deposits with the Bank of England for every per¬
centage growth in the interest-bearing element of its eligible liabilities beyond
a certain specified rate over a defined period. The Bank of England has also
issued qualitative guidance on the direction of bank lending; this provides for
priority to be given to the finance required by manufacturing industry, for the
expansion of exports and for import saving.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government and other securities. The Scottish and Northern
Ireland banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart from an
amount specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered by
holdings of Bank of England notes. The provision of coin for circulation is the
responsibility of the Royal Mint, a government department.
The primary business of the deposit banks is the receipt, transfer and the
encashment of deposits. The principal deposit banks are the six London

clearing banks, three Scottish clearing banks and two Northern Ireland banks.
Mergers have resulted in the formation of six banking groups, four based in
London and two in Scotland. The two Northern Ireland banks are owned by
London clearing banks, but two groups of banks based in the Irish Republic
also operate in Northern Ireland.
In April 1978 sterling sight and time deposits with these banks from non¬
bank customers amounted to ^27,438 million and accounted for over 72 per
cent of the total of such deposits with all banks in Britain, that is including the
accepting houses, overseas banks and other British banks. Sight accounts are
repayable on demand and no interest is generally paid on them, but on time
deposits interest is paid (at a rate below individual banks base rates). The
deposit banks provide full banking services throughout Britain, and operate
through some 14,000 branches. Several of them have interests in British
overseas and Commonwealth banks, and in other banks which have been
formed specially to compete in international markets. They have also acquired
substantial interests in hire-purchase finance houses, and some have set up
their own unit trusts and merchant banks.
The deposit banks’ reserve assets consist of balances at the Bank of England,
money at call (mainly loans to discount houses), their holdings of Treasury
and some other bills and short-dated British Government securities. The
banks also hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio (mainly longer-dated
British Government securities) or trade investments.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts and partly in the form of loans (with or without
collateral security). In April 1978 sterling advances by the London clearing
banks amounted to about 63 per cent of their total deposits.
The bank giro, a credit transfer scheme, and the direct debiting by which
a creditor with the prior approval of the debtor may claim money due to him
direct from the latter’s banking account, have helped to improve the money
transmission services. Many banks have automatic cash dispensing machines
in operation and an increasing number of banks are introducing more auto¬
mated banking facilities. Credit cards are in widespread use for the settlement
of accounts in retail shops; and cheque cards enable the card holder to cash a
cheque up to any prearranged credit limit at any office of the major British
and Irish banks, and at offices of many banks overseas.
Membership of the London Bankers’ Clearing House consists of the Bank
of England and the London clearing banks together with the Co-operative
Bank and the Central Trustee Savings Bank which became members in
1975. In 1977 cheques and drafts passing through the London clearing system
averaged in value nearly ^216,000 million monthly.
The Post Office National Girobank (known as National Giro until 1978),
which was introduced in 1968 to provide a low-cost current account banking
and money transfer service, is operated through most post offices in Britain.
All accounts and transactions are maintained by means of a computer complex
at the National Girobank Centre near Liverpool. In March 1978, Girobank
had 590,000 accounts with deposits of over £230 million. The number of
yearly transactions has risen from 80 million in March 1969 to 242 million by
March 1978. In addition to its services to individuals, Girobank’s services to
commerce, industry and the public utilities include a facility whereby
organisations with dispersed branches, depots and representatives can rapidly
channel receipts into their central accounting system. Over 140 local authorities
as well as voluntary housing associations use Girobank’s rent collection

services. Girobank’s international services also provide money transfer
facilities in Europe linking over 18 million account holders in the European
Community and other countries in Western Europe. Following the granting
of powers to Girobank in 1976 to provide a wider range of banking services,
personal loans, a guarantee card, limited overdrawing for personal customers
and overdrafts for corporate customers were introduced. Other new services
introduced in April 1978 include deposit accounts, budget accounts and
bridging loans.
Altogether some 360 overseas banks are represented in London, through
branches, subsidiaries, representative offices and consortia. There are about
290 banks directly represented in London, while over 70 different foreign
banks and financial institutions are represented through 37 consortium banks
operating in London. Of those directly represented, 65 are from the United
States, 23 from Japan and 109 from Europe, of which 51 are from the
European Community. They provide a comprehensive banking service in
many parts of the world and engage in the financing of trade not only between
Britain and other countries but also between third countries.
The merchant banks have an influence on Britain’s financial affairs which is
much greater than their size in relation to other financial institutions might
suggest. Traditionally merchant banks have been primarily concerned with
acceptance credits1 and with the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf of their
customers. Today they have a widely diversified and complex range of activi¬
ties with an important role in international finance and the short-term capital
markets, the provision of expert advice and financial services to British
industrial companies especially where mergers, takeovers and other forms of
corporate reorganisation are involved, and in the management of investment
holdings, including trusts, pensions and other funds.
The Discount Market is an institution which is unique to the City of London.
Its function in the monetary system is to provide a financial mechanism
designed to promote an orderly flow of short-term funds. The market consists
of 11 discount houses, five money traders and two discount brokers, all of
which borrow money ‘at call’ or short notice and lend for somewhat longer
periods. The discount houses have recourse to the Bank of England as lender
of last resort. The Bank lends to them generally overnight or for seven days
at minimum lending rate, although it may charge a higher rate. Most of the
market’s borrowed funds come from the banks, which are thus provided
with a flexible means of earning a yield on surplus funds which they have at
any given time, although an increasing proportion is also coming from
industry.
The assets of the discount houses mainly consist of Treasury and commer¬
cial bills, government and local authority securities and negotiable certificates
of deposit denominated in both sterling and US dollars. The discount houses
accept as a formal responsibility that they should cover the Government s
need to borrow on Treasury bills which are offered on tender each week.
The Department for National Savings is responsible for the administration of
Government savings schemes: National Savings Bank accounts, National
1 Acceptance credits are usually short-term (90 days) arrangements to finance exports
from, and imports to, Britain and other markets. The expression is derived from the
method of financing trade by which commercial bills are accepted or guaranteed by
a merchant bank against documents, after which they may be discounted for cash by
a discount house.

the end of May 1978 National Savings totalled £10,335-5 million. Facilities
are provided by National Savings for the purchase of Government stocks
(‘gilts’); a selection of about 55 stocks is held on the National Savings Stock
Register. National Savings Gift Tokens are also available at most post
offices.
The National Savings Bank provides a countrywide system for depositing and
withdrawing small savings at post offices. There are about 21 million active
accounts. Ordinary Accounts bear interest at 5 per cent and the first ^70 of
annual interest is tax-free. Up to £50 can be withdrawn on demand at any
savings bank post office, but a few days’ notice is required for larger amounts.
The money is lodged with the National Debt Commissioners and is invested
in Government securities. Deposits bearing a higher rate of interest may be
made in Investment Accounts. All deposits carry a government guarantee.
At the end of May 1978 the sum of the two accounts totalled £3,336 million.
National Savings Certificates, in units of £1 (minimum purchase £5), are
encashable at par at any time. Interest, which is free of income tax and capital
gains tax, is paid only on encashment. The maximum permitted holding of
the current Fourteenth Issue is £3,000. Index-linked National Savings
Certificates Retirement Issue are available only to men aged 65 and over and
women aged 60 and over at £10 for each one unit certificate. Interest does not
accrue periodically but instead, subject to the certificate being held for one
year, the repayment value is related to the movement of the general index of
retail prices. If held for five years a bonus of 4 per cent of the purchase price
will be added to the repayment value. The maximum permitted holding is
£70°-
British Savings Bonds, 9-5 per cent, are sold in units of £5. If the bonds are
held to maturity (five years from the date of purchase) they are repaid with a
tax-free bonus of 4 per cent. The maximum permitted holding is £10,000.
Premium Savings Bonds are in units of £1 (minimum purchase is £5) and
individual holdings are limited to £3,000. After a qualifying period of three
months the bonds give investors a chance to win tax-free prizes. There is a
weekly draw for prizes of £75,000 and £50,000 and a monthly draw for well
over 110,000 prizes ranging from £25 to £100,000. At the end of May 1978,
£1,300 million was invested in this form of savings.
The Third Issue of the Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme is index-linked.
The scheme enables savings to be made in fixed regular monthly amounts
over five years, with a minimum of £4 and a maximum of £20, by means of
deductions from pay or by other regular payments. At the end of five years,
the repayment value will be the total contributions plus any increase due to
index-linking of monthly contributions. Completed savings which are not
withdrawn will qualify for fresh index-linking and a bonus equal to two
monthly contributions at the end of seven years. Savers who wish to stop
payments will be able to withdraw the total sum saved (but there cannot be
partial withdrawals). Tax-free compound interest will then be paid at the
rate of 6 per cent a year on amounts withdrawn after the first year.

The Trustee Savings Banks (TSBs), most of which were founded in the
nineteenth century, operate under their own trustees but are subject, under
the Trustee Savings Banks Acts 1969 and 1976, to the supervision of the
Trustee Savings Banks Central Board and the Registrar of Friendly Societies.
Following a planned programme of amalgamations, there were 19 individual
banks in June 1978 (compared with 67 in 1975) operating in a network of
about 1,650 branches with 14 million accounts and total deposits in excess of
£4,000 million. The 1976 Act empowered TSBs to provide a full banking
service including credit services and removed the requirement, as from
November 1979, that deposits be invested with the National Debt Commis¬
sioners. The TSB credit services, including personal loans, temporary over¬
drafts and bridging loans, were introduced during 1977. The TSBs also
operate their own unit trust, and Central TSB, which is responsible for the
clearing operation of the TSBs, is a functional member of the Committee of
London Clearing Banks.
Many special financial facilities, which are supplementary to the credit
facilities of the banks, are provided through institutions outside the banking
system. These include finance corporations, hire-purchase finance com¬
panies, the Stock Exchange, investment trust companies, unit trusts, building
societies and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are in
the main highly specialised, for example, finance houses, stockbrokers,
insurers and insurance underwriters and brokers.
Although there are a large number of firms engaged in the financing of hire
purchase and other instalment credit transactions, 90 per cent of all finance
house business is accounted for by the 37 firms which constitute the Finance
Houses Association. At the end of March 1978 the value of instalment credit
debt outstanding to finance houses, including those recognised as banks,
amounted to £2,300 million. About 65 per cent of new credit extended by
finance houses related to cars and commercial vehicles, including motorcycles
and caravans, the remainder relating to industrial and building equipment
and other goods.
The leading finance houses comply with the authorities’ policies on lending
similar to those applied to banks, and all finance houses are required to
observe term controls affecting the minimum deposits and maximum repay¬
ment period for specific goods financed by certain forms of lending. Finance
houses with total eligible liabilities exceeding £5 million are subject to the
same system of credit control as that applied to banks (see p 343).
Finance for Industry Ltd (FFI) was formed in 1973 as the holding company
for two previously separate but related corporations, the Finance Corporation
for Industry (FCI) and the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation
(ICFC). The purpose of the merger was to provide, in one specialist financial
institution, the capacity to support investment programmes over the whole
range of industry. The FCI provides medium-term funds at fixed and
variable interest rates for large companies in excess of £2 million. At the
end of March 1978 it had approved £267 million in 39 companies plus £58
million which had been committed but not drawn. The ICFC provides
34^

and Unit Trusts
medium- and long-term funds at fixed interest rates for the small and
medium sectors of industry. The ICFC has investments of over £239 million
in 2,375 companies and its normal lending limits range from £5,000 to
£2 million for periods between seven and 20 years.
Equity Capital for Industry Ltd (ECI) was formed in 1976 as a new
specialist long-term institution with the primary purpose of providing equity
or equity-type capital for industry in Britain which cannot appropriately
be provided through the normal market mechanism. Its authorised capital is
£50 million and the shares are largely held by insurance companies and life
offices, investment trust companies, unit trusts and FEE There is an
unauthorised unit trust associated with ECI whose units are held by pension
funds so as to enable them to participate in the provision of capital.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company (CDFC) is no longer
confined to the Commonwealth in its activities. It supports business enterprise
overseas by providing finance in the form of share capital and loans on
mutually acceptable terms. Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which
about 14! million ‘A’ ordinary shares of £1 (£o'io paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in Britain, and 1 if million ‘B’ ordinary
shares of £1 (£o’50 paid) are held by the Bank of England and certain central
banks in the Commonwealth. At 31 March 1978 the CDFC held investments
of about £30 million spread over a wide range of industries in 40 countries.
The Agricultural Mortgage Corporation was established in 1928 for the
purpose of making loans to farmers. Its authorised share capital is £1-5 million
and at 31 March 1978 loans and investments amounted to £355’4 million.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) was set up in 1948
and undertakes projects for the promotion and expansion of a wide range of
enterprises within and outside of the Commonwealth. At the end of 1977 the
CDC had a total capital commitment of £270 million.
Investment trust companies and unit trusts enable investors to spread their
risks and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The usual type of investment trust company is constituted as a public com¬
pany registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business
is to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies, it
may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits to
build up reserves. Investment trust companies grew to importance in the latter
half of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment. At the end of 1977, such companies held assets
worth £6,500 million, of which 31 per cent were in overseas securities.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell
units to the public and must invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of stock
exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly by an
initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a half-
yearly service charge which is usually taken out of the income of the trust.
The level of both charges is controlled by the Department of Trade, from
which authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public;
this is only granted if the trust deed meets the Department’s requirements.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. At the end of 1977 there were
almost 2 million unit holdings. The value of the funds invested in authorised
trusts depends on the value of the underlying securities; from only £60
million at the end of 1958 they had risen to £3,461 million at the end of

1977. There is a wide variety of trusts, both in the range of investments
covered and in the ways of catering for the differing needs of investors.
Building societies are non-profit-making mutual institutions which borrow
mainly short-term from individual savers, who are generally able to withdraw
their money on demand, and provide long-term loans at variable rates of
interest on the security of private dwellings purchased for owner occupation.
They also lend to a limited extent to house builders and on the security of
business or commercial property. Most societies pay and charge interest on
the basis of a structure of rates recommended periodically by the Building
Societies Association, the movement’s representative body.1
Building societies have existed in Britain for some 200 years and have been
subject to specific legislation governing their operations (now consolidated
in the Building Societies Act 1962) since 1836. The present legislation is
administered by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies, to whom the
societies must provide regular statements of their financial position and who
has discretionary powers to restrict or suspend a society’s operations if he
considers that the way in which its business is being conducted may put in¬
vestors’ money at risk.
Building societies account for about 90 per cent of all lending for house
purchase in Britain and in recent years they have overtaken the banks as the
principal repository for the personal sector’s total liquid assets. This growth
has been accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands
of a few large societies. At the end of 1977 there were 339 registered building
societies with total assets of about .£34,290 million; over half this amount
was accounted for by the five largest societies and almost 90 per cent of it by
the 30 largest. The amount lent on mortgages in 1977 was a record £6,720
million, a 10 per cent increase on 1976.
The stock exchanges of the United Kingdom and Irish Republic amalgamated
in 1973 to become ‘The Stock Exchange’ with its main trading floor and
central administration in London. There are also trading floors in Glasgow,
Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and Dublin.
The number and variety of securities officially listed on the Stock Exchange
are greater than in any other market in the world and its turnover of company
securities is roughly equivalent to that of all the European bourses combined.
Some 8,200 securities are quoted on the Stock Exchange; at the end of
December 1977 these had a total market value of £294,554 million. About
6,600 securities of companies were quoted, including a number of leading
overseas companies. Company issues represented more than four-fifths of the
securities at market valuation, the remainder being United Kingdom, Irish
Republic and other overseas government and corporation stocks.
The Stock Exchange does not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bar¬
gains are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand
for the securities concerned.
In 1978 a new market in traded share options opened on the Stock Ex¬
change. The market, initially in the shares of ten prominent British companies,
enables investors not only to buy options to purchase shares in future at
pre-fixed prices but also to trade in the options themselves.
1 The income tax on interest is paid by the society on behalf of individual investors, at a
rate equal to their average tax rate. This means that while those not liable to tax
cannot reclaim the tax paid on their behalf, investors who pay at the basic rate receive
a better return than would otherwise be the case.

The Council for the Securities Industry was set up in 1978 as a supervisory
body for the securities industry. Its main function is to sustain proper conduct
and high standards in the industry.
The market consists of about 270 authorised banks and several firms of foreign
exchange brokers which act as intermediaries between the banks. It provides
those engaged in international trade with foreign currencies for their trans¬
actions. The foreign exchange banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and
future delivery. An important function of the market is to engage in arbitrage
transactions which serve to eliminate differentials in exchange rates between
different centres. The forward market enables traders, who at a given date in
the future are due to receive or make a specific foreign currency payment, to
contract in advance to sell or buy the foreign currency involved for sterling
at a precise fixed exchange rate.
All authorised banks may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely
concentrated in the hands of the five members of the London gold market.
The five members meet twice daily to establish a London fixing price for
gold. This price provides a reference point for world-wide dealings in gold.
Although much interest centres upon the fixings, active dealing takes place
throughout the day. Forward prices may also be quoted on request.
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by friendly societies,
banks and trade unions, most insurance services in Britain are in the hands of
mutual or joint stock insurance companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.
There are about 800 insurance companies authorised to carry on one or more
classes -of insurance business in Britain of which about 150 are overseas
companies. A number of other overseas insurance companies are represented
by agents in Britain although they do not write business here.
Some 310 companies belong to the British Insurance Association and these
account for about 95 per cent of the world-wide business of the British
insurance companies market.
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of private insurers in London. The name
‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late
seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. Although Lloyd’s activities were originally
confined to the conduct of marine insurance business, a very considerable
world-wide market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business
in non-marine, aviation and motor markets has been built up.
Lloyd’s is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting in 1871.
The affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are administered
by the Committee of Lloyd’s. The society does not accept insurance itself.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business is
transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and in
competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd’s
brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the insured.
Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact insurance
with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent financial regula¬
tions laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to transact
business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give security to the Lloyd’s
policy. Since 1969 non-Commonwealth underwriters have been admitted to
membership of Lloyd’s if they satisfy the requirements.

Alongside its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a world-wide
organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf
of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a
valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London representa¬
tives of the latter. The Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 provides
for the registration of insurance brokers by a Registration Council.
Over 60 per cent of the general (that is, non-life) business of members of the
British Insurance Association is carried on overseas, partly by re-insurance
on the London market and partly through branches and agencies established
in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this international business is
that resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available
for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the deposits, underwriting trust funds and other re¬
sources of Lloyd’s underwriters.
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome, insurance and re-insurance in the
European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the govern¬
ments of member states. The purpose of the directives is to harmonise the
legislation of the various member countries, thus providing a common
market’, which would avoid distortion of competition. Directives abolishing
restrictions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in
respect of reinsurance, and on compulsory motor insurance were in force
when Britain joined the Community and have since been accepted. A directive
relating to freedom of establishment in non-life insurance came into force in
1976 while one relating to insurance intermediaries came into force in July
1978. Draft directives relating to other classes of insurance are under con¬
sideration or in preparation.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in London
relate to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The
need for close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance
services often determined the location of these physical markets in the City
of London. There are also futures markets in cocoa, coffee, grains (wheat and
barley), rubber, soya bean meal, sugar, wool and non-ferrous metals (copper,
lead, silver, tin and zinc).
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations provide
financial, professional and commercial services for some 100 governments,
mostly of independent countries, and over 200 overseas public authorities
and international bodies. The individual Crown Agents are appointed by
the Minister for Overseas Development, but the office is not a government
department. It is a public service which is responsible to its principals for
business operation. In April 1976 the Government announced its intention to
incorporate the Crown Agents.
18 Trade and Payments
Although small in area and accounting for only about i *4 per cent of the world’s
population, Britain is the fifth largest trading nation in the world—and, as a
member of the European Community, part of the world’s largest trading area
which accounts for about one-third of all trade.
For hundreds of years, and especially since the mid-nineteenth century,
when the rapid growth of Britain’s industry, commerce and shipping was
accompanied by its development as an international trading centre, overseas
trade has been of vital importance to the country’s economy. Britain’s exports
of goods represent more than one-quarter of the gross domestic product. It is
a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures, electrical
apparatus, chemicals and textiles. Britain relies upon imports for almost half
of its total consumption of foodstuffs, and for most of the raw materials needed
for its industries. It is among the world’s largest importers of foodstuffs,
timber and paper, metals and ores, and other raw materials, petroleum and
many other products. Invisible trade is also of great significance to the economy,
Britain having the largest share of world invisible trade after the United
States.
A sound commercial banking system and a wide range of financial institutions
ensure that commercial needs are met for both short- and long-term finance
for international trade. The facilities provided by merchant banks and accepting
houses, for example, have long been used to finance shipments of goods not
only to and from Britain, but also between overseas countries.
This chapter describes the pattern of British overseas trade including its
commodity and area distribution, outlines British commercial policies and
government services to overseas trade, summarises the balance of payments and
gives an account of government aid to developing countries.
OVERSEAS TRADE
PATTERN OF Changes in the value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
TRADE imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
Value and In 1977 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about £32,200 million f.o.b.
Volume and its imports of goods at about £33,900 million f.o.b. on a balance of pay¬
ments basis (as distinct from an overseas trade statistics basis, which for
imports includes the costs of insurance and freight, and for both imports and
exports includes returned goods). Between 1976 and 1977 the value of exports
rose by 27 per cent while that of imports increased by 17 per cent. Over the
same period the volume index of exports increased by 8 per cent and of imports
by 1-4 per cent; but the unit value index of exports rose by 18 per cent and of
imports by 16 per cent. The small increase in the volume of imports reflects
a low level of demand in Britain and increasing production of North Sea oil.
The value and volume of imports and exports, together with the terms of
trade index, from 1970 to 1977, are shown in Table 24.

Although Britain is still one of the largest importers of food in the world the
value of its imported food supplies has been growing less rapidly than the value
of total imports and the ratio of imported foodstuffs to total imports, on an over¬
seas trade statistics basis, has fallen from 36 per cent in 1954 to 16 per cent in
1977. There has been a similar downward trend in the proportion accounted
for by basic materials—from 30 per cent in 1954 to about 10 per cent in 1977.
Imports of petroleum and petroleum products amounted to about 14 per
cent of the total value of imports during 1977, when their value was £4,769
million on a balance of payments basis. This was 7-3 per cent lower than in
1976, increased prices being offset by a fall in volume, itself the result of
increasing production of North Sea oil.
In recent years there has been a significant rise, in Britain as in other in¬
dustrial countries, in the proportion of imports of finished manufactures.
Such imports rose from about 6 per cent of the total imports in 1957 to 32 per
cent in 1977, when they were valued at £11,803 million. Imports of semi¬
manufactures have also been increasing and since 1962 have formed a larger
part of the total import bill than basic materials, partly the result of a shift of
the early stages of the manufacturing processes to the supplying countries.
Imports of semi-manufactured goods (including chemicals) totalled £9,878
million in 1977 and accounted for 27 per cent of total imports.
About 82 per cent of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods both
finished and semi-manufactured. By far the most important group of goods
is machinery and transport equipment, which in 1977 increased by 22 per cent,
to account for 38 per cent of total exports. Exports of machinery alone
accounted for 25 per cent of total exports in 1977. The share of chemicals has
grown fairly steadily, to reach nearly 12 per cent in 1976 and 1977. The share
354
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of textiles has fallen from 18 per cent in 1948 to 7 per cent in i960 and 3-6
per cent in 1977.

Although Britain’s trade has, in general, grown fastest in recent years with the
rest of the European Community, there was a marked change in the pattern
of British exports following the oil price rise at the end of 1973. As a result of
this rise, which generated large reserves for the oil-exporting countries,
British exports to these countries rose in value by 52 per cent between 1973 and
1974, accounting for nearly one-tenth of the total growth in exports over this
period. On the other hand, the slowdown in activity in most of the developed
economies during 1974 adversely affected British exports to these economies.
This pattern was repeated in 1975, when the value of exports to the oil¬
exporting countries grew by 86 per cent, compared with a growth of 16 per
cent to other member countries of the European Community and of only 4 per
cent to North America (implying a substantial fall in volume). In 1976 and 1977
there was a return to growth in world trade and exports to the developed
industrial countries continued the recovery which began in the latter part of
1975 as economic conditions in the European Community and the United

As far back as estimates have been made (for nearly two centuries) Britain has
usually earned a surplus from its invisible transactions. These fall into three
main groups: services (receipts and payments arising from services, as distinct
from goods, supplied to and received from overseas residents); interest, profits
and dividends (income arising from outward and inward investment); and
transfers between Britain and other countries (see below). Table 28 shows the
breakdown of the figures from 1970 to 1977. Services of the private sector
(and public corporations) include sea transport and civil aviation, travel,
financial services (including insurance) and ‘other services’ which include
commissions on imports, royalties, services between related companies,
construction work overseas, agency expenses and many other services.
The balance on invisibles in 1977 was £1,998 million. Gross earnings of
£16,135 million from invisible exportg were about half the total of £32,182
million from visible exports. The surplus in 1977 was substantially below that
356
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
COMMERCIAL
POLICY
of £2 AS2 million in 1976, largely as a result of the increasing profits of foreign
companies operating in Britain, particularly oil companies. Earnings from
tourism were particularly high in 1977 and earnings from construction work
overseas and insurance also increased strongly.
The deficits on government services have related predominantly to military
services overseas which have remained fairly steady in recent years, though
currency changes have caused the sterling value to rise. Substantial govern¬
ment transfer payments relate to economic grants to developing countries
and subscriptions to international organisations including, since 1973, Britain’s
contribution to the common budget for the financing of European Community
expenditure.

Britain has long been an advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade,
and to this end has taken a leading part in the activities of such organisations as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD). As a member of the European Community
Britain participates in the development of the Community s commercial
policy. The Community’s Common Customs Tariff (CCT) is, on average, at a
similar level to the tariffs of other major industrial countries.

Protective tariffs have been considerably modified in recent years as a result
of negotiations held under the auspices of GATT which also seek to reduce
tariffs and other barriers to trade, and to eliminate discrimination in inter¬
national commerce.
As a result of the ‘Kennedy Round’ (1964-67), a series of GATT tariff
negotiations, average reductions of over 30 per cent were made by the major
trading countries, including Britain, in their tariffs on industrial goods. A new
series of negotiations was formally launched in Tokyo in 1973; substantive
negotiations took place in early 1978 and a framework of understanding was
agreed in July with a view to a conclusion to the negotiations early in 1979.
The negotiations cover a wide range of both tariff and non-tariff barriers to
trade in both individual and agricultural products. (The European Com¬
munity operates as a single unit both in these negotiations and GATT
generally.)

The GATT Anti-Dumping Code, to which Britain is a party, together with
the Customs Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1969 and a European
Economic Community regulation, control the anti-dumping action that may
be taken to protect British industry against unfair competition and the criteria
by which allegations of dumping are judged.
All tariffs on trade in industrial products between Britain and the other
European Community countries have been eliminated. Britain applies the
common customs tariff to all countries neither belonging to, nor having any
special arrangement with, the Community, subject to special arrangements for
some industrial materials. Virtually all industrial tariff barriers between the
358

and Developing
Countries
Generalised
System of
Preferences
European Community and the remaining member countries of the European
Free Trade Association (EFTA), to which Britain belonged between i960 and
1972, have been dismantled.
Preferential tariff treatment for British imports from other independent
Commonwealth countries dating from the Ottawa Conference of 1932 has
been phased out since accession to the European Community. In the case of
22 developing Commonwealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the
Pacific (ACP), Commonwealth preference has been replaced by the trade
provisions of the Convention of Lome, which came into effect on 1 July 1975.
This established new trade, aid and co-operation links between the European
Community and a total of 46 developing ACP countries. In 1976 and 1977
seven newly independent countries acceded to the Convention, bringing the
total number of members to 53 (24 Commonwealth and 29 non-Common-
wealth).1 The Convention safeguards the interests of Commonwealth and
other countries dependent on the export of particular agricultural products,
including sugar for which access to Community markets has been guaranteed
for an indefinite period at prices related to those in the Community and in
quantities which the producing countries have undertaken to supply.
All British dependent territories (with the exception of Gibraltar, Hong Kong
and Bermuda), together with the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) of
other Community members, were formally linked with the Community as a
whole in 1976 under arrangements similar to those embodied in the Con¬
vention of Lome.
Other special arrangements have been agreed relating to continued access
into the Community for New Zealand dairy products.
The Community has stated its continuing objective of expanding and re¬
inforcing existing trade relations with the Commonwealth countries of Asia,
taking into account the scope of the generalised system of preferences (see
below) from which they derive considerable benefit. A commercial co-operation
agreement between the Community and India came into effect in 1974, one
with Sri Lanka in 1975, and one with Bangladesh in 1976. An agreement with
Pakistan was signed in 1976.
To secure greater stability in world commodity trade, discussions are under
way in UNCTAD on a number of primary products and on the creation of a
Common Fund to support international commodity agreements. Britain has
consistently supported the negotiation of such agreements on a product-by¬
product basis where feasible and economic and is committed to the establish¬
ment of a Common Fund.
The establishment of a generalised system of preferences for manufactures and
semi-manufactures exported by developing countries was agreed in principle
at the second UNCTAD Conference in New Delhi in 1968. Britain’s scheme
started early in 1972, but, as a member of the European Community, Britain
adopted in 1974 the scheme of the enlarged Community. Since enlargement
the Community’s scheme has been considerably improved in the interests of
the poorer developing countries.

TRADE AND PAYMENTS 359
There are now very few restrictions imposed by Britain on the movement of
goods and services.
Under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 the
Department of Trade is empowered to prohibit or regulate the import or export
of goods. Most goods may be freely imported under the provisions of the
Open General Import Licence. Controlled goods require an individual import
licence. Several other departments have separate powers to control imports
and exports for specific purposes.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT, and to the
IMF and the European Community, Britain has progressively removed
quantitative restrictions from almost all its imports from the market economies;
those controls that remain (for example the GATT Multi-Fibre Arrangement,
approved by the European Community in December 1977) predominantly
affect textile goods. There are comparatively few quantitative restrictions on
imports from centrally planned economies, and progress towards liberalisation
continues to be made wherever possible. In accordance with its obligations to
the European Community, Britain has also removed all quantitative restric¬
tions on imports of goods of Community origin, with the exception of potatoes
and certain internationally recognised restrictions. In 1975 the importation
of gold coins, gold medals and similar articles, minted or made after 1837,
was stopped (except by authorised banks and then only for sale abroad); in
1977 the cut-off date was changed to 1937; the remaining controls include
those recognised internationally on a few goods such as arms, ammunition and
radioactive materials. Some further restrictions or prohibitions are applied by
other Departments under separate legislation for the protection of health or
public safety, in the interest of conservation, and for other non-economic
reasons (for example, on animals, drugs and explosives).
There is a general import restriction on goods from Rhodesia as part of the
Government’s sanctions policy against the illegal regime.
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside
the scheduled territories are paid for in the proper manner most British exports
are not subject to any government control or direction. (The scheduled
territories comprise the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands, the Isle of
Man, the Irish Republic and Gibraltar.) The few controls that are in operation
are imposed to supervise exports of military and strategic significance; on
diamonds, to assist exchange control operations (see below) in preventing the
export of capital in that form; on cattle, sheep and pigs, horses, asses and
mules, for humanitarian purposes; on cocoa and cocoa products and on
endangered species of animals and plants, in accordance with international
agreements; on antiques over 100 years old and documentary and photo¬
graphic material over 70 years old, to restrict the export of items of national
importance; on salmon and trout, to inhibit out-of-season fishing; on controlled
(dangerous) drugs; on currency notes, gold coin and gold bullion; on British
spirits (beverages) in casks of less than nine gallons; and on EEC Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) products. All exports to Rhodesia are subject to
control.
Britain applies exchange control principally in order to conserve its reserves of
gold and foreign exchange. The powers under the Exchange Control Act 1947
are conferred mainly on the Treasury which has delegated the administration
of most parts of the Act to the Bank of England and to HM Customs and Excise.

The Bank has in turn authorised most commercial banks in Britain to execute a
wide range of transactions.
The general effect of exchange control rules is to control transactions
between residents of the scheduled territories and non-residents. Payments in
sterling may in general be made freely between residents, but the acquisition of
other currencies by them is subject to control.
The aim of exchange control policy is not to discourage investment abroad
but to regulate the manner in which investment outside the scheduled terri¬
tories is financed. Official exchange is usually available only for projects which
promise early and continuing benefits to the balance of payments. Where the
use of official exchange is not permitted investors can finance their approved
projects in other ways, for example, by borrowing foreign currency or pur¬
chasing investment currency (which, because it is drawn from a limited pool
of currency, normally changes hands at a premium).
Payments for goods exported from the scheduled territories must be
received in foreign currency or in sterling from non-resident sources—
normally within six months of export unless they are covered by an approved
export credit arrangement. Control is also exercised over imports to ensure
that currency authorised for their payment is used for that purpose. British
merchants conducting trade between countries outside the scheduled terri¬
tories are normally allowed to pay non-residents for goods only with foreign
currency borrowed for that purpose, the borrowing to be repaid from the sale
proceeds of the goods when they are sold to non-residents. Sterling credit
provided by British banks for foreign trade is therefore restricted to the
financing of trade between the scheduled territories and the rest of the world.
There are certain restrictions on dealings in gold bullion and on the use of
gold for manufacturing and industrial purposes. Purchases of gold coins
minted after 1937 by United Kingdom residents other than authorised dealers
in gold are allowed only if the coins are in Britain and are being sold by a resident
who is not selling on behalf of a non-resident.
Residents are entitled to purchase up to £500 in foreign currency for their
travel expenditure on each journey outside the scheduled territories, other than
to Rhodesia, irrespective of the purpose of the journey. Further travel funds
may be obtained for business, professional or other reasons. Non-residents
are normally allowed by the Bank of England to hold an external account in a
British bank and are entitled to change their sterling on external account for
other currencies and to make and receive payments in any currency to and
from non-residents in any other part of the world. Special restrictions apply
to transactions with residents of Rhodesia.
People living outside the scheduled territories who visit Britain temporarily
are regarded as non-resident and not subject to most of the exchange control
provisions. On the other hand, people coming to Britain from outside the
scheduled territories and intending to take up permanent residence in Britain
are normally regarded as resident, though they may be eligible for certain
exemptions from their obligations under the Exchange Control Act 1947.
Visitors to Britain may import notes in any currency, travellers’ cheques and
letters of credit without limit. On departure, visitors may take with them
sterling or scheduled territory notes up to a value of ^100, foreign currency
notes up to a value of £500 and, as a concession, any foreign currency notes
which they brought in with them.
The Government assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions favourable
to the export trade and by providing information and advice about

opportunities for trade in other countries and credit insurance facilities.
Export promotion is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and
Industry), the Development Corporation for Wales and in Northern
Ireland by the Department of Commerce.
The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) directs Britain’s official export
promotion services, which include the provision of export intelligence, assis¬
tance to British exporters in appointing agents and locating potential importers,
help to exporters at trade fairs and other promotional events overseas, and
support for firms participating in missions overseas and for inward commercial
visits to Britain. It includes representatives of commerce and industry, the
Trades Union Congress, the Department of Trade and the Foreign and Com¬
monwealth Office and operates under the general authority of the Secretary of
State for Trade who is the President.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the offices of the BOTB
throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts of the
British Diplomatic Service overseas.
Overseas officers work closely with the BOTB in the provision of services for
exporters. They regularly report on local economic and commercial conditions
and generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of govern¬
mental regulations.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) provides credit insurance
for more than a third of the country’s export trade and insures exports of both
goods and services.
The main risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the
buyer, governmental action which stops the British exporter receiving payment,
new import restrictions, war, or civil disturbance in the buyer’s country. Cover
may commence from the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from the date
of shipment.
This insurance may be supplemented by unconditional guarantees of repay¬
ment given direct to banks financing the exporter. Alternatively, for contracts
over £1 million ECGD will guarantee loans direct to overseas buyers enabling
them to pay on cash terms, or ‘lines of credit’ similarly covering an agreed
buying programme of an overseas country. The banks provide finance against
these guarantees.
In order to facilitate a switch from sterling to foreign currency financing of
exports, ECGD has, since 1977, underwritten larger projects only where these
are financed in foreign currency.
Since 1975 ECGD has offered a measure of cover against high and unpre¬
dictable cost escalation to exporters with capital goods contracts worth over
£2 million which involve a manufacturing period of over two years. ECGD is
also prepared to support the issue of performance bonds in the commercial
market in respect of cash or near-cash contracts worth over .£1 million.
Investment insurance is also provided for new British investment against
expropriation, war damage and restrictions on remittances.
Britain stages many exhibitions and trade fairs and British products are shown
at most of the large international trade fairs throughout the world.
Participation in trade fairs and store promotions overseas are forms of export
promotion for which the Government provides information and financial
assistance to exporters. In 1973 a British Export Marketing Centre was opened

in Tokyo to provide exhibitions and other marketing facilities for individual
British firms or organisations.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Britain’s balance of payments has usually been characterised by a deficit on
visible trade partially offset by a surplus on invisible earnings. Estimates of
the balance of payments and its main constituent items from 1970 to 1977
are given in summary in Table 29, and in greater detail since 1975 Tables 30
and 31. The balance of payments statistics contain two indicators of particular
importance. The first is the balance on current account, covering both visible
(exports and imports of goods) and invisible (trade in services, investment
income and transfers) transactions. This, together with capital transfers,
provides a measure of how far Britain is paying its way abroad and thus adding
to or using up overseas assets. The second indicator, is the balance for official
financing. This is the net result of all external transactions, that is, the current
account, capital transfers, investment and other capital transactions (including
official long-term capital transactions, investment flows, trade credit, and

changes in Britain’s net external banking and money market liabilities in sterling
and in overseas currencies) and other flows including unidentified transactions
reflected in the balancing item. The balance for official financing shows the
impact of all external transactions on the reserves and official debt position, that
is, how much is available to add to the reserves and repay any official borrowing
in the case of a net surplus, or how much must be financed by drawing on the
reserves or by borrowing if there is a net deficit. Table 30 gives details of the
current account since 1975. The increase in oil prices (see p 186) was the main
cause of a substantial rise in the visible deficit in ip74 £5’235 rnilfi°n> offset
to some extent by a surplus on invisibles of £1,644 million. In 1975, the low
level of domestic activity and substantial de-stocking reduced the volume of
imports, more than offsetting the decline in the volume of exports resulting
from the setback in world trade. The visible trade deficit consequently declined
to £3,236 million while that on non-oil goods was almost eliminated. After a
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
363
slight worsening in the terms of trade in 1976, the visible deficit stood at £3,589
million and the total current deficit at £ 1,137 million. In 1977 the visible deficit
fell to £1,709 million, largely due to increased production of North Sea oil.
The current account showed an overall surplus of £289 million.
There was a net inflow in 1977 on identified investment and other capital
transactions of some £4,410 million and a balancing item of £2,662 million.
The outflow on investment and other capital transactions in 1976 was largely
the result of a rundown of overseas residents’ sterling balances and the exten¬
sion of sterling lending overseas. The inflow in 1977 was caused by a large
build-up of non-official overseas holdings of sterling deposits and government
stocks and a marked slowdown in sterling lending overseas.
The direct benefit of the North Sea oil and gas programme to the balance
for official financing has increased substantially from about £5°° million in
1975 to over £2,300 million in 1977.

Britain participates in the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) scheme which
came into effect in 1970 in order to supplement world reserves. SDRs are
reserve assets created and distributed by decision of the members of the IMF.
Any member of the IMF may join the scheme, and its share is based on its IMF
quota. Participants in the scheme accept an obligation to provide convertible
currency, when designated by the IMF to do so, to another participant in
exchange for SDRs up to a total amount equal to twice the net amount of their
own allocation of SDRs. Only those countries with a sufficiently strong balance
of payments are so designated by the IMF. SDRs may also be used in certain
direct payments between participants in the scheme and for payments of
various kinds to the IMF. The role of SDRs as a central standard of value in
international transactions (see p 195) is being enhanced.
The significance of any inventory of Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities1 is limited because a variety of claims and obligations are included
that are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method of
valuation. The inventory for the end of 1977 shows that Britain had a net
debtor position estimated at some £ 1,700 million, due to heavy official financing
of balance of payments deficits in recent years. In the past a net creditor position

United Kingdom banking and commercial claims at the end of 1977 totalled
£7,983 million. Within this total banking claims were £4,216 million; sup¬
pliers’ export credit to unrelated firms was £3,264 million. Official external
assets, including re-financed export credit, amounted at the end of 1977 to
£4,701 million, which included outstanding inter-government loans by
Britain of £1,243 million. These assets, together with official reserves of
£10,975 million, £7,983 million in banking and commercial claims and private
investment overseas of £26,550 million, resulted in aggregate identified
external assets at the end of 1977 of some £50,200 million.
Approval is readily obtained for financing direct investment projects by
borrowing abroad on appropriate terms, and there is also scope for the invest¬
ment of retained profits of subsidiary companies overseas. In recent years a
considerable proportion of net direct investment outflow has been financed in
this way. Foreign currency finance out of the official reserves is available for
direct investment only when projects promise early and substantial benefits
to Britain’s balance of payments, such as may be provided by the returns to
direct investment overseas, which take the form of interest, profits and
dividends. Examination of these returns in conjunction with the methods of
financing direct investment overseas (such as the use of unremitted profits
and foreign currency borrowing) indicated that, overall, British direct invest¬
ment overseas has a beneficial effect on the official reserves and the balance of
payments.
Direct investment outflow, excluding oil, was £1,899 million in 1977 com¬
pared with £2,108 million in 1976. (The latest available area analysis indicates
that of the 1976 figure £451 million was placed in developing countries, £490
million in other member countries of the European Community and £567
million in North America.) With the inclusion of oil, portfolio and other invest¬
ment, aggregate private investment outflows totalled £2,282 million in 1977,
compared with £2,156 million in 1976.
Identified external liabilities at the end of 1977 are estimated to have been some
£51,900 million. Net drawing on the IMF accounted for £2,129 million of this
sum and foreign currency borrowing by the Government for a further £2,085
million. Foreign currency borrowing by the rest of the public sector under the
exchange cover scheme1 totalled £5,656 million. Inter-governmental loans to
Britain and other official liabilities, mainly a consequence of the second world
war and its aftermath, totalled £2,017 million at the end of 1977 of which
£1,577 million was owed to the United States and £374 million to Canada.
The Government has also drawn a loan of £65 million from the Federal
Republic of Germany under the 1969 Anglo-German Offset Agreement. Other
public sector liabilities of £6,257 million comprised overseas holdings of
British government and public corporations’ sterling securities, holdings of
Treasury bills and notes, local authorities’ securities and mortgages and
borrowings by British public corporations and local authorities other than
under the exchange cover scheme. British banking and commercial liabilities,
including liabilities in sterling and in foreign currencies, totalled £12,483

sector excluding oil, banking and insurance totalled £8,500 million at the end
of 1977. . . . . r r
The ‘sterling balances’, or foreign holdings in Britain of sterling in the form
of British government securities, bank deposits, deposits with local authorities
and hire purchase companies, and Treasury bills totalled £7)79° at the
end of 1977. Of this, £2,107 million was held by residents of oil-exporting
countries, £1,483 million by residents of other member countries of the
European Community and £4,200 million by other holders. About 36 per cent
of the balances were official holdings (mostly those of central monetary in¬
stitutions) and 64 per cent were private holdings used by overseas residents to
finance their international transactions. The total of these liabilities (excluding
the counterpart of borrowing) remained broadly constant between the end of
1945 and 1970, then rose sharply in the early 1970s to a peak in i975> in
1976, mainly as a result of reductions in the amounts held by central monetary
institutions. It rose again to a new peak in 1977 as confidence in sterling
increased.
As trade and payments arrangements have become more diversified in
recent years the relative importance of sterling as a reserve currency has
declined. Nevertheless, following the increase in oil prices the official sterling
balances grew rapidly as a number of oil-producing countries deposited part
of their financial surpluses in Britain. During 1976, however, they fell sharply
as official holdings were reduced because of fears about Britain s relatively high
inflation rate and trade deficit which undermined the sterling exchange rate,
and this depressed the exchange rate further. The facility for the sterling
balances, set up for two years early in 1977, with provision for a possible
extension for a third year (see p 187), aims to ensure that sterling and the
exchange markets cease to be affected by pressures associated with any run
down of the official sterling holdings and to achieve greater international
monetary stability. It also enables the Government to achieve an orderly
reduction in the role of sterling as a reserve currency. The Government
offered official holders the option to convert part of their holdings into negotiable
medium-term foreign currency bonds issued on market-related terms, some
£395 million of the official balances were converted in this way.
Inward Private
Investment
Overseas liabilities arising from investment in the private sector of the
British economy rose from £7»3^5 in I97° £2I>24° at
end of 1977. (
Overseas investors in Britain are free to repatriate the proceeds of the sale of
their investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued. Earnings
and dividends are transferable irrespective of their size. In 1977 the inflow of
direct, portfolio and other private investment, including oil, amounted to
£3,019 million.
The value of overseas investment in the private sector at the end of 1977
comprised: the book value of direct investment in Britain by companies incor¬
porated abroad (excluding oil, banking and insurance)—£8,650 million (this
figure has been extrapolated from the book value at the end of i974> taking
account of subsequent annual transactions); portfolio holdings of British
securities—£4,720 million; the book value of the net assets in Biitain of

million and liabilities of £89,590 million) are included in the external liabilities hgure.

overseas oil companies—^,5,300 million; and borrowing by British companies
overseas—£2,570 million.
Of the £711 million inflow of direct investment excluding oil, banking and
insurance into Britain in 1976 (the latest year for which detailed figures are
available) £466 million originated in North America and £159 million in other
member countries of the European Community. Foreign investment inflow
brings a number of benefits to British industry, including technological
development which in turn will strengthen the economy and its balance of
payments position.
Britain’s aid programme to the developing countries, which is the responsibility
of the Ministry of Overseas Development, consists of grants and loans for
economic and social development, technical co-operation, budget support and
contributions to multilateral aid giving agencies. To complement the official
programme private investment is encouraged by the provision of government
insurance to private investors by the ECGD. In addition an important con¬
tribution is made to economic development by private voluntary organisations
engaged in relief, development and educational work.
Since 1945 total official aid disbursements have amounted to about £5,877
million. The average gross annual disbursement over the four years 1974-77
was about £471 million. In 1977 official aid flows totalled some £589 million,
of which £576 million represented official development assistance (see Table
32) and £13 million other official flows. Of the overall total, bilateral aid
accounted for £374’5 million including technical co-operation funds of £i26,6
million; assistance provided through multilateral agencies was £201-7 million.
Repayments of capital and payments of interest during the year on loans made
previously came to £52-5 million and £37-8 million respectively.
In recognition of the special importance of the role of official development
assistance, the strategy for the Second UN Development Decade, adopted in
1970, included a recommendation that each developed country should pro¬
gressively increase its official development assistance to the developing coun¬
tries and exert its best efforts to contribute a minimum net amount of 0-7 per
cent of its gross national product (GNP) to them by the middle of the decade.
Britain has accepted in principle the 0-7 per cent GNP target and is seeking
in the years ahead to move towards it. The speed at which it can do so, however,
must be subject to the pace of Britain’s own economic recovery and to other
calls on its resources. In 1977, net disbursements of official development
assistance amounted to £523-7 million, 0-38 per cent of GNP (the net official
flow figure was £536-7 million, 0-39 per cent of GNP). Britain has also accepted
the UN target of 1 per cent of GNP for total net financial flows (that is, includ¬
ing private and official flows) to developing countries.
In 1975, in a major policy statement, contained in a report entitled The
Changing Emphasis in British Aid Policies—More Help for the Poorest (see
p 450), the British Government outlined its intention to adapt its aid policies
to meet the needs of the poorest countries and the poorest communities within
these countries, with particular emphasis being placed on rural development.
Bilateral financial aid in 1977 totalled £247-9 million; over 73 per cent was in
grants and the rest in loans. Budgetary aid, £10-44 million in 1977, is provided
in the form of grants. Development aid is in grants or loans, depending on the
economic and constitutional circumstances of the recipient countries. The
greater part of it is provided in grants following the decision in June 1975 to
provide future aid to the poorest developing countries (which include India,
368
Commonwealth
Countries
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and many African countries) in grant form only. The
terms of new development loans from Britain have been progressively softened
since 1958 and a policy of making interest-free loans to lighten the repayment
burdens of the poorer developing countries was introduced in 1965. In 1977
the total value of bilateral loan commitments entered into by the British
Government, excluding investments by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (see p 369), was £6 million and of this over 92 per cent was on
interest-free terms. Where loans bear interest it is at fixed concessionary rates
ranging from 3 per cent to 6 per cent, and both kinds of loan carry from three
to seven years’ grace periods during which repayments of capital are not made.
Of all loans committed in 1977 the average maturity was 25 years. Britain has
more than fulfilled the 1972 recommendations of the Development Assistance
Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) on easing the terms of financial aid. In July 1978 Britain announced
its intention to cancel debts worth £900 million owed on past development
loans by 17 of the poorest countries.
Loans and grants are tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and services
from Britain, although there may be a limited element for local costs and a
foreign content not exceeding 20 per cent in contracts financed from tied aid
in appropriate cases. Since October 1975, new loan commitments can be
untied, if the recipient agrees, to the extent that goods can be purchased from
the poorest developing countries as well as from Britain.

Differences between totals and the sum of their constituent parts are due to rounding.
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of its
responsibilities towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains
on the Commonwealth which includes among its members some of the
world’s poorest countries. In 1977 /251 million (67 per cent) of the bilateral
programme was disbursed to Commonwealth countries. Of this, ^31-2 million

went to Britain’s remaining dependencies, which are a first charge on the aid
programme, and £5-3 million to the Associated States in the Caribbean.
An important role in development assistance is played by the Common¬
wealth Development Corporation (CDC), set up by the British Government
in 1948, to assist the economic development of the then dependent territories.
Subsequent legislation extended its area of operations to independent Com¬
monwealth countries and, with the approval of the Minister of Overseas
Development, to other countries. By the end of 1977 some ^260-6 million had
been invested out of a total commitment of X333’9 million. Of the latter, £82-9
million was in East Asia and the Pacific Islands, £$()’() million in the Caribbean
and virtually all of the remainder in Africa. Commitments approved in 1977
totalled over £45 million.
Expenditure on bilateral technical co-operation (the provision of skilled
personnel, advice and training) has increased in recent years and was £126-6
million, 33 per cent of bilateral aid, in 1977. The largest component of
expenditure (£59 million in 1977) was on sending or maintaining experts
overseas, including volunteers; the next largest was for students and trainees
in Britain (£20 million).
During 1977, of the 8,625 British persons other than volunteers who were
working in developing countries and financed by the British Government,
some 3,846 were engaged in the field of education, 1,590 in public works and
communications, 1,303 in public administration, 1,096 in agriculture and
allied fields, 249 in health services, and 241 in industrial posts.
In addition, under the British Volunteer Programme in 1977 there were
1,641 volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified, working in develop¬
ing countries, the majority of them teaching. Recruitment, training and placing
overseas is undertaken by four voluntary bodies; 80 per cent of the British
costs were met by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Over 14,615 were financed in Britain in 1977 under regional pro¬
grammes of technical co-operation, by awards under the Commonwealth Edu¬
cation Co-operation Scholarships and Education Fellowship Schemes, and
under the various schemes of the British Council.
Britain is the second largest subscriber (after the United States) to the World
Bank group of institutions—the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the International Development Association (IDA) and the Inter¬
national Finance Corporation. The British commitment to the IDA’s Fourth
Replenishment, covering 1975-77, was over £206 million, while that to the
Fifth Replenishment, which became effective in July 1977, is £474 million.
Britain has contributed, or has agreed to contribute, to the Asian Develop¬
ment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean Develop¬
ment Bank and the African Development Fund. Since its inception in 1950
Britain has contributed ^158 million to the United Nations Development Pro¬
gramme and has provided more experts and training places under multilateral
schemes than any other country. Other contributions include those to the
United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA),
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the World
Food Programme, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
(UNFPA) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF). As part of
its contribution to the International Year of the Child (1979) the Ministry
of Overseas Development is giving ,£30,000 to .£40,000 to the international
3?o
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
child-to-child programme which is designed to teach and encourage school
children to concern themselves with the health of their younger brothers
and sisters. .
An increasing proportion of British development assistance is being chan-
nelled through the European Community’s aid programme. Community
financial aid takes the form principally of assistance from the European
Development Fund (EDF) to those countries which have a special relationship
with the Community under the Convention of Lome (see p 358). The EDF for
1975-80 amounts to some £2,000 million, including expenditure on a new
export-earnings stabilisation scheme. Assistance to a number of Mediterranean
countries linked to the Community by trade agreements is being extended.
Britain also contributes fully to the Community’s food aid programme.
Britain has played a leading part in urging the Community to adopt a new
aid and development policy based on the criterion of need and applicable on a
world-wide basis, thereby encompassing those developing countries (many of
which are among the world’s poorest) not covered by the Lome Convention
or having any other special relationship with the Community. The basis of a
programme has been agreed with a budget allocation of 70 million units of
account in 1978.
Britain has for centuries provided an atmosphere of learning congenial to its
scientists, whose record of achievements in relation to size of population is in
many respects unsurpassed. A feature of the present century has been the
increased allocation of national resources by the Government to assist in
research and development, partly because of the benefits of science to society
and partly because of the increasing cost of the equipment and facilities needed.
This has led to the development of means for determining priorities in allo¬
cating resources and for accounting for their uses. The resulting organisational
structure, as described in this chapter, is, however, less centralised than it
appears and allows flexibility in maintaining much of the freedom which
scientists in Britain have traditionally enjoyed.
The Government keeps under review facilities for training scientists and
ensures that adequate research is devoted to matters of national interest, which
include defence (see Chapter 5), industrial innovation, health, environ¬
mental protection, use and conservation of natural resources, the provision
of good food, shelter and energy and of efficient transport and communica¬
tions. Though the Government finances just over half the research and
development in Britain it carries out only one-quarter in its own establishments.
Funds are also provided by private and public corporations, and by private
endowments and trusts. Research is carried on in a wide range of institutions—
private firms, research associations, contract research institutions, government
research laboratories, universities, polytechnics, schools and hospitals.
The Pattern of Total expenditure in Britain on scientific research and development in 1975-76
Expenditure (the latest year for which complete estimates are available) was £2,111 million,
or 1-93 per cent of gross national product. Net Government expenditure on
research and development rose from £776 million in 1972-73 to £1,382 million
in 1975-76, of which £25 million was for the social sciences. Private industry
spent £743 million in 1972-73 which increased to £1,185 million in 1975-76.
The Government funded £403 million of this, £782 million being privately
funded.
THE GOVERN¬
MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
Central responsibility for basic civil science rests with the Secretary of State
for Education and Science, who is advised by the Advisory Board for the
Research Councils (see p 372). Responsibility for technology rests mainly
with the Secretary of State for Industry. Other government departments are
responsible for research and development related to their executive responsi¬
bilities. In 1972 the Government extended the customer-contractor approach
to all its applied research and development, whereby each department as
customer, with advice from its Chief Scientist, defines requirements and the
work is undertaken by contractors (government laboratories, research coun¬
cils, research associations, industry and the universities).
Advisory Council
for Applied
Research and
Development
The Lord Privy Seal is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate co¬
operation and co-ordination between departments in science and technology.

forum of external advice to ministers and to publish reports as necessary on the
deployment of applied research and development in both public and private
sectors and on the role of Britain in international collaboration in such activities.
The Select Committee on Science and Technology, one of the specialist select
committees of the House of Commons (see p 33), has published reports on
such subjects as alternative sources of energy, energy conservation, university-
industry relations, advanced ground transport and nuclear reactors which
have raised the level of public debate and influenced ministers. The Parlia¬
mentary and Scientific Committee provides for a regular exchange of informa¬
tion between Members of Parliament and scientists. Membership is open to
Members of Parliament of any party in both Houses, and also to nominated
representatives of such non-profit-making scientific and technological organi¬
sations as may be affiliated under its constitution.
The Department of Education and Science (see also p 44) discharges its
responsibilities for basic and applied civil science mainly through the five
research councils: the Agricultural Research Council, the Medical Research
Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Science Research
Council’and the Social Science Research Council; it also provides financial
grants to the British Museum (Natural History) and to the Royal Society
(see p 383). The Department spent about ^249 million in 1977 on the research
councils which in addition received commissions of about £52-5 million from
other departments under the customer-contractor principle. The Department
is also responsible for some aspects of international scientific relations (see
p 387) and helps to co-ordinate government policy regarding scientific and
technical information.
The Advisory Board for the Research Councils advises the Secretary of State
on responsibilities for civil science with special reference to the research
council system, the support of postgraduate students and the proper balance
between national and international scientific activities, and on the allocation
of the science budget between research councils and other bodies; and pro¬
motes close liaison between the councils and users of their research. Its
membership includes the chairman or secretary of each of the five research
councils, the chairman of the University Grants Committee, the Chief Scien¬
tists from departments with a major interest in the work of the research councils,
and independent members drawn from the universities, industry and the Royal
Society of London.
The Computer Board advises on requirements for central computer instal¬
lations at universities, research councils and similar establishments.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), established in 1931 under Royal
Charter (since amended), consists of a chairman and 18—21 other members. It
is supported in part by grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the
Secretary of State for Education and Science; over half its expenditure is for
work commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
The ARC is responsible for 15 independent state-aided agricultural research
institutes and also has eight institutes under its direct control and seven units
under distinguished scientists associated with universities. Also there are eight
independent institutes in Scotland financed by the Department of Agriculture

and Fisheries for Scotland with advice from the ARC on their scientific pro¬
grammes, staffing and equipment.
The ARC makes special research grants to support promising new lines of
work in university departments. It makes a limited number of postgraduate
training awards.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) was established under Royal Charter
in 1920, as successor to a Medical Research Committee first appointed in 1913.
The Council, which consists of a chairman and 14-18 other members, was
granted a new Charter in 1966 (since further amended). It is supported mainly
by a grant-in-aid provided by Parliament through the Secretary of State for
Education and Science and also receives funds from the health departments
and Department of Employment for the support of commissioned research.
The Council is assisted by four advisory boards: the Neurobiology and
Mental Health Board; the Cell Biology and Disorders Board; the Physio¬
logical Systems and Disorders Board; and the Tropical Medicine Research
Board. In addition, the MRC is advised by committees concerned with par¬
ticular aspects of its work and with research grants. The MRC’s arrangements
for the support of research fall under four main headings: investigations by
members of its scientific staff, mostly working in its own establishments;
short-term (‘project’) grants to workers in universities and elsewhere; long¬
term grants in support of specific research programmes in university depart¬
ments (‘programme grants’); and research training awards (fellowships and
studentships) tenable both at home and overseas.
The MRC’s main research establishments are the National Institute for
Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, and the Clinical Research Centre at
Northwick Park, London, which forms an integral part of Northwick Park
Hospital. In addition the Council has over 60 research units, mostly located in
university departments, medical schools and hospitals in Britain.
The MRC also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support from
the Ministry of Overseas Development, maintains laboratories in The Gambia
and in Jamaica.
Besides financing the MRC, the Government also supports medical research
through block grants to universities distributed through the Department of
Education and Science and the University Grants Committee, and through the
research and development programme of the Department of Health and Social
Security (see p 381). Certain government-financed research for defence pur¬
poses has civil applications related to medical science.
Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, and by the many
private charities or voluntary organisations which raise money for particular
branches of research.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) was established by
Royal Charter in 1965 with responsibility to encourage, plan and execute
research in sciences, physical and biological, relating to man’s natural environ¬
ment and its resources. These researches are broadly grouped and defined as:
the Solid Earth—its physical properties and mineral resources; Seas and
Oceans—their behaviour and living and mineral resources; Inland Waters—
their behaviour and living resources; Terrestrial Environments—wild-life
communities and their resources; Atmosphere—its structure and interactions;
and a number of interdisciplinary studies including pollution and the physical
and biological properties of the Antarctic environment.

Research
Council
The Council carries out research and training through its own institutes,
grant-aided institutes, and by grants, fellowships and other postgraduate
awards to universities and other institutes of higher education.
The Council’s research institutes are: the British Antarctic Survey, the
Institute of Geological Sciences, the Institute of Hydrology, the Institute of
Marine Biochemistry, the Institute for Marine Environmental Research, the
Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, the
Sea Mammal Research Unit and the Unit of Invertebrate Virology. The
Council also maintains central service units which include the Research Vessel
Base and the Experimental Cartography Unit.
Research institutes aided by council grants are: the Freshwater Biological
Association, the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Marine Biological Association, the Unit of Marine Invertebrate
Biology, the Unit of Comparative Plant Ecology and other units attached to
universities.
The statutory council consists of a chairman and up to 18 members. The
Council is financed by a grant-in-aid from Parliament, received through the
Department of Education and Science, and by commissioned research from
government departments.
The Science Research Council (SRC), comprising a chairman and 14-18 other
members, was established under Royal Charter in 1965 and is supported by
parliamentary grants-in-aid through the Secretary of State for Education and
Science. The SRC supports basic research in astronomy, the biological
sciences, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics in furthering its
primary purpose of sustaining standards of education and research in the uni¬
versities. Most of the SRC’s resources are devoted to helping university and
polytechnic staff to carry out basic research at the forefront of their subjects
in their institution, in one of the Council’s research establishments, or else¬
where; to encouraging active collaboration in research between the higher
education institutions and industry; to identifying and supporting areas of
special importance, such as polymer engineering, manufacturing technology,
marine technology and energy; and to enabling suitable graduates to receive
further training in methods of research or a specialised branch of science or
engineering of importance to British industry. The SRC provides grants for
research projects and awards studentships for training in methods of research or
advanced courses of study, and fellowships to promising scientists or engineers
to enable them to carry out independent research programmes that they them¬
selves have put forward.
The SRC maintains five research establishments: the Appleton Laboratory
at Slough (Berkshire), the Daresbury Laboratory at Warrington (Cheshire),
the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux (East Sussex), the Royal
Observatory, Edinburgh, and the Rutherford Laboratory at Chilton (Oxford¬
shire). Their main purpose is to support the research of universities and poly¬
technics. The five establishments are each centres of specialised research but
are also used for the development and operation of research equipment beyond
the resources of a university (for example, the high-power laser facility at the
Rutherford Laboratory). They provide support for scientists whose research
needs access to facilities run by international research organisations, such as
the powerful particle accelerators at the European Organisation for Nuclear
Research (CERN) and the high-flux neutron source at the Institut Laue-
Langevin (ILL).
The SRC provides national contributions to CERN, the civil science

programme of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the Anglo
Australian Telescope, the European Incoherent Scatter Project and part of the
European Space Agency contribution. It also contributes to, and shares with
its French and German partners, the control of the ILL reactor at Grenoble.
The provision of facilities for university research in nuclear physics is the
function of the SRC. The SRC establishments concerned are the Rutherford
Laboratory, which supports university teams engaged in experiments in
particle physics at CERN, and the Daresbury Laboratory, where a 30 million
volt tandem accelerator for research into nuclear structure is under
construction.
At the Rutherford Laboratory, the SRC has built a central laser facility for
plasma physics and compression study, and is constructing a new spallation
source based on a proton synchrotron (particle accelerator). At the Daresbury
Laboratory the Council is building a source of high intensity electromagnetic
radiation which will be used in a wide range of research projects in the physical
and biological sciences.
Astronomy uses both ground-based techniques, such as optical and radio
telescopes, and space-based methods (see p 389). Optical astronomy is
carred out in university departments and in the Royal Greenwich Observatory
and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, under the SRC. Instruments include
the Isaac Newton Telescope, of diameter 2-5 metres (8 feet), for which the
Royal Greenwich Observatory is responsible; the Anglo Australian Telescope,
of diameter 3-9 metres (13 feet), at Siding Spring, Australia, in a joint project
with the Australian Government; a i-2-metre (4-ft) Schmidt Telescope on
the same site; and optical telescopes operated by the South African Astro¬
nomical Observatory, to which the SRC contributes. A 3-8-metre (12-ft)
infra-red telescope is being completed on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, by the SRC.
Cambridge and Manchester Universities are the main centres for research
in radio astronomy with substantial support from the SRC. The fully steerable
76-2-metre (250-ft) telescope at Jodrell Bank (University of Manchester) has
been modernised and a radio-linked interferometer system is under construc¬
tion. The Cambridge University group at Lord’s Bridge has developed and
made substantial use of the aperture synthesis technique; two arrays of tele¬
scopes with 1-6-kilometre (i-mile) and o-8-kilometre (o-5-mile baseline have
been complemented by a 5-kilometre Q-i-mile) array.
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) was established under Royal
Charter in 1965 to encourage, support and carry out research in, and to
disseminate knowledge about, the social sciences. The SSRC consists of a
chairman and 13-19 other members, and is supported by grant-in-aid provided
by Parliament through the Secretary of State for Education and Science. It
initiates research into such topics as health policy, energy policy, population
studies, pollution policy, pre-school education, transmitted deprivation, and
the social impact of North Sea oil. It provides grants for research projects at
universities and other institutions, and makes training awards to postgraduate
students. It has also four research units: the Industrial Relations Unit, the
Cambridge Population Unit, the Ethnic Relations Unit, and the Socio-legal
Studies Centre. The SSRC’s fields of interest include economics; political
science; psychology; social anthropology; social and economic statistics;
sociology and social administration; social science and government; education;
management and industrial relations; human geography; linguistics; planning
and various aspects of a wide range of other disciplines.

Several government departments have funds allocated for social research
related to their responsibilities, including the Home Office, which has a large
research unit carrying out a wide variety of sociological studies. The Social
Survey conducts sample survey inquiries at the request of government depart¬
ments and from time to time also carries out studies in collaboration with uni¬
versities and other independent research organisations. Trends based on
departmental data are indicated by the Central Statistical Office in its pub¬
lication Social Trends.
Of total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the academic
year 1976-77 (over £232 million), the largest government contribution (over
£138 million) was through the University Grants Committee (UGC).
Scientific research in the universities (and other institutions of higher
education) is also supported through the research councils. This support takes
two forms. First, about half the postgraduate students in science and tech¬
nology in the universities and other institutions receive maintenance awards
from the research councils, through postgraduate studentships. These awards
are in some cases for periods of up to three years of training in research work
and in others for shorter periods for advanced studies. The cost of these
awards is about £33 million a year. Second, grants and contracts are given
to the universities and other institutions by the research councils for specified
projects, particularly in new or developing areas of research. These total
about ^50 million a year. The ARC, MRC and SSRC maintain a number of
research units within universities. In addition, the research councils provide
central facilities in their own establishments for use by university research
workers.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations. The contributions from sources other than the
UGC amount to about a third of the total university expenditure on research.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the
Government in numerous joint projects.
There were in 1976 some 585,000 persons with qualifications in engineering,
technology and science in Great Britain, of whom 307,000 were qualified in
science and 278,000 in engineering and technology. Of those economically
active in 1975 (465,000), about half (237,000) held engineering qualifications.
The Department of Energy (see p 44) is responsible for the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA); research in support of the exploitation
of North Sea oil and gas; research into alternative sources of energy and con¬
servation of energy; co-ordination of energy research within government
departments; general approval of the research programmes of the coal, gas
and electricity supply industries; and co-ordination of British contributions to
energy research and development programmes sponsored by international
organisations.
An Advisory Council on Research and Development for Fuel and Power
advises the Secretary of State on the general programme of research and
development of the nationalised energy industries and on other matters related
to energy research and development. An Energy Technology Support Unit
at Harwell assists the Department in assessing technological possibilities in

energy policy, advises on long-term research and development programmes,
and assists in their management.
An Offshore Energy Technology Board advises the Secretary of State for
Energy on research and development in offshore oil and gas technology and
is responsible for programmes designed to ensure the safety and efficiency of
offshore operations and improve the competitive efficiency of the offshore
equipment industry in Britain.
The Secretary of State for Energy is responsible for promoting and controlling
the development of nuclear energy and ensuring that the proper degrees of
importance are attached to its various applications. The UKAEA is the main
body carrying out relevant research and development. Its programme includes
work in support of the Government’s nuclear power programme, and it builds
and operates experimental and prototype reactors (see p 258). The authority
also works outside the nuclear field. Research and development work is under¬
taken at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell and at the
Culham Laboratory, both in Oxfordshire; at the Atomic Energy Establish¬
ment at Winfrith (Dorset) and at establishments of the Authority’s northern
division, which is directed from the Risley Nuclear Power Development
Establishment, near Warrington, Cheshire: the Risley Nuclear Power Deve¬
lopment Laboratories, the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establish¬
ment, Highland, the Springfields Nuclear Power Development Laboratories,
Lancashire, and Windscale Nuclear Power Development Laboratories,
Cumbria. The Safety and Reliability Directorate at Culcheth (Cheshire) is
the focal point of the UKAEA’s work in relation to the safety of nuclear
reactors and related plants and processes.
Co-operation in nuclear energy between Britain and other countries takes
place within a framework of intergovernmental agreements and membership
of bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (which operates
under the aegis of the United Nations) and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and through direct
research links between the UKAEA and counterpart organisations in other
countries.
Britain takes part in the co-operative research programmes of the European
Atomic Energy Community (Euratom, see p 72) including that concerned
with establishing the feasibility of achieving controlled thermonuclear fusion.
The Joint European Torus project, partly financed by Euratom, is to be sited
at the UKAEA’s laboratory at Culham (Oxfordshire) where a Euratom design
team has been working since 1973. This project is intended to carry forward
research into a completely new source of energy through the fusion of the
nuclei of light elements, using cheap, readily available and hitherto untapped
resources.
The Departments’ research programme is the responsibility of the Directorate
General of Research which provides a common service to both Departments.
It is formulated on the basis of the customer-contractor relationship, the main
contractors being the Departments’ research establishments. Guidance on
research priorities is given by six research requirement committees, which bring
together the main customer-contractor and research policy interests. The
Departments receive external advice on the broad shape and priorities of their
research programme from the Construction and Housing Research Advisory
Council and the Planning and Transport Research Advisory Council. There

are also a number of procedures to ensure that outside interests, such as those
in local government and industry, are fully consulted about the programme’s
contents.
About half the Departments’ programme is carried out at the Building
Research Establishment (see p 235), the Transport and Road Research
Laboratory (see p 289) and the Hydraulics Research Station. The other half
is the subject of contracts placed with, or grants given to, a wide range of
organisations, either by the research establishments, or by the Departments.
The Departments give grants-in-aid to a number of research organisations
which include: the Centre for Environmental Studies; the Local Government
Operational Research Unit of the Royal Institute of Public Administration;
and the Retail Planning Institute. The Construction Industry Research and
Information Association, the Building Services Research and Information
Association, the Timber Research and Development Association and the
Water Research Centre receive grants to support their co-operative research
and related activities. The Royal Society receives a grant to meet costs it incurs
as British representative on the International Institute of Applied Systems
Analysis.
The Nature Conservancy Council (see p 165), funded by the Secretary of
State for the Environment, may give grants to anyone (including voluntary
bodies) to carry out research projects relevant to its functions. The Council
carries out certain research and also commissions research mainly from the
Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, a component body of the NERC (see 373).
The Department of Industry is responsible for the sponsorship of manufactur¬
ing industries and for technical services to industry, and for six Government
laboratories. Of these, the National Physical Laboratory has responsibilities
for the national system of measurement, for technical aspects of standards
(including the British Calibration Service) and for research in computing,
numerical analysis, chemical standards and materials applications. The
National Engineering Laboratory carries out research in mechanical engineer¬
ing aimed at helping industry improve designs and production processes by the
application of improved technology. The Warren Spring Laboratory under¬
takes research in control engineering, materials handling, metals extraction,
mineral processing, waste materials processing and environmental technology.
The National Maritime Institute has special facilities and expertise relating to
the characteristics and performance of ships and offshore structures, marine
traffic and navigation safety, wind and water forces on structures and in con¬
ducting marine trials and measurements at sea. The Computer Aided Design
Centre is concerned with increasing and optimising the use of computer aided
design by industry. The Laboratory of the Government Chemist offers
analytical services and scientific advice to all government departments. All
these laboratories undertake contract research for British industry and overseas
firms.
The Department sponsors research by extra-mural contracts with industry,
universities and research associations. In accordance with the Government’s
customer-contractor principle, the Department administers a number of re¬
quirements boards to determine the objectives and balance of the relevant
research and development programmes, to further the practical application of
technology and to advise on science and technology matters in their fields.
They cover ship and marine technology; mechanical engineering and machine
tools; engineering materials; computers, systems and electronics; chemicals

and minerals; metrology and standards; garment and allied industries; and
electrical technology. They are responsible to the Secretary of State for
Industry and include representatives from other departments, industry and
bodies in the public sector. The Chief Scientist and Engineer’s Board covers
other relevant branches of technology.
Within the total expenditure of ^1,178 million on research and development
carried out within or financed by private industry in 1975-76, expenditure in
individual industries, including funds from government sources, was as
follows (in ^ million): aerospace 291, electronics (including computers) 251;
other electrical engineering 64; petroleum products 18; other chemical
products 221; mechanical engineering 63; motor vehicles 87; scientific
instruments 21; food, drink and tobacco 48; textiles 25. Firms in science-based
industries commit large private funds to research and development in the
course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
A scheme by which the Government helped firms with similar interests to
form organisations known as research associations, to carry out industrial
research co-operatively, was started in 1917. Encouragement by government
grants, related to the contributions made by the industries concerned, has
lately been phased out in favour of extra-mural contract support, such as that
offered by the Department of Industry’s Requirements Boards (see p 378).
About 30 of these research associations operate in areas of interest to the
Department of Industry. In addition there are four (buildings services; con¬
struction industry; timber; and water) linked with the Department of the En¬
vironment and five (Flour Milling and Baking; Campden Food Preservation;
British Food Manufacturing Industries; British Industrial Biological Re¬
search; and Processors’ and Growers’) linked with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. Among the largest of the industrial research associations
are those dealing with production engineering, ships, welding, electrical
manufacturing, cotton and man-made fibres, non-ferrous metals and motor
manufacturing. (See also Chapter 12.) The Textile Research Council serves
as a focal point for the collective interests of the various textile research
associations.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations, in particular those concerned with energy
(see Chapter 13), steel and transport. These organisations also give support to
other organisations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
Agricultural research is carried out by the Agricultural Research Council, the
government agricultural departments and by private industry. Fisheries
research is conducted by the government fisheries departments, the White
Fish Authority, and the Natural Environment Research Council. Expenditure
on research and development by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food is estimated to be £45-1 million in 1978-79.
Advice is given to the government agricultural departments and to the ARC
on priorities for all state-aided research and development in agriculture and
food in England, Wales and Scotland, by the Joint Consultative Organisation
(JCO). The JCO comprises members of the farming and food industries,
scientists, economists and members of the departments’ professional,

technical and administrative services and consists of five advisory boards con¬
cerned with animals; arable crops and forage; horticulture; food science and
technology; and engineering and buildings.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does both applied and basic
research. At its Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, research and
laboratory investigations are carried out into the causes, pathology, epi¬
demiology and control of diseases of farm livestock, including poultry; the
diagnosis of animal and poultry diseases (other than foot-and-mouth disease);
and the making and supplying of certain biological products. The laboratory
is, by appointment of the World Health Organisation, the third international
laboratory for biological standards. In discharging its responsibilities in
regard to plant health services, the Plant Pathology Laboratory at Harpenden,
Hertfordshire, provides the scientific basis for essential legislation against
plant pests and diseases, and acts as a liaison centre for the collection and dis¬
semination of information on pests and diseases of crops and plants and on the
uses and toxic hazards of pesticides used in agriculture and horticulture. It
carries out research and development on plant health problems, and also on the
detection of pesticide residues in treated crops and crop products, and on the
formulation of pesticides. The Pest Infestation Control Laboratory at Slough,
Berkshire (with stations at Tolworth and Worplesdon, Surrey), engages in
research work on insects, mites and fungi affecting food storage and on harmful
mammals and birds. It provides the scientific basis for advisory work on their
detection and control and acts as an instruction and liaison centre for home and
some overseas work. It is also concerned with the safe use of pesticides in food
storage and in animal husbandry, and with the effect on wildlife of pesticides
of all kinds.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science
Division provides advice on scientific and technical aspects of food. Particular
attention is paid to the safety, quality and nutritive value of food, including
consideration of food additives and contaminants. Close liaison is maintained
with the Department of Health and Social Security, which has responsibilities
for public health, and with other government departments. The division has
Food Science Laboratories in Norwich and London concerned with storage
of certain foods, interaction of food additives and food components, heavy metal
contamination and studies arising from food legislation and safety. There is an
increasing demand for advice in connection with international work, including
the European Community food legislation, and also regarding the new
government policies for the support of research at the four food research
associations and elsewhere.
In Scotland research work at East Craigs, Edinburgh, by the Agricultural
Scientific Services of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is mainly
concerned with the problem of cultivar taxonomy, seed testing, healthy seed
potato production, plant pathology, and the ecology of birds, mammals and
insects harmful to agriculture and stored products. In Northern Ireland the
Department of Agriculture is responsible for promotion of research in food pro¬
duced by agriculture and in veterinary sciences with the aim of improving
efficiency of production, marketability of foods and the health of plants and
animals. The Department is also responsible for work on forest science, ecology
of freshwater and marine fish as well as on the biology of freshwater resources.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s research work is carried out
by the Directorate of Fisheries Research at Lowestoft and by the Torry
Research Station in Aberdeen. The former includes a Marine Fisheries

and Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory in London, a Shellfish Cultivation
Station at Conwy (Gwynedd) and a Fish Disease Centre at Weymouth. Torry
Research Station and an outstation at Hull are concerned with the investigation
of all aspects of fish technology. There are seven research vessels engaged on
sea-going, inshore and estuarine work. The Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries for Scotland maintains a marine research laboratory and six sea¬
going research ships at Aberdeen, and a freshwater fisheries research laboratory
at Pitlochry.
A Fisheries Research and Development Board, representative of govern¬
ment departments and the industry, advises fisheries ministers on research
programmes, objectives and priorities. A Controller of Fisheries Research and
Development, responsible jointly to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland, co-ordinates the programmes of
the research laboratories.
Forestry research is carried out by the Forestry Commission at the Forest
Research Station, Alice Holt Lodge, Surrey, and the Northern Research
Station, Roslin, near Edinburgh. By means of grants, aid is also given for
forestry research work undertaken by various universities and other institu¬
tions, including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford. Expenditure
by the Commission on research work in Great Britain amounted to £2-7
million in 1977-78. Research into the quality and uses of home-grown timber
is carried out by Princes Risborough Laboratory in Buckinghamshire, and
also by grant-aided associations. An extensive research programme on Dutch
elm disease has been carried out by the Commission since the outbreak of the
disease in 1969.
The Procurement Executive, Ministry of Defence, engages in research for
defence purposes at its research and development establishments and through
contracts placed with industry and universities (see p m). It also undertakes
certain research for civil purposes, including meteorology (see p 383), civil
aviation (see p m), medical research and space research.
The Department of Health and Social Security spent over £25 million on
research and development in 1977-78 of which over ^8-5 million was on bio¬
medical research through the Medical Research Council. The Department is
advised by a Chief Scientist supported by a group of independent advisers
covering a wide range of scientific disciplines.
The Department of Employment has a Research and Planning Division to
conduct and advise on its programme of research on socio-economic problems.
Assistance is given to the Department in social research by the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys and close contact is maintained with the
Social Science Research Council.
The Department of Prices and Consumer Protection (see p 49) has responsi¬
bility for standards and weights and measures, for government support for
the British Standards Institution (see p 207) and for the Metrication Board
set up to facilitate the transition to the metric system of weights and measures
in Britain.
Some other branches of research for which government departments are
responsible are given below1.

assistance is given by the Ministry of Defence and the Department of
Industry. Their work is, wherever possible, integrated into a single programme
managed by the Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence and carried
out in government establishments such as the Royal Aircraft Establishment,
the National Gas Turbine Establishment and the Royal Signals and Radar
Establishment as well as in industry, in research associations and in universi¬
ties. The work is subject to the oversight of the Aeronautical Research Council
and the Joint Research Committee, which bring together the research interests
with the aircraft manufacturing and operating industries and with eminent
academics.
Similar methods are used by the Civil Aviation Authority for research needed
to support their statutory responsibilities in aircraft operation; in this case,
advice is obtained on research and development work from the Civil Aviation
Research and Development Programme Board.
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (founded in 1759), together with its 200-
hectare (500-acre) estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly (Sussex) is administered
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and has the largest collec¬
tion of living plants in the world. The Herbarium (also the largest in the world
with nearly 5 million specimens) is concerned primarily with research into the
classification and accurate determination of plants, as well as producing several
major descriptions of flora in various parts of the world. The Jodrell Laboratory
undertakes the study of plant anatomy and plant physiology, biochemistry,
cytology and genetics. There is also a seed bank and seed testing unit. There is
a Conservation Unit concerned with various aspects of plant conservation, and
in particular the threatened plants of the world. The Museums Division is
concerned with public exhibitions and the care of reference collections of
economic plant products. The Library, founded in 1852, consists of more than
120,000 botanical books, about 140,000 reprints and separately issued items
and a collection of over 170,000 drawings and paintings of plants.
The Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh (founded in 1670), has, since 1969,
been administered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scot¬
land. Together with the associated Logan Botanic Garden at Ardwell, near
Stranraer, and the Younger Botanic Garden at Benmore, near Dunoon, it
maintains large collections of living plants (both temperate and tropical) used
for taxonomic research (into classification of plants), including tropical plants.
The herbarium and library (the finest outside London) are used for taxonomy,
cytology, anatomy, mycology and other subjects.
The Post Office, responsible to the Department of Industry, undertakes
research and development on many aspects of the science and engineering of
communications (see pp 308-9).
Research into the effects of pollutants on man and the environment and on
methods of controlling them is spread throughout research establishments of
all kinds, sponsored by research councils and central government depart¬
ments with control responsibilities (see p 166). The Royal Commission on
Environmental Pollution advises on the adequacy of such research.
The Health and Safety Executive, through its Health and Safety Laboratories,
carries out research into matters affecting the health and safety of people at
work. Fields of study include explosion risks, fires, protective equipment,
methods for monitoring and measuring airborne contaminants, the safety of

engineering systems and fluid mechanics. The Executive also places research
contracts with outside organisations.
The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is respon¬
sible for research in meteorology and some aspects of geophysics, mainly for
civil purposes. The headquarters of the Office and most of its research
sections are at Bracknell (Berkshire). The Ministry also makes grants for
fundamental meteorological research carried out under the auspices of the
Royal Society or in university departments.
A National Radiological Protection Board (see p 171) carries out research,
makes public and occupational health assessments and provides services in
connection with radiological protection. The Board is financed by Parliament
through the Secretary of State for Social Services by grants from the UKAEA
and the MRC, and by income from services.
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies, of which there are more than 300, have retained their traditional
function of facilitating the spread of knowledge. The most eminent of those
concerned with science in its broadest aspects (as distinct from those societies
with specialised interests and activities) are the Royal Society, Royal Society
of Arts, Royal Institution and British Association.
The Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for Improving
Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in the country’s
scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies of sciences in other
countries. It is the oldest such academy in the world to have enjoyed continuous
existence. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high honour. The Queen
is Patron. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows,
Foreign Members, of whom there are about 80, and the main body of Fellows
numbering about 860. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life, is restricted
to 40 persons a year. The Royal Society is governed by a council of 21 members.
Its activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication of
research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings',
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson, Henry Dale and Napier Research Professorships and 14
other research professorships supported by a parliamentary grant-in-aid.
Research fellowships in human nutrition supported by the J. Sainsbury
Centenary Grant were inaugurated in 1974. The highest medal awarded is the
Copley Medal, for which scientists from all countries are eligible; there are
also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford, Davy, Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester,
Hughes, Leverhulme and Mullard Medals, and the Esso Award for the con¬
servation of energy. There are seven lectureships: the Croonian (biology);
the Bakerian (physical sciences); the Ferrier (nervous system); the Wilkins
(history of science); the Leeuwenhoek (microbiology); the Bernal (social
functions of science); and the Clifford Paterson (for electrical science and
technology). There are also the Rutherford Memorial, the Blackett Memorial
and the Isaac Newton Lectures which are given overseas. The Council has
set up committees, some of them jointly with other bodies, to promote
improvements in education in science and to emphasise the importance of
applied sciences, especially engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the Society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which makes grants for certain of

its activities. The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appoint¬
ments to research councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with research.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. It represents
Britain in the international unions comprising the International Council of
Scientific Unions and appoints national committees for each of them. The
Society represents Britain on the Council of the International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis, and is a member of the European Science Foun¬
dation and certain other organisations. It also plays a leading part in inter¬
national scientific programmes and promotes exchange visits of scientists
with many academies throughout the world. Its international fellowship
scheme to foster relations with scientists of Western Europe receives financial
support from the British Government and from partner organisations in
Europe.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) is concerned with scientific, artistic,
technical, industrial and commercial subjects. Since its foundation in 1754,
one of the Society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress and
useful application of all departments of science. Today it fulfils this purpose
chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The Society regularly holds
lectures, and publishes a monthly Journal, thus enabling the exposition and
assessment by leading authorities of developments which have a public as well
as a specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge .
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are
given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the annual meeting, attended by many young students as well as
by eminent scientists. In addition the Association plans special lectures,
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the Press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The Association has area committees and three lectureships for
voung scientists (the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences) to en¬
courage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has made an important contribution to the development of
science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles to the dis¬
covery and application of scientific knowledge.
There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which are playing a distinguished part in promoting their own disciplines
or are interested in the education and professional well-being of their members.
The Council of Engineering Institutions, the federal body for the chartered
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES

engineering institutions, promotes the co-ordination of the engineering
profession. The Council of Science and Technology Institutes is a federal
body with five member institutes representing biologists, chemists, mathema¬
ticians, metallurgists and physicists.
A Fellowship of Engineering, envisaged as complementary to the Royal
Society and forming an independent and authoritative forum of eminent
engineering opinion, was formed in 1976. The founder members were
Fellows of the Royal Society, together with a number of other distinguished
engineers who were selected by the chairman of the Council of Engineering
Institutions and the Presidents of the individual engineering institutions.
Further Fellows, up to a total of 1,000, but not more than 60 in one year, are
being elected by the Fellowship.
MacRobert Awards of £25,000 and a gold medal have been presented since
1969 by the Council of Engineering Institutions on behalf of MacRoberts
Trusts, for successful technological innovations contributing to the national
prestige and prosperity of Britain. A fund was endowed in 1972 by the late
Lord Rank to be used to reward outstanding contributions to human nutrition
and crop husbandry, and to opto-electronics and nearly related phenomena.
The first Rank prizes were announced in 1976. In giving awards for techno¬
logical innovation, the Queen’s Award to Industry scheme concentrates on
the potential application in industry of outstanding achievements in advanced
technology in the form of processes or products.
There are at least two bodies concerned with the relationship between science
and society: the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science; and the
Council for Science and Society, formed by specialists in the natural and
social sciences, the law, and medicine to support and stimulate research into
the social effects of scientific and technological development.
Zoological research is among the many activities of The Zoological Society of
London. The society also runs the world-famous London Zoo, opened in 1828,
which occupies 14 hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s Park, London. In 1931, the
Society opened Whipsnade Park Zoo in Bedfordshire, where hundreds of
animals roam a 200-hectare (500-acre) park. Other well-known zoos are those
at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley, Chessington and Jersey (a small col¬
lection of some of the rarest animals in the world). There are also a number of
‘safari parks’ containing reservations of wild animals through which the public
can pass in closed motor cars.
The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the Common¬
wealth for the general study of natural history, particularly for research into
classification (taxonomy); it has extensive collections of extant and fossil
animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The Science
Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all
countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held a leading place in
engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the develop¬
ment of industrial machinery and processes. The geology of Britain is probably
known in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and
the Institute of Geological Sciences has an outstanding collection of exhibits
in its Geological Museum. These three museums are in South Kensington,
London. Other important collections are those of the Museum of Science and
Industry, in Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at
Oxford.

The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a major problem as the volume of information
has grown. The leading learned societies have for long been important agencies
for communicating scientific information. The traditional method of scientific
publication, in which results are written up into papers and published in
journals or are presented at scientific meetings, is still the main means of com¬
munication among scientists, but access to information through computer
networks is becoming of increasing importance.
A description of general library services which also cater for scientific needs is
given on p 402.
Two constituents of the British Library are concerned with science and
technology—the Lending Division, and the Science Reference Library. The
Lending Division collects for loan purposes all literature which is likely to be
of interest to the practising scientist and technologist, covering all branches of
science and technology (including agriculture and medicine) and the social
sciences. The Science Reference Library is divided between the Holborn Divi¬
sion, formerly the Patent Office Library, and the Bayswater Branch which has
substantial collections, especially in the life sciences and scientific literature
written in Slavonic and oriental languages.
The rehousing in a new London headquarters of the world’s largest library
devoted to the social sciences, the British Library of Political and Economic
Science, part of the London School of Economics, is planned for completion
by the end of the present decade.
Aslib, representing special libraries and information units in industry,
government departments, universities, colleges and other institutions, carries
out research into the collection, utilisation and dissemination of information,
provides consultancy and advisory services and training courses and offers
members an inquiry and reference service covering all subjects.
The Department of Industry and the UKAEA devote considerable sums to
advisory and information services. The former has nine regional offices which
make contacts with local industries to promote greater use of existing scientific
and technical knowledge. Its Technology Reports Centre is a national clearing
house for unpublished technical reports made available by various bodies in
Britain and overseas. The industrial research associations circulate research
reports and provide information services to members. Besides information
services provided by its various groups, which include the Ceramics Centre
and the Non-destructive Testing Centre at Harwell, the UKAEA has an
information centre in London and a network of regional advisers on the use of
radioisotopes.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux (see
p 388) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches of
agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of Agricultural Research in
Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual reports.
The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research results
directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) is an independent
public corporation supported as necessary by government loans through the
Department of Industry. The NRDC’s functions are to promote the manu¬
facture by industry, under NRDC licence, of new products and processes

invented in government laboratories, universities and elsewhere, advancing
money where necessary to bring them to a commercially viable stage, and to
speed up technological advance by investing money with British industrial
firms, on a joint venture basis, for the development of their own inventions and
projects. Its borrowing power for government advances is £50 million.
Outstanding advances total £7-9 million and the Corporation is currently
funding its annual investment in research and development from its income
from licences and levies. Projects so far sponsored include the Cephalosporin C
antibiotic, hovercraft, computers, advanced types of electric motor, diving and
other oceanological equipment, packaging equipment, insecticides, micro¬
electronics and plastics.
Britain is represented on the Scientific and Technical Research Committee
of the European Economic Community, the object of which is to co-ordinate
national policies on these matters and to implement joint projects of interest
to the Community. Other intergovernmental organisations involved in scientific
co-operation with which Britain is concerned include: European Co-operation
in Science and Technology; specialised agencies of the United Nations such
as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation; the
International Atomic Energy Agency; the Nuclear Energy Agency and the
International Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development; the European Organisation for Nuclear Research; the
European Space Agency; the European Molecular Biology Conference; the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory; the International Agency for Re¬
search on Cancer; and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Science Com¬
mittee. Among non-governmental organisations Britain is represented in the
international unions comprising the International Council of Scientific Unions
(see p 382). The five research councils, the Royal Society and the British
Academy became founding members of the European Science Foundation
set up in 1974. In nuclear energy Britain also co-operates within the framework
of international agreements; through direct links between the UKAEA and
its counterparts; and through joint companies in, for example, nuclear fuel
and radioisotope manufacture.
There are scientific counsellors in the British Embassies in Washington,
Paris, Bonn, Moscow and Tokyo who among other things promote contacts
in science and technology between Britain and the countries to which they are
accredited. These counsellors serve all central government departments con¬
cerned in overseas scientific affairs, as well as the research councils and the
Royal Society, which is the main representative of Britain in areas of non¬
governmental collaboration. Administrative support for the counsellors is
provided in Britain by the Department of Industry’s Overseas Technical
Information Unit.
The Ministry of Overseas Development promotes scientific activities in the
interests of developing countries. These include research covering a wide
range of disciplines, specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, conferences
for exchange of information, training scientists from overseas in universities
and research institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from Britain, and
providing support for existing research services and research projects overseas.
Equipment is sometimes provided for research purposes and to encourage
scientific training. There are two organisations forming part of the Ministry,
which are wholly engaged on scientific work to assist developing countries.
They are the Tropical Products Institute, which specialises in the post¬
harvest aspects of agricultural, fish and animal products, and the Centre for

Overseas Pest Research, which is concerned with the development and applica¬
tion of pest control techniques relevant to tropical agriculture. In addition,
the Ministry meets the cost of a number of scientific units which do substantial
research work of benefit to developing countries. The Ministry also supports
the International Agricultural Research Centres under the aegis of the Con¬
sultative Group for International Agricultural Research. The Ministry pro¬
vides over £17 million a year for scientific activities including research for the
benefit of developing countries.
The Commonwealth Science Council (CSC) consists of administrators and
scientists nominated by the Governments of Commonwealth member countries
and has been brought into close association with the Commonwealth Secre¬
tariat. The Council concentrates on the organisation of collaborative projects
in science and technology to be undertaken by member countries.
The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, financed by contributions from
the governments of 25 Commonwealth countries, comprise four institutes and
ten bureaux, all of which except one institute are in Britain and each of which
is concerned with a particular branch of agricultural science. They act as
clearing houses for the interchange of information of value to research and
other workers in agricultural science throughout the Commonwealth and
increasingly throughout the world.
The principal aims of the British Council (see p 151) in science (including
agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to identify and manage
development projects in the technological, scientific and educational sectors.
There are 70 staff overseas with science qualifications who work to advance
technological, educational and scientific development, and collaboration with
Britain. One of their priorities is to make British know-how available, increas¬
ingly through consultancy schemes; others are to establish research and
development facilities, to provide trained manpower, and to assist with the
establishment of technical teaching institutes.
Interchange of scientists, technologists and educationalists is considered to
be of prime importance. British specialists in a very wide range of subjects are
sent overseas to advise on research and development and on teaching, and to
give courses of lectures, while scientists, technologists and technical teachers
are recruited or seconded to posts in overseas universities, technical teaching
institutes, teacher training colleges, education authorities, schools or cur¬
riculum reform centres.
The Council invites senior overseas people to Britain and arranges pro¬
grammes of visits or attachments. It makes its own awards for postgraduate
study in Britain and supervises programmes for senior specialists and students
who come to Britain through the United Nations agencies or bilateral technical
assistance schemes. The Council administers the Academic Interchange with
Europe Scheme, the European Academic Links Scheme, the Younger Research
Workers’ Interchange Scheme, the Commonwealth University Interchange
Scheme and scientific exchange with Eastern Europe. Professional courses
organised by the Council in various parts of Britain for overseas specialists
include science and medicine. At the Council’s headquarters in London,
extensive professional, advisory and information facilities within specialist

departments and libraries covering education, medicine, science, technology
and science education are available to overseas people.
Government responsibility for space activities is undertaken by the Secretary
of State for Education and Science (through the SRC), the Secretary of State
for Defence and the Secretary of State for Industry, according to the nature of
the project. Expenditure on space activities in 1977 was about £60 million.
The United Kingdom is a member of the European Space Agency (ESA)
together with Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany,
the Irish Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland;
Austria, Norway and Canada have observer status. Britain actively participates
in the ESA’s science and applications programmes in its four applications
development satellites (for general communications, meteorology, and air
and maritime communications) and in Spacelab, a manned laboratory to be
carried aboard the United States Space Shuttle Orbiter.
Scientific research, notably in astronomy and geophysics, using satellites,
rockets and balloons, is supported by the SRC (see p 374). The programmes of
the ESA and bilateral arrangements with other countries provide flight oppor¬
tunities for British experiments. Britain is co-operating with the United States
in a programme which includes American launching of the British Ariel series
of scientific satellites, the incorporation of British experiments in American
satellites, and the analyses of lunar surface samples. The SRC’s Appleton
Laboratory provides support and services for the universities’ space-based
experiments and also operates the United States National Aeronautics and
Space Administration Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network station at
Winkfield. Optical tracking of satellites is undertaken by many individual
observers in Britain; the prediction and co-ordination centre is at the Appleton
Laboratory, which is also the home of one of the three World Data Centres for
space research.
The Royal Society represents Britain in non-governmental international
scientific groups such as the Committee on Space Research of the International
Council of Scientific Unions.
The Department of Industry is responsible for leading the British delegation
to the ESA and for industrial sponsorship of Britain’s space industry. It par¬
ticipates in a joint departmental industry technology programme designed to
improve Britain’s industrial capability in space applications systems; the
programme is supervised on behalf of the Department by the Procurement
Executive of the Ministry of Defence. The Space Department of the Royal
Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough also undertakes long-term research
and development to assist industry.
The Department of Industry, through the Post Office, is responsible for
the use of satellites for civil communications purposes and undertakes research
work in connection with communications systems using satellites, including
those of Intelsat.
20 The Arts
Arts Councils
The wealth of artistic and cultural activity in Britain, ranges from the highest
standards of professional performance to the enthusiastic support and partici¬
pation of amateurs. London is one of the leading world centres for music,
drama, opera and dance; and festivals held in Bath, Cheltenham, Edinburgh
and other centres are also well known. Many British playwrights, composers,
sculptors, painters, writers, actors, singers, choreographers and dancers enjoy
international reputations. At an amateur level, activities take many forms, of
which a common characteristic is the use of local talent and resources.
Amateur choral, orchestral, operatic, dramatic and other societies for the arts
abound; and increasing numbers of people take an interest in crafts such as
pottery, weaving and woodwork.
Promotion and patronage of the arts are the concern of both official and
unofficial bodies. The Government and local authorities take an active part,
and an increasing amount of help also comes from private sources, including
trusts and commercial concerns. Policies towards support for the arts are
broadly similar, however, and there are two main aims. One is to maintain
and improve the traditional arts and cultural heritage, and to make them
more accessible to greater numbers of people. The other is to provide financial
aid to working artists and craftsmen, and to encourage more ordinary men
and women to take part in creative leisure pursuits.
Ministerial responsibility for general arts policy is borne by a Minister of
State at the Department of Education and Science; the Secretaries of State
for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are also concerned with cultural
matters. In addition, the Government is responsible for the upkeep of ancient
monuments and historic buildings, and grants are made towards the mainten¬
ance of privately owned historic buildings (see p 162).
The main educational functions concerning the arts are carried out through
the central Government education departments. They are concerned, in
partnership with local education authorities and voluntary bodies, with arts
education in schools, further education colleges, polytechnics, evening
institutes and community centres, and with the public library service.
Most government support for the arts takes the form of grants to independent
agencies. The most important of these is the Arts Council of Great Britain,
established by Royal Charter in 1946, whose main objects are to develop
and improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of the arts, to
increase their accessibility to the public, and to advise and co-operate with
government departments, local authorities and other organisations.
Government allocations to the Arts Council in 1978-79 amount to ^49
million. The Council gives financial help and advice to over 1,200 organisa¬
tions, from the major opera, dance and drama companies, orchestras and
festivals, to the smallest touring theatres and experimental groups. It en¬
courages such diverse interests as contemporary dance, photography and art
films, and helps professional creative writers, choreographers, composers,
artists and photographers by means of bursary and award schemes. It
promotes art exhibitions and tours of opera, dance and drama companies.
Funds are provided for specialist training courses in the arts and the Council

also assists projects for the construction of new buildings or improvements
to existing theatres, concert halls and other arts buildings under its ‘Housing
the Arts’ scheme.
Members of the Council are appointed by the minister responsible for the
arts. Advised by panels responsible for different aspects of the arts, the Council
itself allocates subsidies to the main professional arts promoting organisations.
Organisations in Scotland and Wales receive their subsidies from the Scottish
and Welsh Arts Councils which are committees of the Arts Council of
Great Britain having a large measure of autonomy.
A growing proportion of the Council’s funds is channelled to regional arts
associations, which are independent bodies set up to develop the arts in the
regions. A recent assessment by the Council indicated that about 30 per cent
of its revenue funds were applied to activities in London (compared with over
half ten years ago), and 70 per cent to Scotland, Wales and the English
regions. In Scotland about a fifth of the Council’s grant to the Scottish Arts
Council is applied to activities in Edinburgh.
In Northern Ireland there is an independent Arts Council with aims and
functions similar to those of the Arts Council of Great Britain. It receives an
annual grant from the Northern Ireland Department of Education.
The British Council promotes knowledge of British culture and literature in
English overseas (see p 151), and maintains libraries in most of the countries
in which it is represented. The Council may give administrative and financial
help to overseas tours by British theatre companies, orchestras, choirs and
opera and dance companies, as well as by individual actors, musicians and
artists. It promotes fine arts and other exhibitions overseas, and organises
British participation in international exhibitions. The Council distributes
overseas a wide range of specialised films, many of them on the arts, and en¬
courages professional interchange in all cultural fields between Britain and
other countries.
A major contribution to the arts (particularly music and drama) is made by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and, to a lesser extent, by the in¬
dependent television and radio programme companies and the Independent
Broadcasting Authority (IBA). The BBC has orchestras employing about a
third of the country’s full-time professional musicians, and each week it
broadcasts some 90 hours of serious music (both live and recorded) on its
Radio 3 channel. It regularly commissions new music, particularly by British
composers, and sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals. Independent
television companies make grants for the promotion of the arts in their regions,
particularly to regional arts associations, and transmit general magazine pro¬
grammes on the arts. Both the BBC and IBA broadcast a wide range of new
drama together with adaptations of novels and stage plays. They also screen a
variety of feature films including British and overseas productions.
Local authorities support the arts in many ways. In addition to their responsi¬
bilities for education (including specialised art education) and the public
library service, many provide and maintain local museums and art galleries. In
Great Britain the authorities have power to incur expenditure on entertainment
in all its forms (including cultural activities). Many authorities make contribu¬
tions to regional arts associations and towards the expenses of professional
symphony orchestras and local theatre companies. Grants are often made
towards the capital cost of new arts buildings, especially theatres; the Greater

London Council, for example, made a substantial contribution towards the
cost of the new National Theatre.
Valuable support for the arts comes from many voluntary sources including
charitable trusts and foundations, and supporters’ organisations of the major
national institutions. Industrial and commercial concerns provide a certain
amount of patronage, and an Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts
has been formed to advise interested companies. Sponsorship may take the
form of grants to regional arts associations, local arts festivals and orchestras;
and donations towards individual cultural events. Tax advantages and exemp¬
tions are available to encourage such support.
The Government encourages regional co-operation in arts patronage through
15 regional arts associations in England and Wales whose aim it is to ensure
that the whole range of the arts is more widely available to people throughout
their areas. They can offer financial assistance to local and other regional arts
organisations and advise on and promote all sorts of local arts activities. They
are financed by a combination of local authority, Arts Council and private
funds; local authorities and a wide range of other interests are represented on
the associations. Other examples of co-operative patronage are the orchestra
boards which support symphony and chamber orchestras and the societies
formed to present some of the many arts festivals in Britain.
Considerable interest and enthusiasm is shown for more than 200 professional
arts festivals which take place each year. Most are subsidised by a combination
of local authority, regional arts association and private funds, while the major
ones receive Arts Council assistance. Some arts festivals concentrate particu¬
larly on music. These include: the Three Choirs Festival which has taken
place annually for about 250 years in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford, the
Cheltenham Festival which is largely devoted to contemporary British music,
and the Aldeburgh and English Bach festivals. Others cater for a number of
art forms; among the better known are the Edinburgh International Festival,
the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, and those held in the City of
London, Bath, Brighton, Malvern, Harrogate, Chichester, Windsor and
York. A festival is held in Belfast under the auspices of the Queen’s University.
There are more than 150 arts centres and the number is increasing steadily.
They provide opportunities for enjoyment of and participation in the arts.
The centres are supported mainly by regional arts associations and local
authorities with some help from the Arts Council and other organisations.
They may be small centres for amateur activities or they may offer a pro¬
fessional programme. A growing number of theatres and art galleries also
provide a focal point for the community by offering facilities for other arts.
Britain is one of the world’s major theatre centres. In London during the
summer season, theatres are packed with overseas visitors, while in the
provinces there is growing support for the work of regional theatres. From
what was once called the ‘fringe’ theatre, and was based on London, a net¬
work of informal touring companies has developed, which visit many of the
new arts centres and community festivals.
Support for much of this development in British drama comes jointly from
the Government, through the Arts Councils of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, from local authorities and regional arts associations, and from some
private sponsorship. In particular the Arts Council assists developments in
new drama by encouraging co-operation between theatres and playwrights by

means of bursaries, commissions and guaranteed royalties. Schemes are also
in operation to train stage designers, directors, technicians, actors and those
wishing to take up theatre administration.
Over 250 theatres in professional use in Britain can accommodate more than
200 people. Some are owned or rented by non-profit-distributing companies,
the majority of which are receiving Arts Council subsidies, while the remainder
are operated commercially or are owned by local authorities.
London is the centre of theatrical activity with some 40 principal theatres in
or near the centre and eight in the suburbs. Most of the theatres are let to
producing managements on a commercial basis but four are occupied by
major subsidised companies, including the National Theatre which stages
classical and modern plays from various countries in its three auditoria on the
south bank of the River Thames, and the Royal Shakespeare Company which
presents Shakespearean plays at Stratford-upon-Avon and a mixed repertoire
in London.
Outside London there are a number of theatres which accommodate pre-
and post-West End tours of the major London productions and performances
by companies specially formed for touring. (Both the National Theatre and
Royal Shakespeare companies have toured in Britain and overseas.) A decline
in the number of these theatres has been stemmed in response to the demand
by audiences outside London for the larger opera, dance and drama com¬
panies. Some theatres have been purchased by local authorities. Many non¬
repertory theatres outside London present all kinds of drama and many also
put on variety shows and other entertainments. There has, however, been a
growth in the activities of almost 50 resident theatre companies which receive
financial support from the Arts Council and the local authorities. These com¬
panies employ leading producers, designers and actors, and standards are high.
Some companies have their own theatres, others rent from local authorities.
There is no censorship of plays, but the Theatres Act 1968 makes it an
offence to present or direct an obscene performance of a play in public or in
private (including theatre clubs), an obscene performance being defined as one
which tends to ‘deprave and corrupt persons who are likely ... to attend it’.
Provision is made for a defence against an obscenity charge on the grounds
that the performance is for the public good in the interests of, for example,
drama, opera or literature.
There are several thousand amateur dramatic societies in Britain; they are
encouraged by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four
special organisations—the British Theatre Association, the National Drama
Conference, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association
of Ulster Drama Festivals. Most universities have active amateur drama clubs
and societies; an International Festival of University Theatre is held annually.
Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the most
important are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the Central School of
Speech and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, all of which are in London; and the Old
Vic School in Bristol. There is the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama in Glasgow; and in Cardiff, the Welsh College of Music and Drama.
Several universities offer major courses in drama.
Theatre for young people has increasing importance. In 1970 the Young Vic
was opened as a theatre for young people, the National Youth Theatre has a

base in London, and the Scottish Youth Theatre was established in 1970.
There are some ten specialist companies, including the Unicorn Theatre for
Young People, Theatre Centre and the Polka Company, some of which are
supported by the Arts Council. Outside London about 35 repertory com¬
panies provide programmes and engage in other types of theatre activity for
young people. In Northern Ireland a company called Interplay Theatre,
which is sponsored and administered by the Arts Council of Northern
Ireland, works mainly in schools.
Most of the many amateur youth theatres in Britain are supported by local
authorities. Many schools and youth' clubs put on plays and provide some
education in drama. The London education service provides special drama
centres for young people.
Music plays an important role in British cultural life. Pop music, folk music,
jazz, light music and brass bands all have substantial followings while the
widespread interest in classical music is reflected in the large audiences at
choral and orchestral concerts and at performances of opera, dance and
chamber music.
The Arts Councils provide subsidies for orchestras, opera and dance
companies, music societies and festivals. They also provide bursaries and
commissions for composers, musicians, designers and choreographers. The
Master of the Queen’s Music holds an office within the Royal Household, and
whose responsibility includes organising and writing music for state occasions.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities. In central London the principal concert halls are the Royal
Festival Hall, adjacent to which are the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room which accommodate smaller-scale performances; the Royal Albert
Hall, where the annual summer season of Promenade Concerts is given; the
Wigmore Hall, a recital centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
The leading symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony, the Philharmonia, the Royal Philharmonic, the Royal Liverpool
Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester), the City of Birmingham Symphony,
the Bournemouth Symphony, the Ulster and the Scottish National. The BBC
runs a number of orchestras, including four symphony orchestras, providing
broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There are also specialised
string and chamber orchestras such as the English Chamber Orchestra, the
Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the London Mozart Players, the
Bournemouth Sinfonietta, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle upon Tyne),
the Scottish Philharmonic, the Scottish Baroque Ensemble and the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra. Most orchestras (other than those of the BBC) receive
financial aid from the Arts Councils, local authorities and industrial sources.
Among the principal choral societies are the Bach Choir, the Swansea
Philharmonic Choir, the Edinburgh Royal Choral Union and the Belfast
Philharmonic Society. Almost all the leading orchestras have their own
choirs, but they also combine with others in major choral works. The majority
of choral societies are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees (some of which are voluntary and some sub-committees of
local education authorities), which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom

Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music. The
National Federation of Music Societies, the organisation for chamber music
societies, amateur choirs and amateur orchestras, receives an annual grant from
the Arts Council to assist affiliated societies with the cost of engaging profes¬
sional soloists. Over 1,100 music societies are members of the Federation,
which advises them on concert planning and promotion. The Welsh Amateur
Music Federation, funded by the Welsh Arts Council, assists amateur music-
rnaking activities in Wales.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, which receives financial assistance from the Arts
Council and from private and business sponsorship. The Royal Opera House
has a permanent orchestra which plays for the Royal Opera and the Royal
Ballet. Both organisations have a high international reputation and make over¬
seas tours. Seasons of opera and operetta in English are given by the English
National Opera which plays in the London Coliseum, and makes provincial
tours supplemented by the English National Opera based at Leeds. Sadler’s
Wells Theatre provides for the London performances of visiting opera and
dance companies and for the Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet. The Scottish Opera
has regular winter seasons at its permanent home, the Theatre Royal in
Glasgow, and tours Scotland and northern England.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which international casts are
specially assembled, is held every summer, followed by an autumn tour by
Glyndebourne Touring Opera with different casts. Other opera companies
include Kent Opera, the English Music Theatre Company which specialises
in the performance of works by British composers, the New Opera Company
which is associated with the English National Opera, and the Welsh National
Opera Company. Opera in Northern Ireland is promoted by the Northern
Ireland Opera Trust and the Studio Opera Group.
Dance companies also include London Festival Ballet, Ballet Rambert
(Britain’s oldest ballet company, which re-formed in 1966 as a leading
modern dance company), Scottish Ballet, London Contemporary Dance
Theatre (which provides regular seasons of contemporary dance in London
besides touring extensively) and Northern Ballet Theatre (which concentrates
its activities in the north of England, although it makes periodic tours else¬
where). Many small modern groups also give performances.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the Royal
Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music and Trinity College of Music in
London, and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow are
grant-aided. Other leading colleges include the Guidhall School of Music and
Drama in London, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester and the
Birmingham School of Music. The National Opera Studio provides advanced
training courses. The leading dance schools are the Royal Ballet School, the
Rambert School of Ballet and the London School of Contemporary Dance
which, with many private schools, have helped in raising British dance to its
present high standard.
A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to the international Jeunesses
Music ales, encourages attendances by young people at opera, dance and
concert performances. The Royal Ballet’s work includes a small group,
Ballet for All, which offers an introduction to ballet to the public and to

schools. Educational Dance Drama Theatre and Dance for Everyone receive
financial support for their work with young people.
Many children learn to play musical instruments at school, and some take
the examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. The
National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, the National Youth Orchestra
of Wales and other youth orchestras are noted for their high standards.
Almost a third of the players in the European Community Youth Orchestra
come from Britain.
British films, actors and the creative and technical services which support
them have achieved successes at international film festivals and other events.
Cinema and television films are exported to most countries of the world.
There are about 1,500 cinema screens in Great Britain, and estimated
attendance in 1977 amounted to 107 million. Cinema attendance figures have
been declining since the mid-1950s as television has become generally
accessible. In 1953 the average weekly cinema audience was some 25 million;
by 1977 it was just over 2 million.
An Interim Action Committee is studying the future of the film industry.
Among the ideas being considered are the establishment of a British Film
Authority and additional help for the industry.
The Government does not invest directly in films but the National Film
Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production from capital
advanced by the Government and private interests. The Corporation also
administers the National Film Development Fund which provides loans for
script-writing and other pre-production costs.
A levy on cinema admissions, known as the Eady Levy, provides a fund,
administered by the British Film Fund Agency, to benefit the makers of
eligible films. Subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for Trade, grants
from the levy can be made to the Children’s Film Foundation, to the British
Film Institue Production Board, the National Film School, and the National
Film Finance Corporation. The rest of the fund is distributed to makers of
eligible films in proportion to a film’s takings.
A specified proportion of British or European Community films must be
shown in British cinemas each year. For main feature films the quota is 30
per cent and for supporting programmes 25 per cent.
Local authorities are the only public authorities with powers to license
cinemas and censor films. They have a legal duty to prohibit the admission
of children under the age of 16 to unsuitable films, and may also exercise
censorship over films for adults. In considering the suitability of films the
authorities normally rely on the judgment of an independent body, the British
Board of Film Censors, to which most films for public showing (other than
newsreels) are submitted.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912, on the initiative of the
cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in the films
offered to the public. The board, which does not use any written code of censor¬
ship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a film; very
rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the board are placed into one of
four categories: ‘U’ (for general exhibition); ‘A’ (for general exhibition but
parents are advised that the film contains material which they may not wish
children under the age of 14 years to see); ‘AA’ (for persons of not less than 14
years of age); and ‘X’ (for persons of not less than 18 years of age).

The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back to 1929,
when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive and
imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then,
British documentary technicians have continued to produce, for both cinema
and television, high quality factual films which have won numerous inter¬
national awards. The British Industrial and Scientific Film Association
promotes the use of films in industry, science and commerce. The Federation
of Specialised Film Associations is the trade association of documentary,
short, industrial, advertising and cartoon film makers. The National Panel for
Film Festivals, under the aegis of the British Council, is responsible for the
selection of British entries for international short and documentary film
festivals.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films for use in Britain and
overseas, including documentary films, television programmes and newsreels.
They are produced through the Central Office of Information (COI), which
commissions their production by private companies.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other
organisations, such as the British Tourist Authority and the British Pro¬
ductivity Council. The best are available through the COI’s Central Film
Library and other agencies. The Films of Scotland Committee promotes the
production of films covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from local
authorities which may impose conditions. There are about 470 children’s
cinema clubs which provide special programmes on Saturday mornings. An
important contribution to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film
Foundation, which, with the aid of grants from the British Film Fund Agency,
produces and distributes entertainment films specially designed for children.
The development of the film and television as an art is promoted by the
British Film Institute, founded in 1933, which is financed mainly by an
Exchequer grant, and by the Scottish Council for Educational Technology
which also receives a government grant. The Institute offers financial and
technical assistance to both new and experienced film makers who cannot find
support elsewhere. The Institute administers the National Film Theatre in
London and the National Film Archive and maintains a film library from
which films may be hired, a library of scripts and books on the film and
television, a British National Film Catalogue recording all non-fiction and
short films available in Britain, and an information service. It makes grants to
the Federation of Film Societies, the British Universities Film Council and
the Society for Education in Film and Television.
The Institute’s Educational Advisory Service offers guidance to teachers in
formal education at all levels on film and television courses, and its Editorial
Department produces a range of publications including a critical journal
Sight and Sound and the Monthly Film Bulletin.
The National Film Archive contains about 25,000.films, including news¬
reels and other miscellaneous items, and 3,725 television programmes, besides
art designs, posters and over 1 million photographic stills, selected to illustrate
the history and the art of the film and as social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre has two cinemas showing films of outstanding
historical, artistic or technical interest. It is unique as a cinema offering
regular programmes unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the

age or nationality of the films shown. Each year it organises a London Film
Festival. The British Film Institute has promoted the development of some
50 regional film theatres on the lines of the National Film Theatre and may
make grants towards their costs. In Scotland the Scottish Film Council, as a
committee of the Scottish Council for Educational Technology, is responsible
for regional film theatres and administers the Scottish Central Film Library.
Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.

An independent National Film School offers three-year courses for writers,
directors, producers and cameramen. The school, which is financed by grants
from the Department of Education and Science and the British Film Fund
Agency, has about 75 students. Training in film production is also given at the
London International Film School which has some 150 students, and at some
polytechnics and other institutions of further education.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, and have received many international prizes and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at home
has been stimulated by improved methods of display by museums and galleries,
and by the activities of many institutions, societies, private galleries and the
growing number of local arts centres.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of maintenance
and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase grants for
municipal museums and galleries, and grants towards the cost of local education
authority art education. The Government also encourages high standards of
industrial design and craftsmanship through grants to the Design Council.
In addition to direct state assistance, the Arts Council runs the Hayward
Gallery in London, where major loan exhibitions are shown, and the Serpentine
Gallery, which mainly presents the work of young artists. The council also
maintains its own collection of contemporary British art, and organises or offers
grants or guarantees towards a variety of touring and other exhibitions. It
also supports art societies and independent galleries, and provides commis¬
sions and awards for artists. The Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils maintain
galleries in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Cardiff respectively, and the Northern
Ireland Arts Council owns a gallery in Belfast.
London is a major centre for the international art market and regular sales of
works of art take place in the main auction houses. Certain items are covered by
export control: these are works of art and other antiques over 100 years old and
worth more than £4,000; documentary and photographic material over 70
years old; and British archaeological material over 100 years old. A licence is
required before such items can be exported but this is granted automatically in
the case of objects imported into Britain within the last 50 years. In other cases
the application for a licence is considered by the Department of Trade, and
if the department’s expert advisers recommend the withholding of a licence,
the matter is referred to the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Works of
Art. If the committee regards a work to be of national importance it can advise
the Government to withhold the export licence for a specified time to enable a
public museum or art gallery to purchase the object at a fair price.
Over 950 museums and art galleries are open to the public including the major
national collections and a wide variety of municipally and independently
owned institutions.
An increasing number of people visit major national art galleries and
museums (about 23-3 million in 1977 compared with 16-2 million in 1971).

Finance
Of the national museums and art galleries, those in London contain between
them one of the most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic, archaeo¬
logical, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within one city.
They are the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National
Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War
Museum, the National Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the
National Maritime Museum, the Museum of London, the Wallace Collection,
the British Museum (Natural History), the Geological Museum and the
Science Museum.
There are three national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the
National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum
(including the Scottish United Services Museum), and the National Galleries
of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art).
The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St. Fagan’s Castle
where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed and has recently opened an
Industrial and Maritime Museum in Cardiff’s dockland. In Northern Ireland
there are two national museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the
Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, County Down.
Some national museums have also opened branches outside the capital
cities, an example being the National Railway Museum at York which is
administered by the Science Museum.
Most of the national collections are administered by trustee bodies, but the
Victoria and Albert and Science Museums are the responsibility of the
Department of Education and Science; the Royal Scottish Museum has a
similar relationship with the Scottish Education Department.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (housed in the
Tower of London), the Public Record Office and the Sir John Soane’s
Museum. In Buckingham Palace the Queen’s Gallery has exhibitions of
pictures from the extensive royal collections.
Most cities and towns have a museum devoted to art, archaeology and
natural history, usually owned by the local authority but sometimes by a
local learned society or by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and Cambridge
are rich in museums, many of them associated with the universities (for
example, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest in
the country, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge). There are important
museums and art galleries in Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff,
Dundee, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich,
Reading, Sheffield, Southampton and York. Many private art collections
housed in historic family mansions, including those owned by the National
Trust, are open to the public. An increasing number of open air museums
depict the regional life of an area or preserve early industrial remains (for
example, the Weald and Downland Museum in Sussex, the North of England
Open Air Museum in Durham, and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in Salop
which won the first European Museum of the Year Award in 1978).
All national collections are financed chiefly from government funds. Besides
meeting administrative and maintenance costs, the Government provides
annual purchase grants (^6’5 million in 1978-79). It also provides special
purchase grants. Pre-eminent works of art accepted by the Government in
place of capital transfer tax are allocated to public collections.
Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or endow¬
ments, receive help in building up their collections through the annual

government grant administered by the Victoria and Albert, Science and Royal
Scottish Museums. Financial and practical assistance is also given to museums
and galleries by trusts and voluntary bodies, including the Calouste Gulben-
kian Foundation, the National Art Collections Fund, the Contemporary Art
Society and the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts.
The Government is advised on policy matters by the Standing Commission
on Museums and Galleries, which also promotes co-operation between
national and provincial institutions. Eight area museum councils, grant-aided
by the Government, provide technical services and advice on conservation,
display, documentation, publicity and other matters.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. It serves as a central body for the
collection of information and discussion of matters relating to museum adminis¬
tration, and as a training and examining body for professional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions provided by the Arts Councils, the national museums
and galleries, the Art Exhibitions Bureau and the area museum councils are a
regular feature of many museums. In London the Hayward Gallery, the
Tate Gallery, the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the
Royal Academy are the main centres for loan exhibitions; these are also held
at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, the Camden Arts Centre and the Institute of
Contemporary Arts. Commercial exhibitions are held in the galleries of the
London dealers. The Serpentine Gallery in London’s Kensington Gardens
houses Arts Council exhibitions of contemporary artists, and another small
gallery in London is run by the Crafts Advisory Committee.
There are a number of national art exhibiting societies, some of which,
notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in
London. The Royal Scottish Academy holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh.
An increasing number of amateur art societies throughout Britain hold local
exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts. There are also
children’s exhibitions, including the National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Art and design education is provided in maintained colleges of art, further
education colleges and polytechnics, which are administered by local education
authorities. Other institutions offering art and design courses include univer¬
sities, the Royal Academy Schools and some private art schools. At post¬
graduate level there is the Royal College of Art which awards its own degrees.
Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central (Art)
Institutions administered by the Scottish Education Department.
The leading academic institutions for the study of the history of art are the
Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department of Classical
Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the Warburg
Institute, also a part of London University.
Art has a place in all school curricula, and the Society for Education through
Art encourages, among other activities, the purchase by schools of original
works of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition. Pictures
may also be borrowed from many public libraries.
Government grants for the crafts, amounting to some £840,000 in 1978-79,
are administered in England and Wales by the Crafts Advisory Committee.
Set up in 1971 to advise the minister responsible for the arts on the needs of
artist-craftsmen, the committee also promotes exhibitions of work and gives
financial assistance to enable craftsmen to be trained and to establish or

expand their businesses. Its activities include crafts associated with conserva¬
tion and renovation. Scotland receives a separate government grant which is
similarly administered by the Joint Crafts Committee.
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned mainly
with encouraging the best in new building and conserving the best that has
been inherited from the past (for conservation, see p 162).
Several government departments, notably the Department of the Environ¬
ment, provide advice on building and architecture. In collaboration with the
Royal Institute of British Architects, the Secretary of State for the Environ¬
ment makes annual awards for good housing design in both the public and
private sectors. Royal Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for
Scotland advise the departments, planning authorities and other public
bodies on questions of public amenity or artistic importance.
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional
institution with a membership of 20,750 in Britain and 5,850 overseas. It
exercises control over standards in architectural education, and maintains one
of the largest architectural libraries in the world. The Royal Incorporation of
Architects in Scotland is allied to it.
Other bodies with an interest in architecture include the Civic Trust (see
p 172) which seeks to promote high standards in civic building and planning,
and the National Trust (see p 172) which acquires land and buildings in order
to protect them for the benefit of the public from harmful development. The
number of people visiting National Trust properties rose from just over a
million in i960 to more than 5 million in 1977.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges and
universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country, private
libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews are
featured in the press and on television and radio and there are numerous
periodicals concerned with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary
merit is provided by a number of awards, including the Booker, W. H. Smith
& Son, and Whitbread prizes. Awards to encourage young writers are made,
for instance, by the Somerset Maugham Trust Fund and the E. C. Gregory
Trust Fund.
Government help is given through the Arts Councils which support
literature in a number of ways, including grants awarded to writers, translators,
publishers, little presses and magazines. The title, Poet Laureate, is conferred
on a poet who receives a stipend as an officer of the Royal Household.
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and the
Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of His¬
torical, Philosophical and Philological Studies (known as the British Academy)
is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives a government grant.
Other specialist societies include the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals,
among which the Poetry Society and the Apollo Society are the best known.
There are also a number of clubs and societies, such as the New Fiction
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which distribute selected new books to
their members.
402
Books
Libraries
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1977 British publishers issued 36,000 separate titles: more than 27,000 new
ones, and over 8,000 reprints and new editions. An increasing proportion of
books—including specialised non-fiction—is sold in paperback form. Book
clubs make available hardback books at a lower price.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers’ Association. The British Council also publicises British books and
periodicals through its libraries in over 60 countries, its programme of book
exhibitions (263 exhibitions were mounted in 1977-78) and its bibliographical
publications including the monthly British Book News. The Book Development
Council promotes British books overseas. (For sales and exports of books in
1977 see p 232). The National Book League has a membership including
authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and readers. It encourages an
interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain and overseas.
The British Library, created in 1973 from a merger of the British Museum
Library with other libraries and institutions, is organised in three divisions.
The Reference Division includes the Department of Printed Books holding
nearly 10 million titles, the Department of Manuscripts, the Department of
Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books, and the Science Reference Library.
The Lending Division at Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, has nearly 2-9 million
volumes including some 47,000 current periodicals available on loan to other
libraries in Britain and overseas. It also has access to many millions of books in
other libraries and is the national centre for inter-library lending within
Britain and between Britain and foreign countries. The Bibliographic Services
Division processes the acquisitions of the British Library for inclusion in its
catalogues and provides other bibliographic services; it publishes the British
National Bibliography which lists in a classified order (with indexes) all new
books and new editions, excluding reprints, published in Britain. The British
Library automatically receives a copy of each new book, pamphlet or news¬
paper published in Britain. In addition the National Library of Scotland, the
National Library of Wales, the Bodleian Library of Oxford University and the
Cambridge University Library are entitled to claim copies. The Government
has announced plans to start work on a new building for the British Library
in London during 1979-80. When completed the building will cater for about
3,500 readers, will carry a stock of 25 million books and have a staff of some
2,500. The building will cover 3-80 hectares (9-5 acres). The first stage will
take about ten years to complete and will cost an estimated £77 million.
London’s Victoria and Albert Museum and Natural History Museum,
correctly known as the British Museum (Natural History), also have large
libraries and many government departments have old-established libraries of
considerable size and importance. The Public Record Office contains the
records of the superior courts of law and of most government departments, as
well as such famous historical documents as Domesday Book. In Scotland,
the Scottish Record Office serves the same purposes. The National Register of
Archives (maintained by the Historical Manuscripts Commission) contains
particulars of local and private records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the Signet Library,
Edinburgh, and the London Library, there are the rich resources of the learned
societies and institutions (for scientific societies and institutions, see p 383).
Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the
Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal
Libraries in
Education

Society of Edinburgh, the British Theatre Association, the Royal Academy of
Music, the National Library for the Blind and the National Book League.
Many libraries have collections of records and musical scores for loan to
the public. The City of Westminster houses the Central Music Library
which lends to other libraries and to individuals. Another well-known collec¬
tion is the Henry Watson Music Library at the Manchester Central Library.
The ancient university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge are not matched by
any of the more recent foundations, although the combined library resources of
the colleges and institutions of the University of London total some 5'5 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Manchester contains some
2 million volumes, and the university libraries of Edinburgh and Glasgow
have over 1 million volumes each, while Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and
St Andrews each has over 750,000 volumes. Many universities have built
up large and important research collections in special subjects; for example,
the Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham, and the British Library of
Political and Economic Science at the London School of Economics. Other
universities and the polytechnics are also building collections.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, often receive important support services from the public library
service, including loans of books.
Britain is served by a network of public libraries, administered by local
public library authorities. These libraries have a total stock of some 114
million books (not including the libraries in publicly maintained schools).
Qualified and specialist staff are available for consultation in all but the
smallest service points. About one-third of the total population are members of
public libraries. The Secretary of State for Education and Science is responsible
for the supervision of the public library service in England and is advised by
the Library Advisory Council for England. The Secretary of State for Wales
has similar responsibility in Wales and is advised by the Library Advisory
Council for Wales. Public library authorities in England and Wales have a
duty to provide an efficient and (with some limitations) free lending and
reference library service of books and periodicals. They maintain nearly 5,000
public library service points; some areas may be served by mobile libraries, of
which almost 600 are in service, and domiciliary services exist for people who
are unable to visit a library. In Scotland local authorities have a duty to provide
library facilities, and similar duties are imposed on education and library
boards in Northern Ireland.
In addition to lending books, most library authorities now lend gramophone
records of various kinds and a number also lend from collections of works of
art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all libraries provide children’s
departments, while reference sections and art, music, commercial and technical
departments meet the growing and more specific demands in these fields.
Most libraries possess a significant collection of books and documents on the
history of their localities.
The public library is often a centre for local cultural activities. Film shows,
lectures, adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramo¬
phone recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities pro¬
vided by or based upon the local library.
A voluntary system of library co-operation in England and Wales has grown
up since the first quarter of this century. The eight regional library bureaux in
4°4
Library
Associations
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
England and Wales (consisting mainly of public libraries in each area) aim to be
largely self-sufficient in the interlending of current British books, achieved in
some regions by a system of co-operative subject specialisation. The British
Library is responsible for national and international inter-library lending.
A number of local schemes for the exchange of specialist titles and informa¬
tion involve industrial, commercial and sometimes university libraries, and
are normally centred on a major public or technical college library.
The National Library of Scotland and the National Library of Wales carry
out functions similar to those of the regional bureaux and the lending division
of the British Library. In Northern Ireland access to the stocks of all co¬
operating libraries is available on application to the libraries under the control
of the five education and library boards and to the Queen’s University and
New University of Ulster libraries.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association. It maintains
a Register of Chartered Librarians, publishes books, pamphlets and official
journals, and holds regular conferences. There are also associations of libraries,
for example, the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux
and the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries.
21 The Press
Ownership
More daily newspapers, national and regional, are sold per person in Britain
than in most other countries. Despite a slight long-term decline in national
newspaper sales, some papers have circulations comparable with the largest
in the world. National papers have a total circulation of about 14 million on
weekdays and 19 million on Sundays, and a total readership nearly three
times greater.
The press caters for a variety of political views, interests and levels of
education. It is subject neither to state control nor to censorship.
Although pronounced views may be expressed in some newspapers and
their political leanings may be obvious, they are almost always financially
independent of any political party and are not obliged to follow any specific
party line. In order to preserve their character and traditions, a few news¬
papers and periodicals are governed by arrangements which vest ownership
of the undertaking in trustees, or operate it in accordance with a deed of trust,
or provide that the transfer of shares be controlled by trustees. Others have
management arrangements to ensure editors’ authority and independence.
Unlike most of its European counterparts the British press receives no
subsidies and relatively few tax and postal concessions. Newspaper and
magazine sales and advertising receipts are zero-rated for value-added tax
purposes. Registered newspapers receive a concession on postal rates, and
there are concessions on ‘per-word’ rates for international press telegrams and
phototelegrams. In common with all postal customers, newspaper and maga¬
zine publishers can obtain reduced charges for regular bulk postings.
About 130 daily (Monday to Saturday) and Sunday newspapers and over
1,000 weekly newspapers are published. These figures include certain special¬
ised papers with circulations limited not by region but by interest; for
instance, business newspapers, sporting newspapers, newspapers in foreign
languages for people of other countries resident in Britain and religious
newspapers. Newsprint forms roughly a third of average national newspaper
costs. Three-quarters of Britain’s requirements are imported.
A Royal Commission on the Press reported in 1976 on the economic
problems of the national newspaper industry, recommending investment in
new equipment and rationalisation of the use of manpower. The Royal
Commission’s final report in 1977 covered the press as a whole and made
recommendations on a wide range of matters, including editorial standards,
concentration of ownership, industrial relations, the economics of the press,
the training of journalists and the role of the Press Council. The Royal Com¬
mission’s reports are listed in the Bibliography (see p 453).
Newspaper ownership, as it affects the national, London-evening and regional
daily newspapers, is concentrated mainly in the hands of a comparatively small
number of large press publishing groups (see, for example, the details of the
groups controlling the national press which are given in Table 33).
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The large national newspaper
and periodical publishers are major corporations with diversified interests
over the whole field of publishing and communications; some have shares in
406
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
independent television and radio contracting companies; and others are
involved in industrial and commercial activities which have no connection
with publishing or the mass media.
The law provides safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentra¬
tion of the means of communication. For instance, if it appears that newspaper
shareholdings in television programme companies have led or are leading to
results which are contrary to the public interest, the Independent Broadcasting
Authority may, with the consent of the Home Secretary, notify the companies
that their programmes may cease to be transmitted. There is a similar stipula¬
tion for independent local radio; if a local newspaper has a monopoly in the
area, it is not allowed to have a controlling interest in the local radio station.
In addition, it is unlawful to transfer a newspaper or newspaper assets to a
proprietor whose newspapers have an average daily circulation amounting,
with that of the newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more copies
unless the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection gives
written consent. Except in certain limited cases, which include transfers of
very small newspapers, consent may be given only after the Secretary of State
has referred the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and
received its report.
The ‘National’
Press
English
Regional
Newspapers
Nine morning daily papers and seven Sunday papers (see Table 33) circulate
throughout the country, and are known as national newspapers. All are pro¬
duced in London (where Fleet Street is the traditional centre for the press),
but five of the dailies and four of the Sundays also print northern editions in
Manchester (accounting for about a quarter of the total production of the
national press). Prices of the national newspapers vary from yp to 15P for the
dailies and i2p to 22p for the Sundays.
The leading Scottish papers, The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald, have a
considerable circulation outside Scotland. Each of London s two evening
papers has a distinctive style and draws its readership from a wide area, but
both have ownership affiliations with a national daily (see Table 33).
National newspapers are often divided into ‘quality’ and ‘popular papers on
the basis of differences in format (broadsheet or tabloid, though this is not a
rigid distinction), style and content. Four dailies and three Sundays are usually
described as quality newspapers. The three Sunday qualities produce colour
supplements which are distributed as part of the paper.
The slight long-term decline in newspaper circulations conceals the different
experiences of individual papers and the fact that, while the circulation of the
popular press as a whole has declined over the years, that of the quality press
has generally remained steady.
The regional newspapers of England (outside London, 78 morning or evening
dailies and Sundays and some 700 newspapers appearing once or twice a week)
provide mainly regional and local news. The daily newspapers also give
coverage to national affairs, and a number co-operate to provide their own
foreign news service.
Generally speaking, regional evening newspapers are non-political, while
the morning newspapers adopt a more positive political stance and tend to be
independent or conservative in outlook.
The total circulation of the regional morning and evening papers is esti¬
mated at over 6 million. Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post (Leeds)
and the Northern Echo (Darlington) have circulations of over 100,000 and
two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and
THE PRESS

of over 340,000. Weekly papers are mainly of local appeal; they are also a
valuable medium for local advertising. Most have circulations in the 5,000-
40,000 range.
There are also many free distribution advertising newspapers (mostly
weekly), some published by orthodox newspaper publishers.
The London local weeklies (120) include papers for every district in Greater
London. They circulate in as many as six to eight local editions of individual
papers, affiliated in some cases to larger groups.
A number of evening newspapers, using the latest production technology,
are published in the outer metropolitan area on the fringe of the circulation
areas of the two London evening newspapers.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in
Cardiff; its circulation of just under 100,000 is mainly in south Wales. In
north Wales the Liverpool Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the
area. Evening papers published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff;
the South Wales Argus, Newport; the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea;
and the Evening Leader, Wrexham. Their circulation range is between 22,000
and 120,000. North Wales is also served by the Liverpool Echo, the Shropshire
Star covers parts of mid and north Wales, and there is coverage to a smaller
extent by the Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (nearly 60) includes English language papers, some of
which carry articles in Welsh, bilingual papers, and Welsh language papers.
Scotland has six morning, six evening and three Sunday newspapers. The
morning papers, with circulations of between 89,000 and 712,000, are The
Scotsman published in Edinburgh; the Glasgow Herald', the Daily Record
(sister paper to the Daily Mirror)-, the Dundee Courier and Advertiser-, the
Aberdeen Press and Journal-, and the Scottish Daily Express (published only in
Manchester although production in Inverness is also planned). The evening
papers have circulations in the range of 16,000 to 212,000 and are the Evening
News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph
and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the
Greenock Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, the Sunday
Post and the Scottish Sunday Express.
Weekly and local newspapers number about 130, of which the Hamilton
Advertiser and the Falkirk Herald have the largest circulations.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening paper and one
Sunday paper, all published in Belfast with circulations ranging from 50,00010
170,000. They are The News-Letter (Unionist) and the Irish Nezvs (Nationalist),
the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday News.
There are over 40 weekly newspapers.
The 4,300 periodical publications are classified as ‘general’, ‘specialised’,
‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’. There are also about 635 ‘house maga¬
zines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or public services
for the benefit of their employees and/or clients. The ‘alternative’ press
probably includes a further 500 titles, most of which are devoted to radical
politics, community matters, religion, the occult, science or ecology.
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all
denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,
THE PRESS

hobbies and humour; journals specialising in various subjects such as politics,
finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts; and the
publications of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and
other organisations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Radio Times and TV
Times which have circulations of over 3 million and Woman's Weekly, Woman's
Own, Woman, Weekly News (which sells mainly in Scotland) and My Weekly
with circulations in the 800,000 to i-6 million range. The leading journals of
opinion are The Economist, a politically independent publication covering
topics from a wider angle than its title implies; the New Statesman, which is
a review of politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist
political tendency; the Spectator, which covers much the same subjects from
an independent conservative standpoint; Tribune, which represents the views
of the left-wing of the Labour Party; New Society, covering the sociological
aspects of current affairs; and New Scientist, which reports on science and
technology in terms which the non-specialist can understand. Punch, tradi¬
tionally the leading humorous periodical, and Private Eye, a satirical fort¬
nightly, also devote attention to public affairs.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, appeal generally
speaking to the more serious type of reader.
The publication of trade, technical, business, scientific and professional
journals (covering hundreds of subjects, many of them in considerable depth)
has become one of the more important aspects of the British publishing
industry. In addition to circulating in Britain, these journals have a con¬
siderable circulation overseas and are an important medium for selling British
goods. Their publication ranges in frequency from weekly to quarterly.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout Britain. In Wales
there are also several monthly and quarterly journals published in both
Welsh and English; in Scotland there are three monthly illustrated periodicals,
a weekly paper devoted to farming interests, a number of literary journals
(of which the most famous is probably Blackwood's), and numerous popular
magazines; and Northern Ireland has weekly, monthly and quarterly publica¬
tions covering farming, the linen industry, building, motoring, politics and
social work.
New Technology New techniques are continually being introduced into all the stages of news¬
paper production, but the national newspapers are generally concentrating
investment in the composing and plate-making processes. The introduction
of new technology in these departments involves computerised photocom¬
position in place of Linotype machine composition, and substitutes electronic
and chemical methods of plate-making for manual. These methods allow
savings to be made with newspapers’ labour costs and have been adopted
particularly by the provincial press where composing represents a very high
proportion of total costs.
News Agencies There are three principal British news agencies registered in Britain:
Reuters Ltd; The Press Association Ltd; and The Exchange Telegraph
Company Ltd.
Reuters Ltd, a world news organisation, is owned by four associations: the
Newspaper Publishers Association; The Press Association; the Australian
Associated Press; and the New Zealand Press Association. They are parties
to a trust deed which safeguards the independence and integrity of the news
service. Founded in Aachen in 1850 and transferred to London in 1851,

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Training for
Journalism
Reuters now has about 1,150 correspondents in 183 countries and territories,
and links with 120 national or private news agencies, which give it access to
coverage by many hundreds of local reporters. Some 700,000 words of
general news, sports, and economic reports are received in London every day
and are retransmitted to 154 countries and territories over a global network
of leased teleprinter lines, satellite links and cable and radio circuits. These
news services are specially tailored to the needs of recipients in Britain and
overseas, and are distributed to information media, either direct or through
national news agencies. Reuters Economic Services, one of the world’s
largest financial and business news services, supplies information to business
houses throughout the world by means of computer-based video display
units, teleprinters and bulletins.
The Press Association Ltd, the British national news agency founded in
1868, is co-operatively owned by the principal newspapers of the United
Kingdom outside London, and of the Irish Republic. It provides newspapers,
the broadcasting organisations, Reuters (of which it is a major joint owner)
and other international agencies with a complete service of home news, includ¬
ing general and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all branches of financial,
commercial and sports news; and includes in its services to regional papers the
world news of Reuters and the Associated Press. News is teleprinted 24 hours
a day from head office in London over a network of lines leased from the
Post Office-certain items being available in teletypesetting form. Through
its photographic department The Press Association serves London and
regional newspapers with a daily picture service from home and overseas;
these are wired to the regional press. Its Special Reporting Service supplies
reports of local or special interest to daily and weekly papers and periodicals.
Press Association Features provides exclusive rights to syndicated articles and
visual features.
The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd (Extel), an independent news
agency founded in 1872, is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Exchange Tele¬
graphy Company (Holdings) Ltd, a public company. It supplies financial
and sporting news to newspapers and broadcasting organisations. In con¬
junction with The Press Association Ltd, racing services are also supplied
by teleprinter and telephone to subscribers in London and the provinces from
offices in all important cities and towns.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Asso¬
ciated Press Ltd, and by United Press International, which are British
subsidiaries of United States news agencies.
A number of other British, Commonwealth and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,
mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some countries,
but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which repre¬
sents the principal press organisations, sets and conducts examinations, and
organises short training courses for journalists.
The two methods of entry into newspaper journalism are selection for a
one-year NCTJ pre-entry course or direct recruitment by a regional or local
newspaper. Both categories of entrant take part in an apprenticeship scheme
consisting of‘on-the-job’ training, and block release courses for those who have
not attended a pre-entry course. A number of centres provide courses for
reporters. Other training facilities include one-year postgraduate courses in

journalism at the University College of South Wales in Cardiff, and at the City
University (London), and courses provided by the Newspaper Society
Training Service for regional newspapers in such subjects as circulation,
advertising, industrial relations and management.
The NCTJ co-operates closely with the Printing and Publishing Industry
Training Board which is responsible for training in printing, publishing and
professional photography.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Harry Brittain Memorial Fellow¬
ship Scheme, several young Commonwealth journalists each year spend three
months working and studying in Britain. The Thomson Foundation holds
training courses for journalists from all parts of the world at its studies
centre in Cardiff, and provides consultants and tutors for courses in journalism
held overseas.
The most important organisations to which employers in the industry belong
are the Newspaper Publishers Association, whose members publish national
newspapers in London and Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which repre¬
sents the regional, local and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily
Newspaper Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday news¬
papers in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which
represents the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern
Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly news¬
papers in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines.
On the journalists’ side there are the Institute of Journalists (IOJ), with
some 2,300 members, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), with
29,600 members. All practising journalists (including those engaged in radio,
television, public relations, freelance journalism and book publishing editorial
work) are eligible for membership of either. Four main printing unions are
concerned with the press.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors with about 450 members aims to
maintain the professional status and independence of editors, defend the
freedom of the press, and improve the education and training of journalists.
The British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation
to which most editors of house journals belong.
The Press Council has a membership consisting of equal numbers of press and
non-press members, with an independent chairman. Its aims are: to preserve
the established freedom of the press; to maintain the character of the press in
accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of
the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press (the
Council’s complaints committee comprises equal numbers of press and non¬
press members); to report on developments in the press which may tend
towards greater concentration or monopoly; to make representation on
appropriate occasions to the Government, to organs of the United Nations
and to press organisations abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodic
reports recording its work; and to review from time to time developments in
the press and the factors affecting them. The Council publishes annual reports,
which include statistics of the newspaper and periodical press and a series of
articles examining the structure of the leading press groups.

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Press and
the Law
The press has generally the same freedom as the individual to comment on
matters of public interest.
Apart from enactments relating directly to such matters as the registration
of newspapers for postal purposes, there are no specific press laws but certain
statutes include sections which apply to the press. These relate to such matters
as the extent of newspaper ownership in television and radio companies; the
transfer of newspaper assets; the drawing up between employers and unions
of ‘closed shop’ membership agreements1; restrictions on the reporting of
preliminary hearings of indictable offences (in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland); the right of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local
authorities; restrictions on the publication of (a) certain details of divorce,
domestic and rape proceedings in courts of law, (b) legal proceedings involving
children, (c) advertisement and investment circulars, which are governed by
Acts dealing with the publication of false or misleading descriptions of goods
and services and with fraud, and (d) advertisements of remedies for certain
diseases, which are covered by public health legislation; agreements between
the Post Office and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communications,
which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions on certain types
of prize competition; and copyrights, which come under copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the press are the laws on libel and contempt of
court. A newspaper may not publish comments on the conduct of judicial
proceedings which are likely to prejudice their reputation for fairness before
or during the actual proceedings nor may it publish before or during a trial
anything which might tend to influence the result. The obtaining and publica¬
tion of information from state and official sources of a confidential or security
nature is affected by the Official Secrets Acts. Newspapers are also liable to
proceedings for seditious libel and incitement to disaffection.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority are libel actions brought by private individuals. In such cases, the
editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and distributor of the newspaper, as well
as the author of the article, may all be held responsible.
1 In order to safeguard the interests of journalists, contributors and others involved in
writing newspaper articles, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Act
1976 provides for the drawing up of a charter containing practical guidance on matters
affecting the freedom of the press. Following talks within the industry the Secretary
of State for Employment is holding consultations about provisions for a charter.
The Royal Commission on the Press recommended a number of safeguards it considered
essential, together with voluntary methods for securing them.
22 Television and Radio
The British
Broadcasting
Corporation
All British broadcasting is based on the tradition that it is a public service
accountable to the people through Parliament. Television and radio are the
responsibility of two broadcasting authorities, the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA),
which work to broad requirements and objectives placed on them by Parlia¬
ment, but are quite independent in the day-to-day conduct of business.
The BBC operates two national television channels, four national radio
services and 20 local radio stations. It also broadcasts to countries overseas
through its External Services division. The IBA supervises the operation of a
single television channel (Independent Television, ITV) and 19 local radio
stations. The Home Secretary regulates broadcasting generally under the
Wireless Telegraphy Acts 1949 and 1967 which prohibit the sending or
receiving of wireless communications except under licence. He is answerable
to Parliament on broad policy questions, and may issue directions on a
number of technical and other matters.
Television viewing is by far the most popular leisure pastime in Britain,
and some 96 per cent of the population have television in their homes. It is
estimated that about 10 per cent of households have two or more sets. Average
viewing time per person is over 17 hours a week. Practically every home also
has a radio set, and car radios and portable sets have made radio, national and
local, one of the country’s major day-time diversions.
Households with television sets must buy a licence each year—£9 for black
and white sets, £21 for colour. Of about 18 million licences current in April
1978 approximately 11 million were for colour and 7 million for black and
white television. The revenue from licences meets most of the cost of the
BBC’s domestic services. Independent television and independent local radio
are self-supporting, with revenue drawn from the sale of advertising time.
In July 1978 the Government published proposals for the future constitu¬
tion, structure and organisation of broadcasting, resulting from its considera¬
tion of the Annan Committee’s report on the future of domestic broadcasting
(see Bibliography, p 453). (For some of the main proposals, see p 419.)
The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by the Royal Charter
and by a Licence and Agreement. The Corporation consists of 12 governors
(including a chairman, a vice-chairman and separate national governors for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each appointed by the Queen on the
advice of the Government. The governors are responsible for the whole
broadcasting operation, including television and radio programmes and
installations and equipment. Committees advise them on such matters as the
social effects of television, religious broadcasting, music, agriculture, schools
broadcasting, further education, programmes for immigrants, science and
engineering and charitable appeals. There is also a programme complaints
commission. The governors appoint the chief executive officer (the Director
General) with whom they discuss major matters of policy and finance. He is
chairman of the BBC’s board of management, which also includes the mana¬
ging directors for television, radio and external broadcasting, and the directors
of personnel, finance, public affairs and engineering.

The Independent
Broadcasting
Authority
The Programme
Companies
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales control the
policy and content of television and radio programmes intended primarily for
reception in their respective countries. Local radio councils, representative of
the local community, are appointed by the BBC to advise on the development
and operation of local radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally by the income
from the sale of television licences less certain deductions for collection and
other expenses. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities, in¬
cluding television programme exports, the sale of records and publications
connected with BBC programmes, the hire and sale of educational films, film
library sales and exhibitions based on programmes and other BBC activities.
Nearly three-quarters of the BBC’s expenditure on domestic services relates
to television. The BBC meets the cost of local radio stations but some local
education authorities help to make educational programmes.
The BBC’s External Services are financed by a grant determined each year
by the Government.
The IBA’s constitution and finances are governed by the Independent Broad¬
casting Authority legislation and a Licence. It consists of a chairman, a
deputy chairman and nine other members (three of whom have responsibility
for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) appointed by the Home Secretary.
The IBA does not itself produce radio or television programmes; these are
provided by commercial programme companies. Its main functions are to
appoint the companies, to supervise programme arrangements, to control
advertising and to build, own and operate transmitting stations.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broad¬
casting, religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist
panel advises on medical and allied advertisements. A Complaints Review
Board reviews reports of complaints received and investigated by the IBA s
staff. Local advisory committees provide advice on local radio services.
The chief executive officer of the IBA, the Director General, is supported
by a headquarters and regional office staff covering all technical and admini¬
strative services.
The IBA’s finance comes from annual rental payments made by the tele¬
vision and radio programme companies. The television programme companies
also pay to the IBA, for transfer to the Government, a levy related to their
profits.
Fifteen television programme companies hold contracts to provide television
programmes in the 14 independent television regions (two companies share
the contract for London, one providing programmes during the week and
the other at the weekend). The companies operate on a commercial basis,
deriving their revenue from the sale of advertising time. The financial resources,
advertising revenue and programme production of the companies vary
considerably, depending largely on the size of population in the areas in
which they operate.
Although newspapers can acquire an interest in programme companies, there
are safeguards to prevent their shareholdings leading to results contrary to the
public interest.
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the pro¬
grammes to be broadcast in its area. These consist partly of material produced
by the company itself, partly of that produced by the other programme com-
TELEVISION AND RADIO
415
Television
panics, and partly of that purchased from elsewhere. The five largest companies
(Thames, ATV, Granada, Yorkshire and London Weekend) produce a larger
proportion of their own programmes and provide more programmes for
broadcast elsewhere on the national network than do the smaller ones. A common
news service is provided by Independent Television News Ltd., a non-profit-
making company in which all the programme companies are shareholders. The
negotiations concerning the supply, exchange and purchase of programmes and
their co-ordinated transmission through the independent television network
take place largely on the Network Planning Committee which consists of
representatives of all the programme companies and of the IBA.
Local radio is broadcast by independent stations on the same principles.
The companies providing programmes are under contract to the IBA,
operate under its control and are financed by advertising revenue. News
coverage is supplied as a common service by Independent Radio News. In
certain circumstances local newspapers have a right to a share in the control
of local radio companies.
\\ hen a company, on the basis of negotiations with the other companies, has
decided on a programme schedule for its area, it is required to submit this to the
IBA for approval. The IBA has wide-ranging powers to regulate the content
and quality of programmes; for example, it ensures that a ‘proper balance’ of
views is expressed and, for television, has drawn up a code on violence which
includes special precautions to be taken when children are likely to be
viewing.
Three television channels are in operation: BBC-i and ITV broadcasting on
both 405 lines very high frequency (vhf) and 625 lines ultra high frequency
(uhf), and BBC-2 which broadcasts on 625 lines uhf only. Some 99 per cent
of the population live within range of vhf, and almost 98 per cent within range
of uhf transmissions, which are still being extended. The vhf transmissions
are expected to cease within a few years. A high proportion of programmes on
the three uhf services is transmitted in colour, though they can also be
received in black and white. Most television sets are designed to receive four
channels, and the Government has made proposals for a new type of service
to be provided on the fourth channel (see p 419).
Apart from a break during the war years the BBC has been providing
regular television broadcasts since i93^‘ All BBC-2 programmes and the
majority of those on BBC-i are broadcast on the national network. Of the
BBC s 1976-77 television output over 44 per cent was produced in London
and 36 per cent elsewhere in Britain, 11 per cent comprised feature films and
series, and 9 per cent Open University programmes. Current affairs, features,
documentary, news, schools, further education, Open University and religious
programmes comprised some 46 per cent of the total.
Through co-ordinated planning of programmes on its two services the BBC
is able to cater simultaneously for people of differing interests. While both
services cover the whole range of television output, BBC-i presents a higher
proportion of programmes of general interest, such as light entertainment,
sport, current affairs, children’s programmes and outside broadcasts, while
BBC-2 places greater emphasis on minority interests, providing a larger
element of documentaries, travel programmes, serious drama, music, pro¬
grammes on pastimes and international films.
The first regular independent television broadcasts began in London in 1955.
ITV services are provided on a regional basis by the programme companies.

BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
On average every ITV region transmitted nearly 103 hours of television each
week in 1977, nearly two-fifths of which comprised informative programmes—
including news, documentaries, current affairs, education and religion. Nearly
three-quarters of the programmes seen on ITV are produced by the pro¬
gramme companies themselves. There are about three short advertising
intervals an hour, during and between programmes.
British television programmes have won many international awards, and the
country is one of the world’s foremost exporters of television productions.
It is estimated that Britain exports roughly £25 million-worth of television
programmes a year, and there are few countries in the world where British
programmes have not been shown.
Over 14 per cent of households with television rely on cable systems for the
reception of programmes. The systems are usually used to improve reception
quality, to avoid ‘screening’ by buildings or the local topography, or because
external aerials are not allowed in some residential buildings. There are cable
networks in almost every urban area; some cover a whole town, some homes
scattered throughout an area, and others particular housing estates. Of some
2-6 million subscribers to cable networks in 1978 nearly i-6 million subscribed
to commercial systems, 909,000 to systems operated by local authorities and
other non-commercial bodies, and nearly 85,000 to housing associations’
systems. Commercial relay operators are represented by The Cable Tele¬
vision Association of Great Britain. All operators of cable systems are licensed
by the Home Secretary and the Post Office.
In the past few years several experiments have been authorised for local
stations to distribute locally-originated material by cable systems to sub¬
scribers. Three stations are still in operation. At Greenwich in London funds
are provided by the local commercial cable television company, while at
Swindon they are provided by a number of non-commercial bodies and from
the promotion of a weekly lottery. At Milton Keynes the new town develop¬
ment corporation is using public funds to provide locally-originated pro¬
grammes over the Post Office cable system. All the experiments enable people
not only to see programmes about local activities but also to participate in
making programmes.
BBC Radio’s four national channels each have a distinct character. Radio 1
provides a programme of pop music, while Radio 2 provides light music as
well as being the principal channel for the coverage of sport. Radio 3 provides
mainly classical music (much of which is in stereo) and in the evening offers,
in addition, adult education programmes and works of artistic and intellectual
interest. Radio 4 is the main speech programme, providing the principal
news and information service as well as a wide range of drama, music, talks,
entertainment and schools broadcasts. Many radio programmes are trans¬
mitted in stereo.
Local radio is provided by 20 BBC stations in England and by 19 indepen¬
dent stations distributed throughout Britain. Local broadcasts provide a
comprehensive service of local news and information, music and other enter¬
tainment, education, consumer advice and coverage of local events, and offer
residents a chance to air their views, often by using the phone-in technique.
Five experiments in locally-initiated sound programmes over cable distribu¬
tion systems are being licensed. By August 1978 two experimental stations, at
Newton Aycliffe and Thamesmead, were in operation.

The BBC broadcasts to most countries overseas (in 39 languages, including

unbiased news, to reflect British opinion and to project British life and
culture. News bulletins, current affairs programmes, political commentaries
and topical magazine programmes form the main part of the output. A full
sports service, all kinds of music, drama, and a wide range of general enter¬
tainment are also included.
The languages in which the External Services broadcast and the length of
time each language is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart from
this the BBC has full responsibility and it is completely independent in deter¬
mining the content of news and other programmes.
The foreign language services are divided into areas: the African, Arabic,
Eastern, Far Eastern, Latin American, French (to Europe and Africa),
Central European, South European, German and East European Services.
Broadcasts range from 45 hours a week in Arabic to 35 minutes in Maltese.
A review of the service is in progress.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive
language teaching undertaking in the world. English lessons are broadcast
weekly by radio with explanations in 26 other languages, and recorded lessons
are supplied to some 280 stations in 90 countries. English by Television pro¬
grammes are shown in more than 60 countries.
The BBC World Service broadcasts for 24 hours a day in English and is
supplemented at peak listening times by additional series of programmes
designed to be of special interest to Africa.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are rebroadcast by the domestic
radio services of many countries. Rebroadcasting involves direct relays from
BBC transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through the
BBC tape and disc transcription service. There are some 3,000 rebroadcasts
weekly of World Service programmes in about 50 countries. The Transcription
Service offers programmes to some no countries.
Another part of the External Services is the Monitoring Service which listens
to and reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news
and comment from overseas to the BBC, the press, and the Government.
The BBC External Services are complemented by the radio services of the
Central Office of Information (COI) which produce a range of material for
transmission by radio stations overseas. In addition, COI television services
provide material such as documentary and magazine programmes for distri¬
bution to overseas television stations.
The BBC’s domestic television and radio services operate from over 1,000
transmitters, and its external services from some 47 transmitters in Britain and
32 overseas. Most of the circuits used to link studios and transmitters are
rented from the Post Office. For its domestic radio, the BBC uses 101 studios
in London and the regions, and for its external services 52 in London. In
addition, there are semi-automatic studios which can be operated by pro¬
gramme officials without engineering staff. Each BBC local radio station has
at least two studios. BBC television productions come from main studios at
the Televis^n Centre in west London and other studios in various parts of
London, and six fully-equipped regional studio centres and eight television
studios in other towns. Outside broadcasting is covered by a number of
mobile units.
The IB A uses a total of more than 400 television and sound radio trans¬
mitting stations throughout Britain, programme links being rented from the
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Post Office. Independent television programmes are produced at 18 studio
centres throughout the country. These studios reflect the IBA’s policy of
encouraging regional television, and the programmes are designed for either
local broadcasting or for national transmission. All companies have facilities
for colour transmission.
Advertising
Political
Broadcasting
Technical
Developments
The BBC does not give publicity to any individual firm or organised interest by
mentioning its name or branded products, except when it is necessary in order
to provide effective and informative programmes. Under the terms of its
licence and agreement it must not broadcast sponsored programmes.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television but there is no
sponsoring of programmes by advertisers. Advertisements must be clearly
distinguishable and separate from programmes, and the amount of time
given to advertising must not be so great as to detract from the value of the
programmes as a medium of information, education and entertainment. In
any one hour of broadcasting the amount of advertising time on independent
television is normally limited to seven minutes. Averaged over the day’s
programmes it must not exceed six minutes per hour. The independent local
radio stations are normally limited to up to nine minutes of advertising each
hour. The IBA has drawn up a code governing standards and practice in
advertising on television and radio and giving guidance about the types and
methods of advertisement that may not be used. Some types of advertising are
prohibited, notably those with a political or religious object or on behalf of
cigarettes or betting. Advertisements may not be inserted in certain types of
programme, such as broadcasts to schools.
Government publicity material designed to support non-political cam¬
paigns may be broadcast on independent radio and television. It is prepared
through the COI and is broadcast and paid for on a normal commercial basis.
The Government has no general access to radio or television. Short public
service features on safety, health and welfare schemes are also produced for
free transmission by the BBC and ITV.
Broadcasts on political issues include a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament, transmitted on BBC’s Radio 4 when Parliament is in
session, and there is frequent coverage of political subjects in news bulletins and
current affairs programmes on both radio and television. Ministerial and party
political broadcasts are transmitted periodically under rules agreed between
the major political parties, the BBC and the IBA. Certain parliamentary
proceedings are broadcast on radio.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and engineering
staffs of the BBC, the IBA, the Home Office, the Post Office, the Government,
and the radio industry. Advances by the BBC have included the electronic
conversion of monochrome and colour television pictures between the Euro¬
pean and the American systems, and the development of a sound-and-vision
system known as ‘sound-in-syncs’ which enables the television sound and
picture to be carried over a single 625-line vision circuit, and thus eliminates the
operational complexity and expense of a separate circuit for the sound. IBA
engineers were the first in the world to introduce a fully digital field rate stand¬
ards converter (DICE) to improve the interchange of programmes between
areas using the 525-lines system (for example, North America) and those using
the 625-lines system (for example, Europe).
Both the BBC and IBA have produced ‘teletext’ systems, known respec¬
tively as CEEFAX and ORACLE, which allow the broadcasting of written

and simple graphical information to television receivers fitted with special
adaptors. Both systems enable viewers to select a display of ‘pages’ of written
information on the television screen ‘Prestel’, a service providing a wide
range of information via the telephone which can be displayed on the screen
of a television receiver is being developed by the Post Office (see p 308).
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
EBU manages Eurovision, is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes over that network
and for intercontinental satellite links, and maintains a technical monitoring
station where frequency measurements and other observations on broad¬
casting stations are carried out.
The BBC belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association whose
members extend to each other such facilities as the use of studios, recording
channels, and programme contributions. The BBC also provides technical aid,
particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting organisations throughout
the world; members of the BBC’s staff are seconded for service overseas.
The BBC is a partner in Visnews, which supplies a service of world news-
film to some 134 television organisations in 94 countries and is the most widely
used newsfilm agency in the world. The BBC is also a member of the Inter¬
national Television Federation (Intertel), which produces high-quality
information programmes which are exchanged overseas. United Press Inter¬
national, Paramount Pictures and Independent Television News jointly
provide an international newsfilm service to more than 100 overseas
television organisations via the Eurovision network and by satellite.
The Government spends a considerable amount each year on broadcasting
training for overseas students and largely finances the British Council (see
p 151), which includes in its activities training in educational television and
radio for members of broadcasting organisations overseas. Training in tele¬
vision work is also provided for overseas trainees at the Thomson Television
College in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a charitable trust.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Tele¬
communication Union (ITU), the United Nations specialised agency respon¬
sible for the regulation and control of all international telecommunication
services (including radio and television), for the allocation and registration of
all radio frequencies and, through its international consultative committees,
for the promotion and co-ordination of the international study of technical
problems in broadcasting. The BBC is also represented on the United King¬
dom Committee of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
Government proposals for the future of domestic television and radio were
announced in July 1978. A few of the main points are mentioned below.
The BBC and the IBA would continue to be responsible for the broadcasting
service they already provide, and the I BA’s supervisory responsibilities
would be extended to embrace cable services, including pilot schemes of pay-
television and other forms of local broadcasting. Both the BBC and the IBA
would be authorised to establish a number of new local radio stations.
An Open Broadcasting Authority would be established to provide a fourth-
channel television service in which priority would be given to education,
interests not catered for on the three existing channels, and programmes
produced outside the existing broadcasting organisations. A Welsh language
420
BRITAIN I979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
service would be given priority on the fourth channel in Wales. The pro¬
posed Authority would not make programmes itself. Some finance would
come from the Government, especially in the early years, but advertising
would also be a source of revenue.
Changes are proposed in the BBC’s internal structure so as to distance the
governors from detailed involvement in management and to enable them to
concentrate more on their supervisory and regulatory functions. Proposals are
made for changes in the governing instruments of the BBC and the IB A so
that they may better meet the special needs of Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
Broadcasting authorities would from time to time conduct public hearings
to sound out people’s views, and an independent Broadcasting Complaints
Commission would be set up to adjudicate complaints of misrepresentation,
unfairness or invasion of privacy.

There is widespread interest in sport in Britain. Large crowds attend such
occasions as the association football ‘Cup Final’ at Wembley Stadium, the
international rugby matches at Twickenham, Murrayfield and Cardiff Arms
Park, the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships, the classic horse races,
Grand Prix motor racing and the cricket Test Matches; millions also
watch them on television. Enthusiasm for active participation in sport and
recreation has grown considerably in recent decades and there is a large
variety of opportunities and facilities available. Physical recreation tends to be
informal and non-competitive and may include, for example, climbing,
rambling, riding, boating, angling and other water-based activities.
ORGANISATION
AND
PROMOTION
An important feature of British sport and recreation is its amateur element
(the people who devote time and energy to the organising, teaching and training
of individual activities). Although the Government is not directly concerned
with the organisation of sport and recreation, a Minister of State in the Depart¬
ment of the Environment has responsibility for the co-ordination of policies
and the promotion of research in the field of active recreation. The Secretaries
of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland exercise similar responsi¬
bilities in their countries.
The Government’s policy is to stimulate the provision of facilities and
encourage their full use. It provides financial and other assistance through a
number of official bodies. Some of these, such as the Sports Councils (see
below) and the Countryside Commissions, have specific responsibilities
relating to sport and recreation, and assist other public and private bodies in
the provision of facilities. Others, for example, the Forestry Commission, the
British Waterways Board, the Nature Conservancy Council and the regional
water authorities, provide recreational amenities in addition to their main
functions.
Sports Councils The main responsibility for the general development of sport in Great Britain
rests with three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England and
for general matters affecting Britain as a whole), the Sports Council for Wales
and the Scottish Sports Council. Members of the councils are appointed by
the Government. The Councils have the task, subject only to general minis¬
terial directives, of allocating funds made available by the Government (in
i978_79 amounting to some ^18 million). They award grants for sports
development, coaching and administration to the governing bodies of sport and
to other national organisations; and administer national sports centres. Grants
and loans are made to voluntary organisations and local authorities to assist
in the provision of sports facilities. The Councils also assist British representa¬
tives at international sports meetings and encourage links with international
and overseas organisations. The Sports Council consults with the Central
Council of Physical Recreation, comprising members of the national governing
and representative bodies of sport and physical recreation in England. The
Sports Council is linked with nine regional councils for sport and recreation
in England on which are represented local authorities and sport and country¬
side interests in each region. The Scottish Sports Council consults with the
Scottish Standing Conference of Sport which comprises representatives of the

national governing bodies of sport in Scotland; and the Sports Council for
Wales maintains, through a standing committee, a close liaison with the
governing bodies of sport in Wales.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Education provides financial
assistance to local authorities and voluntary sports bodies for the provision of
facilities. The Sports Council for Northern Ireland acts in an advisory capacity
and can assist voluntary clubs with the cost of equipment, coaching and
administration.
A bibliographic service about sport is provided by the National Documenta¬
tion Centre, set up by the Sports Council and based at the University of
Birmingham. The Council also has an information centre providing data on a
wide range of sports topics; similar services are provided by the Sports
Council for Wales and the Scottish Sports Council.
There are a number of voluntary organisations whose activities are concerned
with recreation. Some, such as the Ramblers’ Association, safeguard the
interests of particular leisure pursuits; others, such as the National Trust
(see p 172), provide for recreation in addition to their main responsibilities.
Most, however, exist to provide recreational opportunities for young people.
A description of the youth service and an outline of the work of individual
organisations is contained in Chapter 7.
The British Otympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The Association’s committee consists
of representatives of the 26 sports in the programme of the Olympic Games
(summer and winter). It determines the size of the British team (which com¬
petes under the name of ‘Great Britain’); raises funds; makes all the arrange¬
ments for the team’s travel and comfort at the games; organises the provision
and transport of clothing and equipment; and provides a headquarters staff for
the management of the team.
The National Playing Fields Association aims to stimulate the provision of
playing fields, playgrounds and recreational facilities. It maintains a technical
advisory service, and specialises in the play and recreational needs of children
and young people including young handicapped people. It is a national
charity established by Royal Charter, and depends mainly on voluntary
contributions. It is helped by its seven regional play advisers and by affiliated
associations in Scotland and Northern Ireland and in English and Welsh
counties.
The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, encourages
sporting activities for the physically handicapped. The Association, which
receives an annual Sports Council grant, provides advice on physical recrea¬
tion for the disabled, arranges sports meetings and encourages the provision
of facilities (including sports clubs) for disabled people. Regional and branch
committees of the Association organise local, regional and national games.
Annual national and international paraplegic games are arranged by the
British Paraplegic Sports Society. At Stoke Mandeville Hospital, the first
sports stadium in the world designed for disabled people was opened in 1969.
In Scotland and Wales there are associations which co-ordinate sporting
activities and facilities for disabled people.
Increasing numbers of sports receive financial sponsorship from commercial
concerns. Sponsorship may take the form of financing specific events, or it

may be granted to individual sports organisations, for example, to provide
better accommodation for spectators or to encourage more people to partici¬
pate in the sport.
A Sports Aid Foundation has responsibility for raising and distributing
funds from industry, commerce and private sponsors in order to assist the
training of talented individual sportsmen and sportswomen. The Foundation
makes grants on the recommendation of the governing bodies of sport. The
Sports Council also runs a sponsorship advisory service which links potential
sponsors with suitable sports.
OF Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities for
community recreation and their total expenditure on sport and outdoor
recreation in England and Wales amounted to some £490 million in 1976-77.
In Scotland, total expenditure on sports and recreation facilities by local
authorities in 1976-77 was about £69-2 million. The facilities provided
include parks, playing fields, sports halls, tennis courts, golf courses, lakes,
swimming baths and sports centres catering for a wide range of indoor and
outdoor activities.
All publicly maintained schools are required to provide for the physical
education (for example, gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swim¬
ming) of their pupils. All (except those solely for infants) must have a playing
field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Some have other amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and halls
designed for dance and movement. In some areas, physical education facilities
in schools are available to the whole community outside school hours. Sport
and recreation facilities are likewise provided at universities (some of which
have departments of physical education), and there are ‘centres of sporting
excellence’ at universities and other colleges which enable selected young
athletes to develop their talents and provide for their educational needs.
Opportunities for outdoor recreation in national parks, nature reserves,
forest parks and country parks are provided by public bodies (see p 163).
Water-based activities on canals, rivers, lakes and reservoirs are increasingly
popular. The British Waterways Board, for example, maintains about 1,760
kilometres (1,100 miles) of cruising waterways for navigation, about 960 kilo¬
metres (600 miles) of other waterways and some 90 reservoirs. An Inland
Waterways Amenity Advisory Council advises the Board on the use of its
waterways for pleasure purposes, and a Water Space Amenity Commission
provides advice on the recreational use of water in England generally.
In addition to the recreational facilities provided by public authorities,
many facilities are made available by local voluntary clubs. Some of these
cater for indoor recreation, but more common are those providing sports
grounds, particularly for games such as cricket, association and rugby football,
hockey, tennis and golf. Clubs linked to industrial business firms often cater
for a wide range of activities, and in many cases make their facilities available
to members of the public. Commercial facilities, provided as profit-making
businesses, include tenpin bowling centres, ice and roller skating rinks,
squash courts, golf driving ranges and riding stables.
National sports centres, some of which were initially financed by funds from
voluntary sources, are maintained by the sports councils and provide facili¬
ties and a wide range of courses for instructors and performers in many
recreational activities. As well as making residential courses available for
enthusiasts from all over Britain, the centres are used extensively by local
clubs and the community generally.

There are seven national centres in England and Wales. Combined facilities
for ranges of sports are provided at three centres: the Crystal Palace National
Sports Centre in London and the Bisham Abbey and Lilleshall National
Sports Centres in Buckinghamshire and Salop respectively. The centre at
Crystal Palace has a main stadium seating 17,000 spectators, a sports hall
seating 2,000 spectators, a swimming hall with pools meeting Olympic require¬
ments and seating 2,000, tw'O teaching pools, ten squash courts, an indoor
cricket school, practice rooms for most indoor sports and a hostel for 132
residents. These facilities are available for international competitions as well
as for training purposes, and are supported by a grant from the Greater
London Council in addition to the Sports Council grant. The other four are
specialist centres: the Plas-y-Brenin National Centre for Mountain Activities
in north Wales, the National Sailing Centre in the Isle of Wight, the Holme
Pierrepont National Water Sports Centre in Nottinghamshire, and Harrison’s
Rocks, a small rock-climbing centre in Sussex. In addition there is a National
Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff which is supported by local authorities,
and by a grant from the Sports Council for Wales.
The Scottish Sports Council operates three national sports training centres:
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore for outdoor activities, Inverclyde at Largs
for general sports activities, and a national water sports training centre in
Cumbrae Isle on the Firth of Clyde.
As well as the national sports centres, other centres (such as the Meadow-
bank Sports Centre administered by Edinburgh District Council) cater for a
wide range of recreational activities and often attract more than purely local
interest. Over 300 indoor sports centres serve local rather than national
needs; more are planned, some as ‘dual’ projects on school sites. There are
also several national centres catering for specialised interests and generally
administered by the sponsoring organisations. These include the National
Equestrian Centre, run by the British Equestrian Federation, and the Stoke
Mandeville Sports Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, run by
the British Paraplegic Sports Society (see p 422).
In Northern Ireland eight indoor sports centres are provided by district
councils and several more are being built. The Sports Council for Northern
Ireland has a Mountain Centre at Tollymore, County Down.
Some of the major sports in Britain are described below. Sportsmen may be
professionals (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports, such as rugby union
football, hockey and rowing, are entirely amateur but in others the distinction
between amateur and professional status is less strictly defined.
Probably the most popular spectator sport is association football, dating as an
organised game from the nineteenth century, and controlled by separate foot¬
ball associations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In
England over 400 clubs are affiliated to the English Football Association (FA)
and some 37,000 clubs to regional or district associations.
The principal clubs in England and Wales belong to the Football League
(92 clubs) and in Scotland to the Scottish Football League (38 clubs); the
clubs play in four divisions in England and Wales and three in Scotland.
During the season attendances at Football League matches total about
25 million.
The annual competitions for the FA Challenge Cup, the Football League
Cup, the Scottish FA Cup and the Scottish League Cup are organised on a
knock-out basis, and the finals (four of the most important matches of the

year) are played at Wembley Stadium, London, and at Hampden Park,
Glasgow.
National teams representing England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland compete against each other annually and take part in European com¬
petitions, the World Cup competition and other international matches.
The Sports Council is giving grants to some Football League clubs to
enable them to provide greater sports opportunities for young supporters.
In England amateur athletics (including track, road and cross-country running,
relay racing, jumping, vaulting, hurdling, steeplechasing, throwing and race
walking) are governed, for men, by the Amateur Athletic Association and, for
women, by the Women’s Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland have their own associations and, as in England, there are
separate women’s associations. The various organisations encourage the
development of the sport, establish uniform rules and regulations and promote
regional and national championships. Hundreds of clubs are affiliated to the
various national associations.
International athletics and the selection of British teams are the concern of
the British Amateur Athletic Board which is composed of representatives of
the national associations. British teams compete in the Olympic Games and in
other international matches, and separate teams representing England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games. The
board also administers coaching schemes.
The Highland Games, traditional gatherings of local people in the Highlands
of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the weight
and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions take place,
are unique spectacles which attract large numbers of spectators from all over
the world. Among better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar
Gathering (traditionally attended by the Royal Family), the Argyllshire and
Cowal Gatherings and the meeting at Aboyne.
Boxing as a British sport is one of the oldest, probably originating in Saxon
times. Its modern form, also adopted in many overseas countries, dates from
1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating
much of the brutality that had characterised prize fighting and making skill the
basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional.
The Amateur Boxing Association controls all amateur boxing in England
including schoolboy, club and association boxing, and boxing in the armed
services. There are separate associations in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The associations organise various amateur boxing competitions, and
teams from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland take part in
international competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The Board has strict medical regulations which provide for
an examination of boxers before and after each contest, and for an extensive
annual medical examination. In addition the Board appoints inspectors,
medical officers and representatives to ensure that the regulations are observed
and to guard against over-matching and exploitation.
Amateur and professional boxing championships are decided at various
weights—11 in amateur and 10 in professional boxing.
Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game. It is known to have been played as early as the
1550s. Among the many clubs founded in the eighteenth century was the
426
BRITAIN 1979: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Field Sports
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in London and which
reframed the laws of the game. Cricket in Britain is now governed by the
Cricket Council which consists of representatives of the MCC, the Test and
County Cricket Board (representing first class cricket) and the National
Cricket Association (representing club and junior cricket).
The game is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns
and villages there are amateur teams which play weekly games from late April
to the end of September. In the Midlands and the north of England there is a
network of League cricket contested by teams of Saturday afternoon players
reinforced by professionals, some of whom come from overseas.
Some of the best supported games are the annual series of five-day sponsored
Test Matches played between England and a touring team from Australia,
New Zealand, India, Pakistan or the West Indies. A team representing England
tours one or more of these countries in November-March. There is also a
sponsored First Class County Championship of three-day games played
by 17 county teams who also take part in three one-day sponsored competi¬
tions—two of these are knock-out competitions and the other is a Sunday
League.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women’s Cricket Association, founded in 1926.
The British Field Sports Society looks after the interests of all field sports
(including hunting, game shooting and fishing) which have a long history and
play a considerable part in the life of the countryside. The Society is a member
of the British Shooting Sports Council which is the representative body of
recreational shooting.
Fox hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds is the most important
British hunting sport but there is also stag hunting, and hunting the hare.
The fox hunting season lasts from early November to April and is preceded
by the hunting of young foxes when young hounds are trained. There are
over 320 packs of hounds of all kinds in Britain and hunts are financed
mainly by members’ subscriptions and by the proceeds of such events as
steeplechase point-to-points.
Game shooting as an organised country sport probably originated in the
early part of the nineteenth century. Game consists of grouse, black-grouse,
partridge, pheasant and ptarmigan, these species being protected by law
during a close season when they are allowed to breed in security on numerous
estates supervised by privately employed game-keepers. It is necessary to have
a licence to kill game, and a certificate must be obtained from the local police by
anyone who possesses, purchases or acquires a shot gun. The Game Conser¬
vancy, formed by landowners, farmers and others interested in game conser¬
vation, collects information and studies factors controlling game population.
Other shooting sports are wild-fowling which takes place on marshes and
fenlands, and deer stalking.
The most popular country sport is fishing, there being about 4 million
anglers in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout particularly in the rivers
and lochs of Scotland, but in England and Wales the most widely practised
form of fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench,
chub and bream. Angling clubs affiliate to the National Federation of Anglers
and many clubs organise angling competitions. National championships are
organised by the federation which also enters a team in the World Angling
Championship. Freshwater fishing usually has to be paid for; most coarse
fishing is let to angling clubs by private owners while trout and salmon

fishermen either rent a stretch of river, join a club, or pay for the right to fish
by the day, week or month. Coastal and deep sea fishing are free to all (apart
from salmon and sea trout fishing which is by licence only). In Northern Ire¬
land the Ulster Provincial Council of the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers and
the Ulster Angling Federation look after the interests of the sport.
Golf originated in Scotland where it has for centuries borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, the headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf
Club being situated at St. Andrews on the east coast. The sport is played
throughout Britain and there are golf courses in the vicinity of most towns,
some of which are owned by local authorities. The main event of the golfing
year is the Open Golf Championship; other important events include the
W alker Cup match for amateurs and the Ryder Cup match for professionals,
both of which are played between Britain and the United States.
The modem game of lawn tennis was first played in England in 1872 and the
first championships at Wimbledon in 1877. The controlling body, the Lawn
Tennis Association, was founded in 1888. The main event of the season is the
annual W imbledon fortnight for players from all over the world; these draw
large crowds, the grounds at the All-England Club accommodating over 30,000
spectators. There are also county championships and national competitions
for boys’ and girls’ schools. International events include the Davis Cup and
Kings Cup for men and the Federation Cup for women. W^omen from
Britain and the United States compete for the Wightman Cup.
Among the most popular spectator sports is motor racing. The governing
body, the Royal Automobile Club Motor Sports Association Ltd., issues
competition licences to motor clubs registered with it covering all events from
hill climbs to full international race meetings. In addition it organises the
British Grand Prix which counts towards the Formula One W^orld Motor
Racing Championship, and the RAC Rally which counts towards the W^orld
Rally Championship.
Motor cycle racing is governed by the Auto Cycle Union and the most
important events of the year are the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races, the
British Grand Prix, and the Formula 750 W orld Championship. Motor cycle
speedway racing is governed by the Speedway Control Board.
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing (from late March to early Novem¬
ber) and steeplechasing and hurdle racing (from August to June). The Derby,
run at Epsom, is the outstanding event in the flat racing calendar. Other classic
races are: the Two Thousand Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas, both
run at Newmarket; the Oaks, run at Epsom; and the St. Leger, run at
Doncaster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race meeting is the
National Hunt Festival [Meeting at Cheltenham. The Grand National, run at
Aintree near Liverpool, is the best known single steeplechase.
The Jockey Club administers all horse racing in Britain. Its rules are the
basis of turf procedure and it also licenses racecourses.
Racing takes place on most weekdays throughout the year and about
11,600 horses are in training.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare (now considered to be
among Britain’s most popular spectator sports) takes place at 105 tracks
licensed by local authorities^ iMeetings are usually held two or three times a
week at each track, up to a maximum of 130 days a year. Rules for the sport

are drawn up by the National Greyhound Racing Club, but its overall
administration and organisation is the responsibility of the British Greyhound
Racing Federation.
The authority responsible for equestrian activities (other than racing) is the
British Equestrian Federation which co-ordinates the work of the British
Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association at international
level and runs the National Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire.
The British Horse Society promotes the interests of horse and pony breed¬
ing and of riding. It provides lectures, publications, a film library, courses and
examinations and, together with riding schools approved by it, helps to
promote horsemastership. With over 25,430 members the Society is also the
parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club movement. These hold
their own rallies, meetings and competitions, culminating in annual national
championships at the National Equestrian Centre.
Horse trials are held during the spring and summer under the auspices of
the Society. The three-day events held each year (in April at Badminton,
Avon, in May at Tidworth, Hampshire, and in September at Burghley House,
Lincolnshire) include dressage, cross-country riding and show jumping.
Show jumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association
which draws up competition rules and prescribes the general standards and
height of obstacles. The Association keeps a register of horses and ponies
taking part in shows and seeks to improve the standard of jumping and to
provide for British representation in international competitions. It has over
14,000 members and 1,000 shows are affiliated to it. The two major show
jumping events each year are the Royal International Horse Show and the
Horse of the Year Show.
Rugby football is played according to two different sets of rules: Rugby Union
(a 15-a-side game) is played by amateurs while Rugby League (a 13-a-side
game) is played by professionals as well as amateurs.
Rugby Union is played throughout Britain under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union (in England), the Welsh Rugby Union, the Scottish Rugby
Union and the Irish Rugby Football Union. International matches between
England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France are played each year and there
are tours by international teams.
Rugby League is played mostly in the north of England. The governing body
of the professional game is the Rugby Football League which sends touring
teams to Australia and New Zealand. Annual matches are also played against
France. The Rugby League Challenge Cup Final is the major match of the
season and is played at Wembley Stadium in London. The amateur game is
governed by the British Amateur Rugby League Association.
Sailing has always been popular on Britain’s inland and coastal waters. The
Royal Yachting Association has over 1,400 clubs and about 54,000 members.
There are about 500 teaching establishments recognised by the Association
including the National Sailing Centre at Cowes in the Isle of Wight where
instructors are coached and tested. One of the world’s principal regattas takes
place each year at Cowes and major events are held at other British sailing
centres.
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people in Britain, many of whom learn
to swim at public baths, schools or swimming clubs. Instruction and coaching
is provided by qualified teachers who hold certificates awarded by the Amateur
SPORT AND RECREATION..

Other Sports
Swimming Association, to which over 1,700 clubs are affiliated. The Associa¬
tion also draws up and enforces regulations for amateur swimming, diving and
water polo championships and competitions in England. Separate associations
control sport in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Underwater swimming (sub-aqua) is governed nationally by the British
Sub-Aqua Club which promotes underwater exploration, science and sport.
Formed in 1953, the club has become the largest in the world with some 25,000
members and more than 1,000 branches in Britain and overseas.
The governing bodies of some other sports played in Britain are given below.
Most of these are organised on the basis of clubs and regional organisations
linked to a national body. The governing bodies’ functions are broadly similar
and usually include drawing up the rules of the sport, organising regional and
national competitions and maintaining relations with sporting bodies overseas.
Many of the sports listed below have separate national bodies for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.

GAMBLING
Various forms of betting and commercial gaming are permitted under strict
regulations and estimated money staked in Great Britain in 1977 was about
£8,000 million; of this some £7,700 million was returned in winnings. It is
estimated that some 94 per cent of adults gamble at some time or another, 39
per cent regularly.
Gaming includes that at casinos, on gaming machines and on licensed bingo
which is thought to be played by about 5’5 million people on a fairly regular
basis. Betting takes place mainly on horse and greyhound racing, and on
football matches (usually through football pools). Racing bets may be made
at racecourses and greyhound tracks, or through some 13,250 licensed off-
course betting offices which take nearly 90 per cent of the money staked.
A form of pool betting (totalisator betting) is organised on, and off, course
by the Horserace Totalisator Board (HTB). Bookmakers and the HTB
have to contribute a ‘betting levy’ to the Horserace Betting Levy Board which
promotes the advancement of veterinary science and the improvement of
horseracing and breeds of horses.
In addition legislation allows local authorities and certain bodies to hold
lotteries.
A Royal Commission on Gambling reported in 1978 (see Bibliography,
p 452). One of its principal recommendations was that there should be a
national lottery with the proceeds going to sport, the arts and other deserving
causes.
Currency
The unit of currency is the pound sterling divided into 100 new pence (p). There are
six denominations: 50p; 10p; 5p; 2p; 1 p; and ^p.
Bank of England notes are issued for sums of £1, £5, £10 and £20.
Metric Equivalents for British Weights and Measures
Adoption of The Metrication Board was set up in 1 969 to promote the planning and publicising of
Metric System the changeover to the international system of units for weights and measures through¬
out the country.

Annual reports are published by the Sports Council, the Scottish Sports Council, the Sports Council for
Wales and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland. In addition, most of the organisations concerned
with sport publish year-books covering results and records of the previous season and future prospects.
Many weekly or monthly periodicals on sport are also published.
Index
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter
rather than under Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. {that is, Accidents,
Royal Society for the Prevention of; Archives, National Register of). In cases
where the first word is not separable, however {for example, Royal Air Force,
Royal Society), entries will be found appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only
where they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed
under the relevant subject headings.
