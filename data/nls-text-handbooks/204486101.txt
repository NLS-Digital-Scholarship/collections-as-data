INTRODUCTION
BRITAIN 1973 is the twenty-fourth official handbook in the series prepared
and revised each year by Reference Division of the Central Office of In¬
formation with the co-operation of other government departments and of
many national organisations. The handbook is widely known as an established
work of reference and is the mainstay of the reference facilities provided by
the British Information Services in many countries. It is available overseas
in a limited free edition and is on sale throughout the world.
This 1973 edition, which covers events up to September 1972, gives a
factual account of the administration and the national economy of Britain.
It describes the activities of many of the national institutions, both official
and unofficial, and shows the part played by the Government in the life of
the community. An Appendix deals with British accession to the European
Community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt
to cover Britain’s participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The
factual and statistical information it contains is compiled from official and
other authoritative sources, and, while most sections of the book relate to
Britain as a whole, facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland are also given separately when relevant.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult the Annual
Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics, issued by the Central
Statistical Office, and also other government publications and standard works
of reference, some of which are listed in the bibliography towards the end of
the handbook. Readers are asked to note that in Britain the Central Office
of Information reference documents listed in the bibliography and marked
with an asterisk may be obtained, on payment of a small charge, from
Reference Division, Central Office of Information; and that overseas they
may be obtained from British Information Offices.

1 THE LAND AND THE
PEOPLE
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
Britain, formally known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, forms the greater part of the British Isles, a group of islands lying off
the north-west coast of Europe. The largest islands are Great Britain (compris¬
ing the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland) and Ireland (comprising
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the southern coast of Eng¬
land is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west are the Isles of Scilly;
off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is fringed by numerous islands
and to the far north are the important groups of the Orkneys and Shetlands.
All these form administrative counties or parts of counties of the mainland, but
the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great Britain
and France have a large measure of administrative autonomy and are not part
of England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border) has a
total area (including inland water) of 50,333 square miles (130,362 sq. km.)
and is divided into 39 geographical or 46 administrative counties; Wales
(including Monmouthshire), with a total area of 8,017 square miles (20,764
sq. km.), has 13 counties; Scotland, including its inhabited islands, has a total
area of 30,414 square miles (78,772 sq. km.) and is divided into 33 counties;
Northern Ireland, consisting of six counties, has a total area of 5,452 square
miles (14,121 sq. km.). Together, these countries constitute the United King¬
dom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (or Britain), with a total area of
94,216 square miles (244,019 sq. km.). The total land area of the United King¬
dom (excluding inland water) is 93,025 square miles (240,934 sq. km.):
England, 50,052 (129,634); Wales and Monmouthshire, 7,968 (20,637); Scot¬
land, 29,799 (77>I79)i and Northern Ireland, 5,206 (13,484).
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they
refer to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together
for many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which com¬
prises England, Wales and Scotland, or to Britain (the United Kingdom) as
a whole. The position is further complicated by the fact that the county of
Monmouth is occasionally included with England. United Kingdom statistics
and other data sometimes include the Isle of Man, 227 square miles (588 sq.
km.), and the Channel Islands, 75 square miles (194 sq. km.), which strictly
are not part of the United Kingdom but are dependencies of the Crown.
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old observatory at Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost point
of Northern Ireland is 8° 10' West. It is just under 600 miles (966 km.) in a
straight line from the south coast to the extreme north of mainland Britain and
about 300 miles (483 km.) across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous

Topography

bays and inlets no point in Britain is as much as 75 miles (121 km.) from tidal
water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less
than 50 fathoms (300 feet or 91 metres)—because the islands lie on the con¬
tinental shelf. To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor
plunges abruptly from 600 feet (183 metres) to 3,000 feet (914 metres). These
shallow waters are important because they provide excellent fishing grounds
as well as breeding grounds for fish. The North Atlantic Current, the drift
of warm water which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out
over the shelf and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The
effect of tidal movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to weather and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two main
regions, lowland Britain and highland Britain.
In lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern
England have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and
rising to chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet
(305 metres) above sea level. Its boundaries run roughly from the mouth of
the Tyne in the north-east to the mouth of the Exe in the south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and
extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet (305 metres). This high
ground, however, is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains.
Geologically the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old
rocks (archaean and palaeozoic), while the upper strata in the valleys and plains
are mainly more recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern
and western parts of lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal measures
which have been the foundation of Britain’s industrial expansion. The out¬
crops and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted were
found on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high land.
Most of the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors
of present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice Age
during which, at one period or another, ice caps and ice sheets extended
approximately as far south as the Bristol Channel and the Thames valley. The
ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground and swept from the mountains
of Scotland, northern England and Wales any loose rock or soil which had
previously been formed, so that, when the ice eventually disappeared, the hills
stood out as barren rocky areas, while a thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders,
boulder-clay, sands and gravels—lay distributed widely over the lower ground.
The ice had blocked up previous drainage channels and left large lakes, which
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 4,406 feet (1,342 metres); in Wales,
Snowdon, 3,560 feet (1,085 metres); and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District,
Cumberland), 3,210 feet (978 metres).

have since gradually dried up, leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often
affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by
the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses1 are irregu¬
larly placed around central lowlands; the rocks of Ireland are of the same types
as the highland zone of Great Britain, and in the higher parts the moorland
vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, partic¬
ularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of highland Britain often reach the
coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the Pembrokeshire coast in
south Wales; the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumberland coast;
and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner
Hebrides. Even around lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some
parts the soft, white limestone—the chalk—forms the world-famous white
cliffs of Dover or the Needles off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the
south and south-east coastline have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern
coast of England between the Humber and the Thames estuary is for the
most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some stretches of it have been
protected against the sea by embankments.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much of
the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of the
short British rivers2 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. It lies in middle latitudes
to the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but the prevail¬
ing winds are south-westerly and the weather from day to day is controlled
mainly by a succession of depressions from the Atlantic which, moving in a
generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over or near the British
Isles. The climate is subject to frequent changes but to few extremes of
temperature. Although it is largely determined by that of the eastern Atlantic,
occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may bring a cold, dry,
continental type of weather which, once established, may persist for many days
or even weeks. During the summer months the Azores high pressure system
usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards north-west Europe, and
the depressions take a more northerly course, often passing entirely to the
north of the British Isles.
In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly quarter the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south¬
westerly ones although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the
spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may
differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography. Winds
are generally stronger in the north than in the south of the British Isles, stronger
on the coasts than inland, and stronger in the west than in the east. The
strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at Lerwick,
Shetland Islands, varies from about 19 m.p.h. (31 km.p.h.) in January to about
1 The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard, 2,796 feet (852 metres).

210 miles (354 and 338 km.) long respectively.

14 m.p.h. (23 km.p.h.) in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western
outskirts of London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. (16
km.p.h.) in January to about 7 m.p.h. (11 km.p.h.) in August. The stormiest
region of the British Isles is along the north-west coast with over 30 gales
a year; south-east England and the east Midlands are the least stormy, with
gales occurring on about 2 days a year inland and on some 15 to 20 days on the
Channel coast.
Near sea level in the west of the British Isles the mean annual temperature
ranges from 8°C. (47°F.) in the Hebrides to ii°C. (52°F.) in the extreme
south-west of England; latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the eastern
part of Britain. The mean monthly temperature in the extreme north, at
Lerwick (Shetlands), ranges from 4°C. (39°F.) during the winter (December,
January and February) to I2°C. (54°F.) during the summer (June, July and
August): the corresponding figures for the Isle of Wight, in the extreme south,
are 5°C. (4i°F.) and i6°C. (6i°F.). The average range of temperature between
winter and summer varies from 7°C. to I2°C. (450-54°F.), being greatest
inland in the eastern part of the country. During a normal summer, the
temperature occasionally rises above 27°C. (8o°F.) in the south, but tempera¬
tures of 32°C. (90°F.) and above are infrequent. Extreme minimum tempera¬
tures depend largely on local conditions, but —7°C. (2o°F.) may occur on a still,
clear winter’s night, -i2°C. (io°F.) is rare, and -i8°C. (o°F.) or below has been
recorded only during exceptionally cold winter periods.
The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches (102 cm.),
while England alone has about 34 inches (86 cm.). The geographical distribu¬
tion of annual rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the
Atlantic, the mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain
than the lowland of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches (381 and
508 cm.) of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during the
average year, whereas some places in the south-east of England record less
than 20 inches (51 cm.). Rain is fairly well distributed throughout the year,
but, on the average, March to June are the driest months and October to
January the wettest. A period of as long as three weeks without rain is excep¬
tional, and is usually confined to limited areas. In successive years, however,
remarkably contrasting weather conditions are sometimes experienced.
The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general decrease
from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with
altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the
mean daily duration of sunshine varies from five hours in north-west Scotland
to eight hours in the Isle of Wight; during the months of shortest daylight—
November, December and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an average
of half an hour a day in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and in the
Peak District (Derbyshire) and two hours a day on the south coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter. Fogs have become less frequent and less severe in recent years as a
result of changes in fuel usage and the operation of clean air legislation, though
the occurrence of patches of fog is particularly hazardous to motorists, especially
on the motorways.
Many parts of the surface of highland Britain have only thin, poor soils, with
the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of
Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
Fauna
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valleys and the plains where soils are deeper and richer;
villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of heath and forest, almost the whole of
lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except
where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage
systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation
the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and part of East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
natural vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands,
forests of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moor¬
land. In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively diminished
and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry Commission
in the past 50 years, woodlands now occupy only about 8 per cent of the surface
of the country. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the north and east
of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and in Monmouthshire on
the Welsh border. Yet much of Britain appears to be well wooded because of
the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees. The most common trees are oak,
beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which over a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied semi¬
natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or wire fences and,
especially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a
pattern of contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate of Britain and the
even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely dry
up, grassland is green throughout the year with many wild flowers from spring
to autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month in which some flowers may
not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western
Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals, includ¬
ing the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct; but red
deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands and on
Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in Scotland
and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow deer (which are
probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks and are wild in
some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen; there are foxes
in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers and streams. Both
common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of the coast, though not
usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include mice, rats, voles,
shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey more numerous than
the native red), hares, rabbits, weasels and stoats.
About 460 species of birds have been recorded in the British Isles. Some 200
species breed; the rest are regular migrants to, or pass through, the country, or
are casual stragglers. Visitors to Britain are often struck by the abundance,
variety and tameness of song birds in towns and villages. The pigeon, blackbird
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
7
and chaffinch are widely distributed but sparrows usually predominate near
houses. London and some other large towns have huge flocks of starlings which
congregate to roost on buildings, especially in winter. Most species of birds
have maintained their numbers over the last few decades, owing to their
success in adapting themselves to man-made surroundings, and in London
there has been an increase in the number of species breeding as a result of the
improvement in the environment brought about by anti-pollution measures.
Some large birds, on the other hand, have tended to decrease, but several
species, such as the osprey and the ruff, have re-established themselves after
disappearing from Britain in the nineteenth century.
Many species of gulls and other sea birds nest around the coast, and gulls
may regularly be seen feeding far inland; some nest in inland sites such as
gravel pits and sewage farms. The drainage and reclamation of marshlands
have diminished the natural habitat of ducks, geese and other aquatic birds,
but the survival of such species is largely assured on the nature reserves and
bird sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
About 30 kinds of freshwater fish are found; salmon, trout, pike, roach,
dace and perch being widely distributed. Stocks of trout, rainbow trout (an
introduced species), carp, tench and roach are frequently supplemented by
introductions for angling purposes. In a number of rivers measures to control
pollution have resulted in fish becoming more numerous. In the Thames in
London, for example, 56 species were recorded between 1970-72 where no
fish could be found in 1958.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Most British
reptiles and amphibians are indigenous but at least one, the marsh frog, has
been recently introduced from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most of them small,
in the British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly (3 to
4 inches or 8 to 10 cm.) and the stag beetle (2% inches or 6 cm.). The insect
fauna in Britain is less varied than that of continental Europe and lacks a
number of common European species. With modern methods of pest control,
extensive insect damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of diseases
spread by insect vectors are not common in Britain but there is some anxiety
among naturalists that chemical protection against insects may be reducing
the population of creatures which feed on them, and of their predators in turn.
These and other effects of agricultural chemicals on wild life are the subject of

THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from the
people who inhabited them nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were
the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after
settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating
the French language and customs, crossed to England and conquered it in
1066.
It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the

relative importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-
Saxons and the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present
English, Scots, Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over most of
England and the lowlands of Scotland the language which soon came to
predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and Norman-
French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Cornwall, the
Isle of Man, the highlands of Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not enable any precise estimates to be made of the
size of population or of the extent or direction of population movement until
the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the
end of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about 2 million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary estimate
put the population of England and Wales at 5^ million and that of Scotland
at about 1 million. The main factor in this gradual growth of population was a
slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in Britain, as in all countries
before the development of medical science, by high death rates and, in parti¬
cular, by very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration from the con¬
tinent of Europe has been an influence at certain times and immigration from
Commonwealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the British
people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births, deaths, mar¬
riages, occupations, language and family structure—is relatively plentiful and
reliable. Most of it is derived from two main sources: the regular flow of vital
statistics (that is, statistical information based on statutory registration of
births, marriages and deaths) and the periodic censuses of population.
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is
carried out by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as registrars
of marriages. In England and Wales there are nearly 500 superintendent
registrars in charge of registration districts and some 1,200 registrars in charge
of sub-districts. Registrars and superintendent registrars are appointed by the
county, county borough and London borough councils but they act under the
instruction of the Registrar General for England and Wales, who is in charge
of a central government department, the Office of Population Censuses and
Surveys, whose functions include regulating the registration of births, deaths
and marriages, the planning and carrying out of population censuses, and the
compilation and analysis of population and vital statistics. There are cor¬
responding authorities1 and similar arrangements in Scotland, Northern Ire¬
land, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
Censuses of the people of Great Britain have been taken regularly every ten
years since 1801, except that there was no census in 1941 because of the
second world war. The latest full census covering the United Kingdom
was taken in 1971 and the first provisional figures were published during the
year. Censuses were taken throughout Great Britain (on a sample basis) and
Northern Ireland in 1966.
The short demographic account given in this chapter is based mainly on
census reports and on the regular returns of births, marriages and deaths.
According to the preliminary figures of the census the population of Britain
(excluding the populations of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) was

Register Office, Belfast; the Governments of Jersey, of Guernsey and its associated
islands, and of the Isle of Man.

55,346,551 in 1971 compared with 52,709,000 in 1961, 38-2 million in 1901,
and over 6-5 million in 1700. The main causes of this great increase in numbers
were a progressive reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth
rates into the beginning of the twentieth century.
Britain’s population density is one of the highest in the world: it was approxi¬
mately 587 persons per square mile (227 per sq. km.) in 1971, but in England
there were approximately 911 persons per square mile (352 per sq. km.), and
in Greater London 12,097 persons per square mile (4,670 per sq. km.).
On the basis of present trends in birth and death rates and migration, Britain’s
population is expected to continue growing to the end of the century, reaching
57-7 million in 1981, 60-3 million in 1991, and 63-1 million in the year 2001.
For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was over 30 per
thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per
thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 20 years of the century,
but natural population increase changed little.
BIRTH RATES AND DEATH RATES
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age
groups, produced a population of low average age. But when death rates in all
age groups fell by an average of about a third, as they did between 1880 and
1910, the results were a very low general death rate, which helped to maintain
the population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a gradual
increase in the average age of the population. By the 1930s the birth rate had
fallen to less than half the nineteenth century rate. The population continued
to increase slowly, but its average age rose more rapidly.
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary since 1920 at around 12 per thousand of the population
though death rates have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particu¬
larly among pre-school-children, school-children, and adults in their thirties
and forties, with a consequent lengthening of the expectation of life from about
48 years at birth for a boy born in 1901 and 52 years for a girl, to 68-5 years at
birth for a boy born in 1968 to 1970 and 74-7 for a girl.
Since 1933 the steady fall in the number of births has ceased. During the
second world war the birth rate began to rise and reached a temporary post¬
war peak of 20'7 per thousand population in 1947. It receded to slightly above
the pre-war level in the early 1950s, but from 1956 onwards began to rise,

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
reaching a peak of 187 per thousand in 1964. It has since fallen and was 16-3
per thousand population in 1971. The proportion of illegitimate births, which
reached a peak of 9-1 per cent of all live births in 1945, the end of the second
world war, fell between 1945 and 1955, when it reached 4-5 per cent; since then
it has risen, but fell again latterly to about 8-i per cent in 1970.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on
mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and mor¬
tality from tuberculosis is about one-fifty-fifth of the rate prevailing in the
mid-nineteenth century. The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under
one year old per thousand live births) has fallen from 142 in 1900-2 to i8-5
in 1970 and maternal mortality from 471 per thousand live births in 1900-2
to o*i8 in 1970. The reported mortality from some of the illnesses of middle
and old age, such as cancer of the lung and heart conditions, has risen during
the twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement
in diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective
measures to combat some of these illnesses and improvement in positive health
does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so
that in nearly all countries—and in Britain since records began—women pre¬
ponderate among the elderly and outnumber men in the total population. In
1971 there were nearly 106 females to every 100 males in Britain. Formerly
women outnumbered men in every age group from adolescence onwards.
Recently, however, the fall in stillbirths and infant mortality has reduced the
influence of these factors on sex ratio so that the age at which women begin
to outnumber men has advanced and is now about 45. On the other hand, the
lengthening of the expectation of life, which has been rather more marked for
women than for men, has increased the preponderance of women among the
elderly—there are now some 29 women over 70 years old to every 16 men—
and made it a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
II
Over the past 30 years the proportion of the population of Great Britain who
are or have been married has risen from 42-1 per cent in 1938 to 58-4 per cent
in 1971, while the proportion of single persons in the population over 15 years
of age has fallen from 36-1 per cent to 17-6 per cent. This change has been due
mainly to an increase in marriage rates among men and women in their late
teens and early twenties; whereas in 1938 only 25-4 per cent of young women
aged 20 to 24 were married, in 1971 the percentage was 59. Earlier marriage
has led to a large increase in the number of children born to women under 30
years of age and in recent years has contributed to a substantial acceleration of
the total flow of births into the population.
There were 5*5 decrees of divorce made absolute in 1971 for every 1,000
married people in England and Wales; a substantial proportion of divorced
people marry again. Divorce is highest for girls marrying in their teens, the
ratio being twice as high as for women aged 20 to 24 at marriage.
The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part
of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the family
(that is, the number of children born per married couple) caused by the spread
of deliberate family limitation. Couples married a hundred years ago produced
on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline seems to
have set in with those married in the 1860s, and continued until, for couples
married in the period 1935-39, the average family size for Great Britain fell
to 2-07. It rose again for those married in 1940-44 to 2-09 and in 1945-49 to
2*22. Later data suggest some increase, though the present position is not
wholly clear, in view of the latest trends in the birth rate.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20
and 30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to
replace the original generation, while those born at the beginning of the present
century had only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for
replacement. Since then the figure has been rising again and seems likely to
exceed full replacement with the generation born during the second world
war. The rise has been due mainly to the increased proportion of women
getting married and of children surviving to adult life.
The effect of the fall in the birth rate beginning in the latter part of the
nineteenth century was to reduce the ratio of children and old people to
adults of working age. This ratio was at a minimum in 1930. After 1936 the
number of children leaving school for work fell sharply owing to the drop in
the birth rate after 1921, but the population aged over 64, born during an era
of high fertility and representing successive generations of steeply rising
numbers, increased very rapidly; the population aged over 40 was also in¬
creasing relatively faster than that between 15 and 40. The higher birth rates
after 1942 arrested the compensating fall in the number of children and further
reduced the proportion of people of conventional working age.
Because of this high proportion of the young and the old in the present
population, which is expected to increase still further (see diagram), there is a
special need to make the best use of national human resources. At the time of
the 1966 sample census about 93 per cent of men and 50-5 per cent of women
between 15 and 64 in Great Britain were economically active in remunerative
work (this includes those temporarily out of work or sick). In addition some
23-5 per cent of men and 6-7 per cent of women aged 65 or more were still
economically active. At the other end of the scale, some 25 -7 per cent of both
boys and girls between 15 and 19 were continuing their education. The scope

AGE DISTRIBUTION OF UNITED KINGDOM POPULATION
million
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the 1930s the balance of
migration was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 1930 well over 20 million
people left Britain for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the Common¬
wealth and the United States. Many emigrants later returned and large num¬
bers of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and Hungarians, entered
the British Isles. Nevertheless, the net loss by migration from Britain’s present
area amounted to some 4 million between 1871 and 1931. Since then the
balance of migration for Britain as a whole was inward until 1967, after which
a small net outflow has been recorded. Scotland and Northern Ireland have
throughout continued to have a net outward movement of population to
countries overseas as well as to England and Wales.
There have been two main periods of net inflow into Britain since 1931. T he
first was in the years 1931 to 1940 when emigration was very low, many former
emigrants returned, there was considerable net immigration from the Irish
Republic, and extensive immigration from Europe, including about a quarter
of a million refugees seeking sanctuary in Britain. The second, from the 1950s,
resulted from a large increase in net immigration from Commonwealth coun¬
tries, particularly West Indian countries, India and Pakistan. In the three
years 1960-62 total net immigration amounted to some 388,000 people, about
three-quarters of them from the Commonwealth. It was in these circumstances
that the Government introduced the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962,
which gave it power to restrict the number of people from the Commonwealth
and, in principle, the Irish Republic who did not have citizenship of the
United Kingdom and Colonies and who might immigrate into Britain without
assured prospects of employment or adequate means of self-support. The
Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 extended immigration control to citizens
of the United Kingdom and Colonies who had no close links with Britain:
broadly speaking, those neither born, naturalised, adopted or registered in
Britain nor having a parent or grandparent who was. The Immigration Act
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
13
Nationality
Language
1971, provides a single system of control over Commonwealth citizens and
aliens entering Britain. It confers a right of abode—and exemption from
control—on citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who are connected
with Britain by birth, adoption, naturalisation or registration or were children
or grandchildren of such persons, on citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies from overseas who had been resident in Britain for a continuous
period of five years, and on Commonwealth citizens with a mother or father
born in the United Kingdom. (For welfare of immigrants see p. 147 and for
conditions of entry see p. 371.)
The net emigration of United Kingdom citizens to Commonwealth countries
in 1971 was 42,200 and to foreign countries 36,400. Nearly 27,000 Common¬
wealth citizens were admitted to settle in Britain in 1971 of whom some 20,000
were dependants of Commonwealth citizens coming to reside in or already
resident in Britain.
In 1970-71 nearly 75,000 foreigners entered Britain for a period of a year or
more.
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, with insignificant exceptions, citizen¬
ship of the United Kingdom and Colonies is acquired by persons who are
born in the United Kingdom or in a territory which was a colony of the United
Kingdom on 1st January 1949, or at the date of birth if later, or in a United
Kingdom registered ship or aircraft. Citizenship may also be acquired: by
descent from a father who is himself a citizen otherwise than by descent and, in
certain specified circumstances, from a father who is a citizen by descent only;
by registration, for citizens of Commonwealth member countries or of the
Irish Republic, for minor children and for women married to citizens of the
United Kingdom and Colonies; in consequence of an adoption order; and by
naturalisation. The requirements for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation
include five years’ residence in the United Kingdom or Colonies or five years’
Crown service, good character, a sufficient knowledge of English and the
intention to reside in the United Kingdom or a colony or to remain in Crown
service; nearly 40,000 persons acquired citizenship by naturalisation and
registration in 1971.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizen¬
ship by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another
country (although he can lose it automatically if the territory from which he
derives it becomes independent); nor does a woman who is a citizen of the
United Kingdom and Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to an alien.
Indeed, a citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship against his will except
in very exceptional circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisa¬
tion or registration as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen
is, however, at liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires
the nationality or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
is the first language of the majority of the population in most of the western
counties and was spoken by 26 per cent of the population at the time of the
1961 census. (The Welsh Language Act 1967 affirmed the equal validity of
Welsh with English in the administration of justice and conduct of govern¬
ment business throughout Wales.) In Scotland, in 1961, nearly 81,000

persons, mainly in Ross and Cromarty, Inverness, Argyll and Lanark, spoke
the Scottish form of Gaelic,1 while a few families in Northern Ireland spoke
the Irish form of Gaelic. The Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic are no
longer effectively living languages, although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is used
in addition to English for certain official pronouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French
patois is still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official
language of Jersey, used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French
and English are used in the courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now used
for almost all official proceedings.

Scotland and Northern Ireland were in every case greater in 1961 than in 1931

The high rate of increase in England is partly due to migration from the other

a Area figures relate to boundaries as constituted in April 1970, except those for Scot¬
land which relate to December 1970.
Geography, history and economic factors have given rise to the differences
between the four countries and to an uneven distribution of the population
within them. Table 2 shows the areas and populations of the eight standard
administrative regions of England in 1961 and 1971, as well as those of Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Table 3 gives figures of Britain’s larger urban
populations (over 200,000). About half the British population lives within the
area of an ellipse drawn across England enclosing south Lancashire and west
Yorkshire at one end, and the London area at the other, having the industrialised
Midlands at its heart. Other areas with large populations are the central low¬
lands of Scotland; 1,000 square miles (2,590 sq. km.) in the north-east of
England from north of the river Tyne down to the river Tees; south-east
Wales; the Bristol area; and the English Channel coast from Poole, in Dorset,
eastwards. Less densely populated areas are the eastern fringes of England
between the Wash and the Thames estuary, and the far south-west. Most of the
mountainous parts of Britain, including much of Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland and the central Pennines in northern England, are very sparsely

and remote country areas in northern England, Wales and Scotland and some
coastal resorts have had relatively small increases. I he differences result fiom

towards the expanding employment opportunities of the Midlands and south
and towards certain retirement areas, mainly on the south coast.
Throughout Britain the population is predominantly urban and suburban,
although there may be access to large parks, commons and other expanses of
open country within the urban area. Table 3 shows the distribution of the
people of Britain between areas classified as urban for administrative purposes
and those classified as rural.
During the nineteenth century the labour demands of newly developing
industry drew great numbers from the countryside; by the end of the century
three-quarters of the British population was living in towns and the large
conurbation was already the dominant type of British community. During the
twentieth century the suburbs of the towns in these population centres have
continued to spread and merge. Nearly one-third of the population lives in the
seven great conurbations whose centres are the cities of London (Greater
London), Manchester (South-East Lancashire), Birmingham and Wolver¬
hampton (West Midlands), Glasgow (Central Clydeside), Leeds and Bradford
(West Yorkshire), Liverpool (Merseyside) and Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne¬
side).
In recent years there has been a decline in the numbers of people living in
inner urban areas, balanced or surpassed by the increase of population in and
beyond the outer suburban fringes (limited in certain areas by the ‘green belt’
policy where little development is permitted). This applies most strikingly to
London, also to the outer areas of the West Midlands and Merseyside conurba¬
tions and to such towns and cities as Bristol, Derby, Leicester, Norwich,
Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield. These two trends, the movement out of the
centre and development on the fringes, help to explain why the figures in
Table 3 show apparent decreases in most urban populations in recent years.
Factors in the further dispersal of the last few years have been the spread of
car ownership, expansion in public transport serving journeys to work, private
property developments to meet the demand for housing, and planned transfers
of population to the new towns around London, Glasgow, the West Midlands
and Merseyside and to selected expanding towns near to the great cities.
The extent to which people in Britain move about the country for work,
housing or study purposes is shown by the finding that 10‘7 per cent of
residents in Great Britain in 1966 had changed their address in the preceding
year and 33 per cent in the previous five years; 4-2 per cent had moved
between England and Scotland or Wales, or from one region to another,
during 1961-66.
SOCIAL LIFE
This section gives some points of general interest about the structure of
households and social habits in Britain as a background to the information
given in later chapters of the handbook, in particular those on housing,
transport and environmental planning.
The majority of people enumerated in the 1966 sample census in Great
Britain (over 97 per cent) were living in private households (usually in families
or on their own). The remainder included such people as residents in hotels,
people in hospital, in the armed services and in educational or other institu¬
tions. Of 16-9 million private households in Great Britain in 1966 about 15 per
cent consisted of one person only, 30 per cent of two persons, 21 per cent of
jg BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
three, 18 per cent of four and 16 per cent of five or more. The number of
households (which had increased by 96 per cent since 1911) and their small
average size (three persons) reflect a number of factors including lower birth
rates, the higher proportion of married people in the population, and the
increased tendency for young people, married and single, and for independent
elderly people to have their own separate homes. Social factors such as the
greater general availability of housing, the rehousing of slum dwellers outside
city centres, and the greater readiness of people to change their place of work
have helped to weaken the family unit and increase the dangers of loneliness,
particularly for the elderly. The persisting strength of family ties is, however,
reflected in the frequency of home visiting at weekends and holiday times.
Dwellings In 1971, of 19-4 million dwellings, about one-half were owner-occupied,
about one-third rented from public authorities, and one-sixth privately rented.
Towards the centre of large towns new housing is often provided in the form
of multi-storey blocks of flats, but in the suburbs most people live in streets of
semi-detached or detached two-storey houses with gardens. Altogether some
85 per cent of families in Great Britain live in houses, and about 14 pet cent
in flats. Standards of new housing have improved considerably in recent years
and the degree of overcrowding is lower than in most other European coun¬
tries. There has also been an increase in the number of houses with modern
conveniences; of some 16*3 million households enumerated in the 1966 sample
census in Great Britain, about 85 per cent had exclusive use of a hot water
system and 81 per cent (in England and Wales) had a fixed bath, with an
additional increasing number having showers.
Housework Much of the drudgery of housework has been reduced by changes in habits
and equipment, for instance, the increased use of easily cleaned plastic sur¬
faces in place of materials which need scrubbing or polishing, and of non-iron
fabrics and babies’ disposable napkins; the availability of convenience foods
(processed foods requiring little additional preparation before consumption),
and hot, ‘take-home’ meals (including the traditional fish and chips); and the
spread of labour-saving devices. More than four households in five have a
vacuum cleaner, two out of three a washing machine and a refrigerator, nearly
all an electric iron, one in four an electric clothes dryer, and one in five an
electric food mixer. An increasing, though still comparatively small, number
possess a dish-washing machine. Nearly one household in three has completely
eliminated the traditional coal fire in the principal living room. There is a
trend towards conversion to ‘whole house’ or central heating by means of oil,
gas, or solid fuel systems or by off-peak electric storage heaters; some 90 per
cent of all new dwellings built by local authorities in England and Wales have
central heating.
Most women, and many men living alone, do their own catering and house¬
work; probably less than five per cent of households employ any regular paid
help, and less than half of one per cent in England and Wales have a resident
servant. A few households (estimated at one in 750, and those mainly ones
with small children) have a foreign girl living with them au pan. Some
households get help through the local authority home help service because
of particular need, for example, if there is an invalid or elderly person in the
house or because a mother is having her baby at home.
Women who go out to work (about half the women of working age are in
employment) benefit, among other things, from launderettes with extended
opening hours and from shops, particularly departmental stores and super¬
markets, which stay open late at least one evening a week.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
19
Income,
Leisure and
Opportunities
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend
it, greater educational opportunities and higher real incomes than had
previous generations.
Agreed hours of full-time work are usually from 35 to 40 a week, although
men in manual work actually work somewhat longer because of voluntary over¬
time working, while the hours worked by women and girls average somewhat
less. Some five or six hours a week are spent by the majority of people in
travelling to and from work. Almost all employees are entitled to a minimum
of two weeks’ paid holiday a year in addition to public holidays, and a sub¬
stantial and increasing proportion have three.
Britain has fewer public holidays than nearly all other European countries.
Probably more than half the working population already enjoy a five-day week
—most people employed in factories and offices have Saturdays and Sundays
free—and a further extension of five-day working in distributive trades offering
a six-day week service is in progress.
In the last decade average earnings have risen more than prices. Women’s
earnings have risen rather less than men’s. The principle of equal pay for equal
work applies in many occupations and is being extended under legislation
passed in 1970; the average earnings of women are a little over half the average
earnings of men. The real incomes of manual workers, especially unskilled
workers and young people under 18 years old, have risen both in absolute
terms and in relation to the incomes of non-manual workers. The weakest
groups economically are retired people wholly or mainly dependent on pen¬
sions, households in which the father is dead or absent, and low wage earners
with a number of young children.
Illustrative of the widening opportunities for education and training is the
increase in the proportion of young people benefiting from non-compulsory
education. In 1969-70, for instance, 41-8 per cent of 16-year-olds were in
some form of full-time education, compared with 29 per cent in 1963-64.
The proportion of 18-year-olds continuing full-time education in universities,
colleges of education and technical colleges is also steadily increasing. A
large number of undergraduates in Great Britain are, moreover, ‘first genera¬
tion’ students, neither of whose parents had a university education. Although
the children of professional parents are still more likely to go on to higher
education than the children of manual workers—a reflection of the continuing
influence of parental education and encouragement—a higher proportion of
the children of manual workers in Britain receive higher education than in
most other European countries.
Over the last decade social differences between manual and other workers
have become less pronounced. Increased prosperity and modern production
and marketing methods have allowed many workers to adopt ways of living
formerly regarded as ‘middle-class’. The increased diversity of market pro¬
ducts and lower prices have permitted a much freer expression of personal
taste for everyone, irrespective of class. Styles in clothes, for example, vary
more according to age group than according to income group or occupation.
The general level of nutrition is high and is still rising. Because most
housewives have more money to spend, and because those at work have less
time for cooking, the sale of better quality cuts of meat and the more expensive
prepared foods has substantially increased. Poultry, vegetables, butter and
cream are among the other foodstuffs consumed in greater quantities than a
decade ago while the consumption of bread and flour has declined. Tea
remains the most popular beverage, but many more people are drinking coffee,
including ‘instant’ coffee, than before. The consumption of considerable
20
Home Interests
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
quantities of sweets and chocolate (some 7-8 oz.—221 gr.—per person a week)
remains a notable feature of British eating habits. Many more people are now
interested in ‘good eating’, both of traditional English food and exotic dishes.
Restaurants providing the national dishes of other countries are to be found
throughout Britain; Chinese restaurants predominate but there are also many
which specialise in Indian and Italian food, while the growth in the number of
French bistros has widened the available range of French cuisine. The quality
of domestic cooking has also improved and menus have become more imagin¬
ative, helped by cookery journalism, including television demonstrations, and
a great variety of paper-backed recipe books. Increased affluence and tastes
acquired abroad have likewise increased the demand for wines, spirits and
liqueurs—during the 1960s sales of wines nearly doubled. Beer remains the
most popular alcoholic drink in Britain, consumption per head in 1971 being
184 pints.
Although more cigarettes were smoked in 1971 (over 122,000 million or
about 40 a week per head of population) than ten years previously, the increase
was due to a trend towards smaller (and cheaper) cigarettes and not to an
increase in cigarette tobacco consumption which has fallen since 1959- During
the same period, while sales of pipe tobacco also declined, sales of cigar tobacco
increased nearly threefold. In a consumer survey carried out in 1971, 65 per
cent of men and 42 per cent of women described themselves as smokers.
The share of expenditure on food in total consumer expenditure on goods
and services has declined from 24-5 per cent in 1961 to 20-2 per cent in 1971.
Clothing and footwear account for 8-3 per cent. The most noticeable develop¬
ments have been in the growing range of leisure clothes, in the more adven¬
turous styling in men’s wear, and in the large turnover in mass-produced
fashions for young people, with frequent (and sometimes startling) changes of
style. In this branch of fashion, British designers are among the leading
designers in the world.
The greatly increased diversification and output of consumer products have
been accompanied by a growth of activity to protect and help the shopping
public. Which?, the magazine of the Consumers’ Association, a non-govern¬
mental organisation, publishes appraisals of selected consumer goods and has
over 600,000 subscribers with an estimated readership of more than three
million. Over million people a year visit the Design Centre in London where
consumer goods in current production, which meet its criteria of good design,
are displayed.
In Britain, as in many other countries, a considerable proportion of people’s
free time is spent in their homes; on a weekday evening, for instance, seven
out of eight of the adult population are likely to be found at home, watching
television, reading newspapers or books, listening to the radio or the record
player, playing musical instruments (guitars are particularly popular among
young people), or entertaining friends. Many of them also have hobbies,
some of which demand considerable skill and financial outlay, their varied
interests being catered for by magazines and periodicals of all kinds, including
papers dealing with sport, magazines about current ‘pop’ music, do-it-yourse f
and gardening weeklies, and illustrated instructional periodicals which build
up into encyclopedias of art, science or general knowledge.
Nine out of ten families in Britain have a television set and it is thought that
more leisure time is spent watching television than on any other pastime,
average viewing time per head of population is over 15 hours a week. Audiences
for the most popular programmes exceed 15 million.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
21
Entertainments
Outside the Home
Nearly one-third of the total population are registered members of public
libraries. Book sales have increased—a widening range of titles, including
works of scholarship, being bought in the comparatively cheap ‘paper-backed5
form, which constitutes well over half the total book production. More
‘comics’1 are produced per head of the child population than in any other
European country; their sale reaches about nine million a week.
Sales of long-playing records (LPs), including ‘pop5 albums, have increased
sharply during the past decade, partly in response to lower prices; the 1971
production figure of 72 million was four times greater than in 1961. The
production of ‘extended play5 and ‘single5 records—on the weekly sales of
which the ‘pop5 music popularity placings, known as the ‘Top Ten5 and the
‘Top Twenty5, are calculated—reached its peak in 1964; the 1971 production
figure was 48 million.
About four out of five families do most of their own decorating, and the
large sales of hand-tools and of small power tools testify to the extent and
range of home carpentry and other crafts. Gardening is another major interest;
in spite of the high proportion of the population living in urban areas, at least
half the families in Britain have some garden, and the general standard of
cultivation in both town and country gardens is high. Over 3,000 local
horticultural societies are affiliated to the National Allotment Garden Society,
and there are a large number of unaffiliated societies. Probably about 20
million people do some gardening in their spare time. The numerous flower
and vegetable shows held in town and country are very popular, and there is a
large attendance at the more important of them, including the annual Chelsea
Flower Show.
In Britain, many households have a pet; the favourite pets are budgerigars,
cats and dogs. Annual registrations of pedigree dogs at the Kennel Club have
more than trebled since 1938—reaching a total of 161,000 in 1971; the leading
breed in numbers, is the Alsatian. There are 3,500 dog show's every year, of
which Cruft’s is the best known, and between 20,000 and 25,000 breeders.
The increasing diversity of entertainments outside the home includes, for
young people, discotheques and ‘pop5 concerts. The cinemas, many of which
show international as well as British films, are popular among young people,
although audiences in general have been declining for several years. Theatres
continue to appeal to all age groups throughout Britain; although the theatre¬
going public is not a large one, the new theatres opened during the last decade
are well supported. Ballet, opera and concerts of classical music also have an
enthusiastic and growing public. Amateur dramatic and music-making societies
flourish, encouraged by the increasing number of local and national festivals
which have become a feature of British cultural life. Special art exhibitions
often attract large audiences.
Dancing is very popular, especially with those under 35 years of age; it is
thought that over 6 million people go dancing each week. There are between
3,000 and 4,000 regular dance halls throughout the country, including public
dance halls and halls operated by the major dance schools (which are open at
least three times a week), and about 4,000 other schools of dancing. Public
dances are often held in other halls, while many of the clubs and societies
which abound in Britain hold dances occasionally in their own or hired
premises. For younger people formal ballroom dancing is fast being super¬
seded by dances involving spontaneous movement to the rhythms and moods
1 Comics are papers for children (normally appearing weekly) which consist largely of
picture stories and cartoons. Horror comics are illegal.

BRITAIN I973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of ‘pop’ music. However, ballroom dancing, together with Scottish, English
and Irish traditional dances, retains a following particularly among the over¬
thirties. The folk dancing festival held each year at the Royal Albert Hall in
London is well attended.
The public house—the ‘pub’ or the ‘local’—has for many years been a
centre of social life for a large number of people (especially men) in Britain.
Pubs, besides offering a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and
providing (in increasing numbers) hot and cold food, serve as places for meet¬
ing friends and for entertainment; many have, for instance, television sets,
amusement machines and juke-boxes and provide facilities for playing darts,
billiards, dominoes and similar games. Some also employ musicians for even¬
ing entertainment, such as piano playing, folk singing and modern jazz.
‘Bingo’1 is widely played in converted cinemas and in club rooms and village
halls; legalised by the gambling Acts of the 1960s, it provides a form of social
entertainment of particular value to the elderly and lonely, and does not
involve large sums of money. There are some 115 commercial gaming clubs,
operating under strict legislative control. Betting shops number some 14,500.
The turnover of money staked by the public on horse and greyhound racing
is of the order of £1,200 million a year, about four-fifths of which is staked
on horse-races. Betting on football matches, both at fixed odds and through
football pools, is widespread, but usually for smaller stakes.
Increasing prosperity and leisure have affected interest in playing and
watching both outdoor and indoor sports—an interest which has been stimu¬
lated by frequent television broadcasts of sporting events. According to the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) audience research figures, the sports
most popular with viewers, are, in order: football, boxing, athletics, show-
jumping, horse-racing and tennis. Large crowds continue to be attracted to
the major sporting spectacles, such as the association football ‘Cup Final’ at
Wembley, the international rugby matches at Twickenham, the Lawn Tennis
Championships at Wimbledon, and the ‘classic’ horse-races. A growth in
active participation is reported by the governing bodies of almost every sport.
With more money to spend more people are able to enjoy minority sports,
such as golf, sailing, riding and skiing. The steadily rising sales of sports
goods indicate the increased enthusiasm for open air leisure activities,
especially among younger people.
Clubs and Groups A number of people in all age-groups and occupations spend much of their
free time in the more serious group activities associated, for instance, with the
churches, the trade unions, local or national politics, social welfare and reform,
and in educational and cultural pursuits—every year some one and a half
million people attend non-vocational adult education classes in a very wide
range of subjects. A feature of recent years has been the forming of new groups
outside the official welfare bodies to meet newly recognised needs—the Cam¬
bridge Literacy Group, for instance, which helps illiterate adults to learn to
read and write. Novel methods of fund-raising, such as sponsoring long¬
distance walks, have been introduced.
Some of the longer-established clubs and societies are organised on a
national basis and have branches throughout the country; these include the
Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and the
Women’s Institutes. Working Men’s Clubs, affiliated to the Working Men’s
Club and Institute Union, number nearly 4,000 and have over 3-6 million

members (mainly but not entirely men); primarily social and recreational in
nature, the clubs aim at providing amenities comparable with the comforts of
members’ homes and at arranging events, including lectures and classes, of
sufficient interest to compete with the entertainment provided by television.
Over 2,800 Townswomen’s Guilds, with a total membership of some quarter
of a million, are affiliated to the National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds.
The guilds are educational as well as social in purpose, and they co-operate
in many public welfare activities. The declared objective of the National
Federation of Women’s Institutes is to improve rural life and amenities; in
villages throughout England and Wales there are over 9,000 institutes with
a total of nearly half a million members. In Scotland and Northern Ireland
there are Women’s Rural Institutes with similar aims and interests.
Over 40 million people in Britain take an annual holiday and many now
take two holidays a year. Most people spend their holidays away from home;
one in two travel by car (three in ten going abroad), most of them preferring
to tour. The number of people who go abroad for their holidays has risen from
a million in the early 1950s to over 7 million in 1971. The popularity of
foreign travel is attributable to several factors besides rising incomes: the
attraction of the sun which makes Spain, France and Italy the most popular
destinations for the British tourist; the many charter and other airline services
provided; and the readiness of the travel trade to provide inexpensive, in¬
clusive holidays. A by-product has been an increase in the number of adults
who, with the help of radio and television programmes and by attending adult
classes, are studying foreign languages to add to what they learned at school.
Of those who stay in Britain an increasing number enjoy active holidays, such
as canoeing, sailing and pony-trekking; camping under canvas, in caravans and
in specially equipped vehicles, is becoming increasingly popular.
More people in Britain own cars than ever before and the number is still
rising. There is an increasing number of ‘two-car’ families and some families
have more. In mid-1971 there were about 12 million cars licensed on the
roads in Great Britain, compared with 5-5 million in i960. There is still a large
number of motor cycles (including motor scooters)—1 million in 1971—but
fewer than in 1962, when the licence figure was 1-9 million. Sales of bicycles
to the home market reached 768,000 in 1971 which, though lower than in
I959> was higher than in recent years.
Although the number of motor vehicles has continued to increase, the
number of total casualties from road accidents has not risen proportionately.
In 1971, 7,700 persons were killed and some 90,000 seriously injured. Though
deaths increased slightly in 1971 total casualties fell as they did over the five-
year period 1967-71. The rate of deaths per 1,000 vehicles licensed has been
progressively reduced from 3-2 in 1930 to 0-5 in 1971 partly through advances
in medical and surgical techniques as well as in vehicle design, road construc¬
tion and road safety legislation, for instance the introduction of the ‘breath¬
alyser’ (a means of administering a breath test to indicate the level of alcohol
in the blood).
Increasing population and social developments are affecting the physical
appearance of Britain. The spread of car ownership, which has changed the
whole pattern of leisure activities, has also led to a new and more scattered
distribution of houses and to different siting for factories, shops and offices. It
is also one of the main reasons for the large-scale urban reconstruction and
road development programmes which are now being carried out. In general,

Changes in
British Society
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
towns and cities are being altered to accommodate more traffic and house more
people; experiments are being tried in remodelling town centres with pedes¬
trian precincts; multi-storey blocks of flats and offices pierce the skyline. In
addition to new roads and motorways, more reservoirs are needed to supply
the growing demand for water and more lines to carry electric power for the
growing volume of appliances.
In modern industrial society in a densely populated country there is much
scope for conflict between the need for new communal facilities and the desire
to preserve existing beauty or places of historic interest, and between potential
users of a new service and people whose way of life is threatened by the need
to accommodate it. As a result the activities of the established amenity societies,
such as the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the National Trust
and the Georgian Society, are being supplemented to a growing extent by
those of groups formed expressly to safeguard the amenities of a particular area
and to give publicity to the views of the people they represent.
Growing public concern about the dangers both to health and to the natural
environment caused by the unregulated disposal of industrial and human
waste, by exhaust fumes and by the rising volume of noise is reflected in the
appointment by the Government of a standing Royal Commission on En¬
vironmental Pollution and an Advisory Council on Noise. European Con¬
servation Year 1970 gave an impetus to the activities of societies such as the
National Society for Clean Air, the Noise Abatement Society and the Council
for Nature and many organisations contributed to the discussions preceding
the United Nations conference on the environment held in Stockholm in 1972.
In the past 20 years the traditional pattern of life in Britain has undergone
considerable change. Not only have distinctions of class and social habits
become less rigid, but subjects formerly taboo in public discussion are now
openly considered in books, plays and films and in ordinary conversation. A
more informed tolerance of behaviour which deviates from the usual pattern is
reflected, for instance, in the growing popular sympathy for the difficulties of
the unmarried mother. The passing of new laws on such matters as abortion,
divorce and homosexuality, although disliked by many people (particularly of
the older generation), is nevertheless indicative of public unwillingness to
penalise individuals with particular personal problems. Similarly, changes in
the law applying to young offenders reflect the view that it is unreasonable to
treat children who have broken the law as fundamentally different from other
children in trouble.
This liberalising trend is balanced by a recognition that, in some areas,
restrictions on certain freedoms must be extended in the interests of society as
a whole—hence legislation on race relations and the control of dangerous
drugs and firearms.
Relationships between the generations are also undergoing considerable
change, with the result that there is today a greater readiness than there has
ever been on the part of children and young people to criticise traditional
institutions and to seek more influence in shaping society. This desire for
personal involvement is manifest not only among those prepared to demon¬
strate for or against certain courses of action and to bring pressure on the
responsible authorities, but also among the increasing numbers of young
people who offer their services, both as individuals and as members of
voluntary organisations, to help the old, the immigrants, the disabled, the
illiterate, and others in need.
2 GOVERNMENT
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State, whose origins and traditions
are to be found in the history of each of its four component parts: England,
Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. England was unified under a Saxon
king in the ninth century; Wales became part of that kingdom and Ireland
was joined with it before the end of the thirteenth century; and the English
and Scottish thrones were dynastically united in the person of James I and VI
in 1603. In 1707 the Treaty for the Union of England and Scotland provided
that the two countries ‘should be forever united into one kingdom’, and one
Parliament (the Parliament of Great Britain) became the supreme authority
in both countries. In 1801 the Act for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland
1800, which joined the Irish Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain,
established the United Kingdom. In 1922 the 26 counties of Southern Ireland
(now the Republic of Ireland) became a self-governing country, outside the
United Kingdom. Meantime, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 had en¬
acted a constitution for Northern Ireland which, while preserving the supreme
authority of the United Kingdom Parliament and reserving certain matters to
that Parliament, provided Northern Ireland with its own legislature and
executive, to deal with domestic ‘transferred’ affairs. As from March 1972, the
Northern Ireland Parliament has been prorogued1 and all its legislative and
executive powers transferred to the United Kingdom Parliament and Govern¬
ment (see p. 41).
The United Kingdom is a unitary, not a federal, State but methods of
government are flexible and, to some extent, adapted to the needs of the
constituent countries. England and Wales on the one hand, and Scotland on
the other, continue as before the Union to have different systems of law, a
different judiciary, different educational systems, different systems of local
government, national churches on a different footing, and, for most domestic
matters, different government departments. In Scotland these departments
have headquarters in Edinburgh and are grouped under the Secretary of State
for Scotland, who is a member of the Cabinet.
There is also a considerable measure of devolution in the administration of
Welsh affairs to the Welsh Office, under the Secretary of State for Wales—
a Cabinet Minister who is assisted by a Minister of State. The Northern
Ireland government departments are, temporarily, subject to the control and
direction of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies,
not part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and
systems of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same
time, they have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of
their proximity to it and the antiquity of their connection with the Crown.
Her Majesty’s Government is responsible for their defence, their international
relations, and ultimately, their good government.
1 Under the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972 which will continue
in force for one year and will then expire, unless an Order in Council has been made
directing that it shall continue in force for a further period of one year from the time at
which it would otherwise have expired.
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The United Kingdom Parliament has the ultimate responsibility for the
good government of the few remaining British overseas dependencies, although
these are administered by territorial governments and are at various stages
of development towards full self-government. The United Kingdom is also
one of the independent member nations of the Commonwealth,1 which all
acknowledge the Queen as the symbol of their free association and, as such,
the head of the Commonwealth. On 1st January 1973 Britain will become a
member of the European Communities (see p. 459).
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions,
which have never been codified and are not directly enforceable in a court of
law, but which, nevertheless, have a binding force as rules of the constitution.
Because the constitution is not contained in any document, because it can be
altered by the passing of an Act of Parliament or by general agreement to vary,
abolish or create a convention, it can the more readily be adapted to changing
political conditions and ideas without serious disturbance to existing organs
and forms.
The organs of government in the constitution are readily distinguishable
although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They are:
1. the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm;
2. the executive, which consists of: (a) the Cabinet and other ministers of the
Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national policy;
(b) government departments, most of them under the control of ministers
and all staffed by civil servants, which are responsible for administration
at the national level; (c) local authorities, which administer and manage
many services at the local level; and (d) statutory boards, which are
severally responsible for the operation of particular nationalised industries
or public services, and which are subject to ministerial control in varying
degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and is
independent of both the legislature and the executive.
The following pages describe these three organs of government in some
detail in order to show how the constitution of the United Kingdom works.2
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II
is a descendant of the Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the
year 829, and of Malcolm II, whose reign in Scotland (1005-34) was cor¬
respondingly important in that part of the realm.
1 The other members are: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Bangladesh^ Sri
Lanka, Ghana, Malaysia, Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Jamaica, Trinidad
and Tobago, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Malta, Zambia, The Gambia, Singapore,
Guyana, Botswana, Lesotho, Barbados, Mauritius, Swaziland, Tonga, Western Samoa
and Fiji. In addition, Nauru is a special member, participating in functional activities
but not in meetings of Heads of Government.
2 A Commission on the Constitution is considering whether any changes are desirable
in the present constitutional relationships between the several countries, nations and
regions of the United Kingdom and also between the United Kingdom and the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man.
GOVERNMENT
27
Succession
Accession
Coronation
According to the Royal Titles Act 1953, the royal title in the United
Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The form of the royal title is varied for the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, to suit the particular
circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. For the performance of
royal functions in Northern Ireland the Queen’s representative is the Governor;
in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a
Lieutenant-Governor. In the other member nations of the Commonwealth
which owe allegiance to the Crown the Queen’s representative is the Governor-
General, who is appointed by the Crown on the advice of the ministers of the
country concerned and is wholly independent of the United Kingdom
Government. In the United Kingdom dependencies the Queen is usually
represented by Governors who are appointed by the Crown, have varying
executive and legislative powers, and are responsible to the United Kingdom
Government for the good government of the countries concerned.
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement 1701, which
provided that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most
excellent Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’. Sub¬
sequent Succession to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration; and
although succession is not bound to continue in its present line, it cannot now
be altered (under a provision of the Statute of Westminster 1931) except by
common consent of the member nations of the Commonwealth which owe
allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which provide
that the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the Throne accord¬
ing to their seniority; if there are no sons, the daughters succeed in order of
their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-Regnant and
the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully and effectively as though she
were a king. By convention, the consort of a king takes the rank and style of her
husband; the converse, however, does not apply and the constitution has never
attached any special rank or privileges to the husband of the Queen-Regnant
although in practice he may fill an important role in the life of the nation.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession
of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new
Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of the
Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Lord
Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London, and the
High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the Commonwealth
are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval which
may last for a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the same in
substance for nearly a thousand years although the details have frequently
been modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of the time. The
service used at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 was derived from
that used at the coronation of King Edgar at Bath in the year 973.

GOVERNMENT
Acts of
Government
29
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of
representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests
in the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the
other Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in
England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, the commander-in-chief
of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established
Church of England. In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process
during which the absolute power of the monarchy has been progressively
reduced, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she cannot
constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The United
Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the
Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation
during the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers
without any necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts of
government which require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; as a general rule
she opens the new session with a speech from the throne (although this may
be read by the Lord Chancellor if the Queen is unable to be present); and she
must give Royal Assent before a Bill which has passed all its stages in both
Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enactment. The Queen is ‘the fountain
of justice’ and as such can remit all or part of the penalties imposed on people
convicted of crime. As ‘the fountain of honour’, the Queen confers peerages,
baronetcies, knighthoods and other honours,1 and makes appointment to all
important State offices, including those of judges, officers in the armed forces,
governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions in the established Church
of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are required before a minister
can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the realm of international affairs,
by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the State, the Queen has the power
to conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory, to declare war and to make
peace.
These and similar acts of government involve the use of the royal preroga¬
tive which has been defined as ‘the residue of discretionary authority legally
left in the hands of the Crown’.2 Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of
this authority is shown in three constitutional ways in which the royal will can
be expressed: by Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice of the Privy
Council’; by Order, Commission or Warrant signed personally by the Queen
and generally bearing the signature of one or more responsible ministers; or
by Proclamation, Writs, Letters Patent, or other documents under the Great
Seal affixed by the Lord Chancellor in obedience to a Royal Warrant counter¬
signed by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a
few (the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order, the Most Noble Order of the
Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient Order of the Thistle) are in the
Sovereign’s personal gift.
2 Other powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by Royal Charter;
the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants; the admini¬
stration of charities; coinage; the grant of franchises, for example, to markets, ferries
and fisheries; the right to treasure trove; and to print, or to licence others to print, the
Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and State papers.
30
Ceremonial and
Royal Visits
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the
smooth working of government; for although the Queen has no personal
authority and must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be
informed and consulted on every aspect of the national life. The Queen holds
meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and other
holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet decisions,
reads dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them
if the Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or is under the age of 18 years on
accession to the throne. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act 1953—
laid down that the first potential Regent should be The Prince Philip, Duke
of Edinburgh, and thereafter those in succession to the throne who are of age.
In the event of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision
is made for the appointment of Counsellors of State (generally the wife or
husband of the Sovereign, and the four adult persons next in succession
to the Crown1) to whom the Sovereign may delegate by Letters Patent certain
royal functions. But Counsellors of State may not, for instance, dissolve
Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign), nor create
peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the
British Isles and, in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered
outlook of both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages are
the same today as they were many centuries ago. Royal marriages, the birth of
royal children and royal funerals are marked by ancient ceremonial, although
to a lesser degree than in former days. The birthday of the Sovereign is officially
celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on the Horse Guards Parade
and is also celebrated as Commonwealth Day. State banquets take place when
a foreign monarch or head of State visits the United Kingdom; investitures
are held at Buckingham Palace; and royal processions add significance to
such occasions as the opening of Parliament, when the Queen drives in state
from Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating
from the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal
ordinances, established custom and the public will. The Queen and other
members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every
year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial
and charitable works of national importance ensures nation-wide interest and
support. The Sovereign herself pays State visits, often accompanied by other
members of the royal family, to foreign governments and undertakes lengthy
tours in other countries of the Commonwealth. Other members of the royal
family pay official and private visits overseas.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—the
House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate; they are con¬
stituted on different principles; they do different work in different places; and
1 The Regency Act 1953 provided that Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother should be
added to the persons to whom royal functions may be delegated as Counsellors of State.
GOVERNMENT
31
they meet together only on such occasions as the coronation, or the opening
or closing of a session of Parliament when the Commons are summoned by
the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law-making organ of State, however,
Parliament is a corporate body and cannot legislate without the concurrence
of all its parts (except in the case of Bills passed under the Parliament Acts
1911 and 1949).
The Parhament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the
United Kingdom. It can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, or any
of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination of them. It can
also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, but in these islands,
it is not the only legislature, for the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey
legislate1 on domestic matters in the two Channel Island Bailiwicks, and the
Tynwald Court in the Isle of Man. Nevertheless, the Parliament at West¬
minster retains supreme authority, and within practical limits there is nothing
that it cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 the life of a United Kingdom
Parliament was fixed at five years (although it may be dissolved and a general
election held before the expiry of the legal term); and since one Parliament
cannot bind its successor (for otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not
be sovereign or supreme), each assembly has a period of time of up to five
years during which it may legislate exactly as it chooses. During its life, it can
make or unmake any law; destroy by statute the most firmly established con¬
vention or turn a convention into binding law; or legalise past illegalities and
make void and punishable what was lawful when done and thus reverse the
decisions of the courts.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice
Parliament does not exercise its supremacy in this way. Not only is it aware of
its international position and of any international obligations it may have
assumed but it also bears in mind the common law which has grown up in
Britain throughout the centuries and acts as far as possible in accordance with
precedent and tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parlia¬
ment that has been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the
proper authority cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be
likely to pass an Act which it knew would receive no public support. The
system of party government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with
its responsibility to the electorate in mind.
The Meeting of
Parliament
A Parliament, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with
a proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council.
Such a proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and,
on the other, orders the issue of writs for election and announces the date on
which the new Parliament is to meet. This cannot be less than 20 days after
the proclamation, but it may be more.
The life of a Parliament is usually divided up into a number of sessions—
the normal pattern of sitting being one of annual sessions w’ith each Parlia¬
ment being dissolved after five years, though this pattern is often varied. Each
session is terminated by prorogation—usually effected by a commission
under the Great Seal, which appoints the day and place of its meeting in a new
session. The date so appointed may be brought forward or deferred by a
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man consist of the Queen, the
Privy Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the
member of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each
legislative measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.

Lords

subsequent proclamation. The effect of a prorogation is at once to terminate
all business (with certain minor exceptions) until Parliament is summoned again.
During a session either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to such
date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business. A
reassembly of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or on the
initiative of the Government under powers specially conferred by each House
on its Speaker.
The average number of sitting days for the House of Commons is 165,
divided by custom into the following periods: one from November until
Christmas lasting about 40 sitting days, one from January to Easter of about
50 sitting days, one from Easter until Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and
one from Whitsun until the end of July lasting about 40-50 sitting days.
Nowadays, the session is sometimes concluded with a short period of up to
10 sitting days in October, after the long summer adjournment. The House
of Lords sits, on average, for about no days in each session.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Temporal and the Lords Spiritual.
The Lords Temporal may be sub-divided into (1) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who
have not disclaimed their peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life
peers and peeresses created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act 1958,
and (3) Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed under the terms of the
Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 to assist the House in the performance of its
judicial duties and who remain members of the House after their retirement
from office. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the
Church of England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops.
Peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred by the Sovereign on the
advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages carry with them a right to
a seat in the House of Lords, provided the holder is 21 years of age or over,
but anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months of succession,
disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their right to sit
in the House of Lords but they gain the right to vote at parliamentary elections
and to offer themselves for election to the House of Commons.
Not all holders of temporal peerages with a right to sit in the House of
Lords attend the sittings of that House. Those who do not wish to attend may
apply for leave of absence, either for the duration of a particular Parliament
or for a single session.
Peers who frequently attend the House of Lords1 include elder statesmen
and others who have spent their lives in public service. They receive no salary
for their parliamentary work, but they are entitled to travelling expenses from
their homes to the Palace of Westminster (provided they attend at least one-
third of the number of sittings), and (with the exception of the Lord Chancellor,
the Lord Chairman of Committees, the Law Lords and any member in receipt
of a salary as the holder of a ministerial office) they may claim payment for
expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance at the House (except for
judicial sittings) within a maximum of £8-50 a day.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sits
on the woolsack and is ex officio Speaker of the House. The Crown, by com¬
mission under the Great Seal, appoints several members of the House to act
as deputy speakers in the absence of the Lord Chancellor. The first of the

deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of Committees, who is appointed each
session and takes the chair in all committees, unless the House otherwise
directs. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is
charged with keeping the records of proceedings and judgments and with the
promulgation of Acts of Parliament; the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod,
and Serjeant at Arms, who attends the Lord Chancellor and enforces the
orders of the House; and the Yeoman-Usher and Deputy Serjeant at Arms.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of the
community. There are at present 630 seats in the House of Commons (511
for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
Elections are of two kinds: general elections held after a Parliament has
been dissolved and a new one summoned by the Sovereign; and by-elections,
held when a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the death or resigna¬
tion1 of a member, or as a result of his elevation to the House of Lords.
Members are paid an annual salary of £4,500 and an allowance of £1,000 a
year for secretarial and office expenses. They also have a number of other
allowances, including travel allowances and, for provincial members, sub¬
sistence allowances.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members to preside over the House immediately after a new Parliament
is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of
Ways and Means, and the deputy chairmen who act as Deputy Speaker; these
officers are elected by the House on the nomination of the Government and,
like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote other than in their official capacity.
Permanent officers of the House (that is, those who are not members of
Parliament) include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official departments under his control and is
charged with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing Bills and signing
orders, and the Serjeant-at-Arms, wrho attends upon the Speaker, executes the
orders of the House and is generally responsible for its domestic staff arrange¬
ments.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. Permanent
Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
undertake general reviews of constituencies throughout that part of the United
Kingdom for which they are responsible at intervals of not less than ten and
not more than 15 years and report on the changes they recommend. A Com¬
mission is also empowered to submit interim reports on particular consti¬
tuencies if, for instance, it is necessary to bring constituency boundaries into
line with altered local government boundaries. The recommendations in the
last reports of the Commissions were approved by Parliament in 1970.2
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the
Representation of the People Act 1949 as amended by the Act of 1969. Under
1 If a member wishes to resign from the House, he may apply either for what is techni¬
cally an office of profit under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds and Steward
of the Manor of Northstead), but to which, in fact, no remuneration attaches, or for a
directorship by government nomination in a commercial company which is an ordinary
trading concern (see p. 34).
2 These provide for 635 constituencies, instead of 630 as at present, and will come into
force at the next general election.

Parliamentary
Privilege
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the provisions of these Acts, election to the House of Commons is decided by
secret ballot in which British subjects (except members of the House of Lords)
and citizens of the Irish Republic are entitled to vote (voting is not com¬
pulsory), provided that they are 18 years old or over, and are not subject to
any legal incapacity to vote. Those eligible to vote in any constituency are
those who are recorded on the register1 of electors for the constituency as
resident in that constituency on a date fixed by statute. Each elector may cast
one vote, normally in person at a polling station, although members of the
armed forces, Crown servants of the United Kingdom and staff of the British
Council employed overseas, and wives or husbands of such persons, if resident
overseas with their married partners, may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or
in certain cases by proxy, may also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in
person because of physical incapacity or the nature of his work or on grounds
of religious observance.
Anyone, male or female, who is a British subject aged 21 or over, and is not
otherwise disqualified may stand as a candidate in any constituency at a
parliamentary election. Those who are disqualified include members of the
House of Lords, clergy of the Church of England, the Church of Scotland,
the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church, undischarged bank¬
rupts, and those expressly disqualified by the House of Commons Disqualifica¬
tion Act 1957, for instance, holders of judicial offices, civil servants, members
of the regular armed forces and the police forces, and government-nominated
directors of commercial companies which are ordinary trading concerns.
The conduct of elections, including the manner in which candidates can be
nominated for election, is likewise governed by provisions of the 1949 and 1969
Acts. The maximum sum of money that a candidate may spend on his election
campaign was laid down in the 1969 Act as £750, plus ^0-05 for each eight
electors in a borough constituency and £0*05 for each six electors in a county
constituency. The prescribed scale is not required to cover a candidate’s
personal expenses, for instance, the cost of his living at an hotel during the
election campaign, but any such expenses beyond j£ioo must be paid by his
election agent and particulars sent to the returning officer.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain rights and immunities designed to
protect the House from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties.
These rights apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown
for the Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include freedom of speech in debate;
and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the right of the House to control its own
proceedings (so that it is able, for instance, to exclude strangers if it so wishes);
the right to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to
declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise those who
commit a breach of its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords include: freedom of speech in debate;
freedom of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to
commit for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker
as in the House of Commons; they exist independently without grant.

Elections in
1970 and 1966
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, and has now become an essential element in the working of the
constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties,
each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a general
election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for election; any
other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then indicates, by its
choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the opposing policies
it would like to see put into effect.
In the general election held in June 1970, 72 per cent1 of the electorate
voted, compared with 75-8 per cent in October 1966. The number and percent¬
age of votes cast for the principal parties is shown in Table 4.
The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the
general elections of 1970 and 1966 is shown in Table 5.
“ Others include the Speaker, Republican Labour (Northern Ireland), Communists,
Scottish and Welsh Nationalists, Independents, and members of individual parties,
few of which were represented by more than one candidate.

° When a candidate at the polls the Speaker remains aloof from party issues, standing
as ‘the Speaker seeking re-election’. In the past it was customary to allow the Speaker
an unopposed election in his constituency but this is by no means settled practice and
since the end of the second world war the Speaker has almost always been opposed.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority
of supporters in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition,
the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign,
usually on the advice of senior ministers; and its most outstanding members
in the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial appoint¬
ments on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes

the official Opposition with its own leader1 and its own council of discussion
or ‘shadow Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties or any Indepen¬
dents who have been elected may support the Government or the Opposition
according to their party’s or their own view of the policy being debated at any
given time.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable
extent upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on
by agreement: that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must govern
and therefore accepts its decisions; and the majority agrees that the minority
should criticise and therefore sets time aside for that criticism to be heard. The
detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the direction
of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House, by the Government Chief
Whip in consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip. The Chief Whips
together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in the House of
Commons when the question of the possibility of finding time for debating
some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the business of the House
is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the House, and it is his duty
to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters about which
it is concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates, and conveying upwards to the party leadership the opinions of their
back-bench members. The Government Chief Whip in the House of Commons
is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; of the other Government Whips,
three (one of whom is deputy Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal Household,
five hold titular posts as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury and four are
paid Assistant Whips. Two of the Assistant Whips for the Opposition also
receive salaries. Salaries are likewise paid to the Chief Opposition Whip and
his counterpart in the House of Lords. The Government Whips in the House
of Lords hold offices in the Royal Household and sometimes act as spokesmen
for the Government in debates.
The Functions The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws regulating the life of
of Parliament the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make
available finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the funds
necessary for the services of the State, and (3) to put relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratifi¬
cation of certain international treaties and agreements (in spite of the fact
that the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the
Government and, in theory, is not subject to parliamentary approval).
Parliamentary Parliamentary procedure is largely based on custom and precedent, supple-
Procedure mented by standing orders governing details of practice in each House. The
system of debate is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every
matter is determined upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and
resolved in the affirmative or negative, as the case may be; members speak
from wherever they have been sitting and not from a rostrum; and members

do not read their speeches. The main difference is that in the House of Lords
the office of Speaker carries with it no inherent authority to check or curtail
debate, such matters being decided by the general sense of the House, whereas
in the Commons the Speaker has full authority to give effect, promptly and
decisively, to the rules and orders of the House. He must carefully guard
against abuse of procedure or any infringement of minority rights, and it is his
duty to allow or disallow any closure motion (that is, a motion to end discussion
so that the matter may be put to the vote). He has certain powers to check
irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to save the time of the House in various
other respects. In case of grave disorder he has power to adjourn the House or
suspend the sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast, the Speaker, who has no original vote, must give the casting
vote; he does this (if possible) in such a way as to avoid change and leave
the question to be decided on another occasion. The procedure on voting in the
House of Lords is similar to that in the House of Commons, except that
the Speaker or chairman has an original, but no casting, vote—the House of
Lords being governed by the principle that unless there is a majority in favour
the question is decided in the negative. When the House is sitting judicially
(see pp. 82 and 85) the question is put in such a way that, if the votes are equal,
there is no interference with the order under appeal.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare occa¬
sions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Proceedings
and in the House of Lords, Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The
Official Report of Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published daily.
Public Bills can be introduced by any member of either House, but no Bill
involving taxation or the spending of public money will proceed very far in
the Commons unless the Government agrees to introduce a ‘money resolution’
to cover it. This has the effect of giving the Government control over a wide
field of legislation. In the House of Commons certain days are set aside for
debating private members’ Bills;1 that is, public Bills introduced by mem¬
bers of the House not holding office in the Government, who have been suc¬
cessful in the ballot, held early in each session, of members wishing to introduce
Bills. Peers can introduce private members’ Bills in the House of Lords at any
time during a session without notice. Also, persons and bodies outside Parlia¬
ment can promote private Bills relating solely to matters of individual,
corporate or local interest.
Bills may originate in either House, unless their main purpose is financial,
when they must be introduced in the Commons. As a rule, however, Bills likely
to raise political controversy go through the Commons before the Lords,
while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature are frequently intro¬
duced and debated in the Lords before being sent to the Commons.
The process of passing a public Bill is basically the same in the House of
Lords as in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal first reading
on introduction; it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies
between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it
1 A private member may also present a Bill after Question Time on notice given, or seek
leave to introduce a Bill under the ‘Ten Minute Rule’, that is, the standing order which
allows a brief speech proposing and another opposing the introduction of the Bill before
the House decides whether or not to grant leave. If a private member’s Bill secures a
second reading the Government will usually introduce any necessary money resolution.
38
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is given a second reading after a debate on its general merits or principles. In
the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to a Second Reading
Committee to recommend whether or not it should be taken as read a second
time. After a second reading in the Commons a Bill is referred for detailed
examination either to a standing committee or, if the House so decides, to the
whole House sitting in committee; in the Lords it is referred to a committee
of the whole House. The committee stage is followed by the report stage,
during which previous amendments may be altered and additional amend¬
ments may be suggested and incorporated. The last stage is the third reading
which provides an opportunity for a Bill to be reviewed in its final form. In
the Commons this stage may be taken without debate unless there is a motion
on the Order Paper in the name of six members that the question be not put
forthwith—a procedure of which substantial use is made. After the third
reading, the Bill is sent from the Commons to the Lords or from the Lords to
the Commons (depending on its place of origin), when it enters on the same
course again. Any amendments which the second House makes to the Bill
must be agreed to by the first House, or a compromise reached, before the
Bill can become law.
In practice, the Lords pass without amendment such financial Bills1 as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing taxa¬
tion, and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the Supply
Services from the Consolidated Fund. These Bills are introduced upon
resolutions in the House of Commons; they may be initiated only by a
Minister of the Crown.
When Bills have passed through their various parliamentary stages, they are
sent for Royal Assent, which is given by the Sovereign in Letters Patent and
is declared to both Houses by their Speakers or, occasionally, by Royal Com¬
mission. The Sovereign’s power to refuse assent has not been exercised since
the early eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; they
are then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent.
Ilowever, should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would
never reach the Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it—
at any rate until a new government came into power, when it might be re¬
introduced. The Lords, on the other hand, cannot prevent a Bill insisted upon
by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal course of events,
they either accept a Bill from the Commons and return it unchanged; or they
revise and improve it by amendments and return it for the consideration of
members of the other House, who frequently agree to the amendments made.
They can, however, delay a non-financial Commons Bill for about six months.
These limitations on the powers of the Lords are based on the belief that the
principal function of the modern House (which is a non-elected assembly) in
respect of legislation is to act as a chamber of revision and that its object is to
complement the House of Commons and not to rival it.
In substance, a private Bill goes through the same procedure as a public
Bill but most of the work is done in committee, where proceedings follow a
semi-judicial pattern: the promoters must prove the need for the powers or
privileges that they seek and objections on the part of opposing interests are
heard. Both parties may be represented by counsel.
1 Under the Parliament Act 1911 a Bill that deals only with taxation or expenditure
must receive Royal Assent within one month of being sent to the House of Lords,
whether or not the Lords have agreed to it.

Parliamentary
Committees
Delegated
Legislation
39
Either House may resolve itself into a committee, known as a Committee of
the Whole House, to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after their
second reading. A Committee of the Whole House is presided over by the
Chairman of Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees in the House of
Lords) or one of his two deputies instead of by the Speaker.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of which
exist to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised and complex
work. They are:
1. Standing Committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons to
deal with public Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the
second reading and the report stages. With the exception of the Scottish
Grand Committee1 (which considers Scottish estimates and other matters
relating exclusively to Scotland), and the Welsh Grand Committee2 (for
which parallel arrangements exist), standing committees3 consist of from
16 to 50 members nominated for each Bill by the Committee of Selection
(a body normally consisting of 11 members drawn from the main parties
in the House in accordance with party strengths at the beginning of each
session). The procedure of a standing committee is generally similar to
that of a Committee of the Whole House.
2. Select Committees, which are appointed to enquire into and report to the
House on special matters. Select Committees are appointed by either House
when the occasion for such an appointment occurs, or at the beginning
of a session (some of them by standing order) to consider all aspects of a
particular subject that may arise during the session. The latter type of
committee is known as a ‘sessional’ committee and includes in the House
of Commons the Committee of Public Accounts, the Expenditure Com¬
mittee, the Committee of Privileges, and the Committees on Nationalised
Industries, Statutory Instruments, Procedure, Public Petitions and House of
Commons (Services). In the House of Lords there are committees on special
orders, personal Bills, procedures, offices, privileges, leave of absence and the
Appeal and Appellate Committees. The House of Commons also has a few
specialist select committees such as the Committee on Race Relations and
Immigration and the Committee on Scottish Affairs. Other committees
include the Standing Orders Committee which has duties relating to private
Bills; and joint select committees of both Houses of Parliament which may be
appointed at the instance of either House.
In addition to the House of Commons committees there are the parliamen¬
tary party organisations: the Conservative and Unionist Members Committee,
popularly known as the 1922 Committee, which consists of the back-bench
membership of the party; and the Parliamentary Labour Party, which is a cor¬
porate body comprising all members of the party in both Houses.
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
parliamentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken

encies and not less than ten nor more than 15 others.
2 The Welsh Grand Committee consists of 36 members for constituencies in Wales and
Monmouthshire, with up to five other nominated members.
3 Not more than two Scottish standing committees may be appointed and each must be
so constituted as to include not less than 16 members representing Scottish con¬
stituencies.

Parliamentary
Control
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in Council
or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to Ministers of the
Crown, to government departments for which ministers are responsible, or to
organisations whose regulations are subject to confirmation or approval by
ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament for them. More¬
over, the Act which delegates power to issue rules and orders1 generally defines
the precise limits of this power and, in the more important cases, gives
Parliament the right to confirm or annul the orders themselves. Certain Acts
also require direct consultation with organisations which will be affected there¬
by before rules and orders are made.
The House of Commons is aided in its supervision of delegated legislation
by the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. The Special Orders Com¬
mittee of the House of Lords examines and reports on all Statutory Instru¬
ments requiring affirmative resolution.
Control of the Government in power is exercised in the final analysis by the
ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign either
by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a matter of
confidence’; but because of party discipline and party loyalties this has not
happened for many years. A number of opportunities for a searching examina¬
tion of government policy by both the Opposition and the Government s own
back-benchers are, however, provided in parliamentary procedure. In the
House of Commons such opportunities include:
1. Question Time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in rotation,
answer questions put to them on matters for which they are responsible.
So much parliamentary time is devoted to scheduled public business that
questions are regarded as one of the best means of eliciting hitherto un¬
published information about the Government’s intentions, as well as an
effective way of airing, and possibly securing some redress of, grievances
brought to the notice of members by their constituents. (Another means
available to members is by way of the Parliamentary Commissioner see
p. 41.)
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the House to
initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern.
There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public business; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
Whitsun and the Summer) there is a whole day spent discussing matters
for which the Government is responsible raised by private members. More¬
over, if a member wishes to discuss a ‘specific and important matter that
should have urgent consideration’ he may, at the end of Question Time,
ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker accepts
the terms of the motion, he asks the House for leave for it to be put forward.
Leave can be given unanimously, or if 40 or more members support the
motion, or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support it and the House
(on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the matter is debated
for three hours, usually on the following day.
3. The practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates has ceased to be
a consideration of the financial requirements of the Government and has

become an occasion for the examination, initiated by the Opposition, of
some aspect of the Government’s administrative policy, the cost of which
has been included in the Estimates.
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during
the debate on the address in reply to the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
a session, during debates or motions of censure for which the Government
gives up part of its own time; and during second reading debates.
The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of Com¬
mons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments for the
public service is described in Chapter n, Finance.
The Parliamentary Commissioner is an independent statutory officer whose
function is to investigate complaints of maladministration brought to his
notice by members of Parliament on behalf of members of the public. His
powers of investigation extend to actions taken by central government depart¬
ments in the exercise of their administrative functions, but not to policy
decisions (which are the concern of the Government). Certain administrative
actions are also outside his jurisdiction; these include matters affecting rela¬
tions with other countries and the activities of British officials outside the
United Kingdom.
In the performance of his duties, the Parliamentary Commissioner has
access to all departmental papers, and reports his findings to the member of
Parliament who presented the case. The Parliamentary Commissioner reports
annually to Parliament and may submit such other reports as he thinks fit. A
Select Committee has been appointed to consider his reports.
There is also a Parliamentary Commissioner for Northern Ireland, whose
status and powers are similar to those of the Parliamentary Commissioner at
Westminster, but who may, in addition, investigate personnel matters in the
Civil Service in Northern Ireland.
Until March 1972 the Northern Ireland Parliament, which consisted of a
Governor representing the Sovereign, 24 senators (of whom 12 were elected
by the House of Commons every four years under a system of proportional
representation) and 52 members elected by a system of parliamentary franchise
similar to that which operates in Great Britain, had power to make laws for the
peace, order and good government of the Province in relation to all matters
except those specially reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament.1
Under the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972 (see p. 25) laws
which could have been made by the Northern Ireland Parliament are made by
Order in Council, normally subject to affirmative resolution in draft by the
United Kingdom Parliament. In cases of urgency an Order may be made
without such approval in draft, but then ceases to have effect after 40 days
unless it has in the meantime been approved by affirmative resolution. All
laws passed and administrative acts done before the transfer of power remain
valid.
A commission, appointed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
from among people ordinarily resident there, is consulted before any Order in
Council is made, although the commission’s advice need not necessarily be
taken.
1 These were: the Crown or succession to the Crown; foreign relations; defence; the
postal service; the Supreme Court; customs and excise; income and profits taxes;
coinage; standards of weights and measures; trade marks; submarine cables; wireless
telegraphy; aerial navigation; and lighthouses, buoys and beacons.

Procedure and
Functions
Committees of
the Privy
Council
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner Committee
of the Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council. The present-day Privy Council is the body on whose advice
and through which the Sovereign exercises his or her statutory, and a number
of prerogative, powers. It also has its own statutory duties, independent of the
power of the Sovereign in Council.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council
(which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation
of the Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have reached eminence
in some branch of public affairs in any country of the Commonwealth. There
are usually about 300 Privy Counsellors.
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council and is presided
over by the Sovereign or, when the Sovereign is abroad or ill, by Counsellors
of State. Three Privy Counsellors form a quorum, but, as a rule, not fewer
than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy Council is called together
only on the death of the Sovereign or when the Sovereign announces his or her
intention to marry.
The Privy Council is responsible for advising the Sovereign to approve
Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing fundamentally in
constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal prerogative, for
example, Orders approving the grant of Royal Charters of Incorporation; and
those made under statutory powers, which are the highest form of delegated
legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the Privy Council
attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby
become personally responsible for the policy upon which the Orders are based;
this rests with the minister whose department is responsible for the subject
matter of the Order in question, whether or not he was present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclama¬
tions, some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parlia¬
ment. Its statutory responsibilities include powers of supervision over the
registering bodies for the medical and allied professions.
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These committees, which have advisory functions, may be preroga¬
tive committees, such as those which deal with legislative matters sub¬
mitted by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and with
applications for the grant of charters of incorporation; or they may be provided
for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the
Scottish universities.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out
in the Privy Council Office under the control of the Lord President of the
Council.

Departmental
Ministers
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council derives its appellate jurisdiction
from the right of subjects of the Crown to appeal for redress to the Sovereign
in Council if they believe that the courts of law have failed to do them justice.
It is now the final court of appeal from the courts of the United Kingdom
dependencies, from the courts of those independent members of the Common¬
wealth (including certain countries of which Her Majesty is no longer Queen)
which have not elected to discontinue the appeal, from prize courts1 in the
United Kingdom and dependencies, from the courts of the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man, and from certain professional disciplinary committees.
It also has jurisdiction in a limited class of English ecclesiastical appeals.
Appeals come to the Judicial Committee either where a right of appeal has
been specially created—for instance, by statute, Order in Council or Letters
Patent—or by special leave of the Sovereign in Council on the advice of the
Judicial Committee. They are heard by a board of the committee, whose
members are usually selected from the Lord Chancellor, ex-Lord Chancellors
and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, although other members of the Privy
Council who have held high judicial office (including chief justices and certain
other judges from Commonwealth countries overseas) are asked to sit from
time to time. In theory the Judicial Committee does not deliver judgment.
It advises the Sovereign who acts on its report and approves an Order in
Council to give effect thereto. Its decisions, though not binding on the English
courts, are treated with great respect by them.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time being
with the administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. There
are, however, always some ministers in the House of Lords, partly because
there is a statutory limit to the number of ministers who may sit and vote in
the Commons while receiving salaries from the Crown, and also because every
Government must be assured of spokesmen to expound and justify its inten¬
tions and its actions to the House of Lords. The Lord Chancellor is always a
member of the House of Lords.
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The creation
of a ministerial office with entirely new functions requires legislation, but the
abolition of an office, the transfer of functions from one minister to another,
or a change in the designation of a minister may be effected by Order in
Council. Functionally ministers may be classified under the following heads:
The Prime Minister, who is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister
for the Civil Service.
Departmental Ministers, who are in charge of government departments. The
holders of these offices (most of whom are in the Cabinet) are known as
‘Secretary of State’ or ‘Minister’, or they may have a special title, as in the
case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury
and a number of sub-departments). In the present administration there are

eleven Secretaries of State and two ministers in this category as well as the
Chancellor of the Exchequer. There are also eight ministers with the status
of a minister in charge of a department not represented in the Cabinet, who
are responsible, under a Secretary of State, for a particular part of the acti vities
of the department concerned.1
Non-Departmental Ministers, who include the holders of various traditional
offices—the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster,2 the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and Ministers with¬
out Portfolio. Sometimes these ministers have few or no departmental duties
and are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime Minister
may wish to entrust to them.
The Lord Chancellor, who is in a special position as a Minister of the Crown
with departmental functions, is also head of the judiciary in England and
Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales (and,
temporarily, for Northern Ireland), the Attorney General and the Solicitor
General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for
Scotland.
Ministers of State who are appointed to government departments in which the
work is particularly heavy and complex or where it involves frequent travelling
abroad. There are now two Ministers of State in the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office, the Home Office, the Northern Ireland Office and the Ministry
of Defence; and one each in the Treasury, the Department of Health and Social
Security, the Department of Employment, the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Office, and the Welsh Office.
Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or,
where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under¬
secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve
their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary
debates, answering parliamentary questions, and assisting in departmental
duties. In certain cases, however, they may be given responsibility, directly
under the head of the department, for specific aspects of the department’s
work. The Parliamentary Secretary of the Treasury and the other Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury are in a different category as Government
Whips.
Ministerial salaries range from £20,000 a year for the Prime Minister and
£13,000 for Cabinet ministers to £5,500 for junior ministers. Senior ministers
not in the Cabinet and Ministers of State receive between £9,500 and £7,500-
The Prime Minister and ministers in the House of Commons also have the
parliamentary and secretarial allowances paid to all members of the House.
The Lord Chancellor receives £20,000 a year, £2,000 of which is attributable
to his speakership of the House of Lords.

45

Minister
The Cabinet
Cabinet
Meetings
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during
the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the holder
of this office derives from his ability to command a majority in Parliament and
from his power to submit his own choice of ministers to the Sovereign and to
obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. Nowadays, by convention,
the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise a
general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences and
approving important departmental decisions where reference to the Cabinet
is not required. The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in the House
of Commons on the most important topics and answers questions on its
general administration in that House.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as
for appointments to high judicial offices, such as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown
on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord Lieutenants of counties1 and
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower,
and some university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The
Prime Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various
public boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation,
as well as to various royal and statutory commissions. He likewise makes
recommendations to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and
distinctions and of Civil List pensions, and selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
The Cabinet is composed of ministers2 personally selected by the Prime
Minister and may include the holders of departmental and non-departmental
offices. Its origins can be traced back to the informal conferences that the
Sovereign held with his leading ministers, independently of the Privy Council,
during the seventeenth century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an
active role in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development of
organised political parties stimulated by successive extensions of the franchise
from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of the policy to
be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive
in accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co¬
ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments. The
exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet is a
group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the support
of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publica¬
tion of Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they have been
in existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection in the

Public Record Office) and a resigning minister desiring to make a statement
involving disclosure of Cabinet discussions should first obtain the permission
of the Sovereign through the Prime Minister. From a practical point of view,
this secrecy is essential in the interests of full and frank discussion, which can
be maintained only if there is no risk of publicity for every statement made and
every point conceded.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. To keep the
amount of work coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a great
deal of the work of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system,
which involves the reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet com¬
mittee or to an ad hoc committee composed of the ministers primarily con¬
cerned. The committee then considers the matter in detail and either disposes
of it or reports upon it to the Cabinet with recommendations for action.
Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend its meetings when matters
affecting their departments are under discussion; they may also be members
of Cabinet committees.
The Secretary of the Cabinet and senior officials of the Cabinet Office attend
meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate. A record is kept of
the conclusions and of the main points made in discussion.
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which
ministers share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual
responsibility of ministers to Parliament for the work of their departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, means that the Cabinet is bound to offer
unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members do not hold
identical views on a given subject. Consequently it means that the policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. In principle, once the Government’s policy on a particular matter
has been decided, each minister is expected to support it, unless he chooses
to resign, as he is free to do if he cannot agree with his colleagues on a matter
of general policy or on a single major issue.
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of admini¬
stration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since
the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in
person. Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be
represented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually a Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsi¬
bility, although on important political matters they will usually wish to consult
their colleagues collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee. Any
decision by a departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way
of bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any
departmental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament dis¬
courages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
GOVERNMENT

Internal
Organisation
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to govern¬
ment policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They may,
and frequently do, work with and through local authorities, statutory boards,
and government-sponsored organisations operating under varying degrees of
government control.
A few departments have existed for over 200 years. Many more have come
into existence during the past half-century to match the widening scope of
government activity. The election of a party of a different political complexion
does not necessarily affect the number or general functions of government
departments, although a radical change in policy is usually accompanied by
some organisational change. In recent years, moreover, successive govern¬
ments have favoured the establishment of larger departments, created to be
responsible for related functions. For instance, the Department of the Environ¬
ment (established in 1970) comprises three previous ministries: Housing and
Local Government, Public Building and Works, and Transport.
The work of some departments, for instance, the Ministry of Defence,
covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments, for instance, the
Department of Employment, cover Great Britain (England and Wales, and
Scotland, but not Northern Ireland); others, such as the Department of Health
and Social Security, the Department of Education and Science and the Depart¬
ment of the Environment are mainly concerned with affairs in England, and
there are separate departments for Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is
also a separate department with responsibility for affairs in Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, the minister in charge of the day-to-day work of the Civil Service
Department is responsible for the Central Office of Information and the
Stationery Office, and Treasury ministers are responsible for the Board of
Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the Department for National
Savings and a number of small departments including the Treasury Solicitor’s
Department, the Department of the Government Actuary, the Royal Mint,
the National Debt Office and the Public Works Loan Board. Generally, depart¬
ments receive their funds directly out of moneys provided by Parliament and
are staffed by members of the Civil Service (see p. 60).
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging
its duties there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments, how¬
ever, have certain features in common: for instance, the minister of a major
department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent secretary,
sometimes assisted by one or more second permanent secretaries, and also one
or more deputy secretaries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and
assistant secretaries. Usually major departments also have a principal finance
officer and a principal establishments and organisation officer. A number of
establishment divisions have their own organisation and methods (‘O and M’)
branch, the members of which act in an advisory capacity. Many departments
also have their own legal advisers or solicitors, and their own information
divisions.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.

Advisory Bodies
BRITAIN 1973- AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or com¬
mittees (several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect informa¬
tion, mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before coming
to a’decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases there is a
statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee, but usually
advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister concerned be¬
cause he feels the need for their advice. .
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved. Some are expert committees; others inclu e
civil servants and representatives of varying interests and professions, for
instance, industrialists, trade unionists, university and industrial scientists,
educationists, lawyers and local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recommenda¬
tions on specific matters. For certain important enquiries Royal Commissions,
whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide experience and
diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by Royal Warrant). Royal Commissions
examine written and oral evidence from government departments and other
interested organisations and individuals, and on this evidence submit recom¬
mendations. The Government may accept the recommendations m whole or
in part, or it may decide to take no further action or to delay action. Enquiries
may also be undertaken by departmental committees, appointed by the head
of the appropriate department.

relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet
Office
Central
Statistical Office
The Cabinet Office is in essence a secretariat, headed by the Secretary of the
Cabinet, serving ministers collectively. It operates under the direction of the
Prime Minister as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy at the highest
level. Its functions include circulating the memoranda and other documents
required for Cabinet or Cabinet committee business, preparing the agenda for
meetings of the Cabinet and its committees, recording their discussions and
circulating the minutes, keeping in touch with the progress of action on deci¬
sions and safeguarding the security of documents. _ , ,
The Cabinet Office also includes a Central Policy Review Staff which works
under the supervision of the Prime Minister, with and through departments,
to assist Cabinet Ministers collectively by providing them with an assessment
of government policies and programmes as a whole. An historical section is
responsible for the preparation of Official Histories of the War.
The Central Statistical Office, which is part of the Cabinet Office, has a co¬
ordinating role in the statistic-producing activities of all government depart¬
ments. Its responsibilities include the collection from departments of statistics
relating to the national economy, their analysis and their preparation as an
agreed body of statistics to assist the Government in formulating its economic
and financial policy.

The Civil Service Department is under the control of the Prime Minister as
Minister for the Civil Service, with responsibility for the day-to-day work
of the department delegated to a senior minister assisted by a Parliamentary
Secretary. The department’s Permanent Secretary is also the official head of the
Home Civil Service.
The department is responsible for personnel management in the Civil Ser¬
vice, which includes policy and central arrangements for recruitment, training
(including the Civil Service College), promotion, general career management,
welfare and retirement. It is also responsible for the size and deployment of
manpower, pay, pensions, and conditions of service in the Civil Service, and
with the co-ordination of pay and pension policies in the public sector as a
whole. The department’s further responsibilities include the development and
application of new systems and techniques in the field of management and
administration; the provision of a central management services consultancy
for the Civil Service as a whole to deal with organisation and methods and
operational research; central planning and co-ordination of data processing
in government; project appraisal; and the promotion of technical developments
of significance to other government departments.
The Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for the recruitment of
permanent civil servants and for assigning candidates to the various depart¬
ments, forms part of the Civil Service Department, but specific and formal
arrangements have been made to ensure its independence and impartiality in
the performance of its task.
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of all
Government Bills, except those Bills or provisions of Bills exclusively affecting
Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Department. The Office
drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and amendments moved by
the Government during the passage of Bills; it advises departments on ques¬
tions of parliamentary procedure; and attends sittings (and committees) in
both Houses. It also drafts subordinate legislation when specially instructed,
and advises the Government on legal, parliamentary and constitutional ques¬
tions falling within its special experience.
Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the
Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners never
meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Financial
Secretary and a Minister of State. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary to
the Treasury, who is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
The Treasury is the government department primarily responsible for the
development of Britain’s overall economic strategy. Its work is carried by three
main groups: the Public Sector Group which has the broad function of con¬
trolling the level of public expenditure and ensuring that resources are effi¬
ciently used within the public sector; the Finance Group which is responsible
for all questions affecting home and overseas finance and monetary policy;
and the National Economy Group which is responsible for the preparation of
short-term and medium-term economic forecasts and the co-ordinated eco¬
nomic strategy based on these forecasts; and for the surveillance of certain
areas of economic policy administered primarily by other departments—
namely, fiscal and industrial policies.

The Ministry of
Agriculture,
Fisheries and
Food
BRITAIN 1973* AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible in England
and Wales for administering government policy for the agriculture, horticul¬
ture and fishing industries. It is also responsible for measures to harmonise
this policy with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European
Economic Community. Its functions include the administration of agricultural
support and levy arrangements. The ministry also administers schemes such as
those designed for the control and eradication of animal and plant diseases and
for the improvement and drainage of agricultural land; and it exercises responsi¬
bilities relating to applied research and development. In addition the ministry
is concerned with the quality of food and food hygiene, including the standards
of its composition, and labelling and advertising; and it has certain reponsi-
bilities for ensuring public health standards in the production and handling of
basic foods in cargoes, stores and slaughterhouses.
A number of the functions relating to agriculture and fisheries in Wales and
Monmouthshire are the joint responsibility of the minister and the Secretary
of State for Wales. In regard to the operational control of certain diseases of
animals the ministry’s responsibilities extend to Scotland.
The ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries and participates in certain of the activities of a number of inter¬
national organisations concerned with agriculture, fisheries and food, such as
the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, and the Organisa¬
tion for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Board of The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and
Customs and administer the customs and excise duties imposed from time to time m the
Excise annual Finance Acts or by other legislation, and to advise the Chancellor ot
the Exchequer on any matters connected with them. The board is also respon¬
sible for preventing and detecting evasion of the revenue laws.
The board undertakes, for other departments, a wide range of non-revenue
agency work, for instance, the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions on
the importation and exportation of certain classes of goods, exchange currency
control, and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade statistics from
customs import and export documents.
The Ministry of The Ministry of Defence is the government department responsible for defence
Defence policy and for the control and administration of the three fighting Services—
Navy, Army and Air Force. The Secretary of State for Defence is in charge of
the department, assisted by a Minister of State for Defence who represents the
Secretary of State in the House of Commons and deputises for him on all
occasions in his absence. There is also a Minister of State for Defence Procure¬
ment responsible, under the Secretary of State, for the activities of the
Defence Procurement Organisation and for matters in the field of Services
operational requirements. Three Parliamentary Under-Secretaries are severally
responsible for each of the three Services.
The Department The Department of Education and Science promotes education in England and
of Education post-school education in Wales; it is responsible for the Government s rela-
and Science tions with the universities in England, Wales and Scotland; and it fosters t e
progress of civil science both in Britain and in collaboration with other nations.
The work of the department is organised in branches severally concerned with
publicly maintained schools, direct grant schools, and independent schools in
England; further education (including vocational, recreational and adult
education and the youth services), teachers and kindred subjects in England

throughout Great Britain. The department also has responsibilities relating to
national library policy and to the administration of the Victoria and Albert
Museum and the Science Museum. Specialist branches advise on health,
building and planning (including educational research and statistics), and law,
and there is an information service. The Secretary of State for Education and
Science is assisted by two Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State. Depart¬
mental responsibility for the Government’s arts policy is the concern of the
Paymaster General in his capacity of ‘Minister for the Arts’.

and other education include dealing with the supply, training and superannua¬
tion of teachers, the building of new schools and other institutions, the school
health service, and the special educational treatment of handicapped children.
In these matters the department works in co-operation with local education
authorities whose duty it is to secure adequate facilities for all forms of educa¬
tion in their areas. Its relations with the universities are conducted through the
University Grants Committee. Its activities concerning civil science are dis¬
charged through five research councils: the Medical Research Council, the
Agricultural Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council,
the Social Science Research Council, and the Science Research Council. On
questions of scientific policy the Council for Scientific Policy advises the
Secretary of State.
The Department of Employment is generally responsible for the efficient use
of Britain’s manpower. Its functions include identifying industries and regions
where manpower is, or is likely to become, under-employed and areas where
there are persistent shortages, and co-operating with other government depart¬
ments on general employment policy, including the distribution of industry
and the future supply of, and demand for, scientific and technical manpower.
The department has a national employment service which assists people seek¬
ing jobs and employers seeking staff.
The department is also active in the promotion of good industrial relations
and has long-standing powers relating to conciliation, arbitration and investi¬
gation in industrial disputes. Its other functions relate to the development of
industrial training, the employment aspects of race relations policy, wages and
terms and conditions of employment, the move towards equal pay for women,
redundancy payments, safety, health and welfare in industry, and the presenta¬
tion overseas of government policy on labour matters. The department in
addition undertakes agency work for other government departments in con¬
nection with the payment of unemployment and other social security benefits,
and the repayment of income tax to unemployed workers, and certain work on
the issue of passports.
The Department of the Environment, under a Secretary of State, is responsible
(in England) for a wide range of functions relating to the physical environment
in which people live and work. The Secretary of State for the Environment is
assisted by three ministers.
1. The Minister for Housing and Construction is responsible for housing
programmes and finance; building regulations; new towns; relations with
the building and civil engineering industries; government accommodation
and supplies at home and overseas; building for the armed forces, the Post

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, under the Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, provides, mainly through diplomatic
missions, the means of communication between the British Government and
other governments and international governmental organisations for the dis¬
cussion and negotiation of all matters, including economic issues, falling within
the field of international relations. In particular the department is responsible
for alerting the British Government to the implications of developments over¬
seas ; for protecting British interests overseas, including commercial interests;
for protecting British citizens abroad; and for explaining British policies to,
and wherever possible cultivating friendly relations with, governments and
peoples overseas. The department is also responsible for the discharge of
British responsibilities in the associated states (mainly for defence and externa
affairs) and dependent territories. In the dependent territories, each of which
has its own internal administration, the British Government is finally respons¬
ible for good government and for the relations between these territories and
other countries.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary is also responsible for the Overseas
Development Administration (ODA), which manages the British Govern¬

United Kingdom on the World Health Organisation.
Through its Supplementary Benefits Commission the department is respon¬
sible for determining awards of non-contributory benefits and Family Income
Supplements, for reception centres, for certain refunds of the selective employ¬
ment tax,1 and for assessing the means of people applying for legal aid. The
department also has responsibilities in connection with pensions and welfare
services (including in some cases the provision of medical and surgical treat¬
ment) for war pensioners in the United Kingdom, the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man, and, through its various agencies, for United Kingdom war
pensioners living in other countries.
The head of the Home Office is the Secretary of State for the Home Depart¬
ment (the Home Secretary), who is entrusted with all the responsibilities of
national administration which have not been specially assigned by law or
convention to another minister. The Home Secretary is the channel of com¬
munication between the Sovereign and her subjects, and between the United
Kingdom Government and the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.
The chief matters with which the Home Office is concerned are: the main¬
tenance of law and order; the police service; the prison service; the treatment
of offenders, including juvenile offenders; the probation and after-care service;
the organisation of magistrates’ courts; the introduction of legislation on
criminal justice; the criminal injuries compensation scheme; the fire service;

and submitting addresses and petitions to the Sovereign and preparing pre¬
sentations to Parliament; preparing patents of nobility for peers and formal
proceedings for the bestowal of honours; advising the Crown on the exercise
of the prerogative of mercy; making and receiving requests for the extradition
of criminals; sanctioning by-laws made by local authorities in so far as they
relate to ‘law and order’ and ‘good governance’; granting licences for scientific

produces information and publicity material, and supplies publicity services
required by other government departments which are responsible for the
policy expressed in its work. In the United Kingdom, it conducts government
press, television and poster advertising, produces booklets, leaflets, films,
television material, exhibitions, photographs and other visual material, and
distributes departmental press notices. For the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office it supplies British information posts overseas with press, radio and

It provides exhibition services (except for trade and cultural exhibitions); and
it organises tours (other than those sponsored by the British Council—see p.
406) for visitors officially invited to Britain. There are nine regional informa¬
tion offices in England, which provide services for the home departments and
assist the overseas services by the provision of material and by arranging tours
for overseas visitors; similar services are supplied on an agency basis by the
information staffs of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices.
The Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax
and surtax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, estate duty and
certain other direct taxes, and advises the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any
matters connected with them. It is also responsible for the valuation of real
property for such purposes as compensation for compulsory purchase, local
rates in England and Wales, and estate duty; and it collects tithe redemption
annuities.
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales (and, temporarily,
Northern Ireland)—the Attorney General and the Solicitor General—appear
on behalf of the Crown in important civil and criminal proceedings and in
proceedings before international tribunals such as the international court at
the Hague and the European Commission and Court of Human Rights at
Strasbourg. The Attorney General is the senior legal adviser to the Govern¬
ment. He has the ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal
law and his consent is necessary before proceedings for a number of criminal
offences can be commenced; the Director of Public Prosecutions is subject to
his superintendence. Legal proceedings for the enforcement of public rights
and on behalf of the interests of charity are conducted in his name and the
functions of the Queen’s Proctor, who has certain duties connected with the
operation of the divorce laws, are exercised under his direction. The Attorney
General is also spokesman for the Lord Chancellor in the House of Commons
on matters affecting the administration of justice since the Lord Chancellor’s
Department has no minister in that House. The Solicitor General is subject
to the authority of the Attorney General, with the same rights and duties.
The Law Officers, who are appointed from among the leading members of the
English Bar and are always members of the House of Commons, are assisted
by a small professional staff.
The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office held by an
eminent ex-member of the Bench or of the Bar and carrying Cabinet rank.
In addition to his functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian
of the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor is the minister primarily responsible
for the administration of the courts and of the law. The Home Secretary has
important responsibilities in respect of the criminal law (see p. 91) but the
Lord Chancellor appoints the justices of the peace and recommends to the
Crown most other appointments to the judiciary in England and Wales. His
responsibility for the courts and for their administrative staff is exercised
through six regional (or circuit) offices and their sub-offices.
The Lord Chancellor is further responsible for the reform of the law, for
appointing the members of the Law Commission, and for presenting the
reports of the Commission to Parliament. He is also concerned with court
procedure (see p. 91).

Britain. This includes geodetic surveys and associated scientific work, topo¬
graphic surveys and the production of maps at appropriate scales from these
surveys. The department also undertakes a considerable amount of agency
work for other departments, particularly the Ministry of Defence, and for the
Institute of Geological Sciences and the Land Registry.
The Paymaster General’s Office acts generally as a banker for government
departments other than the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and
Excise, for which separate arrangements exist. Money granted by Parliament
is transferred (in such sums as may be required from day to day) from the
Exchequer account to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of
England. Most departmental payments are made by means of payable orders
drawn on the Paymaster General’s Office; their recipients obtain payments
through the commercial banks, whose accounts at the Bank of England are in
turn reimbursed by the Paymaster General’s Office.
The department is also responsible for the regular payment of many public
service pensions.
The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, whose director is also the
Registrar General for England and Wales, is concerned with the regulation of
civil marriages, the registration of births, marriages and deaths in England and
Wales, and control of the registration services. Its work also includes the pre¬
paration and publication of reports on vital medical and demographic statistics,
taking the periodical census of the population, and, through the social survey
division, conducting research into the attitudes and circumstances of indivi¬
duals through direct contact with sample members of the general public or of
particular groups.
The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications is responsible to Parliament
for the Post Office. He also has responsibilities for broad questions of national
broadcasting policy and may issue directions to the British Broadcasting Cor¬
poration and to the Independent Broadcasting Authority on technical and
other matters.
1 The Judge Advocate General’s Department advises the Secretary of State for Defence
and the Defence Council on legal matters arising out of the administration of military
law, and reviews the proceedings of army and air force courts martial (see p. 91).
2 The Official Solicitor is concerned with the interests of minors and people with a
mental disability involved in proceedings in the High Court, who would otherwise not
be represented. In addition he protects the interests of people committed to prison for
contempt of court, acts as Receiver for people with a mental disability, and can be
appointed as Judicial Trustee in complex and disputed trusts.

by the Treasury Solicitor, who reports annually on its work to the Statute
Law Committee (a body appointed by the Lord Chancellor from among the
judiciary and legal profession in England and Scotland).
Some government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; others have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often,
for litigation and conveyancing; others, whose administrative work is based
on or deals with a code of specialised law or involves a great deal of legal work,
have their own independent legal sections.
The Treasury Solicitor is also the Queen’s Proctor.

private printers under contract. It operates six binding works, two of which are
involved in the repair of manuscripts from national archives. Official publica¬
tions are sold by Stationery Office bookshops in London, Edinburgh, Man¬
chester, Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff and Birmingham, and through agents in Britain
and overseas. The Stationery Office is also the United Kingdom agent for
Canadian government publications, and for those of the principal international
and European inter-governmental organisations. The Controller is Queen’s
Printer of Acts of Parliament, and the copyright of all British Government
documents is vested in him.
The Department of Trade and Industry, under a Secretary of State (who also
holds the historic office of the President of the Board of Trade), is responsible
for helping British industry and commerce to improve their economic and
technological strength and competitiveness by establishing a general frame¬
work of requirements, incentives and restraints within which firms can operate
to their own individual advantage. The department’s operations, for which the
Secretary of State is finally responsible, are carried out in four functional
wings, each under a minister, assisted by a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of

social deprivation, and (with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food)
for agriculture in Wales. He has, in addition, a general oversight of government
policy in Wales, and certain responsibilities relating to the national library
and the national museum. The Welsh Office maintains close and continuous
working relationships with the government departments mainly concerned
with economic and social planning through the Welsh Planning Board and
Welsh Council.
The Welsh Office is centred in Cardiff; there is also a small ministerial office
in London.
The Secretary of State is responsible in Scotland for a wide range of functions
which in England and Wales are divided among a number of departmental
ministers. He also works closely with ministers in charge of Great Britain
departments on topics of special significance to Scotland within their respon¬
sibility. He is assisted at ministerial level by a Minister of State and three
Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State. There are also two Scottish Law
Officers.
The Secretary of State’s statutory functions are discharged by four main
departments of the Scottish Office (the Department of Agriculture and Fisher¬
ies for Scotland, the Scottish Development Department, the Scottish Educa¬
tion Department, and the Scottish Home and Health Department). He is
advised and assisted (particularly on questions with which more than one of
the departments are concerned or which fall outside the province of any of
them) by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State. The day-to-day administra¬
tion of the departments is conducted in Edinburgh, but there are representa¬
tives in London for liaison and parliamentary duties.

development of the various regions of Scotland (for which he has a general co¬
ordinating responsibility) the Secretary of State consults regularly with the
Scottish Economic Council. He is also assisted by the Regional Development

270,000 of whom are engaged in the provision of public services—paying
sickness benefits and pensions, collecting taxes and contributions, running
employment services, staffing prisons, and providing services to industry and
agriculture. A similar number is employed in the Ministry of Defence,
including the Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Dockyards. The remainder
is about equally divided between: central administrative and policy duties;
service-wide support services, such as accommodation, printing, and informa¬
tion; and services which are largely self-supporting financially, for instance
those provided by the Department for National Savings and the Royal Mint.
Stability of administration is ensured by the political neutrality of the Service.
Although a civil servant works under the authority and direction of the minister
of the department to which he is appointed, legally he is a servant of the Crown.
A change of minister, whether due to ministerial changes within a government
or the advent of a government of a different political complexion, does not
involve a change of permanent staff.
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years.
Before then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying
standards were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political
jobbery was rife. Nineteenth century reforms included the substitution of open
competition for the practice of obtaining Civil Service appointments by favour
or purchase, and the establishment of an independent body, the Civil Service
Commission, to control recruitment. The great expansion in State activity in
the first half of the twentieth century, and the consequent increase in the
numbers of civil servants and the scope of their duties, led to further re¬
organisation, including the creation of service-wide scientific and professional
classes; recruitment was adapted to a developing educational system, and
co-ordination between the various departments improved. Civil servants,
though they remained employees of their departments, became members of an
integrated service with common conditions of employment and traditions and
standards of conduct belonging, not to individual departments, but to the
Civil Service as a whole.
More recently the structure and organisation of the Civil Service has again
been under detailed internal scrutiny (as a result of the report of the Fulton
committee1) and is engaged upon a programme of reconstruction and simplifi¬
cation, designed to make it more effective in carrying out its changing tasks.
The structure of the Civil Service, which until recently tended to reflect the
assumption that specific types of work should be allocated to particular groups
of civil servants on the basis of their specialist or vocational qualifications, is at
present being redesigned to provide for a more flexible deployment of staff so
that talent can be used to the best advantage and the highest levels of the Civil
Service will be seen to be open to people of outstanding ability, whatever their
specialist background or original methods of entry to the Service. These
structural changes involve the abolition of classes, and are being allied with
personnel management policies designed to ensure that, although work
requiring specialist skill is always done by appropriately qualified individuals,
people with the necessary aptitudes are given suitably wide experience to fit
them for higher posts.
1 The committee appointed by the Government in 1966 under the chairmanship of
Lord Fulton, then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sussex, to examine the struc¬
ture, recruitment and management, including management training, of the Civil Service
which published its report on the Civil Service in June 1968.
62 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
At the top levels of the Civil Service, where staff are predominantly con¬
cerned with higher management and policy, there is now an open and unified
structure, with three grades—permanent secretary, deputy secretary and
under secretary—available for all types of post. Posts at these levels are filled
by the people most suitable for them without regard to their academic back¬
ground or to whether they were previously in a specialist or generalist stream.
At other levels it is proposed that the structure should be based on a system
of categories and occupational groups. Occupational groups cater for groups of
staff whose members have common personnel management and recruitment
needs. Categories are pay and grading structures, each containing occupational
groups. Three new categories have so far been created, and the groups of
staff that are so far members of them are shown below.

The Administration Group contains some 200,000 staff. Their functions range
from the co-ordination and improvement of government machinery and the
formulation of advice to ministers on matters of policy to the performance of
normal clerical duties connected with the running of departmental business at
lower levels.
The Economist Group contains about 200 staff. They provide economic
advice and undertake economic analysis.
The Statistician Group (some 300 staff) undertakes the collection and
analysis of statistics required for government policies.
The Information Officer Group (some 1,350 staff) carries out a variety of
specialised press, publicity, public relations and information work.
This contains the Science Group (17,000 staff), which is responsible for
conducting scientific research and testing in numerous government laboratories
and testing establishments, and for providing advice on scientific policy. Its
members also participate in the planning and management of advanced
technology procurement projects.
This contains some 4,000 staff and includes a range of professionals—
architects, surveyors, quantity surveyors, and electrical and mechanical
engineers, and appropriate supporting staff—whose main function is to plan
and oversee a wide range of government construction and procurement
activities, and to carry out certain inspection and regulatory activities.
The three categories already established account for over half the staff in the
non-industrial Civil Service, and it is proposed that the remainder should in
due course be re-structured by assimilation to either one or the other of these
categories or by incorporation into additional categories to be set up for the
purpose. Such staff include those in a number of ‘general service’ classes (that
is to say, classes whose members serve in a number of departments) for
instance the medical class (doctors advising on the planning and management
of the National Health Service, running the prison medical service and under¬
taking duties of a similar nature), and the legal class (whose members provide
legal advice and services for all government departments).
There is also a large number of staff in ‘departmental’ classes, whose work is
special to one particular department, for instance the Inland Revenue Tax
classes, the Home Office Immigration Service, and the Customs and Excise
Waterguard and Outdoor Services.
The Civil Service employs about 25,000 shorthand typists, audio typists, and
copy typists, who work mainly in small groups, and about 3,500 personal
secretaries who work mainly to senior civil servants.

There are about 15,000 other support staff, including paperkeepers, office
cleaners and messengers. (As far as practicable, posts of messengers are
reserved for ex-servicemen, although other men and women over the age of
30 may be recruited.)
The Diplomatic Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown,
which provides the staff (comprising some 6,400 civil servants) for service in
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom diplomatic
missions and consular posts in foreign and in independent Commonwealth
countries. Its functions include advising on policy, negotiating with overseas
governments and conducting business in international organisations; promot¬
ing British exports and the advancement of British trade; presenting British
ideas, policies and objectives to the people of overseas countries; and protecting
British interests abroad.
The Service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with
that of the Home Civil Service; it also has Secretarial, Communications and
Security Guard branches. Various specialists and advisers from home depart¬
ments or the armed forces may serve at overseas posts on secondment or
attachment to the Diplomatic Service.
Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which deals with matters trans¬
ferred to its jurisdiction under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Subject
to regional differences, the Northern Ireland Civil Service is modelled on its
counterpart in Great Britain, recruitment being effected through its own Civil
Service Commission. Interchange of staff between the two Civil Services
occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for departmental agreement in
individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but when
vacancies cannot be filled by this means, the Overseas Development Ad¬
ministration (see p. 52) and the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and
Administrations are asked to recruit other candidates, principally from the
United Kingdom.
Recruitment to the permanent Civil Service is effected principally through
open competition, in which all eligible candidates (both within and outside
the Civil Service) are considered on equal terms. There are also limited
competitions designed to afford special opportunities of permanent appoint¬
ment or promotion for particular categories of staff already employed in the
Civil Service.
There are three main levels of entry into the administration group of the
Home Civil Service, related to the academic achievements of: honours
graduates; 18-year-old school leavers; and 16-year-old school leavers. Selec¬
tion is by interview and/or qualifying examination. Entry to the professional
and technical grades usually requires appropriate qualifications in the subject
concerned, and selection is by record and interview. The Civil Service
Commission is responsible for conducting the examinations and interviews,
and for issuing to departments certificates to the effect that candidates are
qualified for permanent posts. The appointment of the candidate after
certification is carried out by the department in which he is to be employed.
Recruitment to clerical and certain other junior posts may be undertaken
by the departments themselves, with the Civil Service Commission acting in

an advisory capacity and issuing the certificates necessary for permanent
appointment. Temporary civil servants are also normally recruited by the
department concerned; no special qualifying examinations are required.
In all except the smallest government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors whose task it is to help identify the training needs of the
staff and to organise courses, both general and technical, to provide for their
varying requirements. The number of management courses run within the
Civil Service, including those provided at the Civil Service College, has
increased substantially during recent years. Some use is also made of external
management courses of business schools, the Administrative Staff College,
Henley, and other centres.
Methods of training within the Civil Service combine lectures, discussion
groups, instructional visits and case-studies with the use of many audio-visual
aids such as closed-circuit television and video-tape recordings, instructional
films and programmed learning: there is also a considerable amount of ‘on-the-
job’ training. Civil servants are regularly moved between the different branches
of their department and sometimes between departments so that they can gain
as wide an experience as possible of Civil Service work.
In order that they may continue their education, arrangements are made for
the release of civil servants under the age of 18 usually on one day a week (‘day
release’ schemes) to attend appropriate courses. Adult staff are assisted
financially to undertake, mainly in their own time, private studies leading to
recognised educational or professional qualifications in approved subjects.
There are also opportunities for civil servants in mid-career to obtain fellow¬
ships or otherwise to go on sabbatical leave to undertake research in areas of
interest to themselves or their departments.
Training is co-ordinated by the Management Personnel Training Division
of the Civil Service Department which is responsible, in conjunction with the
Civil Service College, for the analysis and determination of training needs to be
met centrally in the Civil Service, and which exercises advisory functions in
regard to departmental training. All central training is provided by the Civil
Service College which offers a wide range of courses and seminars (some of a
broad developmental nature and others more specialised) for civil servants,
including those in specialist groups, at various levels up to that of Under
Secretary. Subjects covered include structure and machinery of government,
organisation and staff management, economics, statistics, industrial growth,
social administration, operational research, computers and information systems.
The College also provides courses on European institutions and their
working, and is developing training and links with other European countries.
A period of probation (varying according to grade, with extensions in certain
instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent Civil Service.
Promotions are made partly through centrally conducted examinations and
partly by the departments themselves. Promotions or appointments to most
of the highest positions in the Service, for instance, permanent secretaries,
principal establishment officers and principal finance officers, are approved by
the Prime Minister, who is advised in these matters by the head of the Home
Civil Service.
The consideration governing all promotion is the advancement of the
efficiency of the public service—the criterion being the fitness of an officer for a
more senior, responsible post. Normally promotion is from grade to grade, but
a procedure of accelerated promotion has been worked out for administration

trainees and officers who have shown exceptional promise but are outside the
age and salary limit for this grade.
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service
as a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed
jointly of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate
sections of the service is provided through the various staff associations which
civil servants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil and Public
Services Association, the Society of Civil Servants and the Institution of
Professional Civil Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils.
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a fair
comparison with that paid for similar work outside the service and usually he
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to
which he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the
pleasure of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice
he enjoys a considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every civil
servant, who is capable and efficient, may reasonably expect a full career in
the public service and is legally entitled to redundancy payments and pension
benefits.
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each week.
Certain grades are eligible for overtime pay for any hours worked in excess of
the standard hours, but this does not apply to the higher grades whose salaries
are determined on the assumption that they will work such long hours as may
be necessary without additional pay. The standard working week for office
staffs is 41 hours in London and 42 hours in the provinces. Annual leave varies
according to grade and length of service up to a maximum of six weeks, that is,
30 working days a year.
Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance benefit received, may be
granted to civil servants for up to six months in any 12 months, and on
reduced pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any four years; any
officer whose health is permanently impaired may be retired on medical
grounds.
The position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government of the day
irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which he is free, as a
private individual, to participate in political activities varies according to grade.
For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who are
completely free to engage in all kinds of national and local political activities
(although if they intend standing for Parliament, they must resign their
appointment before nomination day on the understanding that if not elected
they will be reinstated in their previous capacity within a week of the declara¬
tion of the election result); those who are free, subject to the acceptance of the
need for discretion and with the permission of the department, to take part in
most activities except parliamentary candidature; and those who are debarred
from national political activities though they may seek permission to take part
in local government political activities. In the non-industrial Civil Service, the
completely free groups are members of the minor classes such as cleaners and
messengers. The intermediate group includes mainly members of the clerical
and typing grades and the granting of permission by the department depends,
broadly, on the nature of the work done. The remainder are not allowed to
take part in national political activities. Departments are encouraged to permit
members of all groups to engage in local political activities to the maximum

extent consistent with the reputation of the Civil Service for political im¬
partiality and the avoidance of any conflict with official duties. Where per¬
mission is granted, it is subject to a code of discretion and to the obligation to
notify the department of election or co-option to a local council.
All civil servants enjoy the right to register their private political opinions
on appropriate occasions, for instance, at general or local authority elections.
They may also engage in such private activities as they wish, provided that
these do not in any way conflict with their official duties, nor with the pro¬
visions of the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1920, and the Prevention of
Corruption Act 1906. However, since a civil servant must not use his official
position to further his private interests, he is subject to certain restrictions in
commerce and business: for instance, he may not hold private interests in
public contracts and he may not use official information in writing, broad¬
casting or lecturing without the approval of his department.
The political views of civil servants are not as a general rule a matter of official
concern, but there are some civil service duties in which secrecy is so vitally
important to State security that the Government does not feel itself justified
in employing anyone to carry them out whose reliability is in doubt. For this
reason no one who is known to be a member of, or actively associated or in
sympathy with, the Communist Party or with Fascist organisations, or is liable
to be a security risk in any other respect, is employed in connection with secret
work.
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security,
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a director-
general who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals with
national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the leader of the
Opposition, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public
service and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security
arrangements is necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of the
United Kingdom for many centuries. In its present shape much of it dates back
to the late nineteenth century when the conception of a comprehensive system
of locally elected councils to manage various services provided for the benefit
of the community was first incorporated in statute law. Since that time there
has been a large increase in the population, and a massive transformation in the
range, complexity and scale of local authority functions. Because of this, local
government in Greater London was reorganised in the 1960s and changes in
the structure and functions of local government in Northern Ireland are due to
be introduced in April 1973. In England and Wales a new local government
structure will replace the existing one on 1st April 1974, while a similar
reorganisation in Scotland will take place the following year. (The reorganisa¬
tion proposals are summarised on page 74.)
Local government is conducted by elected local authorities, acting in accor¬
dance with powers and duties conferred on them by Parliament. The actual
administration and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits are the
responsibility of the local authority, but, in respect of certain services, Acts of
Parliament dealing with local government give ministers of the Crown defined

powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national uniformity
in the standard of service provided or to safeguard public health, while others
are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For some services
the minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for others there are
strictly limited powers. Government policy is to ensure that central govern¬
ment controls over local authorities are kept to a minimum.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local
government give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory
circulars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The Department of the Environment is the main link between local
authorities and the central Government in England; in Scotland the Scottish
Development Department is responsible for general policy in regard to local
government; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ireland, the
Ministry of Development.
The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
(outside the Greater London area) and Northern Ireland is at present a
division of the country into county boroughs and administrative counties.
The county boroughs (mostly with populations of over 75,000) are separate
from the counties and independent of them. The administrative counties are
subdivided into county districts—non-county boroughs, urban districts and
rural districts, the last-named being further divided into parishes1 (except in
Northern Ireland). Scotland is divided into counties, counties of cities, large
and small burghs, and districts. Each local authority area is administered by its
own elected council.
In England and Wales (outside the Greater London area) there are 58
county councils, 83 county borough councils, 259 non-county borough
councils, 522 urban district councils, 470 rural district councils, and over 10,000
parish councils or meetings; in Scotland, 33 county councils (two pairs being
combined for certain purposes), 201 town councils (including 4 for counties of
cities—Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen) and 198 district councils
(2 counties not being divided into districts); and in Northern Ireland, 1 county
borough council, 6 county councils, 9 non-county borough councils, 24 urban
district councils, 26 rural district councils, and 2 Development Commissions
exercising municipal functions.2
The Greater London area is administered by the councils of 32 London
boroughs and the City of London, and by the Greater London Council (GLC).
Local councils comprise a number of unpaid elected councillors (and, in some
cases, though not in Scotland, aldermen elected by the councillors), presided
over by a chairman who has varied ceremonial and civic duties to perform in
addition to his work on the council. In most boroughs of England and Wales
and Northern Ireland the chairman is the Mayor; in the City of London and
certain important boroughs, the Lord Mayor; in the Scottish counties, the
Convener; and in the burghs, the Provost or Lord Provost.
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local
government is three years; aldermen normally hold office for six years. In
some local authority areas the whole council retires every third year and
1 There are usually some 20 to 30 parishes in a rural district.

replaced by 26 new district authorities (see p. 74).

another is elected immediately; in other areas elections are held annually,
when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure at local government
elections in Great Britain is governed by rules laid down in the Representation
of the People Acts 1949 and 1969 or made for a specific type of authority;
in Northern Ireland it is governed by the Electoral Law Acts (Northern
Ireland) 1962-71 and the Electoral Law (Northern Ireland) Order 1972.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote
at a local government election in Great Britain provided that he or she is 18
years of age or over, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is
not subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government
elector for the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for regis¬
tration as a local government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register
(compiled annually), he or she is resident in the council area. In Northern
Ireland, a person must be 18 years of age or over and must have been born in
Northern Ireland or, alternatively, have resided continuously in the United
Kingdom for seven years immediately prior to the qualifying date.
A candidate for election as councillor normally stands as a representative
of one of the national political parties, as a member of an association repre¬
senting some local interest, or as an independent. He must be of British
nationality and aged 21 or over. In addition, he must be registered as a local
government elector in the area of the local authority to which he seeks election;
or have resided or occupied (as owner or tenant) land or other premises in that
area during the whole of the 12 months preceding the day on which he is
nominated as a candidate; or, in that 12 months, have had his principal or only
place of work there. A candidate is also subject to a number of statutory dis¬
qualifications designed to ensure that unsuitable persons do not offer them¬
selves for election.
Most local authority areas are divided into electoral areas for local council
elections. Administrative counties are divided into single-member electoral
divisions in accordance with orders made by the Secretary of State for the
Home Department, for the Environment, or for Scotland. Boroughs and urban
districts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and burghs in Scotland, are
either divided into ‘wards’, or, if they are small, left as single units. For rural
district council or parish council elections, each parish or ward of a parish (or,
in some cases, a combination of parishes) forms an electoral area which returns
one or more members. For the purpose of elections to the Greater London
Council, parliamentary constituencies form the electoral areas, with each
constituency returning one councillor.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer
concerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. The procedure for local government voting is similar to that for
parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are more restricted.
In Great Britain each elector has one vote for each seat contested in his electoral
area: he need not record all his votes, but must not give more than one vote
for each candidate. In Northern Ireland agreement has been reached to hold
the 1972 elections on the basis of proportional representation.
Functions and
Services
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer such
services as Acts of Parliament require. It may provide additional services
under the permissive powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by
local or Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon their type, as follows :
in England (outside the Greater London area) and Wales county borough
yo
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
councils are all-purpose authorities, while both county councils and county
district councils have particular functions allotted to them, which they
exercise independently to a considerable extent. County councils are generally
responsible for the police, fire, educational and personal social services, while
the district councils provide housing and administer most of the environmental
services. There is, however, a certain degree of delegation from county
councils to county district councils, especially of duties connected with town
and country planning and the education, health and personal social services.
Parish councils or parish meetings have a few functions of local interest which
they may exercise of right. In Scotland the councils of the counties of cities are
all-purpose authorities; elsewhere, the county councils, the town councils and
the district councils share responsibilities. In Northern Ireland the position
has been broadly similar to that in England and Wales, except that local
authorities have not been called on to provide or administer the police or
(except in Belfast) the fire services; as from 1st April 1973, however, local
authorities will cease to be responsible for many of the more important services
traditionally provided by local government.
In Greater London the basic units of local government are the London
boroughs; the GLC is responsible only for those services which, by their
nature, require unified administration and control over the whole area. In the
City of London (an area of approximately one square mile in the centre of the
metropolis) the City Corporation exercises the general powers administered,
and duties performed, by the London borough councils.
Local authority services may be classified under three heads: environ¬
mental, protective and personal. The environmental services are designed to
secure local good order, amenity and public health. The main service is town
and country planning while others include the services for bridge and highway
construction and maintenance, for street lighting, public safety on the roads,
and the provision of recreation grounds, parks and similar amenities. Other
environmental services are those concerned with drainage, sewerage, street
cleansing, refuse collection and disposal, litter prevention, rodent control, the
supervision of water supplies, measures for ensuring food hygiene and for
preventing air pollution, and the provision of public lavatories.
The protective services are the police, fire and civil defence services. In the
administration of the police and fire services neighbouring authorities fre¬
quently combine.
The personal services range from education, housing and the health and
social services to the provision of public entertainment. Education and culture
are promoted by the establishment and maintenance of various types of schools;
by the provision of adult education centres, and art and technical colleges;
by the award of grants and scholarships to students of all kinds; and by the
provision of libraries, art galleries and museums. Housing needs are met, as
far as possible, by building new houses (mainly to let), acquiring old houses
and converting them to provide additional accommodation, clearing slums,
and laying down the standards to be maintained in both newly built and older
houses.
Personal health and social services cover the provision of ante-natal, post¬
natal and child health clinics, and some residential and day nurseries; the
provision and supervision of midwifery services, health visitors and home
nursing facilities; measures for the prevention of illness and the aftercare of
physically or mentally sick persons; the ambulance service (except in Scot¬
land); the provision of facilities for vaccination and immunisation against
certain infectious diseases; the provision of domestic help where necessary;
GOVERNMENT 71
and the services for the permanently disabled or handicapped, for the aged and
infirm and for children deprived of a normal home life.1
Some local authorities engage in trading services, such as passenger trans¬
port, water supply, and harbour, dock and pier services; they also have power
to initiate schemes to attract industrial development.
The above is only a brief outline of local authority services. Fuller informa¬
tion is given under the relevant subject headings in later chapters.
Internal
Organisation
of Local
Authorities
Officers and
Employees
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own
internal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they
discharge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system,
whereby questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and
committees are appointed to administer the various services. Parish councils
and the smaller district councils are often able to do their work efficiently in
full session although they appoint committees from time to time as necessary.
In recent years many councils have rationalised their organisation by reducing
substantially the number of their committees. Some have established policy
advisory or co-ordinating committees with powers to originate policy, subject
to the approval of the full council.
The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be
advisory or executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council’s
standing orders. A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees,
except its powers in connection with raising loans, levying rates, or making
financial demands on other authorities liable to contribute, which are legally
reserved to the council as a whole. County and county borough councils
exercise their powers of delegation to a considerable extent.
Joint committees or joint boards consist of representatives of more than
one authority and may be established, outside the Greater London area, for
services that can be more effectively administered over a wider area than that
controlled by a single council, for instance, town and country planning, water
supplies and the police service.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of the council (and of
some committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered
if the council resolves that publicity for that matter would be prejudicial to the
public interest.
The execution of council policy rests with salaried officers and employees,
whose number may vary from about half a dozen in a small rural district to
tens of thousands in the larger authorities. Generally speaking, councils are
free to make such appointments as they think necessary for carrying out their
work, although certain posts, for instance, the clerk and treasurer are com¬
pulsory in almost all councils, and a borough or city architect must be appointed
in each London borough and in the City of London. In most other cases
choice of personnel is left to the individual council: in theory, the appointment
of certain chief officers is subject to some central control but, in practice, the
nominee of the council is nearly always accepted.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or
chief officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial
kind; subordinate officers employed in a professional, clerical or technical
capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical work for

National Health Service (see p. 135).

which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually made
at the instance of the committee or committees particularly concerned; most
junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are also respons¬
ible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engagements are always
made in conformity with the council’s set establishment and committees are
informed of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within
the jurisdiction of the employing council (except for the rare case where the
proposed salary of an officer requires the approval of a government depart¬
ment, as in the case of the clerk of a county council in England and Wales).
They are based on recommendations made by the Whitley Councils, of
which the largest are the National Joint Council for Local Authorities’
Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical Services and the National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Services (Manual Workers). Conditions
of service and salary scales for senior local government officers are determined
by separate joint committees for England and Wales, and for Scotland. The
local government service in Northern Ireland has its separate joint negotiating
machinery at various levels.
Local authority expenditure in Britain is now about -£8,000 million annually,
of which about a third is capital, the remainder current, expenditure. Capital
expenditure is normally financed by borrowing (see p. 73), although the
Government makes grants towards the capital costs of certain services,
principal roads and public lighting, and annual subsidies are payable for local
authority housing. Housing is the major element in capital expenditure,
representing two-fifths of the total.
Current expenditure by local authorities accounts for about a quarter of
total current-account spending by public authorities. The education service
represents by far the largest portion of this spending followed by roads, the
police service, the personal social services, and sewerage. Local authority
current expenditure is financed from three principal sources: government
grants (some 46 per cent); local rates, paid by occupiers of land and buildings
(34 per cent); and rents from municipal houses, dividends and interest (20
per cent).
Government grants are normally related directly to total local authority
spending and payable both in aid of revenues generally (when they are known
as rate support grants) and for specific services. In 1972-73 estimated rate
support grants in England and Wales amounted to £2,303 million, while grants
for specific services represent some £199 million. The grants for Scotland
were £283 million and £27 million respectively.
The rate support grants are distributed among authorities (in England and
Wales, the county, county borough, county district and London borough
councils; in Scotland, the county and town councils) in three parts: the needs
element composed of a basic payment which takes into account total heads of
population and, in particular, the number of children under 15 years of age,
together with supplementary payments which take into account such factors
as the number of children under five years old and of people over 65, the cost
of various stages of education, density of population and road mileage; the
‘resources’ element which is paid to authorities whose rateable resources are
below the average for all authorities in relation to population; and the domes¬
tic’ element which compensates rating authorities for loss of rate income from
reductions in rate poundage which they are required to give to householders
in England and Wales £o*io-£ in 1972-73, and in Scotland £0-12. Services
GOVERNMENT 73
qualifying for specific grants include the police service. Grants are also made
towards the cost of rate rebates for people with low incomes.
In Northern Ireland there is a system of grants towards the cost of specific
services, for instance, education, roads, health and welfare, water supplies and
sewerage, supplemented by a General Exchequer Contribution which com¬
pensates for derating and takes account of the needs and resources of individual
authorities. A grant is also paid to rating authorities to compensate them for
prescribed reductions in rate poundages, which they are required to give to
householders.
Rates are a local tax paid by the occupiers of non-agricultural land and
buildings as a contribution towards the cost of local services. Each occupier’s
payment is calculated annually by the rating authority by multiplying the
rateable value of his property (broadly equivalent to its annual rental value)
by the rate poundage—a percentage fixed by the authority according to its
projected financial needs. Rateable values are assessed periodically in England
and Wales by the Board of Inland Revenue, which is independent of local
authorities. New valuation lists are due to come into force in April 1973. Dis¬
putes about rating assessments are heard by local valuation courts, each con¬
sisting of three members of an independent local valuation panel and then, on
appeal, by the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales;
but it is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of counties and
counties of cities. Appeals are heard by the valuation appeal committee of each
valuation area and thereafter by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the
Court of Session. In Northern Ireland the valuation authority is the Com¬
missioner of Valuation, whose department is part of the Ministry of Finance.
In England and Wales the responsibility for levying and collecting the rates
lies with the councils of county boroughs and county districts, with the
London borough councils and with the Common Council of the City of
London. Rates in Scotland are levied by the town councils in burghs (including
counties of cities) and by the county councils elsewhere. County borough and
county of city authorities, which are responsible for all services in their areas,
determine the rates solely on the basis of their own financial needs; elsewhere,
where services are divided, the rating authorities take account in their rate
determination of the needs of the other, non-rating, authorities, to which part
of the proceeds are passed to cover services provided by them. In Northern
Ireland the only non-rating authorities are the rural district councils, which
derive their rate income from the county councils.
Agriculture throughout Britain is exempted from rate payments, and in
Scotland and Northern Ireland industry and freight transport are rated at a
half and a quarter, respectively, of their net annual value. Householders in
Great Britain benefit from rate reductions financed by government grant (see
p. 72) and they have the right to pay rates in ten instalments a year. House¬
holders with small incomes are entitled to rebates. Charities pay half the full
rate on property they occupy for charitable purposes but may be given further
reliefs by the rating authorities, which are empowered to reduce or remit the
rates for a wide range of non-profit-making bodies. Half rates may be levied
on all empty properties.
Loans may be raised by local authorities to finance capital expenditure either
under general powers conferred by national legislation or under special powers
provided by Acts of Parliament of local application. For items of expenditure
in key sectors (such as education, housing and roads) local authorities in
74

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
England and Wales must seek approval from the government department con¬
cerned before raising loans. For other capital expenditure, each authority (or
group of authorities in the case of county districts) receives an annual loan
authorisation within which it determines what sums to borrow and what
projects to undertake. The Greater London Council applies annually for
parliamentary sanction to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland the government department responsible for
the service also issues the appropriate loan approvals.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by issuing mortgages, by issuing
stock upon the Stock Exchange and by bonds which may or may not be quoted
on the Stock Exchange. Although these bonds may be for any period, local
authorities normally issue them for one year. Local authorities also have right
of access to the Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer, or, in
Northern Ireland, to the Government Loans Fund, for long-term borrowing
to finance a proportion of their reckonable capital payments, and may borrow
temporarily for a limited proportion of their current outstanding loan debt.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned
by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy of
the council under constant review. In England and Wales the accounts of
county councils, urban and rural district councils, and a variety of other local
authorities are wholly subject to audit by district auditors appointed by the
Secretary of State for the Environment. Certain accounts of county borough
and borough councils are statutorily subject to district audit, and these
authorities can opt to have the remainder of their accounts audited either by
district audit or by a firm of professional accountants. In Scotland the accounts of
each authority are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the Secretary
of State for Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in Northern Ireland
by local government auditors appointed by the Ministry of Development.
In Northern Ireland as from 1st April 1973 the local government functions
which are of a regional character are to be transferred to the Northern Ireland
departments. Of these, the planning, roads, water and sewerage services will
be administered by the Ministry of Development, while the education, personal
health and personal social services are to be the responsibility of area boards
operating on an agency basis for the ministries concerned. The housing res¬
ponsibilities of local authorities have already been transferred to a new regional
body, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, and the intention is that local
government functions not transferred to regional administration—including
environmental health services such as refuse collection and disposal, street
cleansing and litter prevention—shall be provided by 26 new district authori¬
ties, elections to which were due to be held in 1972.
In England and Wales the 1,400 existing authorities are to be replaced by
52 new county and some 375 new district authorities, while in Scotland the 43°
authorities are to give way to eight new regional and 47 new district authorities,
together with three virtually all-purpose authorities for the Orkney and Shet¬
land Islands and the Western Isles. The new county and regional authorities
(see map on page 67) will normally provide those services most suitably ad¬
ministered on a large scale, including major planning, most transportation
matters, education and the personal social services, while the independently
elected district authorities will provide the more local services such as housing,
refuse collection and the provision of amenities. The main exception to this
division of functions will be in six English conurbations (provisionally styled

education and the personal social services. Elections to the new authorities in
England and Wales are to take place during 1973, prior to their assumption of
full responsibility on 1st April 1974. In Scotland elections will take place during
1974 and the new authorities will take over from existing ones in 1975.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to
a measure of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England
and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The fire services in
Northern Ireland are controlled by two authorities, the Belfast Corporation
and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, which are responsible to the
Minister of Home Affairs. Every part of the United Kingdom is covered by a
public fire brigade.
It is the statutory duty of every fire authority to make provision for fire¬
fighting purposes, and in particular to maintain a brigade of sufficient strength
to meet efficiently all normal requirements. In England and Wales there are
132 local authority fire brigades administered by the county and county
borough councils (with some amalgamations) which are the fire authorities for
their areas. The Greater London Council is the fire authority for London.
In Scotland the local authorities are grouped in 11 areas each with a single
brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the town council of the city
is the responsible authority, each area is administered by a joint committee
representative of the councils of the counties and large burghs in the area.
There are also fire-fighting organisations outside the local authority service,
for instance, those maintained by the Army and Air Force Departments of the
Ministry of Defence; by the Department of Trade and Industry at certain of
their establishments; and by some large industrial and commercial concerns.
The Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Secretary of State
for Scotland have central responsibility for the fire service in England and
Wales and in Scotland respectively. Central control is directed mainly towards
ensuring that the operational efficiency of brigades is maintained. To this end
the Secretaries of State have powers, under the Fire Services Acts, to make
regulations on such matters as appointments and promotions, standards of
training and equipment, pensions, and disciplinary matters. Their approval is
also required for reductions in the operational establishments of fire brigades.
In matters affecting the fire brigades as a whole (excluding discipline and
conditions of service), each minister is advised by the appropriate Central Fire
Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of officers of the respective Home
Departments, representatives of the local authority associations, and of the
associations representing members of fire brigades, and other persons with
special qualifications, appointed by the Secretary of State. The National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades and the National Joint
Council for Chief Officers of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades are the nego¬
tiating bodies on ranks, pay and conditions of service of members of the
brigades in Great Britain.
Inspectorates of fire services advise the Secretaries of State on operational
and technical matters.
Each fire authority must draw up a scheme showing the establishment of
officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and
y6

location of fire stations and the number and type of appliances consideied
necessary for the provision of fire cover for its area. Establishment schemes vary
according to the fire risks in the area concerned, the strength of individual
brigades ranging from 7 whole-time and 93 part-time men (in Merioneth¬
shire) to 4,776 whole-time men (in Greater London). In the whole of England
and Wales there are about 24,500 whole-time and 14,000 part-time firemen,
operating more than 3,800 fire-fighting appliances (including pumps, turntable
ladders, water tenders, and emergency tenders and hose-laying lorries) housed
in some 1,590 fire stations. In Scotland there are approximately 2,848 whole¬
time and 2,911 part-time firemen, 439 fire-fighting appliances, and 268 fire
stations.
It is the duty of every fire authority to buy such appliances and equipment as
may be necessary to meet efficiently all normal fire-fighting requirements in
their area. Certain items of equipment are standardised so that there is complete
interchangeability when a fire is attended by men and appliances from more
than one brigade. The principal types of fire-fighting appliances are bought by
fire authorities to requirement specifications approved by the Home Secretary
and the Secretary of State for Scotland, on the advice of the respective Central
Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. These specifications ensure that minimum
standards are maintained and at the same time allow sufficient freedom of
design to meet special circumstances and encourage further developments.
Each fire authority must appoint a chief fire officer (firemaster in Scotland)
for its fire brigade. The appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary
or by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Central control is exercised by the chief fire officer from brigade head¬
quarters. Divisional officers, who are in charge of the geographical divisions
into which most areas are divided, are responsible for mobilising their forces
to deal with outbreaks of fire in their divisions. Constant communication is
maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters and if at any time an
outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division, help is sent
from one or more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of another
fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire authorities,
the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless of area
boundaries.
In England and Wales, the approximate number of fire calls in 1971
(including false alarms and special service calls—see below) was approximately
432,000. In Scotland the number was approximately 42,000.
Fire authorities have discretion to employ their brigades and equipment foi
purposes other than fire-fighting, and they are in fact used in a variety of
emergencies, such as rail, road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings,
flooding of premises, leakage of noxious gas or liquids and the rescue of people
or animals from dangerous situations, for which no charges are made. Brigades
are also used, by prior arrangement, for such purposes as emptying of swimming
pools and filling of water tanks.
Estimated property losses from fire in the United Kingdom in 1971 amounted
to about £1287 million.1  
1 This figure, which relates to direct losses only, includes malicious damage in Northern
Ireland and is, therefore, not strictly comparable with those for previous^ years, but
generally there has been a levelling off of normal fire damage in the United Kingdom
over the past three years.

Fire Prevention
Research
The large cities and urban areas in Great Britain are served in the main by
whole-time firemen but some 60 per cent of county fire brigade establishments
is composed of part-time retained firemen who, in return for a retaining fee
and call-out and attendance fee, undertake to attend fires if called upon, and
volunteer firemen, who receive no remuneration. Many fire authorities employ
women (about 900 in England and Wales and 140 in Scotland in 1971) on
communications and mobilising duties, and some brigades have schemes for
the employment of junior firemen between the ages of 16 and 18 years, with a
view to their being enrolled as regular firemen at the age of 18.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at collective training schools run by the
larger fire authorities. In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central
training school which is the responsibility of the Scottish Home and Health
Department. Management and command training is provided for the higher
and middle ranks at the Fire Service Staff College, Wotton House, near
Dorking, Surrey, where high-level operational studies are also conducted;
fire prevention, practical firemanship, advancement and instructor training,
for junior and middle ranks, is provided at the Fire Service Technical College,
Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. Both these establishments are main¬
tained by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department.
Facilities for properly accredited officers from overseas fire services to study
the organisation, current training methods, appliances and equipment of the
British fire brigades are arranged by the Home Office Fire Department.
The cost of maintaining the fire service is borne by local authorities, and is
grant-aided by the central Government through the rate support grant
(see p. 72).
Fire authorities are concerned with fire prevention under a wide range of
statutes, including the Factories Act 1961, the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act 1963 and the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (which provides for a
comprehensive system of fire prevention control in places of entertainment
and public resort and in certain kinds of residential premises). Fire authorities
are also under a statutory duty to give, when asked, advice on fire prevention,
restricting the spread of fires, and means of escape in case of fire. The enforce¬
ment and advisory duties involved are mainly carried out by the fire service
which, in 1971, made nearly 700,000 inspections for these purposes.
Courses in fire prevention are held continuously at the Fire Service Tech¬
nical College and all brigades have qualified fire prevention officers. Other
sources of advice on fire prevention include the various insurance companies
which advise their policyholders, and the Fire Protection Association, a non-
profit-making body established by the Fire Offices’ Committee1 as an advisory
centre on a nation-wide basis for industry and the general public on protection
of life and property against fire.
Research into the causes, development and prevention of fire is undertaken
by the Joint Fire Research Organisation under the general direction of a
steering committee, whose members are drawn from the Department of the
Environment, the Home Office, the Fire Offices’ Committee, the independent
insurance companies and industry. The annual cost of the organisation is over
£480,000, of which £125,000 is paid by the Fire Offices’ Committee, the

balance being met by the Government. The organisation operates from the
fire research station at Boreham Wood, Hertfordshire.
Within the Home Office, a research section has been created to study the
operational problems of fire brigades. This unit, as well as carrying out its own
research programme, supervises projects undertaken, under contract, by private
consultants.
In Northern Ireland the Belfast Corporation controls the Belfast Fire Brigade
and is responsible for the area inside the city boundary, and the Northern
Ireland Fire Authority covers the rest of the country outside Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains 5 whole-time stations and has an
establishment of 310 officers and men manning 20 appliances, while the
Northern Ireland Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry
and 47 other stations throughout the remainder of the area, and an establish¬
ment of 108 whole-time officers and men and 750 part-time firemen, manning
108 appliances.
The amount of fire service grant payable to the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority1 is 50 per cent of the loan charges in respect of capital expenditure
which do not exceed -£119,000 and 25 per cent of the amount (if any) by which
the loan charges exceed £119,000 together with 50 per cent of the first
£346,000 of other net expenditure and 25 per cent of the excess over that
amount. Expenditure in excess of the fire service grant is apportioned among
the local authorities liable to contribute to the funds of the authority. Under
the Fire Services Act, the Belfast Fire Brigade does not qualify for the payment
of fire service grant.
1 It is expected that, by the end of 1973, the fire services in Northern Ireland will be
amalgamated under one single authority—the Ulster Fire Authority wholly financed
from government funds.
3 LAW AND ORDER
THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, it does not have a single body
of law applicable universally within its limits. Scotland has its own distinctive
legal system and law courts, and although the existence of a single Parliament
for Great Britain since 1707, common opinions on broader issues, and a
common final court of appeal in civil cases have resulted in substantial
identity on many points, differences in legal procedure and practice remain. In
Northern Ireland on the other hand, legal procedure and practice have closely
resembled those of England and Wales for centuries but its enacted law
derives in certain spheres from a different source and may differ in substance
from that which operates in England and Wales. However, a large volume of
modern legislation, particularly in the social field, applies throughout the
United Kingdom.
A feature common to all the systems of law in the United Kingdom is that
there is no complete code.1 The sources of law in all the systems include
legislation and unwritten or ‘common’ law.2
Legislation includes some 3,000 Acts of Parliament and delegated or
subordinate legislation made by ministers and others under powers conferred
by Parliament, Acts of Parliament being absolutely binding on all courts of
the United Kingdom, and taking precedence over any other source of law. The
common law of England originated in the customs of the realm and was built
up by decisions of the courts. A supplementary system of law, known as
‘equity’, came into being during the Middle Ages to provide protection when
common law would not, for policy reasons, or could not, provide it. It was
administered by a separate court and later became a separate body of legal
rules. In 1875 t*16 courts of equity were fused with the courts of common law,
so that all courts now apply both systems but, where they conflict, equity pre¬
vails.
In Scotland the basis of common law, which largely depends on the canon
law of Rome, helped by continental commentators, is embodied in the
writings of certain seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth century
lawyers of great repute who, between them, described systematically almost
the whole field of private and criminal law as it existed in their times. Broadly
speaking, the principles enunciated by these lawyers, together with the many
judicial decisions which have followed and developed from those principles,
form the body of Scots non-statutory law. Scotland has never had a separate
system of equity—equitable principles having always permeated the ordinary
rules of law.
A feature common to the legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. Criminal law
1 The Law Commission (see p. 96) is working on the codification of certain branches of
law.
2 In the event of Britain entering into the European Communities on 1st January 1973,
there will be a further source of law, namely the directly applicable law of the European
Treaties and of the delegated legislation made under them by the community institu¬
tions. This law will be of a separate legal order, standing alongside both statute and
common law and, in the event of a conflict, will take precedence over them.

is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole; civil law is
concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
the community between themselves.
CRIMINAL LAW
IN ENGLAND
AND WALES
Criminal Courts
Magistrates’
Courts
The Crown
Court
There are two levels of criminal courts in England and Wales: magistrates’
courts, which try and dispose of the great majority of criminal cases and con¬
duct preliminary investigations into the more serious offences; and the Crown
Court which takes all criminal work above the level of magistrates’ courts.
Magistrates’ courts are for the most part presided over by lay justices of the
peace, of whom there are some 20,500, and who are part-time and unpaid. The
jurisdiction of the courts is local, their areas being the counties and most of the
large boroughs. Counties are divided into petty sessional divisions so that the
courts are held in different places, while a borough that has a separate com¬
mission of the peace forms a single division, with its own justices. The function
of the court, which consists of between two and seven justices, is to hear and
determine charges against people accused of summary offences—that is, those
offences that may legally be disposed of by the justices sitting together without
a jury. In addition, justices may also try certain offences which would normally
be tried on indictment, that is to say, the more serious offences, if the accused
consents to forgo his right to trial by jury—and, in fact, about 98 per cent of all
criminal cases are disposed of in magistrates’ courts. Magistrates also sit as
‘examining justices’ to conduct preliminary enquiries to determine whether
there is sufficient evidence to justify the committal of the accused for trial in a
higher court. ...
In inner London and a few large provincial cities there are, in addition to
justices, stipendiary magistrates (37 in London and 11 elsewhere), who are full¬
time salaried lawyers, and usually sit alone. In the City of London, the courts
consist of the aldermen of the City who are justices ex officio by virtue of
charters, in addition to the justices appointed individually. Benches of lay
magistrates work with the help and advice of the Clerk af the Court a barrister
or solicitor or other person with court experience.
To hear cases involving people under the age of 17 brought before the court
in care or criminal proceedings, and to deal with applications for the adoption
of children, magistrates’ courts sit as juvenile courts. Juvenile courts sit either
in a different room or building from other courts, or at a different time, and
only limited publicity is allowed. If a young person under the age of 17 is
charged jointly with someone who has attained the age of 17, the case is heard
in an adult magistrates’ court. If the young person is found guilty, the adult
court remits the case to a juvenile court, unless it wishes to dispose of the case
by discharge or fine.
The Crown Court, which has jurisdiction throughout England and Wales, is
served by High Court judges, Circuit judges and Recorders who sit on a part-
time basis. The Crown Court sits at nearly 90 centres which have been selected,
as far as practicable, to be within daily travelling distance of the whole
population.
There are three kinds of centre: first tier centres where the Crown Court
is served by both High Court and Circuit judges and where the High Court
also takes civil business; second tier centres where, again, High Court and
Circuit judges sit in the Crown Court; and third tier centres, where the Crown
Court is served only by Circuit judges and Recorders.
The jurisdiction of the Crown Court comprises trials on indictment, the
sentencing of those committed for sentence from magistrates’ courts and

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
appeals from magistrates’ courts. This appellate jurisdiction includes civil as
well as criminal appeals. In addition the court has a minor original civil
jurisdiction which has little practical importance.
A High Court judge, Circuit judge or Recorder presides at all sittings of the
Crown Court, with a jury. For the more important criminal trials, a High
Court judge sits without any justices of the peace. For the less important trials
on indictment, appeals and committals for sentence from magistrates’ courts, a
Circuit judge or Recorder sits with between two and four justices of the peace.
In the City of London, where the Crown Court continues to be known as the
Central Criminal Court, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen are entitled to sit
with any High Court judge, Circuit judge or Recorder in any class of work.
The distribution of Crown Court business is subject to directions given by, or
on behalf of, the Lord Chief Justice of England, with the concurrence of the
Lord Chancellor; such directions allocate the various classes of offences to High
Court judges, Circuit judges and Recorders, sitting with or without justices of
the peace.
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal against the conviction
or against the sentence to the Crown Court. Where the appeal is on a point
of law either the prosecutor or the defendant may appeal from the magistrates’
court to the High Court by way of case stated, that is, by requesting the
magistrate to 'state a case for the opinion of the High Court. In certain cases,
an appeal by case stated may lie to the High Court from the Crown Court,
but normally appeals from the Crown Court, either against conviction or
against sentence, are made to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division).
Appeals against conviction may be brought to the court by right on any point
of law, and with leave of the trial judge or the court on any question of fact or
mixed fact and law. Appeals against sentence come with the leave of the court,
provided that the sentence was in the discretion of the trial judge and not
fixed by law. The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) normally consists of
three judges, who may be Lords Justices of Appeal or judges of the High
Court, although the Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal usually
presides. A further appeal from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) to
the House of Lords can be brought if the court certifies that a point of law of
general public importance is involved and it appears to the court or the
House of Lords that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
In addition, a prosecutor or defendant may appeal to the House of Lords
from a decision of the High Court in a criminal case.
In the majority of cases there is no restriction on the right of a private citizen
to institute criminal proceedings, but most prosecutions in England and Wales
are, in fact, initiated and conducted by the police. In some cases the consent
of the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions or, less fre¬
quently, a government department is required. The Director of Public Prosecu¬
tions is also concerned with prosecutions in all the more serious cases of
indictable offences; in courts where a substantial number of cases with which
he is concerned are tried, standing counsel are appointed by the Attorney
General to appear on his behalf. At the Central Criminal Court in London,
for instance, there is a panel of counsel known as Treasury Counsel, who are
retained to prosecute in the Director’s cases.
In criminal cases arrest may be effected either on a warrant issued by a judicial
authority on sworn information laid before it or, in certain cases, without
warrant. In the latter circumstances, a police officer may release the defendant

on bail, that is, he may discharge him temporarily, subject to his entering into
a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a reasonable sum of money, to
appear in court or at a police station at an appointed time. If the defendant
cannot be brought before the magistrates’ court within a day, and his alleged
offence is not serious, the police must release him on bail. Magistrates also
have discretion to grant bail, which they exercise according to well-defined
principles. If bail is refused by the magistrates, the defendant is entitled to
apply to the Crown Court or the High Court, and he must be informed of this
right.
Once anyone has been charged with an offence, the police may not put any
further questions to him, save, in exceptional circumstances, to prevent or
minimise harm or loss to any person or to the public, or to clear up an ambi¬
guity in a previous answer or statement. This is laid down by the Judges’
Rules which, although they do not have the force of law, nevertheless carry
very great weight.
A person detained in custody who thinks that the grounds for his detention
are not lawful,1 may sue out a writ of habeas corpus against the person who
detained him, this person then being required to appear before the court on the
day named to justify the detention. An application for such a writ is normally
made to a divisional court of the High Court either by the person detained or
by someone acting on his behalf. If no court is sitting the application may be
made to a single judge who may, and in some cases must, direct that it should
come before a divisional court. An application on behalf of anyone under 18 is
always first made to a judge sitting in chambers or in private. A writ may be
refused only by a divisional court.
Since criminal law in Britain presumes the innocence of the accused until
his guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any advantage,
apparent or real, over the defence. A defendant has the right to employ a legal
adviser for his defence and if he cannot afford to pay he may be granted legal
aid wholly or partly at the public expense; if remanded in custody he may be
visited in prison by his legal adviser to ensure that his defence is properly
prepared. During the preparation of the case, it is customary for the prosecu¬
tion to inform the defence of any relevant documents which it is not proposed
to put in evidence and to disclose them if asked to do so.
Criminal trials are (with rare exceptions) held in open court and the rules
of evidence (which are concerned with the proof of facts) are rigorously
applied. For instance, although generally the evidence of one uncorroborated
witness is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, where the evidence is that of an
accomplice (or accomplices) the judge will warn the jury of the danger of
convicting on uncorroborated evidence and a conviction made without any
such warning would not be upheld on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the right to hear and subsequently to
cross-examine (normally through his counsel) all the witnesses for the prosecu¬
tion ; to call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial of their own
free will, may be legally compelled to attend; and to address the court either
in person or through his counsel—the defence having the right to the last
speech at the trial. Moreover, the defendant cannot himself be questioned
unless he consents to be sworn as a witness in his own defence. The right
1 Lawful grounds are: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of
either House of Parliament; detention of persons found to be mentally disordered;
detention of children by their parents or guardians; and detention expressly authorised
by Act of Parliament. The writ of habeas corpus runs in both criminal and civil cases.
BRITAIN 1973- AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to cross-examine him, even when he is so sworn, is limited by law, with the
object of excluding enquiry into his character or into past offences not relevant
to the particular charge on which he is being tried. Furthermore, although
confessions made in the course of previous judicial proceedings are admissible
as evidence if they have been made upon oath, no confessions made in any
other circumstances are admitted unless it can be proved that they were made
voluntarily.
In criminal trials by jury the judge determines questions of law, sums up
the evidence for the benefit of the jury, and acquits the accused or passes
sentence according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alone decides the
issue of guilt or innocence. Verdicts need not necessarily be unanimous, in
certain circumstances the jury may bring in a majority verdict provided that,
in a normal jury of 12 people, there are not more than two dissentients.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If a
defence of insanity is accepted by the jury the verdict is ‘not guilty by reason
of insanity’ and the defendant will be detained in a suitable hospital. From a
verdict of ‘guilty’ or of ‘not guilty by reason of insanity’ there is a right of
appeal on the part of the defendant to the appropriate court.
CIVIL LAW IN
ENGLAND AND
WALES
Civil Courts
Magistrates'
Courts
County Courts
The main civil courts in England and Wales are the county courts, which
deal with a wide variety of civil cases, and the High Court, where those that
cannot be decided in the county courts are heard. Magistrates’ courts have
limited civil jurisdiction, as does the Crown Court—mainly in connection with
appeals from magistrates’ courts under various enactments. Most appeals in
civil cases go to the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and from there may go to
the House of Lords.
The civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial proceed¬
ings for separation and maintenance orders, adoption, and affiliation and
guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction in respect of such
matters as nuisances under the Public Health Acts and the recovery of rates.
Committees of magistrates exercise quasi-administrative functions in relation
to the licensing of public houses and of betting shops and clubs.
County courts (of which there are 337) are so located that no part of the
country is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. In the busier
centres, the courts may sit every day; in others they may sit weekly, monthly,
or longer intervals. , „
Under the Courts Act 1971, all judges of the Supreme Court and all Circuit
iudges and Recorders have power to sit in the county courts. But the Act
provides that each county court shall have one or more Circuit judges assigned
to it by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are mostly
taken by these judges, many of whom held office as county court judges before
the passing of the Act. The judge normally sits alone although on the request
of a party the court may, in exceptional cases, order a trial to be held with a
J The jurisdiction of the county courts covers: actions founded upon contract
and tort (except libel, slander, and some other types of case) where the
amount claimed is not more than £75°; equity matters, such as trusts an
mortgages, where the amount does not exceed l$,ooo\ and actions for the
recovery of land where the net annual value for rating does not exceed £400.
Cases outside these limits may be tried in the county court by consent of the
parties, or may be transferred to the High Court.
The High Court

Proceedings
LAW AND ORDER 85
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the
Rent Act, landlord and tenant, and adoption. In addition undefended divorce
cases1 are heard and determined by county courts designated as divorce
county courts; bankruptcies are dealt with in certain county courts outside
London; and complaints of racial discrimination brought by the Race Rela¬
tions Board are heard in selected courts where the judge sits with assessors.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction, which is both original
and appellate and covers all civil and some criminal causes, is vested in all its
divisions. In general, however, particular types of work are assigned to a
particular division—distribution of work being governed by statute, the rules
of court and the practice of the court. For instance, the Family Division deals
with all jurisdiction of a family kind, including matrimonial cases, and cases
relating to wardship, adoption, and guardianship; while Admiralty and prize
jurisdiction rests with a specially constituted Admiralty Court of the Queen’s
Bench Division.
There are 68 High Court judges each of whom is attached to one division
on appointment but who may be transferred to any other division during his
term of office. The Lord Chancellor is president of the Court of Appeal and
of the Chancery Division—the administration of the Chancery Division being
the responsibility of the senior judge known as the Vice-Chancellor. The
Queen’s Bench Division is presided over by the Lord Chief Justice of England,
who ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in the legal hierarchy, and the Family
Division is headed by the President. Outside London (where the High Court
sits at the Royal Courts of Justice) sittings of the court are held at 23 places
which are known as first tier centres (see p. 80).
For the hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly.
Appellate jurisdiction in civil matters from inferior courts is exercised by
divisional courts of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of
the appropriate division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial proceedings heard by magistrates’ courts lie to a
divisional court of the Family Division of the High Court. Affiliation appeals
are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from decisions of the licensing
and betting licensing committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High Court
and the county courts are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and
may (with leave of the court or of the House of Lords) go on to the House of
Lords, which is the ultimate court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex officio members of the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) are the Lord
Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the President of the family Division and
the Master of the Rolls; the ordinary members are 14 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the ten Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and
sometimes even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals
(which normally takes place in a committee room and not in the legislative
chamber), but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit.
The president of the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary enquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is required. The
most common form of proceedings is an action commenced by a writ of
1 Defended cases are transferred to the High Court.
86
BRITAIN 1973'. AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
summons served on the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant
that the plaintiff has a claim against him and states the nature of the claim.
If the defendant intends to contest the claim, he ‘enters an appearance’ by
informing the court to this effect and documents setting out the precise
question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court.
A decree for divorce can be obtained only after a hearing in court, whether
or not the case is defended. Other civil proceedings, because they are a private
matter, can usually be abandoned or compromised at any time without leave
of the * court—the parties to a dispute being able to settle their differences
through their solicitors before the stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that
are brought to court are usually tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases
involving claims for defamation, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution,
when either party may insist on trial by jury, or in a case of fraud, when the
defendant may claim this right. In trials where a jury is present, the jury is
responsible for deciding questions of fact (as in criminal trials) and also the
amount of damages to be awarded to the injured party; majority verdicts may
be accepted.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by
seizure of the debtor’s goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order
requiring an employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction
from the debtor’s wages). Refusal to obey a judgment directing the defendant
to do something or to refrain from doing something may result in imprison¬
ment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal may be
effected only on a warrant of the court. . . ,
The general rule is that the costs of the action (the barrister’s fees, solicitor s
charges, court fees and other disbursements) are in the discretion fo the court;
normally, the court orders the costs to be paid by the party losing the action.

Courts

Courts
The Sheriff Court
The High Court
of Justiciary
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, when
proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury, or under
summary procedure, when the judge sits without a jury. All cases in the
High Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff court are
tried under solemn procedure. Proceedings are taken under summary pro¬
cedure in the less serious cases in the sheriff court, and in the justice of the
peace and burgh (or police) courts.
These courts are established in burghs. The judges are town councillors who
are serving (or have served) in the office of magistrate of the buigh. In
Glasgow stipendiary magistrates act as judges of three of the courts.
These courts are organised on a county (and county of city) basis, the judges
being the justices of the peace for the county (or county of city).
Scotland is divided into sheriffdoms, each consisting of a county or combina¬
tion of counties, and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court
districts. A sheriffdom has a sheriff-principal and a number of sheriffs who
act as the judges of the court. The sheriff courts exercise an extensive civil
jurisdiction, as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
Any one of the following judges is entitled to try cases in the High Court , the
Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of Session),
the Lord Justice Clerk, or any one of the 16 Lords Commissioner of Justiciary

who are also judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the court is in Edin¬
burgh, but the judges go on circuit to preside at trials in other towns.
A person convicted in the High Court or in a sheriff court on indictment may
appeal to the High Court of Justiciary (a) against his conviction on any ground
which involves a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High Court or
upon the certificate of the judge who presided at the trial that it is a fit case
for appeal, on any ground, and (b) against his sentence, with the leave of the
High Court, unless the sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals are heard by
three or more judges, and there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on
questions of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
In Scotland the police make preliminary investigation of all cases of crime
discovered by or made known to them, but it is for the Public Prosecutor
concerned (the Lord Advocate in the High Court, the Procurators Fiscal in
the sheriff court, and the justice of the peace fiscal and burgh prosecutor in
the justice of the peace and burgh courts respectively) to decide whether or
not to prosecute and, in the case of the Procurator Fiscal, to decide whether
to proceed summarily or to charge the accused by petition with a view to
proceedings on indictment.
The police in Scotland have very broadly the same powers of arrest as have
the police in England and Wales. The Judges’ Rules do not apply in Scotland,
but when anyone is arrested he must be cautioned and have the charge read
over to him. Thereafter, only his voluntary statements are used in evidence
at his trial, and the court will reject any statements made by him unless it is
satisfied that they have been fairly obtained.
As in England and Wales, when anyone is apprehended in Scotland, he
must be brought before the court competent to deal with his case with the
least possible delay. Where a prosecution on indictment is contemplated,
the accused is brought before a judge for judicial examination and the judge
may then commit him for trial or for further examination. Eight days may
elapse between commitment for further examination and commitment for
trial.
People in custody, other than those charged with murder or treason, may
be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the jurisdiction
of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or by the police.
Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be granted at the discretion
of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a right of
appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail,
by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the
amount fixed.
The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High Court
of Justiciary has power to release anyone unlawfully detained and trials must,
in any event, be brought to a conclusion within no days of committal.
In trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ diet takes place in the sheriff court,
when the accused person is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty. If he
pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ diet in the appro¬
priate court. If he pleads guilty, and it is a case which is to be dealt with in the
sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a High Court case
it is continued to the second diet in the High Court for disposal.

The second diet is held at least nine days after the pleading diet, either
before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury. Evidence is led (without
opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for the prosecution and for
the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the jury. The jury may return
a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of which result in acquittal,
or they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case the court proceeds to
deliver sentence. The verdict may be by a majority of eight to seven. Fairness
to the accused is ensured by the fact that, with a few minor exceptions, no
person may be convicted without the evidence of at least two witnesses, or
corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances which clearly impli¬
cate the accused in the crime.
At summary trials the accused is asked to plead to the charge at the first
calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the case.
Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it
may appoint a trial diet for a later date.
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in Scotland are the sheriff courts which,
in their civil capacity, correspond roughly to the county courts in England
and Wales, and the Court of Session, which is the supreme civil court in
Scotland.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to nearly all actions and is
unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff,
against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal or
directly to the Court of Session. Minor civil matters (actions not exceeding
£5 in value) may be tried by justices of the peace.
The Court of Session has universal jurisdiction, sits only in Edinburgh, and
has sole jurisdiction, inter alia, in divorce actions. The court is divided into
two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House,
which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions
of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being presided
over by the Lord President and the second division by the Lord Justice Clerk.
From the Inner House an appeal may lie to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank
and dignity of a judge of the Court of Session.
In Scotland civil proceedings are initiated by the service on the defender of
a writ or summons, which sets out the nature of the decree which the pursuer
seeks, a statement of facts upon which the pursuer founds his claim, and a
statement of the legal propositions upon which the pursuer maintains that he
is entitled to the remedy which he seeks. In Court of Session actions the next
step is the calling of the summons, which is the publication of the action in
the court lists. If the defender intends to contest the action, he must ‘enter
appearance’ within two days of calling and thereafter lodge defences to it. In
ordinary sheriff court actions ‘entering appearance’ is followed by the ‘tabling
of the cause’, which involves a formal appearance in court by solicitors, or, in
some cases, by the parties to the dispute. In summary and small debt actions
the defender is simply given notice of the date on which the action will be
heard. It is much more common in Scotland than in England and Wales to
have legal debates in court as to the competency or relevancy of the written
pleadings prior to the proof.

LAW AND ORDER 89
In Scotland a pursuer can abandon his case, including any matrimonial
case, at any time, but where abandonment is sought after the commencement
of the proof or trial, only with leave of the court. Trial by jury in civil action
in Scotland is more common than in England and Wales, being the usual form
of procedure in actions for damages for personal injuries in the Court of
Session. In the sheriff court they are relatively rare, being confined to actions
between employer and employee.
The superior courts in Northern Ireland comprise the Supreme Court of
Judicature (consisting of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal)
and the Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court is the superior court of
first instance, is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s Bench
Division (including probate, matrimonial and Admiralty proceedings) and the
circuit courts and is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice, as president, and
four judges. The Court of Appeal, which is the appellate tribunal, is constituted
of the Lord Chief Justice and two Lords Justices of Appeal.
The inferior courts are the county courts and courts of summary jurisdiction
(petty sessions). The county courts exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction
and are presided over by county court judges, of whom there are five (two
of them having a title of Recorder—of Belfast and of Londonderry). At least
four sittings of the court are held annually in each division. Petty session courts
are composed of one resident magistrate (who corresponds to a stipendiary
magistrate in England and Wales) who sits alone except in some specific cases,
for instance, in a special crimes court, where two may adjudicate. Juvenile
courts, which deal with children or young persons between the ages of 10 and
17 unless charged jointly with an adult or committed for jury trial in the case
of a more serious offence, are composed of one resident magistrate and two lay
members, one of whom must be a woman.
Coroners’ courts are common law courts convened when a person appears to
have died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden death of which the cause
is unknown, and in certain other circumstances. In such cases, it is the duty
of the local coroner (who may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical practi¬
tioner of not less than five years’ standing, appointed by county, county
borough, or certain borough councils) to hold an enquiry into how, when and
where the deceased died; he may hold an inquest in court for this purpose,
and he must do so if he has reason to believe that the deceased has died a
violent or unnatural death or has died in prison or in circumstances for which
an Act of Parliament provides that an inquest must be held. If he has reason
to suspect that the death was due to murder, suicide, manslaughter, or infanti¬
cide, or was caused by an accident arising out of the use of a vehicle on the
public highway, he must summon a jury.
Cases may be brought to the notice of the coroner by medical practitioners,
by the police, by various public authorities or by members of the public. The
amount of work varies considerably according to the type of locality.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fiscal
enquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and
may report the result of his enquiries to the Crown Agent in order that Crown
Counsel may consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
In Northern Ireland coroners must, on appointment, be either barristers-at-
law of not less than five years’ standing practising in Northern Ireland or
practising solicitors of the Supreme Court of Judicature in Northern Ireland of
not less than five years’ standing.

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a
rule, they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by
statute, which also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in the
social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions
on which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration,
with a group of people or with another individual; consequently there has
been a substantial growth during the past 30 years of administrative tribunals
with a regular or permanent existence and the function of deciding or
adjudicating in disputes arising under regulatory or welfare legislation. There
are now over 2,000 such tribunals, including those concerned with: land and
property; national insurance; supplementary benefits and family allowances;
the National Health Service; transport; taxation; and many which do not fall
into any specified group. Their constitution follows a fairly general pattern,
all, for instance, consist of an uneven number of persons so that a majority
decision can be reached; members are usually appointed by the minister
concerned with the subject but other authorities (for instance, the Crown, the
Lord Chancellor or the Master of the Rolls) have the power of appointment in
appropriate cases; the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord President of the Court of
Session in Scotland, makes appointments in most cases where a lawyer
chairman or member is required; and, with some exceptions, members of
tribunals hold office for a period specified in the warrant or instrument by
which they are appointed.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline, such as the
General Medical Council and the Disciplinary Committee of The Law
Society, but these are entirely different in constitution from the statutory
tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the public as a whole.
Although there is no general provision respecting appeals from statutory
tribunals, the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1971 provides for an appeal, at
least on a point of law, from all the more important tribunals to the High
Court, or, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. An appeal may also lie to a
specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of the Crown or to an
independent referee. An advisory body known as the Council on Tribunals
(appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for
Scotland) exercises general supervision1 over tribunals and reports on par¬
ticular matters, those peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by the Scottish
Committee of the Council.
The National Industrial Relations Court, set up under the Industrial Rela¬
tions Act 1971, consists of a judge of the High Court nominated by the Lord
Chancellor, a judge of the Court of Session nominated by the Lord President
and other members (appointed by the Crown) with special knowledge or
experience of industrial relations. The function of the court is to hear appeals
on questions of law arising from decisions of an industrial tribunal (see p. 386)
in England, Wales, or in Scotland under the Contracts of Employment Act
1963, the Redundancy Payments Act 1965, and those provisions of the
Industrial Relations Act which enable a complaint to be presented to a
tribunal. It also has jurisdiction to hear complaints of unfair industrial
practices and has exclusive jurisdiction over legally enforceable collective
agreements.

The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board consists of a chairman of wide
legal experience and eight other legally qualified members appointed by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation
with the Lord Chancellor. Its function is to entertain applications for ex gratia
payments of compensation, in certain circumstances, to victims of crimes of
violence in Great Britain or on a British vessel or aircraft. Compensation,
which is assessed on the basis of common law damages and usually takes the
form of a lump sum payment, amounts to about ^3 million a year. Some
10,000 applications a year are currently received.
Courts martial have jurisdiction, under the Army Act and the Air Force Act
of 1955 (as amended) and the Naval Discipline Act of 1957 (also as amended),
over serving members of the armed forces and, in certain circumstances, their
dependants and other civilians who accompany them outside the United
Kingdom. Courts martial may not deal with charges involving treason,
murder, manslaughter or rape, if the offence is committed in the United
Kingdom. Civil offences committed in the United Kingdom by members of
the armed forces are also normally dealt with in the ordinary courts.
A court martial (which consists of a president and a number of serving
officers) may be convened by any authorised officer. A judge advocate is
appointed to sit with the court in more serious cases brought under the
Army and Air Force Acts (and at every trial brought under the Naval
Discipline Act) to advise upon law and procedure and, in the former case, to
sum up the evidence. The judge advocate in the case of the Army and the
Air Force is a civilian and a barrister appointed by the Office of the Judge
Advocate General. In the case of the Navy he is a legally qualified serving
officer appointed by the convening authority.
Appeals lie to the Courts Martial Appeals Court, and from that court to
the House of Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or to the House of Lords
that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
In the United Kingdom the judiciary is independent of the executive and is
therefore not subject to ministerial direction or control in regard to the
judgment of the courts. Responsibility for administrative matters in England
and Wales, when it does not rest with the courts themselves, lies partly with
the Lord Chancellor and partly with the Home Secretary; in Scotland it lies
with the Secretary of State. In England the Lord Chancellor is concerned with
the composition of all courts, both criminal and civil, with parts of criminal
procedure and with everything relating to civil law, and the Home Secretary
with criminal law, preventing offences, apprehending offenders, part of the
process of trying them, and virtually the whole of their treatment. The Prime
Minister is concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the
Crown the highest judicial appointments. The Secretary of State for the
Environment is responsible for providing accommodation for all the superior
courts, except the Central Criminal Court which is the special responsibility
of the City of London.
The administrative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature (the Court
of Appeal, the High Court and the Crown Court) and the appointment of the
officers of the court is partly in the hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in
the hands of the appropriate judges. The Lord Chancellor is a member of
the Supreme Court, the Crown Court and the Matrimonial Causes Rule
92

Committees; and he appoints the County Court Rule Committee, and has
power to alter or disallow the rules made by it.
The Lord Chancellor is also responsible for the administration of the High
Court, the Crown Court and the county courts through a unified court
administrative service organised on a circuit basis under a senior officer, known
as a ‘circuit administrator’. Two High Court judges, known as ‘presiding
judges’, are assigned to each circuit; these judges are not concerned with
administrative detail and continue their normal judicial work, but they
exercise a supervisory and advisory function in the circuit, with particular
responsibility for the allocation of work among all the judges. The Lord
Chancellor has also appointed 18 advisory committees, consisting of lawyers,
magistrates, police officers, and representatives of local authorities, the police
and probation services, and the press, to advise him on such matters as he
may refer to them on the running of the courts. They normally meet under
the chairmanship of the circuit administrator.
Magistrates’ courts are mainly administered by the magistrates themselves,
chiefly through committees known as magistrates’ courts committees (the com¬
mittee of magistrates in inner London) but the local authorities, with financial
assistance from the Government, are responsible for meeting their costs, and
the Home Secretary, besides exercising a general oversight, has certain specific
responsibilities, including the approval of boundary changes to petty sessional
division areas, approval of the appointment of justices clerks, and deciding
disputes on financial matters.
In Scotland the Secretary of State appoints the staff of the High Court of
Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the staffing and
general organisation of the sheriff courts. The Lord Advocate appoints the
members of the Scottish Law Commission (which has functions similar to
those of the English Law Commission).
In Northern Ireland the administration of the superior courts is the
responsibility of the United Kingdom Parliament. The judges are appointed by
the Crown and are removable only on an address of both Houses of that
Parliament. The Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland is responsible
for the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions
courts. The judges of the county court and resident magistrates of the
magistrates’ courts are appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland.
The operation of the law requires the participation of judges, with whom,
aided in certain cases by juries, the decision of disputed cases rests, and of the
officers of the court, who have general or specialised functions of an adminis¬
trative (and sometimes of a judicial) nature in the courts to which they are
attached. Barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors who are entrusted
with representing the interests of the parties to a dispute are also involved
because, although the law allows an individual to conduct his own case if he
wishes, most people prefer to be legally represented.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown
is the historic source of all judicial power) and the Sovereign, acting on the
advice of ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary. In
England and Wales appointments to the highest positions—the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the
President of the Family Division and the Lords Justices who are the judges of
the Court of Appeal—are made on the recommendation of the Prime Minister,
while the Lord Chancellor recommends the appointment of High Court
LAW AND ORDER

Juries
judges, Circuit judges and Recorders and the metropolitan and other stipendi¬
ary magistrates. Justices of the peace are appointed on behalf of the Crown by
the Lord Chancellor,1 who is advised by advisory committees which he has
established for this purpose in every county and large town in England and
Wales, and in some of the smaller boroughs.
In Scotland the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appoint¬
ment of the Lord Justice General and Lord President and also of the Lord
Justice Clerk. Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies
with the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State is responsible
for the appointment and removal of justices of the peace.
Judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor who, as
well as being head of the judiciary, is a leading member of the Government
in power. With the exception of justices of the peace, judges are normally
appointed from practising barristers, advocates or solicitors and neither their
training nor their career is in any way dictated by the State. Justices of the
peace need no legal qualifications, being appointed for their qualities of in¬
tegrity and understanding and as broadly representative of the community
which they serve. On appointment, however, they give an undertaking to com¬
plete a period of basic training, so that they may obtain a sufficient knowledge
of the law, including the rules of evidence, and may understand the nature
and purpose of sentencing. In certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of
misconduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in England and
Wales may be removed from their position by the Lord Chancellor, and in
Scotland, subject to specified conditions, by the Secretary of State on a
report prepared at his instance by the Lord President of the Court of Session
and the Lord Justice Clerk. In order to safeguard and perpetuate the inde¬
pendence of the judiciary from the executive, however, superior judges in
England and Wales (other than the Lord Chancellor who, as a Cabinet
Minister, changes with the Government) are subject to a power of removal
only by the Sovereign on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament;
in Scotland there is no statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court
of Session or High Court of Justiciary from office and it is probable that
special legislation would be required to effect such a dismissal.
A jury in England and Wales summoned to a criminal or civil court consists of
12 persons (except in county courts, where it consists of eight persons). In
Scotland the jury consists of 15 persons in criminal cases and 12 in civil cases
and in Northern Ireland of 12 in criminal and seven in civil cases. Most house¬
holders2 in Britain (men and women alike) are liable for jury service if they are
British subjects between the ages of 21 and 60, but people following certain
occupations can claim exemption and certain persons with criminal records
are disqualified.
A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and the executive.
In criminal cases the accused can have up to seven jurors (in Scotland, five)
changed without giving reasons and both defence and prosecution can object
for cause shown (for instance, lack of impartiality), but once members of the
jury have been sworn, they are protected by law from interference of any kind.
1 Except in Lancashire, where the Chancellor of the Duchy acts on behalf of the Crown
in this matter.
2 Under a provision of the Criminal Justice Bill, the householder qualification will be
replaced in England and Wales by a qualification based on the electoral register. All
citizens between 21 and 65, subject to a five-year residence qualification, will be liable
for jury service.

The Legal
Profession
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland and at fatal accident enquiries in Scotland, a jury is required to be
present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died.
Juries in this instance consist of from seven to eleven jurors, and the coroner
may accept a majority verdict provided that the minority consists of not more
than two. A jury is also required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide
whether objects of gold or silver found in the ground are ‘treasure trove’.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers1 (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Each performs distinct duties—solicitors undertake
legal business for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems sub¬
mitted through solicitors and conduct proceedings in the higher courts—
though certain functions are common to both.
To become a barrister in England a student must have reached an accepted
educational standard, have passed certain examinations and attended certain
courses prescribed by the Council of Legal Education. He must also have
become a member of one of the four Inns of Court—Lincoln’s Inn, the Inner
Temple, the Middle Temple and Gray’s Inn—where he must keep eight terms.
He may then be called to the Bar, but is normally not allowed to practise until
he has kept a further four terms and completed six months’ pupilage with a
practising barrister of at least five years’ standing. A barrister with a sub¬
stantial junior practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor for a patent appoint¬
ing him Queen’s Counsel—a proceeding known as ‘taking silk’. Most of the
higher judicial offices are filled from the ranks of Queen’s Counsel. The
professional conduct of a barrister is subject to the scrutiny of the General
Council of the Bar; discipline is vested in the Senate of the four Inns.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable
by the appropriate committee of The Law Society (the professional organisa¬
tion of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his profes¬
sional career. The term of articles lasts for two, three or five years, depending
upon the educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must
pass the necessary examinations prescribed by The Law Society and, unless
he has been a barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally
required to attend a course of studies at a recognised law school. Once a
solicitor is qualified, he may become a member of The Law Society.
In Scotland prospective advocates and solicitors undergo much the same
training. While the respective professional organisations—the Faculty of
Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland—have their own professional
examinations, candidates usually obtain exemption from them by including
the necessary subjects in a law degree of a Scottish university. The prospective
advocate must, thereafter, undergo a period of training (either of 21 months
or of 12 months depending on whether or not he has been granted exemption
from nine months’ training) in a solicitor’s office, followed by about nine
months’ pupilage with a practising advocate. The prospective solicitor must
serve an apprenticeship of two years in a solicitor’s office before he can begin
his professional career.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.

LEGAL AID AND
ADVICE
Legal Aid in
Civil Cases
Legal Aid in
Criminal Courts
In Britain the legal aid and advice scheme covers legal advice either free or on
payment of a small fee, free or contributory legal aid for nearly all types of
civil and criminal proceedings in nearly all courts of law and for all proceedings
before the Lands Tribunal and the National Industrial Relations Court and
some legal assistance in circumstances where the assistance of a lawyer is
needed but which do not (or do not yet) involve litigation.
Free legal aid in civil cases is available to persons with very small incomes and
capital, and contributory legal aid to those with larger but still limited means.
The majority of people are financially eligible for legal aid.
The legal aid scheme in England and Wales is run by The Law Society
under the general guidance of the Lord Chancellor, assisted by an advisory
committee. It is operated by 13 area committees and a network of local com¬
mittees composed of barristers and solicitors (who may be paid a fee), with a
salaried staff. The cost is met from the Legal Aid Fund, drawn from three
sources: contributions from assisted persons; costs recovered from opposite
parties in litigation; and a grant from the Exchequer.
Applicants for legal aid must show that they have reasonable grounds
for asserting or disputing a claim. A successful applicant is allowed to select
from a panel a solicitor who, if necessary, instructs a barrister, and the case
is then conducted in the ordinary way. Action for libel and slander are excluded
from the scheme.
In Scotland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Law Society of
Scotland through a supervisory central committee, the Supreme Court
Committee and 16 local committees. To obtain legal aid for litigation an
applicant is required to show ‘probable cause’ and produce in support of his
application a statement corroborated according to the requirements of Scottish
law. Assistance is available in connection with appeals to the House of Lords
from the Court of Session, in civil proceedings before the Court of Session,
the Lands Valuation Appeal Court, the Scottish Land Court, the Lands
Tribunal for Scotland and the sheriff courts, and in matters not involving
litigation. Where litigation is not involved, the applicant must show he has
reasonable grounds for taking the proposed legal action.
In Northern Ireland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Incorpora¬
ted Law Society of Northern Ireland under the general guidance of the
Ministry of Home Affairs. The scheme provides for legal aid in proceedings
in the Supreme Court, the county courts and in certain civil proceedings in
magistrates’ courts.
In the criminal courts in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made
by the court or courts concerned if it appears that a defendant’s means are
such that he requires financial help in meeting the costs of the proceedings
in which he is involved (such an order must be made when a person is com¬
mitted for trial on a charge of murder or where the prosecutor appeals or
applies for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) or
the Courts-Martial Appeal Court to the House of Lords). No limit of income
or capital above which a person is ineligible for legal aid is specified, but the
court has power to order applicants to pay a reasonable contribution towards
the cost of the case according to their means. Legal aid in criminal proceedings
may consist of representation by a solicitor and counsel assigned by the court,
but in most proceedings in magistrates’ courts the recipient is entitled only to
the services of a solicitor, and in Crown Court proceedings the court may, in
cases of urgency (when there is no time to instruct a solicitor), order that legal
96

aid shall consist of representation by counsel only. A solicitor may appear in,
conduct and address the court in criminal proceedings in the Crown Court on
appeal from a magistrates’ court or on committal of a person to be sentenced
or dealt with if he (or any solicitor in his employment or by whom he is
employed) appeared on behalf of the defendant in the magistrates’ court.
In appeal cases before the Crown Court legal aid may be granted by a
magistrates’ court or the Crown Court. The granting of legal aid for appeals
to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) rests with that court, which may
also grant legal aid for the purposes of a further appeal to the House of Lords.
The cost of legal aid in magistrates’ courts is paid out of the Legal Aid Fund.
In the higher courts payments are borne by the central Government.
Legal aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland is available to all persons in
custody on their first appearance in the High Court of Justiciary and the
sheriff courts. Otherwise, it is granted for proceedings in these courts at the
discretion of the courts themselves except in appeals, when the final decision
whether or not it should be granted is in the hands of the Supreme Court
Committee of the Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland free legal aid is available in trials on indictment before
courts of assize and in county courts and in criminal proceedings before
magistrates’ courts. It is also available for appeals from magistrates’ courts
to the county court and in appeals from county courts and courts of assize
to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division).
Oral advice on legal matters is available throughout the United Kingdom, free
of charge to people in receipt of social security benefit and at a very reasonable
cost (£0-12^ for an interview of up to 90 minutes) to those of limited means.
Advice is given by practising solicitors paid out of legal aid funds. The scheme
is administered by the law societies, which also run voluntary schemes (for a
fee of £1 for an initial interview of up to 30 minutes) for those who do not
qualify for statutory assistance. Under the Legal Aid and Assistance Act I972>
a scheme is to be introduced whereby solicitors and counsel will be able to give
advice and assistance (short of actual representation in a court or tribunal) up
to the value of £2$ to those who, after a simple means test, would be eligible
for legal aid.
The duty of keeping the law under review in order to ensure that it meets the
needs of modern society lies, in England and Wales with the Law Reform
Committee, the Criminal Law Revision Committee and the Law Commission,
and in Scotland with the Scottish Law Commission. The Law Reform
Committee and the Criminal Law Revision Committee are standing commit¬
tees of judges and lawyers, appointed respectively by the Lord Chancellor and
the Home Secretary, to examine such aspects of the civil and criminal law
as may be referred to them by the appropriate minister. The Law Commission
is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of high standing, charged with
the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its systematic development and
reform, including the possibility of codification, the elimination of anomalies,
the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enactments, and the reduction of the
number of separate enactments. The Commission submits programmes of
reform to the Lord Chancellor and may recommend further examination of
specified topics by itself or by some other body, such as a Royal Commission
or the Law Reform Committee or Criminal Law Revision Committee. The
Lord Chancellor may also ask the Commission to prepare draft Bills or to
advise government departments. In the course of its work the Commission
LAW AND ORDER
97
Penalties
seeks information about the legal systems of other countries in so far as this
may assist its work. The Scottish Law Commission has a constitution similar to
that of the English body and similar functions in relation to the law of Scot¬
land. It reports to the Lord Advocate.
PENAL SYSTEMS
The chief aims of the penal systems of the United Kingdom are to deter the
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
deterrence is intended to lie in the fear of detection, public trial and possibility
of punishment rather than in the severity of the punishment itself. In England
and Wales the Home Secretary is assisted by an Advisory Council on the Penal
System, which makes recommendations on specific aspects of the prevention
of crime and the treatment of offenders. In Scotland the Scottish Council on
Crime keeps under review questions relating to the prevention of crime and
the treatment of offenders in Scotland, in consultation with the Secretary of
State for Scotland.
Methods current in British penal practice1 include imprisonment and, for
certain categories of young offender,2 other forms of custodial treatment:
borstal training; training in detention centres (in England, Wales and Scot¬
land); training in attendance centres (in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland); and training in a remand home or training school approved by the
Ministry of Home Affairs (in Northern Ireland only). In addition an offender
may be put on probation; fined; given an absolute or (in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland) conditional discharge for up to three years, or ‘bound over’
—that is to say, required to pledge money, with or without sureties, ‘to keep
the peace and be of good behaviour’. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
if sentenced to imprisonment for two years or less, an offender may be given
a suspended sentence, which means that the sentence will not actually be
served unless he commits a further offence punishable with imprisonment
within a period of between one and three years.3 If, however, he does commit
such an offence the suspended sentence will normally take effect and a further
sentence may be imposed.
The automatic penalty for murder in England, Wales and Scotland, where
the death penalty has been abolished, is imprisonment for life—a sentence
which may also be imposed for manslaughter and certain other offences,
including rape, robbery with violence, and arson. In Northern Ireland the
death penalty has been retained for two categories of ‘capital’ murder:
1 The Criminal Justice Bill provides for the introduction of a number of new penalties,
the modification of some existing penalties, and the making of a number of other
changes to the penal system and the administration of justice. The new penalties include
community service orders, criminal bankruptcy orders, the forfeiture by the offender of
property used or intended for use for the purposes of crime, and the disqualification
from driving of a person using a vehicle for the commission of a crime. Among existing
penalties modified under the Bill are those concerning reparation by the offender and
suspended sentences. The Bill also provides that, in certain circumstances, the court
would have power to defer passing sentence on an offender for up to six months.
2 Recent legislation has provided that juveniles who appear before the courts in care or
criminal proceedings may be made subject to a care order committing them to the
care of a local authority.
3 Under the Criminal Justice Bill the maximum period of suspension is to be reduced
from three to two years. In addition the courts will be given power to order an offender
made subject to a suspended sentence of more than six months to be placed under the
supervision of a probation officer (see p. 102).

murder of a constable or other person in the service of the Crown in the
course of duty involving enforcement of the law, maintenance of law and
order, or the administration or advancement of justice; and murder done in
the course of furtherance of any seditious conspiracy or of the activities of an
unlawful organisation. For other kinds of murder it has been abolished.
Except in cases of murder, for which the penalty is prescribed by law, the
court which tries the offender has discretion to select the penalty that it
considers most suitable in the light of the nature and gravity of the offence
and the information available about the character and needs of the offender.
In certain cases this discretion is modified by statutory provisions designed
for the most part to ensure that prison sentences are kept to a minimum.
In England and Wales, no offender under the age of 17 may be sentenced to
imprisonment; for those aged 17 and under 21 prison sentences must be for
less than six months or for more than three years except in the case of a per¬
sistent offender, who may be sent to prison for 18 months or more. In Scotland
no offender under 21 may be sent to prison; where neither borstal training nor
detention in a detention centre is thought appropriate, he may be sent to a
young offenders’ institution. In England and Wales the courts must suspend
sentences of up to six months’ imprisonment1 unless the offender has served a
previous prison sentence or the crime involved violence. On the other hand,
special sentences of somewhat longer duration (extended sentences) may be
imposed on persistent offenders.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary is the minister generally respon¬
sible for legislation relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting
statistical and other information about the operation of the penal system,
for keeping penal methods under review, and for bringing information about
these methods to the attention of the courts. He has specific responsibilities
for promoting the efficiency of the probation service, and for providing, main¬
taining and managing prisons, borstal institutions, detention centres, remand
centres and attendance centres. Prison policy is carried out by the Prison
Department of the Home Office through the agency of the prison service which
operates under a director-general and includes a headquarters organisation,
regional directors, the governors and staff of the penal establishments and
members of particular professions, such as medical officers, chaplains and
social workers.
Reports to the Home Secretary on the administration of institutions in the
penal system are made by boards of visitors appointed by the Home Secretary,
not less than two members of which must be justices of the peace. The other
functions of these bodies include acting as the superior disciplinary authority
for reports of a more serious nature against prisoners and providing an inde¬
pendent channel of complaint for any prisoner having a grievance.
The boards of visitors also advise on the release on licence of the inmates
of borstals. The work of boards helps to preserve local interest, and is
voluntary.
The penal systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland are based on principles
similar to those applied in England and Wales. In Scotland the system is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland
of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
The aims of the prison service are briefly to provide for the detention of those

LAW AND ORDER

committed to custody under the law in conditions generally acceptable to
society and to develop methods of treatment and training which will ‘en¬
courage and assist them to lead a good and useful life’.1 To this end prisoners
are classified into groups, according to their record, character, potentialities
and the risk they present to security, and assigned, so far as circumstances
permit, to the establishment best suited to their needs. Untried prisoners are
separated from convicted prisoners and, as far as practicable, those under 21
are separated from those over that age.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known
as ‘local prisons’; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which may be
open or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons. To relieve
overcrowding in local prisons and generally to improve prisoners’ conditions,
new prisons are being built and existing establishments redeveloped and
modernised. During the last ten years the accommodation available in England
and Wales has been increased by 9,000 places, and the current building pro¬
gramme envisages work starting on about 3,000 places a year. In Scotland
1,500 new places have been provided and there is to be an average annual
increase of 400 places in the future.
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to im¬
prisonment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their sentence
provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days (in Scotland,
30 days). In addition, except in Northern Ireland, prisoners serving fixed
sentences become eligible for consideration for release on parole after serving
one-third of their sentence, subject to a minimum of one year. Each eligible
prisoner is first considered by a local review committee which reports to the
Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland on his suitability for
parole. The Minister concerned then refers a selection of the recommenda¬
tions to the Parole Board for England and Wales or the Parole Board for Scot¬
land, each of which consists of a chairman and a number of other members
(about 30 in England and Wales and 13 in Scotland), appointed by the Home
Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland respectively. Where the
Parole Board recommends favourably, the decision whether or not to release
the prisoner depends finally on the Minister, but where the Board does not
recommend release the Minister has no power to grant parole.2 The licence
remains in force until the date on which the prisoner would have been released
if he had not been licensed or, for prisoners serving extended sentences (in
England and Wales only) and offenders sentenced while under 21 years of age,
until the end of the sentence.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence. In
Great Britain the usual practice in such cases is to seek the views of the local
review committee after the offender has served seven years. Each case is
considered by the Home Secretary or Secretary of State for Scotland and
forwarded to the Parole Board concerned. The Lord Chief Justice in Eng¬
land or the Lord Justice General in Scotland (as the case may be) and, if he is
available, the judge who presided at the trial must, by law, be consulted
before any life sentence prisoner is released. In Northern Ireland, where the
Ministry for Home Affairs is responsible for the release on licence of prisoners

in certain classes of case, to release a person on licence on the recommendation of the
local review committee.

serving life sentences, the judiciary is similarly consulted before any such
release takes place.
In England and Wales prison work is controlled by the Directorate of
Industries and Supply of the Prison Department of the Home Office, which
comprises administrative, executive, professional and technical staff. Technical
advice and services to workshops are provided by visits from regional and
headquarters staff. Industrial managers at establishments assist governors with
the day-to-day running of the workshops. Farms and gardens attached to penal
establishments are controlled by the Chief Farms and Gardens Officer at the
Directorate’s headquarters. In Scotland there is a Supervisor of Industries and
Training, who advises the Director of the Prison Service on industrial
employment (including agriculture) and training. A deputy supervisor, two
technical officers and four industrial managers work under the supervisor.
In Northern Ireland general supervision of prison work is exercised by the
Ministry of Home Affairs in consultation, where necessary, with other
government departments.
The primary source of work for prison inmates lies in the requirements of
the prison service itself, that is to say, building and maintenance, domestic
services and equipment. Goods and services are also supplied to other
government departments and, on an increasing scale, to other purchasers,
both inside and outside the public service. A few prisoners are employed
outside prison in agriculture and on work such as archaeological excavation
and the preservation of canals.
In England, Wales and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for
the work they do; in some prisons payments above the minimum are made on
the basis of output and skill; in Northern Ireland a progressive system of
earnings, related to work done, is being gradually introduced.
Any prisoner serving a sentence of four years or more may be considered
for employment in an ordinary civilian job outside prison for about six
months before his discharge. Prisoners selected for the scheme may live
either in prison or in a prison hostel; they are paid normal wages, from which
they support their families and meet their own expenses.
Education for those in custody in Great Britain is provided by local education
authorities in close liaison with the Department of Education and Science, and
in Scotland with the Scottish Education Department. Most prisons have a
tutor-organiser, assisted by a number of part-time teachers and, usually, one
or more full-time teachers. Prisoners may attend evening classes and take
correspondence courses when these are available and other educational facili¬
ties, such as physical training, concerts, plays, films, lectures and group
discussions, are arranged where facilities allow; prisoners may also use the
prison libraries, which depend largely upon the local public libraries for their
stocks. For selected prisoners vocational training courses, leading to an
acknowledged qualification, such as that of the City and Guilds of London
Institute, are provided, and experiments with Open University studies and
full-time education are being undertaken. Education in prisons in Northern
Ireland is the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Facilities
similar to those in Great Britain are provided under the direction of the Prison
Service Education Officer.
Medical attention is provided by full-time and part-time medical officers
whose duties include the care of the physical and mental health of prison
inmates, and the oversight of those services which affect health in prisons.

Privileges and

Welfare and
After-Care
In a few prisons there are large, fully equipped hospitals where major
surgery can be undertaken and treatment by visiting specialists given both to
inmates and to prisoners from other establishments. There is also one
psychiatric prison (in England and Wales) with accommodation for some 350
people.
Several prisons have their own psychiatric clinics, to which prisoners
from other establishments may be referred and, in England and Wales, there
is a prison psychological service, whose officers assist governors and medical
officers in their work of examining and classifying prisoners. The hospital
facilities of the National Health Service (see Chapter 5) are available for the
treatment of prisoners in appropriate cases and arrangements may be made,
where necessary, for prisoners to receive treatment after release.
All prisoners, from the beginning of their sentence, have a legal right to
write and receive letters and to be visited by their relations at regular intervals.
They also have such privileges as additional letters and visits, the use of
books, periodicals and newspapers, and the right to make purchases from the
canteen with money they have earned in prison. Depending on the facilities
available at individual establishments, they may be granted the further
privileges of dining and recreation in association and watching television in the
evening.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or board of
visitors, who have power to order, among other penalties, forfeiture of re¬
mission and forfeiture of privileges.
Welfare in prisons is the general concern of the prison staff as a whole, and in
particular of the chaplains and assistant governors, but special responsibilities
attach to prison welfare officers, who, in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, are probation officers seconded by the probation and after-care
service. (In Scotland, prison welfare officers are specially appointed for this
purpose.) The functions of these officers include helping the prisoner in his
relationships with individuals and organisations outside the prison, and
making plans for the prisoner’s after-care, working closely in this connection
with colleagues in the probation and after-care service and with other agencies
in the community whose help the prisoner or his family may need either during
sentence or after release.
For the spiritual welfare of the inmates, a chaplain of the Church of
England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland, and in Northern Ireland of
the Church of Ireland and of the Presbyterian Church), a Roman Catholic
priest and a minister of the Methodist Church are appointed to every prison.
Ministers of other denominations are either appointed or specially called in as
required. Chaplains not only hold regular services, but also visit every
prisoner soon after reception, shortly before release and regularly during
sentence, and pay daily visits to all prisoners who are sick or confined to
their cells and to any others who apply to see them.
Prisoners may also receive visits from specially appointed prison visitors,
whose work is voluntary and in England and Wales is co-ordinated and
guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
In England and Wales pre-release courses are conducted at all prisons.
During these courses experts hold open forum with prisoners nearing their
release on the domestic, social and employment problems with which they
are likely to be faced. Certain categories of prisoners may be granted home
leave towards the end of their sentences to enable them to preserve links with
their families and friends, or to make new contacts with people, including
102

potential employers, who may be able to assist them on release. Some categories
are considered for two periods of home leave, one allowing five clear days and
the other a week-end at home, and others for one period of five days at home.
Offenders released on licence are subject to statutory supervision after
release by probation officers of the probation and after-care service, to which
offenders not subject to compulsory supervision may also apply for help.
Those who fail to observe the conditions of statutory supervision are liable to
have their licences revoked.
In Northern Ireland after-care duties are likewise carried out by probation
and after-care officers; in Scotland responsibility for statutory and voluntary
after-care is vested in social workers from the local authority social work
departments.
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while he
remains at work or at school under the supervision of a probation officer,
whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal feature of the
service is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before making a
probation order, the court must explain its effects and make sure that the
probationer understands that if he fails to comply with the requirements of
the order he will be liable to be dealt with for the original offence. A proba¬
tion order can be made only if the offender is 17 years of age or over and must
have his consent; it usually requires the probationer to keep in regular touch
with the probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious
life.1 It may also require him to live in a specified place, or to submit to treat¬
ment for his mental condition. A probation order is made for not less than one
year and not more than three years.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation officers
are available to every criminal court. In England and Wales their appointment
is the responsibility of probation and after-care committees, composed for the
most part of justices—first appointments, except in the case of professionally
trained officers, being subject to confirmation by the Home Secretary. In
Northern Ireland the Ministry of Home Affairs appoints probation officers.
Training facilities in England and Wales are provided by the Central Council
for Education and Training in Social Work and by the Home Office on the
advice of the Advisory Council for Probation and After-Care and are made
available by arrangement to Northern Ireland officers.
In Scotland, where there is no separate probation service, the local authority
social work departments provide the services and officers required by the
criminal courts in their areas. Offenders subject to probation orders or to
after-care supervision following release from a penal institution are super¬
vised by specially approved social workers from these departments. Recruit¬
ment is the responsibility of the local authority concerned, and appointments
are not subject to ministerial confirmation. Unqualified staff appointed to posts
in social work departments can be seconded for professional training after
one year in post.
The borstal training system, which is available for offenders who have
reached the age of 15 but are not yet 21 (16 to 21 in Scotland and Northern
Ireland), consists of different borstals specialising in different types of young
offender, classified according to such criteria as age, intelligence and criminal
sophistication. There are also a few borstals for special purposes, such as

which offenders may be required to attend as a condition of a probation order.

allocation or recall. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland the period of
training ranges from six months to two years and is followed, in England and
Wales, by supervision for two years and in Northern Ireland for one year
from the date of release. In Scotland, where there is no minimum period of
detention, the maximum is two years and the supervision period is for one
year from the date of release. The system is essentially remedial and educa¬
tional, based on personal training by a carefully selected staff. Emphasis is
placed on vocational training in skilled trades; there is much freedom of move¬
ment and many borstals are open establishments.
Detention centres provide a means of training, and are intended to deter
from further crime, young offenders for whom a long period of residential
training does not seem necessary but who cannot be taught respect for the
law by such measures as fines or probation. In England and Wales four junior
centres are available for boys of not less than 14 and under 17, and 13 senior
centres for young men aged 17 and under 21. In Scotland there is one senior
centre. Detention in England and Wales may be for not less than three and
not more than six months for those over 17; if consecutive sentences are passed,
the total term may not exceed nine months at any one time. Remission of up to
one-third of the sentence may be earned for good conduct. In Scotland the
fixed period for all detention centre sentences is three months and the age
ranges from 16 to 21.
The regime at detention centres, which is brisk and firm, with strong
emphasis on hard work and high standards of behaviour, provides a normal
working week of 44 hours, including one hour daily devoted to physical
training. Boys of compulsory school age have day-time and evening classes,
and further education is provided for others in the evenings. Nearly all young
offenders discharged from detention centres are subject to statutory super¬
vision for 12 months.
Sixty attendance centres have been established in England and Wales for boys
between the ages of 10 and 17 found guilty of offences for which older people
could be sentenced to imprisonment. Boys ordered to attend must do so
during their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; they may be
required to attend for up to three hours on any one occasion and for a total of
not less than 12 hours (with certain exceptions) and not more than 24. The
activities include physical training and instruction in handicrafts or some other
practical subject. Efforts are made at the centres to induce the boys to join a
youth club or other suitable organisation.
In Northern Ireland there is one attendance centre; it operates on the same
lines as the centres in England and Wales, but caters for boys between the
ages of 12 and 17.
Criminological research, particularly research directed to the question of the
treatment of offenders, is carried out by the Home Office Research Unit
(which also serves the Scottish Home and Health Department), by university
departments and by various other research organisations; much of it is
financed by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department.
Studies undertaken by the Home Office Research Unit are mainly concentrated
on subjects of direct interest to the home departments. Research and teaching
in criminology are provided at the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge
University and at Edinburgh University, at both of which postgraduate
courses are available. Courses in criminology are also available at the univer¬
sities of Durham, Reading. Oxford, Manchester and Southampton; the London
BRITAIN 1973- AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
School of Economics, and University College in the University of London;
and the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Strathclyde in Scotland.
These institutions likewise conduct research.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised in a number of large forces
linked with local government and subject to the influence and eventual control
of the Home Secretary in England and Wales and the Secretary of State for
Scotland in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, it is organised in a single force.
POLICE IN There are 67 regular police forces in Great Britain: 47 in England and Wales
GREAT BRITAIN an(j 20 jn Scotland. Each police force is responsible for a separate police area,
but there is constant co-operation between them.
Police Forces In England and Wales the forces are defined according to area of res¬
ponsibility as: county forces (5); county borough forces (6); combined forces
which are forces whose area of responsibility extends over two or more coun¬
ties or county boroughs (34); the Metropolitan Police Force, which is respon¬
sible for an area of approximately 15 miles radius from Charing Cross, but
excluding the City of London; and the City of London force. In Scotland
there are four burgh forces, 15 combined forces, and one county force.
The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is over 108,000, the
size of individual police forces depending on the area and population which
they serve. In England and Wales, outside Greater London, establishments
range from about 700 to 7,000, the average being 1,850 officers. The strength
of the Metropolitan Police Force is about 21,400. In Scotland forces range in
strength from about 100 to 2,650.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are constabularies maintained
by the statutory transport and other public authorities, and by the Ministry
of Defence.
Police
Authorities
and Chief
Constables
Each of the regular police forces is maintained by a police authority. In the
counties of England and Wales the authority is a police committee and in the
county boroughs a watch committee. Both are committees of the local council
and consist of councillors and justices in a proportion of two to one. Com¬
bined police authorities, which also consist of councillors and justices, contain
representatives from each constituent area covered by an amalgamation
scheme*
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home Sec¬
retary. In the City of London the Court of Common Council is the police
authority, although it usually appoints a standing committee to deal with al
police matters on its behalf. .
In Scotland the police authority for the county is the county council; in
the burghs it is the town council; and where there are combined forces there
is ajoint police committee.
The primary duty of the police authority is to provide an adequate and
efficient police force for the area for which it is responsible. To enable it to
carry out this duty, it is empowered, subject to the approval of the Home
Secretary or Secretary of State for Scotland, to appoint the chief constable
and the deputy and assistant chief constables of the force, and fix the authorised
establishment. It may also retire the chief constable in the interests of efficiency,
if the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland agrees, and
must keep itself informed of the way in which chief constables deal with

complaints from the public against police officers. In addition, police authori¬
ties, with the consent of the Secretary of State, provide the buildings and
equipment needed for their forces. In the Metropolitan Police District the
chief officer of police and his immediate subordinates are appointed by the
Crown on the recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police
forces and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below
deputy or assistant chief constable; they are, however, generally answerable
to the police authorities on matters of efficiency, and are required to submit
a written annual report.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who have a
general responsibility for the preservation of law and order throughout Great
Britain, are concerned both in the overall organisation of the police service
and in its administration and operation. In this regard, they not only approve
the appointment of chief constables, but may require a police authority to
retire a chief constable in the interests of efficiency, call for a report from a
chief constable on any matters relating to the policing of his area, or cause
a local enquiry to be held. They are also empowered to make regulations as
to the government, administration and conditions of service in police forces.
The police regulations cover such matters as rank; qualifications for appoint¬
ment, promotion and retirement; discipline; hours of duty, leave, pay and
allowances; and uniform and equipment. Some of these are first negotiable
on the Police Council; the others are discussed on representative advisory
bodies together with any general questions affecting the police service.
The Home Secretary is advised on all matters concerning police efficiency
by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and five inspectors, of whom
one has a special responsibility for traffic. The inspectors are individually
responsible for the inspection of a number of forces, and must be satisfied of
their continuing efficiency through formal annual inspection, and informal
visits and consultations when particular problems arise. The inspectors report
to the Home Secretary on the condition of all the forces, with the exception of
the Metropolitan Police Force. The Secretary of State for Scotland is similarly
assisted by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland and one
other inspector.
All police authorities receive a government grant equal to half their net
expenditure, except the Common Council of the City of London, which
receives one-third. The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scot¬
land are empowered to withhold the grant, in whole or in part, permanently
or for such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police
area is efficiently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered,
or that the rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the ages
of 19 and 30. Women entrants in England and Wales must be between the
ages of 19 and 35, and in Scotland between 19 and 30 years old. In England
and Wales men over 30 years old, and women over 35, may, however, be
appointed on the recommendation of the appointing authority in special
circumstances approved by the Home Secretary. In Scotland the individual
chief constables may approve appointments of both men and women over 30
years old.
There are nearly 300 graduates serving in the police forces of Great Britain,
and some 80 police officers reading for university degrees.

BRITAIN 1973: an OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
Police District, are: chief constable, chief superintendent, superintendent, chief
inspector, inspector, sergeant and constable. Intermediate ranks may also be
adopted in areas where varying degrees of responsibility make them necessary.
In the Metropolitan Police District the chief officer is the Commissioner of
Police of the Metropolis. He is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four
assistant commissioners. Next in rank are deputy assistant commissioners,
commanders, chief superintendents and chief inspectors; the other ranks are
the same as in the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are the
same as in the regions except that the chief officer is the Commissioner of
Police and the second in command is an assistant commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union since it is a
basic principle of the service that its members must not only be free from
political bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have
their own associations which can make representations to ministers or to
police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their members.
Police cadets are recruited by most forces from among boys between 16 (15
in Scotland) and 18 years of age. They have no police powers but are given
some training in police work, partly as useful preparation for subsequent
appointment as constables and partly to give them sufficient insight into police
duties to enable them to decide whether or not they wish to make a career
in the police service. Some forces also recruit girl cadets.
Police authorities employ a large number of civilians on administrative (pay,
records, finance, and other general subjects) and other duties (fingerprint,
scenes of crime and control room work) in order to release as many police
officers as possible for operational duties. In addition civilian staff is employed
on catering and domestic duties.
All police forces have an attachment of special constables, who are volunteers
willing to perform police duties without pay in their spare time. In England
and Wales the function of special constables is to act as auxiliaries to the
regular force when required. In Scotland they are employed only in emer¬
gencies although they may be assigned for duty for training purposes.
Traffic wardens are extensively employed to discharge specified duties con¬
nected with road traffic and vehicles, normally undertaken by the police. In
this connection they may be authorised to serve fixed penalty notices1 for
minor offences to which the fixed penalty system applies; to man police car-
pounds ; to enforce the vehicle excise laws; and to obtain the name and address
of people thought to have committed a traffic offence of the type with which
traffic wardens are competent to deal. They may also be employed to direct
traffic, to act as parking attendants at street parking places, and as school¬
crossing patrols, if the police agree. Traffic wardens remain under the control
of the chief constable of the force to which they are attached, whatever duties
they may perform.
Police Duties A police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public office
and exercises his powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by
common law, by virtue of his office; he is an agent of the law of the land, not
of the police authority nor of the central Government and although his chief

officer of police has a vicarious liability for any wrongful act he may commit
in the performance of his functions as a constable, he himself may also be sued
in respect of his own wrongful act.
The many and varied functions of a police officer as a constable range from
the protection of persons and property, road or street patrolling and traffic
control to crime prevention, criminal investigation and the apprehension of
offenders.
The main departments in all police forces are the uniform department and
the criminal investigation department; many forces also have specialised depart¬
ments, including traffic departments, river police (in districts which include
long stretches of navigable waterway), a mounted branch (for maintaining
order and safety in large crowds), and police dogs.
In all aspects of police work, the application of scientific aids has reached
an advanced stage: nearly £14 million is spent annually on police equipment,
including upwards of £2*5 million on radio communications; the police have
30,000 personal radio sets operational; and a police computer project is being
developed for rationalising the keeping of records and speeding up the
dissemination of information.
A number of common services are provided by the central government depart¬
ments for the benefit of all forces to supplement those provided by the police
authorities for their own use and by communal arrangements made between
the forces themselves. The most important of these services are: training
services, which in England and Wales provide training centres for recruit
training and a central police college for higher training and in Scotland a
central police college with courses of recruit training and higher training; a
forensic science service in England and Wales which provides eight regional
laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan Police Laboratory); regional
wireless services and wireless depots, which in England and Wales supply and
maintain wireless equipment for the police; and central and provincial criminal
records which are available to all forces. In addition, regional crime squads,
consisting of teams of experienced detectives from several forces, operating
under a committee of chief constables, are employed in England and Wales to
investigate major crimes involving enquiries in more than one police area. In
Scotland the Scottish Crime Squad assists Scottish police forces in the investi¬
gation and prevention of crime and in the collection and maintenance of in¬
formation concerning criminals. Arrangements are also made for everyday
assistance by one force to another.
There are three inter-related branches of the Home Office Police Department
devoted to scientific research and medium- and long-term planning. The Police
Scientific Development Branch and the Police Research Services Branch,
which are staffed by senior police officers, are concerned with operational
research into police methods and the development of equipment for police
forces throughout Great Britain; the Police Management and Planning group,
which is composed mainly of economists and accountants, is responsible for the
development of a planning-programming-budgeting system for the police, and
for the medium- and long-term planning of police resources.
Services provided by the Metropolitan Police Force for other forces include
(1) the publication of the Police Gazette,1 which contains particulars of people
wanted for crime and details of stolen property, and is supplied without charge

to the police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain other Common¬
wealth and foreign forces; (2) the organisation and control of the special branch
of the criminal investigation department at New Scotland Yard, whose duties
include the protection of royalty, some ministers and distinguished foreign
visitors; and (3) the carrying out of extradition orders made by the courts. The
Metropolitan Police Force is also available, on request, to assist any other
police force in England and Wales in criminal investigations. Similarly, the
services of the Fraud Squad, run jointly by the Metropolitan Police Force
and the City of London Police, are available throughout Great Britain for the
investigation of serious company frauds. The National Central Bureau, which
handles the business of the International Criminal Police Organisation
(Interpol) on behalf of Great Britain and the British dependencies, is part of
the Metropolitan Police Force. For certain of these services, the Metropolitan
Police Force receives an additional Exchequer grant.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) operates under the direction of a
chief constable who is responsible to the Police Authority for Northern
Ireland. ,
The RUC, which has a strength of over 4,000 (all ranks) operates through¬
out the Province on a divisional basis. Ranks, conditions of service, pay and
general duties follow closely on the lines of the police service in Great
Britain. The Police Authority, which consists of a chairman, a vice-chairman
and between 14 and 20 other members appointed by the Governor of Northern
Ireland, has the same powers and duties as the police authorities in Great
Britain.
The RUC is assisted in its police duties by the Royal Ulster Constabulary
Reserve, the members of which receive nominal remuneration. While on duty,
they have the same powers, privileges and duties as, by the law for the time
being in force, may be exercised by, or are conferred upon, members of the
regular force.
4 DEFENCE
POLICY
Europe Britain’s basic security depends on the strength of the North Atlantic Alliance,
and it is to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) that by far the
greater part of Britain’s military forces is committed. Britain makes a major
contribution to the full range of deterrent capabilities, both conventional and
nuclear, required by the present NATO strategy of flexible response. At the
same time the British Government supports the Alliance’s efforts to engage the
Soviet Union and its allies in discussions which could lead to a real and lasting
relaxation of tensions between East and West, and hopes that the successful
conclusion of the negotiations on Berlin will make improvements possible over
a wider field in Europe.
Within NATO Britain has felt that the European countries should seek to
co-operate more closely on defence and to establish a greater identity of view.
Britain has played a leading part in the efforts of the European members to
assume increased responsibility for Europe’s defence. In the European Defence
Improvement Programme and their national programmes Britain and nine
other of the European members of the Alliance have made a significant contri¬
bution to the improvement of the Alliance’s conventional capabilities. Cur¬
rently engaged in a number of collaborative equipment projects with European
allies, Britain hopes that such co-operation might be extended to help to meet
Europe’s needs.
Beyond Europe At the same time it is recognised that British interests and responsibilities
are not confined to the NATO area, and that Britain has a shared interest in
the stability of such areas as the Far East and Gulf. Britain is therefore willing
to play, on a scale appropriate to national resources, a part in maintaining
stability outside Europe. Britain is a member of the Central Treaty Organisa¬
tion (CENTO) and the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO). In
South-east Asia, Britain contributes, with Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia
and Singapore, to the Five-Power defence arrangements in Malaysia and
Singapore; this involves the continuing deployment of British forces in this
area. In the Gulf, Britain is willing to help to maintain stability in the area
by the loan of British personnel to assist local forces, and by training and
liaison visits from units of all three Services. Britain is also responsible for the
defence and internal security of its remaining dependencies. In addition,
Britain’s armed forces assist civil communities, particularly in such activities
as disaster assistance and development work.
Northern At home the armed forces have been engaged since 1969 in the task of assisting
Ireland the civil authorities in Northern Ireland in the maintenance of law and order:
in particular they have operated to counter the terrorist campaign pursued by
the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
The United Britain supports the peacekeeping and other efforts of the United Nations
Nations and other international authorities working to eliminate the sources of tension
and conflict between nations and to promote arms control and disarmament.

Britain played a leading part in the negotiations for the 1968 Non-Proliferation
Treaty and the 1971 Sea-Bed Treaty, and Britain’s proposal for a convention
for the prohibition of biological methods of warfare led to the conclusion of a
further international arms control agreement.
Information about defence policy and the armed forces is provided by the
Government in an annual Statement on the Defence Estimates (Cmnd. 4891 in
1972) usually published in February. The defence budget for 1972-73 totalled
£2,854 million, which represents about 5-5 per cent of the gross national
product. Projections of expected defence expenditure for the next five years
are published each November (Cmnd. 4829 in 1971): a rise by an average of
1-4 per cent between 1971-72 and 1975-76 is planned. As compared with
the figure published in 1970 the projections involve an increase of some
£80 million for an accelerated programme of naval shipbuilding and
some £70 million a year for four additional infantry battalions.
PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Prime Minister and
the Cabinet, who are responsible to Parliament. Defence problems and their
implications for foreign and economic policy are dealt with on the Cabinet s
behalf by the Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy, under the chair¬
manship of the Prime Minister.
The formulation of defence policy is the responsibility of the Secretary of
State for Defence. In recent years the emphasis in defence organisation has
been on a greater degree of Service co-ordination, and on overall functional
planning of the defence effort as a whole. Since the unified Ministry of Defence
was created in 1964) the central organisation for defence has been regularly
reviewed and a series of changes made to increase efficiency and economy, the
most recent being the rationalisation of machinery for the procurement of
equipment. The Secretary of State is assisted by two Ministers of State, one
responsible for the Armed Forces and one for Defence Procurement. The two
ministers together with the three Under-Secretaries of State for the Navy,
Army and Air Force respectively, the Chief of the Defence Staff, the three
Service Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Personnel and Logistics, the Chief Scienti¬
fic Adviser, the Chief Executive of the Procurement Executive and the Per¬
manent Under-Secretary of State for Defence, sit on the Defence Council,
which deals with major defence policy under the chairmanship of the Secretary
of State. The Chiefs of Staff Committee, comprising the Chief of the Defence
Staff as chairman and the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services, is responsible
for giving professional advice on strategy and operations, and on the military
implications of defence policy. The day-to-day management of the three Ser¬
vices is the responsibility of the Admiralty, Army and Air Force Boards of the
Defence Council.
The Royal Navy has four main arms. These are: the Naval General Service,
which mans and maintains the surface fleet; the Fleet Air Arm; the Sub¬
marine Service; and the Royal Marines, who provide a seaborne and airborne
land striking-force.
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services which include the
Household Cavalry, the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Regiment of
Artillery, the Guards division and divisions of infantry, the Corps of Royal
Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals, the Army Air Corps, the Royal Corps

of Transport, the Royal Army Medical Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance
Corps and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.
The Royal Air Force is organised in commands, on a functional basis at
home and on a geographical basis overseas.
The three women’s services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the
Women’s Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and the Women’s Royal Air Force
(WRAP), are integral parts of the Navy, Army and Air Force respectively.
Servicewomen serve alongside servicemen in Britain and overseas. Nursing
services are provided by Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval Nursing Service,
Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps and Princess Mary’s Royal
Air Force Nursing Service.
The home and overseas commands of the Services are set out below.
Under a phased programme shore commands have been reorganised under a
single Commander-in-Chief, Naval Home Command, Portsmouth, with sub¬
ordinate Area Flag Officers at Plymouth, Chatham and Rosyth. In November
1971 the various sea commands were brought together under one unified
command, Commander-in-Chief Fleet.
During 1972 the previous home commands were replaced by a single command,
United Kingdom Land Forces; for operational reasons there are separate
command arrangements for Northern Ireland. The overseas commands are:
British Army of the Rhine (BAOR); Near East Land Forces; Land Forces
Hong Kong; and British Troops Malta and Gibraltar.
At the end of 1972 a single operational command for units in Britain will be
formed from the main elements of the previous Strike and Air Support Com¬
mands: in addition there are Training and Maintenance Commands. Overseas
commands are Royal Air Force Germany and Near East Air Force.
The assigned British forces in Malaysia and Singapore, along with the forces
of Australia and Newr Zealand, are under the operational command of an inte¬
grated ANZUK command in Singapore.
Britain’s armed forces consist entirely of volunteer personnel. Engagements
available to non-commissioned ranks range from three to 22 years, with a wide
variety of options. In 1972 a new type of engagement was introduced for non¬
commissioned ranks of all three Services, under which recruits will be com¬
mitted for only a minimum period of productive service (about three years)
and, subject to that minimum, may leave at any time at 18 months’ notice.
Commissions may be granted for short, medium and long terms.
Entrants to the non-commissioned ranks of the three Services are given basic
training, and further training is given during the course of their careers. Young
servicemen have the opportunity to read for secondary school qualifications
(see p. 152). Trade and technical training, though primarily designed for
Service purposes, leads in many cases to nationally recognised qualifications;
completion of many Service trade or technical courses followed by experience
is recognised by trade unions as a qualification for membership by men who
have left the Services.

BRITAIN 1973* AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Promotion from the non-commissioned ranks is possible in all three Ser¬
vices. In the Royal Navy, the largest entry is through the Britannia Royal
Naval College, Dartmouth; in the Army through cadetships in the Royal
Military Academy Sandhurst. This is followed by specialist training which
may include degree courses. The RAF has a direct entry scheme to com¬
missioned service. There are also schemes in all three Services for the award
of University Cadetships, which enable young men to take a degree before
commencing their Service training, and for the entry of graduates and other
qualified specialists.
All three Services provide training facilities for the armed forces of Common¬
wealth and foreign nations.
Selected officers of all three Services who have had previous staff training or
have been to the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich (London), the Army
Staff College at Camberley (Surrey), or the Royal Air Force Staff College
at Bracknell (Berkshire) go to the National Defence College (formerly the
Joint Services Staff College) at Chesham (Buckinghamshire). Here, in an
intensive and broad-based programme of courses, particular attention is paid
to the inter-Service aspect of staff work. Specially selected and more senior
officers from the Services, the Civil Service, and from the Commonwealth, the
United States, and allied European countries attend the Royal College of
Defence Studies (formerly the Imperial Defence College) in London. Con¬
siderable training is done through Joint-Service and inter-allied exercises, on
which increasing emphasis is placed.
In the defence estimates for 1972-73 £47 million is allocated to reserve and
auxiliary forces. Apart from their essential military role, these are considered
to form an important link between the Services and the civil community.
The Regular Reserve consists of various categories of former full-time officers
and ratings liable to recall in emergency: in particular the Royal Fleet Reserve
of men with recent experience of active service. The Volunteer Reserves com¬
prise the Royal Naval Reserve (with its associated women’s reserve) and the
Royal Marines Reserve; they carry out regular part-time training and man a
number of operational minesweepers and reinforce the Royal Marine Com¬
mandos. f
The Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, a civilian organisation composed ot
men and women volunteers, is responsible in time of war for minewatching
duties around the coast and the waterways, and other duties.
Men who have completed the Colour portion of their service with the Regular
Army are retained on the Regular Army Reserve to complete normally a total
engagement of seven or 12 years, according to the initial commitment and are
liable to recall. The Army General Reserve consists of certain former National
Service specialists.
The Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) consists of indepen¬
dent and sponsored units. Independent units are raised on a territorial basis
and each is based on one or more training centres. Sponsored units consist of
specialists and have to be recruited on a nation-wide basis. These units are
divided, for administration purposes, into Group A, which has a liability for
call-out when warlike operations are in preparation or in progress; and Group
B, which consists of miscellaneous units (for example, University Officer
Training Corps) with various liabilities. The establishment of the TAVR has
DEFENCE
US
Royal Air Force
CIVIL DEFENCE
been increased to provide an uncommitted reserve of infantry units and an
additional armoured car regiment.
The Ulster Defence Regiment is a locally recruited, part-time force under
the General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland, whose role is to support
the regular forces in the Command.
The Regular Reserve consists of former full-time officers and airmen who
serve in accordance with the terms of their original engagement or have volun¬
tarily extended their contractual period of service in the reserve; they have a
statutory liability for recall. The Royal Auxiliary Air Force, consisting of three
maritime headquarter units and the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, which
includes the 16 University Air Squadrons, are liable for part-time training
and for recall in an emergency.
Civil defence arrangements are principally based on the extended and adapted
use of existing public services operated by nationalised industries, by local
authorities, police authorities and government departments. Supplementary
effort from individual volunteers and voluntary organisations would be brought
in either at the discretion of local authorities or in response to a national appeal
in time of crisis. Within a total annual expenditure of £10 million emphasis is
placed on a high level of training for officials of the various authorities and
departments and planning at local level.
Arrangements include an emergency system for decentralised governmental
control and communications. The United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring
Organisation, including the Royal Observer Corps, is organised to provide
public warning of an attack, of the location and power of nuclear explosions,
and of the distribution and level of radioactive fall-out. Central training courses
are arranged by the Home Office on staff college lines.
NATO COMMITMENT
The basis of the present NATO strategy of flexible response, which retains
the principle of forward defence, is that credible deterrence of military actions
of all kinds is necessary: this can be secured only through a wide range of
forces equipped with a balanced mixture of conventional and tactical and
strategic nuclear weapons and thus able to respond to aggression at a variety
of levels. While NATO must be ready to use nuclear weapons if necessary, the
number and capabilities of its conventional forces must be maintained at a
level which would give NATO an alternative to a nuclear response against
anything but a major attack. This would permit a flexible range of responses,
able to meet aggression in the first place with direct defence at the appropriate
level, to gain time for negotiations to end a conflict, and to reassert deterrence
through the possibility of escalation to a higher level of conflict.
The strategy, with its emphasis on the need to be prepared to meet attacks of
varying scales in any region of the NATO area, requires a comprehensive
range of mobile and well-equipped conventional forces, and tactical and
strategic nuclear v/eapons. Britain makes a contribution to the forces required
by NATO’s present strategy unmatched by any other European member of
the North Atlantic Alliance. The British Polaris force forms the contribution
to the Western strategic deterrent. Virtually the whole of the Royal Navy is
earmarked for assignment; the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) and RAF
Germany (a tactical air-force) are assigned; and most of the air and ground
combat units based in the United Kingdom are also formally committed, from

which an important part of NATO’s mobile reinforcement capability is pro¬
vided. As part of its contribution to the European Defence Improvement Pro¬
gramme, Britain is improving the capabilities of air and naval forces committed
to the Alliance.
DEPLOYMENT
Elements of the Fleet operate in European sea areas; frigates, submarines and
coastal minesweepers carry out training, trials and fishery protection, and
ships of all classes spend periods at home for refitting. All major ships have
NATO commitments in the Channel, Eastern Atlantic, and Mediterranean;
a frigate or guided missile destroyer is assigned to the Standing Naval Force
Atlantic. Submarines of the British Polaris force are on continuous deterrent
patrol.
Of the Army units stationed in Britain the land elements of the United
Kingdom Mobile Force (of which No. 38 Group, Royal Air Force, provides
the air element), the British contribution to the land element of Allied Com¬
mand Europe Mobile Force (Land), and the Special Air Service Regiment
all have primary roles in support of NATO. Other field force units and train¬
ing organisations are stationed in the United Kingdom together with units
engaged on logistic tasks. A number of units have been deployed in Northern
Ireland to assist in the maintenance of law and order (see p. 109).
The combat units of the Royal Air Force in Britain provide strike and
strategic reconnaissance squadrons, interceptor squadrons for the air defence
of Britain, long-range maritime reconnaissance squadrons and forces for
maritime air defence and strike/attack. Plans to transfer the remaining fixed-
wing air support to the Royal Air Force from the Royal Navy have been
deferred until the late 1970s. These forces are all committed to NATO. Also
based in Britain are strategic and tactical transport forces, and the force of
Phantoms and Harriers in No. 38 group designed to provide close support for
the army in the field and tactical reconnaissance. The Phantoms and short-
range transport aircraft in No. 38 Group provide the RAF part of the UK
Mobile Force which is committed to NATO, while the Harriers provide the
main British contribution to NATO’s Allied Command Europe Mobile Force
(Air). There are also units of the Royal Air Force Regiment, responsible for
airfield defence and available for service overseas as required.
Ground forces in the Federal Republic of Germany consist of the British
Army of the Rhine (BAOR) and an independent brigade in West Berlin.
BAOR is organised as a corps of three divisions each of two brigades, plus corps
troops including two artillery brigades and an armoured reconnaissance force.
The BAOR brigades have been reorganised to produce a better balance
between armoured units and mechanised infantry. Royal Air Force Germany
is a tactical air force including strike/attack, reconnaissance, close support, and
air defence aircraft, all assigned to Supreme Allied Commander, Europe
(SACEUR). Helicopters for army support are also committed to NATO.
Surface-to-air missiles and light anti-aircraft squadrons are deployed for the
defence of RAF Germany’s airfields.
In the Mediterranean Britain’s maritime presence includes two frigates and a
guided missile destroyer or a cruiser which are earmarked for assignment to
SACEUR, one of which participates in the NATO ‘on call’ force; these are
reinforced by the occasional deployment of an aircraft carrier, a commando

ship, and frigates and submarines earmarked for other NATO commands. A
Royal Marine Commando is deployed in Malta.
Royal Air Force units in the area consist of strike/attack, maritime recon¬
naissance, photographic reconnaissance, air defence and transport squadrons;
surface-to-air missiles; and RAF Regiment squadrons. These forces are based
in Malta and Cyprus; support for NATO is provided from the forces in
Malta while support for CENTO comes from forces in both locations. Britain
supplies at its own expense about 900 men for the United Nations Peace¬
keeping Force in Cyprus (the largest national contingent). There are also small
garrisons in Cyprus and Gibraltar.
Britain continues to declare forces to certain contingency plans of the South-
East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO). Garrisons are maintained in Hong
Kong and Brunei. A force of six ships on station in the area contributes towards
the Five-Power defence arrangements (see below), and maintains the Beira
patrol, a guard-ship at Hong Kong, as well as providing a presence in the
Indian Ocean and South-east Asia areas. Other ships deployed in the area
include patrol vessels for maritime policing duties at Hong Kong and Royal
Fleet Auxiliaries.
The British contribution to the Five-Power defence arrangements for Malaysia
and Singapore, which is designed to complement the forces of the other four
countries, consists of a battalion group, with appropriate staff and logistic
elements, in Singapore; a detachment of long-range maritime reconnaissance
aircraft and support helicopters; two frigates or destroyers and a submarine
attached to the Royal Australian Navy.
Two frigates, equipped with helicopters, one of which carries a detachment of
Royal Marines, operate in the Caribbean. A detachment of Royal Marines and
a Royal Navy hovercraft unit are maintained in the Falkland Islands, and the
Royal Navy’s ice-patrol ship, HMS Endurance, operates there seasonally. A
small Army garrison remains in British Honduras.
COMBAT FORCES
Combat forces may be functionally divided as described below.
Responsibility for the British contribution to the Western strategic deterrent
now rests with the Royal Navy Polaris submarine force whose four nuclear
submarines—Resolution, Repulse, Renown and Revenge—are now in service
and provide a continuous deterrent patrol. Each has indefinite underwater
cruising range and carries 16 Polaris A3 missiles (with a range of about 2,800
miles and thermonuclear warheads). The cost of the force for 1972-73 is
estimated at £38 million.
The Polaris and other submarines operate from the Clyde submarine base
completed in 1968. Britain also provides facilities for a depot ship for United
States Polaris submarines at Holy Loch on the Firth of Clyde.
Britain’s nuclear strategic force is assigned to NATO. Within the Alliance
Britain has played an active part in the discussions designed to associate the
non-nuclear members of NATO with the Alliance’s nuclear planning. Political
guidelines for the defensive use of tactical nuclear weapons have been approved,
and procedures for consultation on the possible use of nuclear weapons have
been refined.

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The European theatre ground forces consist of the BAOR, an independent
brigade in West Berlin, and the forces stationed in Britain, the main elements
of which have primary roles in support of NATO (see p. 114). Their cost in
1972-73 is estimated at £412 million. Armoured regiments have completed
re-equipment with the Chieftain main battle tank, which incorporates new
features in protection and mobility and mounts the fully stabilised 120 mm gun,
and with the Szvingfire anti-tank guided missiles on a version of the armoured
personnel carrier. A new family of lightweight armoured combat reconnais¬
sance vehicles is under development, and the first of these, Scorpion, is entering
service. The field artillery has been re-equipped; its weapons now include a
new British 105 mm light gun, the British Abbot self-propelled 105 mm gun,
and the American self-propelled 155 mm and 175 mm guns; the issue of the
new Field Artillery Computer Equipment (FACE) gives improved accuracy
and response times, as will the Cymbeline lightweight mortar-locating radar.
Surface-to-surface tactical nuclear support is provided by the Honest John
free-flight missile and the 8 in. (203 mm) howitzer. Infantry units are highly
mobile with tracked armoured personnel carriers (FV 432), some of which are
modified to carry the 81 mm mortar or the Wombat 122 mm anti-tank gun,
and the Stalwart high mobility cross-country load-carrying vehicle. Mech¬
anised infantry battalions have been equipped with a new 66 mm anti-tank
rocket. Surveillance and target acquisition capability has been improved by a
new drone (unmanned reconnaissance aircraft) and by the issue of ground sur¬
veillance radar and additional night-fighting devices. For chemical defence an
improved range of clothing is being issued. Air defence is provided by Thunder-
bird and Rapier anti-aircraft guided missiles; both systems are fully mobile.
Other Army combat forces consist of the ground forces deployed^ outside
Europe to meet Commonwealth and treaty commitments. Their cost in I972-
73 is estimated at £52 million. Equipment is in general similar to that of the
European theatre ground forces. The force of helicopters is being increased
and will be equipped with the Anglo-French Gazelle and Lynx. Canadian
Beaver light aircraft are used for liaison purposes. The Landing Ship Tank
(LST), for support operations, has been superseded by the faster and more
advanced Landing Ship Logistic (LSL). Winchester SRN6 hovercraft are
operated by the Royal Corps of Transport.
The naval general purpose combat forces comprise amphibious and naval air
forces, submarines (excluding the Polaris force), helicopter-cruisers, destroyers,
frigates, and mine countermeasure forces; and support and other ships. Any
of these ships can be sent to other theatres if needed in an emergency, either
as reinforcements or to carry out joint operations with the Army and Royal
Air Force. Their cost in 1972-73 is estimated at £330 million.
The aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal will operate until the late 1970s. HMS
Eagle and Hermes have been phased out of the fixed-wing-flymg role; Hermes
is undergoing conversion to the commando ship role, to replace eventually
HMS Albion. HMS Ark Royal operates Buccaneer and Phantom aircraft.
The Buccaneer Mk2 is a long-range, low-level strike aircraft, its equipment
including the Bullpup air-to-surface missile; the Phantom is equipped with
Sparrow and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles in the air defence role. Gannet
aircraft provide airborne early warning.
Amphibious forces are provided by the commando ships HMS Albion and
Bulwark, with Royal Marine Commandos, helicopters and landing-cralt and
the assault ships HMS Fearless and Intrepid, both of which have been fitted
DEFENCE

with a communications satellite terminal, working through the Skynet system.
The command-helicopter-cruisers HMS Blake and Tiger are equipped with
Sea King anti-submarine helicopters. The County class series of eight
guided missile destroyers is completed; they are equipped with Seaslug and
Seacat ship-to-air guided missiles (both of which have a capability against
surface targets), an anti-submarine helicopter and underwater detection
equipment, and four 4-5 in. (i 15 mm) fully automatic quick-firing guns with
appropriate control equipment. The 26 Leander class general purpose frigates
are equipped with advanced anti-submarine equipment, including sonar and
mortars. They and the Tribal class carry Wasp anti-submarine helicopters and
Seacat anti-aircraft guided missiles. Some 23 anti-submarine frigates are
operational. Most ships of frigate size and above carry helicopters; the Sea
King is deployed on major fleet units; the Lynx will replace the Wasp in the
mid-seventies. These helicopters have an anti-submarine role and a capability
against surface vessels. The strike capability of surface ships will be improved
by the introduction of the French Exocet, a surface-to-surface guided missile
system.
Three classes of advanced surface ships will be introduced during the
seventies. Eight of the new Amazon class frigates (Type 21), to be equipped
eventually with the Seawolf surface-to-air missile system, are under con¬
struction, and seven of the new destroyers (Type 42) to carry the Seadart
surface-to-air missile (with a surface-to-surface capability) are under con¬
struction. HMS Bristol, the new Type 82 guided missile destroyer, with Sea-
dart and Ikara, an anti-submarine missile, is entering service. Some of the
Leandei class frigates are being equipped with Ikara. A new type of cruiser,
to carry helicopters, with a ‘through-deck’ design giving the option of operat¬
ing V/STOL aircraft, is being designed; it too will be armed with Seadart.
A new general purpose frigate is also being designed.
Seven nuclear fleet submarines (hunter-killer) are now in service—Dread¬
nought, Valiant, War spite, Churchill, Conqueror, Courageous and Swiftsure;
three more are under construction, and an eleventh has been ordered. A force
of 24 conventional patrol submarines is also in service. Studies are in hand
for submarine-launched anti-ship missile systems.
Maintenance and repair facilities are provided by a submarine depot ship,
and a mine countermeasure support ship manned by naval personnel. Ships
of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service provide afloat logistic support such as
fuel, food, ammunition, stores and spare gear. These ships fly the Blue Ensign
and are manned by civilian personnel. The dockyards at Portsmouth, Devon-
port, Chatham and Rosyth provide the Navy with major repair and supply
facilities in Britain.
Royal Air Force The Royal Air Force general purpose combat forces comprise all front line
General formations and units except those designated Air Mobility Forces (transport
Purpose and tanker forces). They fall into the following categories: air defence; strike/
Combat Forces attack; reconnaissance; close support and tactical reconnaissance; maritime
patrol and anti-submarine warfare; and RAF Regiment field squadrons. Their
cost in 1972-73 is estimated at £410 million.
Equipment Interceptor squadrons are equipped with Lightning, which is supersonic and
can carry Firestreak or Red Top air-to-air missiles, and Phantom FGi aircraft
equipped with Sparrow and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. Bloodhound and
Tiger cat surface-to-air missiles and light anti-aircraft guns are also available
for air defence. Work continues on the centralised data handling facilities for
the Linesman/Mediator control and reporting system for air defence and air
Il8 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
traffic control. The Ballistic Missile Early Warning Station at Fylingdales
would provide warning of a missile attack on Britain; it also detects, tracks
and identifies objects in orbit.
Vulcans, Buccaneers and Phantom FGRas operate in the strike/attack role;
Victors, Canberras and Phantom FGR.2S in the reconnaissance role; Harriers
in the close support and tactical reconnaissance role; and Nimrods in maritime
patrol and anti-submarine warfare. RAF Buccaneers and Phantom FGis also
provide maritime strike and air defence; a number of Shackletons have been
converted to provide airborne early warning over the sea. The Jaguar aircraft
will enter service in the close support and reconnaissance roles.
Air mobility forces are made up of the strategic and tactical transport forces,
tanker aircraft to refuel combat aircraft in flight, support helicopters and
communications aircraft. Their cost in 1972-73, together with that of associ¬
ated stations and other support, is estimated at £114 million.
The strategic transport force is equipped with Comet 4C, Britannia, Belfast and
VC10 aircraft. Tactical transport support over medium ranges is provided by
the Hercules (which also has a strategic capability), while for short-range tasks
the Wessex and Puma helicopters and the Andover aircraft are available. A
force of Victor tanker aircraft provides in-flight refuelling, which gives added
range and flexibility to the operations of air defence, maritime strike and
other aircraft.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Responsibility for the procurement (that is, research, development and
production) of defence equipment, including aircraft, ships, ordnance, guided
weapons and electronics, lies with the Procurement Executive within the
Ministry of Defence. The Executive was set up in August 1971 following a
reorganisation of the government departments responsible for defence
procurement and civil aerospace. It combines the defence procurement
responsibilities until then carried out by the Ministry of Defence and the
former Ministry of Aviation Supply (an interim department which took over
the defence and civil aerospace role of the former Ministry of Technology in
late 1970).
Under the Chief Executive there are four systems controllers responsible
for development and production, one in each of the main areas (land, sea and
air systems and guided weapons). There are three additional controllers for
policy, personnel and research. The Head of Defence Sales also reports to the
Chief Executive on certain aspects of his work, while on the remainder he
reports to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State.
Research The 1972-73 estimate for research and development was £330 million. The
and Development major part of the research is undertaken by the Ministry of Defence’s research
and development establishments, but the Ministry also sponsors a sub¬
stantial amount of research by industry and the universities. The research and
development establishments have a very wide technological capability, which
has civil as well as military applications: for example, support is given to civil
aerospace projects such as Concorde and advanced aeroengines. On the
development side, the establishments collaborate closely with the Ministry’s
contractors by monitoring their progress, assisting in testing programmes, and
in solving particular technical problems.
The development programme can be divided into those projects on which

Britain is collaborating with its allies, and those which are being developed
on a national basis. To maintain a sound industrial base for defence procure¬
ment in this country, close consultation is maintained between government
and industry both in the National Defence Industries Council and through
other specialised machinery. However, the complexity of modern defence
equipment and the high initial investment required means that in certain cases
a more practical solution is to share the cost of development by collaboration
with allies or, if need be, to undertake a direct purchase of an existing foreign
military equipment or system without further development.
Collaboration between Britain and her allies, particularly in Europe, continues
to grow in importance. The Multi-Role Combat Aircraft, being developed in
co-operation with Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany, remains the
most important single project in the programme. Collaboration with France
on the Jaguar combat aircraft, the Martel air-to-surface missile and three
helicopters, the Lynx, Gazelle and Puma, is at an advanced stage. Germany and
Italy are collaborating with Britain in the joint development and production
of two major artillery systems: a 155 mm towed medium gun and a self-
propelled 155 mm howitzer. In 1970 Belgium became a partner in the pro¬
gramme for the development and production of the family of air-portable,
tracked, aluminium armoured combat reconnaissance vehicles.
A considerable number of projects are being developed by industry and the
Ministry of Defence. They include the following major projects: aircraft
(HS 1182—a new advanced jet trainer, and Jetstream—a multi-engined pilot
trainer); guided weapons (Seawolf and Seadart—ship-to-air short- and
medium-range missiles, Rapier—an air-portable surface-to-air missile for the
Army and Air Force, Swingfire—a long-range anti-tank missile, and Blowpipe
—a man-portable air defence missile); electronics (Clansman—a net radio
communications system, Linesman/Mediator—a control and reporting system
for air defence and air traffic control, new aircraft search radars, and defence
communications satellites); ships and naval weapons (Type 22 frigate, Type
42 destroyer, nuclear and gas turbine propulsion systems, anti-submarine
torpedoes, and new sonar systems); ordnance and military vehicles (amphi¬
bious combat engineer tractor, and wheeled, air-portable, aluminium armoured
vehicles).
Following the development of defence equipment, either nationally or in
co-operation with allies, production is usually undertaken by private industry
on a contract basis or by the ordnance factories and naval dockyards. Produc¬
tion may also be taken on a collaborative basis. The Defence Sales Organisa¬
tion helps British firms to secure overseas orders, and promotes sales of
products of the ordnance factories. In 1972-73 the total value of exports of
British defence equipment was estimated at some £345 million.
In addition to research and development, there is support of a general nature
supplied in Britain to the Services as a whole. The major items include:
general training; the overhead costs of naval dockyards, ordnance factories
and repair, maintenance and storage units; Ministry of Defence and local
administrative services in Britain; and military pensions. Work continues to
rationalise and reorganise these support services. The total estimated cost for
1972-73 is £1,097 million.

5 SOCIAL WELFARE
Voluntary
Organisations
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain central and local government are responsible for a wide range of
health and social services. Central government is responsible directly for the
hospital service of the National Health Service and for social security, includ¬
ing family allowances, national insurance and financial help to those in special
need, and has a supervisory responsibility for the rest of the National Health
Service and many local authority services. Local authorities are directly
responsible for public health and for a variety of personal health and social
services for children and mothers, the chronic sick and handicapped (physically
or mentally), the elderly and the homeless (all described in this chapter); and
for education (see Chapter 6) and housing (see Chapter 8). Public authorities
in Britain are spending about £ 12,000 million a year on this range of services,
that is, over £200 a year per head of the population.
The publicly provided services are supplemented by those provided by
voluntary organisations and by individual voluntary workers. Voluntary
organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of nearly all the
social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries, and
social and recreational clubs before these were provided by the State. They
made themselves responsible for the welfare of the very young and the very
old, the homeless and the handicapped. Gradually the State accepted the
primary responsibility for the major services, supplementing the voluntary
services and developing a comprehensive structure that ensured a minimum
standard of living and well-being for all citizens.
State and voluntary social services are now complementary and co-operative.
Both central and local authorities make grants to the voluntary social services.
The officers of central and local government plan and carry out their duties
taking account of the voluntary help available and co-operating with the
voluntary agencies, which have specialised in meeting particular needs, while
the residential provision made by central and local authorities for the care of
children, the chronic sick, the mentally disordered, the disabled and the aged
is supplemented by voluntary homes of various types.
The Charity Commission, a government department, gives free advice to
trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their purposes or facilitate
their administration when necessary; it maintains central and local registers
of charities which are open to public inspection; and it works to promote co¬
operation between charities and State services.
In 1972 the Home Office took on the responsibility for the co-ordination of
government interests in voluntary social service.
The number of voluntary organisations in Britain runs into thousands, they
range from national organisations to small individual local groups. Most
organisations, however, are members of larger associations or are represented
on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees. Some are chiefly
concerned with giving personal service, others in the formation of public
opinion and exchange of information. A number are concerned with giving
help to immigrants.
SOCIAL WELFARE
123
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems include the
voluntary family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Association,
Family Service Units, and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage
Guidance Council; the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her
Child; and the Samaritans, who help people near to committing suicide.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people, particularly
those belonging to a number of national and local organisations, for example,
the Young Volunteer Force Foundation, Community Service Volunteers,
Task Force, Scouts, Girl Guides and school groups.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by—among
others—the British Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance Association
and Brigade, the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service and the Leagues of
Hospital Friends, but an increasing number of societies exist to help people
with particular disabilities and difficulties. Such societies, most of which are
constituent members of the Central Council for the Disabled, include the
Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal National Institute for the
Deaf, the National Association for Mental Health, the National Society for
Mentally Handicapped Children, the Spastics Society, Alcoholics Anonymous,
Narcotics Anonymous and their Scottish equivalents.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Com¬
mittee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England
Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work, the
Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian Associa¬
tion, the Society of Friends, the Crusade of Rescue, the Society of St. Vincent
de Paul, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish Welfare
Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which gives help in every kind of practical difficulty, brings
‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, provides flatlets
and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with family problems and assists in
hospitals and clinics, as well as doing relief work in emergencies.
The main voluntary body in England and Wales providing central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies concerned with social
service is the National Council of Social Service, which brings together most
of the principal voluntary agencies for consultation and joint action, either as a
whole or in groups of those concerned with particular aspects, such as youth
work or work among the handicapped. There are also the Scottish Council of
Social Service and the Northern Ireland Council of Social Service, which
perform similar functions. The Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of which there are
now some 540 in Britain, are steadily increasing in number. The primary role
of the bureaux is to give explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt
about his rights or who does not know about the State or voluntary services
which could help him.
Urban
Programme
A four-year urban programme providing for government-aided local authority
expenditure of some £20 million-^25 million was launched at the end of 1968
to assist areas of special social need, in particular to relieve problems resulting
from overcrowding, inadequate housing and schools, and other forms of
deprivation. In 1970 the programme was extended to 1976 with total expendi¬
ture for the period 1968-76 of £60 million-^65 million. Projects being under¬
taken include help for playgroups and the provision and improvement of
124
Reciprocity
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
nursery schools and classes, day nurseries and playgrounds, language classes
for immigrants, in-service training courses for teachers, children’s homes,
family advice centres, housing aid services, family planning clinics, help for
community centres and summer holiday schemes for deprived children. A
particular aim of the programme is to support the work of voluntary bodies.
An experiment in community development is also being undertaken by the
Government. This involves bringing together those services, both statutory
and voluntary, which are concerned with relieving various forms of social
handicap and encouraging the resources of self-help within the community.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries insurance, family allowances, family
income supplements and supplementary benefits together with (in a special
category) war pensions constitute a comprehensive system of social security in
the United Kingdom.
The Department of Health and Social Security administers these services
in Great Britain; within the Department the Supplementary Benefits Com¬
mission is responsible for the system of supplementary benefits. In Northern
Ireland the first five of these schemes are administered by the Ministry of
Health and Social Services which contains the Supplementary Benefits Com¬
mission for Northern Ireland. Pensions and welfare services for war pensioners
and their dependants are the responsibility of the Department of Health and
Social Security throughout the United Kingdom. Appeals relating to claims
for the various benefits are decided by independent authorities.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain
can be traced back for several centuries (the Poor Relief Act of 1601 may
be regarded as specially important in England and Wales), the modern system
of comprehensive provision is a creation of the twentieth century. Non¬
contributory old age pensions were introduced in 1908, and the first con¬
tributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans in 1926. A contributory
National Health Insurance Scheme was begun in 1912, and in the same year
a scheme of unemployment insurance was introduced which in 1920 was
extended to cover the great majority of employees. By the beginning of the
second world war social security provision in Britain was among the best in
the world, but lacked co-ordination because of its piecemeal development, and
not everyone came within its scope. In the immediate post-war years a series
of Acts introduced the present comprehensive system, which became fully
operative in July 1948. Statutory provision for the war disabled goes back to
the end of the sixteenth century, but the main lines of the present war pension
provisions were laid down during the first world war with further develop¬
ments during and after the second world war.
Family allowances and national insurance and industrial injuries benefits
or allowances, other than maternity, unemployment, sickness, invalidity,
injury or disablement benefit, are included in the taxable income on which
income tax is assessed. On the other hand, various income tax reliefs and
exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the support of
dependants. Family income supplements, attendance allowance and war dis¬
ablement pensions are not taxable.
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate as a
single system. Reciprocal agreements on industrial injuries, family allowances

and most national insurance benefits are in operation with Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Jersey and Guernsey,
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. Agreements with Cyprus,
France, the Republic of Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the
Netherlands and Turkey cover industrial injuries and most national insurance
benefits. With Australia and New Zealand there are agreements on family
allowances and most national insurance benefits. There are limited agree¬
ments with Bermuda, Canada and the United States. Northern Ireland and
the Isle of Man are also party to most of these agreements with other countries.
Family allowances are provided in Great Britain under the Family Allowances
Act 1965 (which consolidated the Acts of 1945-64), and in Northern Ireland
under its own legislation. They are being paid in Great Britain to about 4-3
million families with over n-2 million children, and in Northern Ireland to
some 137,000 families. The allowances are payable to families with two or
more children who are under minimum school-leaving age or under 19 and
either in full-time education or apprentices with low earnings.
The rates of the allowances are £o-go a week for families with two children
below the age limits and a further ^1 a week for each additional child.
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to benefit
the family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid either to
the mother or to the father. There is no insurance qualification for title to the
allowances, but there are certain residence conditions.
Family Income Supplement is designed to help families (and single people)
with small incomes where the wage-earner is in full-time work and there is at
least one dependent child. It is payable when the weekly sum of a family’s
resources falls below a prescribed amount, fixed at £20 a week where there is
one child plus £2 for each additional child. The weekly rate of the supplement
is half the difference between the family’s income and the prescribed amount
up to a maximum of £5. Some 70,000 households containing about 300,000
children and including about 23,000 single people with children are receiving
benefit under this scheme.
The National Insurance Acts apply, in general, to everyone over minimum
school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar schemes in
Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. (The National Insurance Act 1965
consolidated the provisions of the National Insurance Acts 1946-64.)
The national insurance scheme provides benefits in specified contingencies
where contribution conditions have been fulfilled. The benefits are paid for
partly by insured persons’ contributions, partly by contributions of employers
in respect of their employees, and partly by a contribution made by the
Exchequer out of general taxation.
The original system was based on contributions varying only with the sex,
age (under or over 18 years), and insurance class (see p. 126), while benefits
were at standard rates for people over 18. Additional earnings-related contribu¬
tions and benefits were subsequently introduced in two stages (1961 and 1966).
In November 1970 pensions were introduced for elderly people who had
been over pension age when the scheme started, and in April 1971 for widows
aged between 40 and 50 when widowed or when entitlement to widowed
mother’s allowance ended. From September 1971 an old person’s pension
became payable to all other non-pensioners aged 80 and over; at the same time
an invalidity pension was introduced for anyone who had received sickness

benefit for six months, with an additional invalidity allowance for people
becoming chronically sick more than five years before retirement age. An
attendance allowance for severely disabled people needing attendance or
supervision both night and day became payable in December 1971. Over the
next two years an allowance at a lower rate will be extended to those needing
attention or supervision either night or day.
Under government proposals published in September 1971 and aimed to be
introduced in 1975 everyone would have two pensions—a basic pension from
the government and an earnings-related pension from his job.
Contributors under the national insurance scheme are divided into three
classes:
Class 1. Employed people. Most of those who work for an employer under a
contract of service or are paid apprentices—over 23 million.
Class 2. Self-employed people. Those in business on their own account and
others who are working for gain but do not work under the control of an
employer—about million.
Class 3. Non-employed people. All those insured who are not in class 1 or
class 2—about a quarter of a million.
There is a general liability to pay flat-rate contributions according to this
classification but certain people are excepted. These include full-time students,
prisoners and most people in receipt of national insurance benefits. Self-
employed and non-employed persons whose income is below £469 a year can
apply for exception. Married women can choose to pay contributions and
receive benefit in their own right or not to pay flat-rate contributions (if they
are working they must pay graduated contributions) and rely upon their
husband’s insurance for maternity grant, retirement pension (at a lower rate),
widow’s benefit and death grant. If a married woman works for an employer
he must pay his full share of the flat-rate contributions even if she has chosen
not to pay flat-rate contributions.
Flat-rate contributions are credited to students up to the age of 18, and
to most people in receipt of national insurance benefits. People who are
excepted from liability to pay but are not entitled to credits may pay con¬
tributions at the non-employed rate if they wish to safeguard entitlement to
retirement pension and widow’s benefit.
An employed person ceases to be liable for national insurance contributions
at the age of 70 (for a man, 65 for a woman), or when he retires from regular
employment after reaching minimum pension age (65 for men, 60 for women),
whichever is the earlier. If he does any work as an employed person thereafter,
he must pay an industrial injuries contribution; the employer still has to pay
his full share of the flat-rate contribution.
Flat-rate contributions are normally paid by means of national insurance
stamps bought from a post office and fixed, for each contributor, to a single
contribution card. All three classes pay flat-rate contributions (see Table 9).
The stamps for class 1 contributors also include the employer s redundancy
contribution (to help to provide for payments in certain circumstances to
employees whose work is terminated, see p. 374) and the selective employ¬
ment tax paid by employers (see p. 210); and for all contributors the national
health service contribution (which for convenience is paid with the national
insurance contribution although the two services are separate). It is the
employer’s responsibility in the first place to see that the class 1 contributions
are paid, but he can deduct the employees’ share from their wages. The self-
SOCIAL WELFARE
127
employed and non-employed must stamp their own cards. Flat-rate contribu¬
tions are usually credited for weeks of unemployment, sickness or injury, or if
certain widow’s benefits are being paid.

women.   . .
6 Including, for class 1, the industrial injuries insurance contribution of £0-05 from
employee and £0-07 from employer.
In general graduated contributions are payable by employed people (in¬
cluding married women but not retirement pensioners) aged between 18 and
70 (65 for women) who earn more than ^9 a week. The range of graduated
contributions is given in Table 9. Employees whose job provides them with
an occupational pension of at least £3'48 a year for each year of service (^2-90
for women) may be ‘contracted out’ of part of the graduated pension scheme.
Contracted out employees pay graduated contributions at the rate of 0*5 per
cent of that part of their weekly pay lying between £9 and ^18 and 4-75
per cent on earnings between ,£18 and ^48 > their employers pay the same
amount. Employees who are not contracted out pay graduated contributions
at the rate of 4-75 per cent of the part of their weekly earnings between £9 and
^48. Their employers pay the same amount.
Graduated contributions provide a graduated addition to retirement pension
and meet the cost of earnings-related supplements to sickness and unemploy¬
ment benefit and to widow’s allowance. The contributions are collected
through the same machinery as is used to collect pay-as-you-earn (deduction
at source) income tax.
128
Benefits
Amounts
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The scheme provides payments to contributors in the event of unemployment
(if normally working for an employer), incapacity for work and invalidity (if
normally working for an employer or self-employed), and confinement and the
weeks immediately before and after (for women normally working for an
employer or self-employed and paying national insurance contributions at the
full rate). Retirement pensions are paid to people who have reached 65 (60 for
women) if they have retired from regular work and from the age of 70 (65 for
women) even if they continue to work; people aged 80 and over who have not
participated in the scheme are eligible for an old person’s pension; widows
normally receive benefit in the first 26 weeks after bereavement and sub¬
sequently while they have young children or if they have reached the age of
40 when widowed or before their children have grown up; and there are two
kinds of allowance in respect of orphan children where a widow’s pension is
not payable. The scheme also provides lump-sum cash grants for two expen¬
sive contingencies—the birth of a child and a death.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before
benefit can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must actually
have been paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless a specified number of contributions have been paid or
credited over a specified period. There are special rules to help a widow who
does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood or when her
children have grown up, to qualify for sickness or unemployment benefit in
the period before she can have established or re-established herself in insur¬
ance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to help a
divorced woman who was not paying contributions during her marriage.
The basic amount of the majority of flat-rate benefits is £6-75 a week which
may be reduced if insufficient contributions have been paid, but is not affected
by other unearned income or the previous level of earnings. Earnings received
while the benefit is in payment, however, may cause its reduction or with¬
drawal : unemployment benefit cannot be paid to a person earning more than
a specified amount from a subsidiary occupation; retirement pensioners under
the age of 70 (65 for women) have their pensions reduced in step with earnings
over certain specified amounts; sickness and invalidity benefits, though not
affected by continued payment of wages during illness, are not normally
payable to a person doing any actual work. Widows’ benefits, however, are not
affected by earnings. Exceptions to the basic flat rate are the higher rate of
£9-45 a week payable to widows during the first 26 weeks after bereavement,
the increased retirement pension earned by someone who has continued at
work and paid contributions beyond minimum pension age and the invalidity
allowance paid to people becoming chronically sick more than five years before
pension age; and the lower rate of £4*75 a week unemployment or sickness
benefit payable to married women who pay contributions and the rates for
widows between 40 and 50 which reduce on a scale to £2*03 a week for a
woman aged 40 at the date of entitlement. The standard rate of retirement
pension for a woman on her husband’s insurance is ^4,i5 a week and the old
person’s pension is £4-05 for a single person and ^6-55 for a married couple.
An age addition of ^0-25 a week is paid to pensioners aged 80 and over.
Invalidity allowance is ^o^o, ^o*6o or £1, depending upon the age at which
incapacity begins. An attendance allowance of ^5‘4° a week is paid in respect
of people requiring a great deal of care or attention by day and night (£3'6°
a week for day or night only).
Standard increases of flat-rate benefit are payable for dependants at the rate

of £4-15 for an adult (generally a wife), £2-10 for the first or only child under
the family allowances age limits; £1-20 for the second child and -£i-io for each
other child over and above any family allowances payable (see p. 125). The
sum payable for the children of widows, invalidity and retirement pensioners
is £3-30 for each child inclusive of family allowances.
A guardian’s allowance of ^3-30 a week is payable to a person who has in
his or her family a child who has lost both parents, one of whom was insured
under the National Insurance Acts. The allowance can sometimes be paid
on the death of one parent. For certain fatherless children there is a child’s
special allowance also of £3‘3° a week inclusive of family allowances; this is
payable to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled and who
has not remarried, if her former husband dies and she has a child to whose
support he was contributing before he died.
The graduated addition to retirement pension is at the rate of £o-o2\ a
week for each £7-50 of all graduated contributions paid by a man and for each
£() of such graduated contributions paid by a woman (with in each case, the
matching amount of graduated contribution coming from the employer). The
earnings-related supplements to flat-rate unemployment and sickness benefits
are one-third of that part of a person’s average weekly earnings between £9
and £30,1 but the supplements cannot raise the total benefit, including in¬
creases for dependants, beyond 85 per cent of earnings. The supplement is
also paid to widow beneficiaries who have the appropriate record of earnings,
if they become unemployed or sick.
An earnings-related supplement is paid in addition to the widow’s allowance
to widows whose husbands were under 70 and had not retired from regular
employment; this supplement is one-third of that part of the husband’s
average weekly earnings between £9 and £30.1
The rates of grants are varied: £23 maternity grant is payable for a con¬
finement and a further £23 for each additional child born at the same con¬
finement living 12 hours after birth; and £30 death grant on the death of an
adult (less for a child, or for an adult who was within ten years of minimum
pension age when the scheme started).
In general, national insurance payments are paid as long as the situation
requiring them lasts. However, invalidity pension cannot be paid and sickness
benefit can only be paid for one year if fewer than 156 contributions have been
made (possible in three years for a contributor continuously at work) while
unemployment benefit is payable for a maximum of one year. The supple¬
ment to unemployment and sickness benefit is paid for a maximum of six
months starting from the thirteenth day of unemployment or incapacity for
work. Maternity allowance begins 11 weeks before the expected week of
confinement and ends after the sixth week following the expected week or the
actual confinement if this is later.
Similarly, a widowed mother’s allowance at the full rate ceases when her
children are no longer dependent on her, though a mother can continue to
receive £6-75 a week for herself while she has living with her a son or daughter
under 19. The widow’s pension payable to the childless widow, provided she
is 40 or over at the time of being widowed, or the similar pension payable to
the widowed mother who has reached 40 before her widowed mother’s allow¬
ance ends, normally continues until she has reached minimum pension age and
1 From May 1973 it is proposed to relate the supplement to earnings between £10 and
£42.

retired, or at most till the age of 65. On retirement she receives a pension at a
rate not lower than her widow’s pension.
The industrial injuries insurance scheme, which, in 1948, replaced the work¬
men’s compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen s Compensa¬
tion Act of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused by accidents
arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for prescribed diseases
due to the nature of employment. It covers practically everyone in class 1 of
the national insurance scheme and certain others. Like the national insurance
scheme, the industrial injuries scheme is financed partly from contributions
(see Table 9) and partly from taxation. The legal basis of the scheme is the
National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1965 which consolidated the 1946
Act and subsequent legislation. Similar cover against industrial injuries and
diseases is provided by Northern Ireland’s legislation.
Injury benefit for an adult is j£9'5° a wee^ plus ^4‘ J5 f°r an a(iu^ dependant,
f2’io for the first or only child under the family allowances age limits, fi%20
for the second child and j£i-io for each other child in addition to any family
allowance payable. It is paid when the insured person is incapable of work as
a result of an industrial accident or prescribed disease, and payment can
continue for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning on the date of the accident or
development of the disease. A person entitled to sickness benefit who draws
injury benefit instead, also receives any earnings-related supplement (see p.
129) to which he is entitled.
Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a loss
of physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the
disablement as assessed by a medical board; it varies from fii'20 for 100 per
cent disablement to £2-25 a week for 20 per cent disablement, but for disable¬
ment of less than 20 per cent a gratuity of up to £740 is normally paid.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement, at the weekly rate of £675; constant
attendance allowance of up to j£4'5° wee^y normally, or a special rate of
£675 or £9 a week in exceptionally severe cases; an allowance of £4-50
a week for exceptionally severe disablement; a special hardship allowance of
up to £4-48 for a person who is unfit to return to his regular job or to do work
of an equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowance which raises the
benefit to that for a 100 per cent assessment during hospital treatment for the
industrial disability. Increases of benefit for dependants are payable with un¬
employability supplement and hospital treatment allowance. People receiving
unemployability supplement may also receive an additional allowance similar
to invalidity allowance (see p. 128).
If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit
may be paid to the dependants.
For a widow a pension of £9’45 a wee^ payable for the first 26 weeks of
widowhood. In addition she receives any earnings-related supplement (see p.
129) that would have been paid had she claimed widow’s allowance under the
main national insurance scheme. Thereafter, the widow can receive a pension
°f £7*30 a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her husband s death, or has
dependent children or other special needs; otherwise she receives £2-03 a
week. If she had been living apart from her husband, the pension is limited to

the weekly rate of maintenance he was paying, if less than the rate otherwise
appropriate.
In addition, allowances are paid for children under the family allowances
age limits. For widows, these allowances together with any family allowance
payable amount to £3"30 a week for each child. For other beneficiaries, the
rate is £2-10 each.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be
entitled to pensions, allowances or gratuities.
The Ministry of Social Security Act 1966 provided for a scheme of supple¬
mentary benefits to replace the system which had been administered by the
former National Assistance Board since 1948. The Act established within the
then Ministry of Social Security a Supplementary Benefits Commission re¬
sponsible for guiding the scheme and for determining awards of benefit.
Parallel legislation in Northern Ireland made similar provision.
Every person in Great Britain aged 16 or over who is not in full-time work,
attending school or involved in a trade dispute and whose resources are in¬
sufficient to meet his requirements is entitled to a supplementary benefit. The
benefit takes the form of a supplementary allowance for people under the
statutory retirement age, and a supplementary pension for those over. The
benefit is the amount by which a person’s requirements exceed his available
resources, both being defined by rules laid down by the Act. The calculation
of requirements is based on different amounts for single people and family
groups (for blind people there are special higher amounts) with, in each case,
an addition for rent. For the old and most other long-term cases a special
addition is made. Available resources include certain income and capital; the
main national insurance and industrial injury benefits, family allowances and
maintenance payments from a husband or the father of the claimant’s children
are taken into account in full but some part of all other resources is disregarded.
The payment of a supplementary allowance in the case of an able-bodied
person of working age may be conditional on registering at an employment
exchange of the Department of Employment and in the case of fit people under
the age of 45 may be limited to four weeks in areas where there is plenty of
work available. The allowance is then paid at the exchange; otherwise it is paid
weekly through a post office.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence people
without a settled way of living to lead a more normal life. The Commission
provides temporary accommodation for them in 18 reception centres, four of
which are administered by local authorities on behalf of the Commission. For
men who have been unemployed for long periods and who are receiving
supplementary allowances or are using reception centres, it runs 13 re¬
establishment centres, three of which have residential accommodation where
they are given help to fit them again for work.
Pensions and allowances for people disabled or bereaved through war or
service in the Forces since the second world war are paid under Royal
Warrants and other instruments administered by the Department of Health
and Social Security.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier
is £11’20 a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the degree of
disablement. The latter is assessed by comparing the condition of the person
disabled by service with that of a normal healthy person of the same age and
sex. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones
being for unemployability (£7-35 a week), constant attendance (up to £4-50
and, exceptionally, £9 a week), comforts (£1*10 or £1-90 a week), and lowered
standard of occupation (up to £4-48 a week). An additional allowance of
^4-50 a week is payable to war pensioners who are receiving constant attend¬
ance allowance at a rate above the normal maximum. An age allowance
(between ^0-55 and -6o a week) is payable to disablement pensioners who
are aged 65 or over and whose assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary allowances are
free of income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any
family allowances payable.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate
of pension for widows of private soldiers is ^8-8o a week, with additional
allowances for their children and, in certain cases, a rent allowance (up to
£2 -40 a week). There is an additional allowance for widows aged 65 or over.
Parents or other relatives who were dependent on a person whose death
resulted from service in the Forces may receive pensions if they are in financial
need.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service
for war pensioners and war orphans which is available to help any who require
advice or assistance. War pensioners have priority for treatment of their war
disablements in National Health Service hospitals subject only to needs of
emergency and other urgent cases.
Many voluntary associations and ex-Service organisations give financial aid
and personal service to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
The Department’s welfare officers work in close co-operation with these and
other statutory bodies.
HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of
the years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second half
of the nineteenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental
or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal
of refuse and cleaning of streets, and the first half of the twentieth century
for the development of publicly provided personal health services, as distinct
from environmental services, culminating in the introduction in 1948 a
comprehensive National Health Service available to every resident. Scientific
discoveries of importance to medicine and health, including the development
of new drugs, and the improved services of the last 7° years, particularly in
maternity and child health, school health services and school meals, are
reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 10) and improved physique. The
infant mortality rate has more than halved since the National Health Service
was inaugurated; this and the maternal death rate are among the lowest in the
world. The health of children has steadily improved and emphasis is now
placed on prevention or early detection of disease or disability. Deaths from
such diseases as tuberculosis, poliomyelitis and diphtheria have fallen so
markedly that they are no longer major health problems. Diseases now in the
forefront of research programmes include cancer and diseases of the central
nervous system, such as muscular dystrophy. Efforts are also being made to
combat some of the most prevalent diseases, which include, besides the
common cold and influenza, bronchitis, rheumatism and arthritis, and heart
diseases.

SOCIAL WELFARE
The Public Health Acts of 1936 and 1961 and the Health Services and Public
Health Act 1968 constitute the present basic public health code in England and
Wales. Local authorities1 (under the general direction of the Department of
Health and Social Security or the Welsh Office and the Department of the
Environment) have extensive powers for making and administering by-laws on
matters of public health. The local authorities chiefly concerned are the
councils of counties and county boroughs, London boroughs and the City
of London, borough, urban and rural district councils and, to a limited extent,
parish councils.
Public health services in Scotland and in Northern Ireland have developed
on much the same lines as in England and Wales, although they are based on
separate Acts and there is a different allocation of services between the various
types of local authority (working under the direction of the Scottish Home and
Health Department and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and Social
Services). The Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897 and the Burgh Police
(Scotland) Act 1892 as amended by later statutes constitute the basic legisla¬
tion for Scotland. The local authorities concerned are the councils of counties
and burghs. In Northern Ireland the councils of county and non-county
boroughs and urban and rural districts are mainly responsible for administer¬
ing the Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland) 1878-1966.
The medical officers of health of local authorities are responsible for investi¬
gating outbreaks of infectious diseases and for disinfection and various other
preventive measures.
Port health authorities supervise health control at seaports and airports, the
primary object of which is to prevent the introduction of infectious disease
into the country. Control is undertaken by health authorities using the services
of medical officers, public health inspectors, rodent inspectors and others.
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by the Food and
Drugs Act 1955 in England and Wales, by the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act
1956 in Scotland and by the Food and Drugs Act (Northern Ireland) 195^
in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales the question of the composition, adulteration and
description of food are the concern of food and drugs authorities (county,
county borough, London borough and City of London councils and, geneially,
the larger borough and urban district councils) and questions of soundness,
purity and hygiene are the concern of all local authorities, except parish
councils. The Department of Health and Social Security and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central departments responsible for
giving advice and making regulations. Places where food for sale for human
consumption is prepared, sold or stored must conform to certain hygienic
standards. Authorised officers of the councils may take for analysis or for
bacteriological or other examination samples of any food for sale for human
consumption. There are special regulations for milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of
counties and large burghs.
In Northern Ireland administration is in the hands of the county and county
borough health authorities, the central department being the Ministry of
Health and Social Services.
1 From April 1974 responsibility for public health will pass from local authorities to the
area health authorities to be created to administer all health services in their areas (see

Local authorities are also responsible for the public health aspects of water
supply, sewerage and drainage; street paving and housing; and the abatement
of noise nuisance. They have power to establish smoke-controlled areas to
secure cleaner air, and to arrange with statutory water undertakings for the
addition of fluoride to water supplies to reduce dental decay.
The Acts setting up the National Health Service—the National Health Service
Act 1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 and the Health
Services Act (Northern Ireland) 1948—came into force simultaneously on 5th
July 1948.
The object of the National Health Service Act 1946 was ‘to promote the
establishment in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service
designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the
people of England and Wales and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
illness, and for that purpose to provide or secure the effective provision of
services’. The service is available to people normally resident according to
medical need, without regard to any insurance qualification. It was originally
free to users but various charges have been introduced under subsequent
legislation, though these can be waived under certain conditions.
National insurance contributors are required to pay a weekly national health
contribution (see Table 9) but contributors and non-contributors are entitled
to the same full range of services. Visitors from other countries who come to
Britain specifically for treatment are expected to pay for it, but treatment can
be given under the emergency provisions of the National Health Service to any
who fall ill or meet with an accident during a visit to Britain. Reciprocal health
agreements have been concluded between Britain and certain countries.
The general form of the organisation established in 1948 to administer the
National Health Service has persisted ever since. Essentially it has been a
tripartite structure, corresponding to the three main parts of the service: the
hospitals service, the general practitioner service and the local health authority
services, comprising a range of home and clinic services for prevention of ill
health and for treatment or care. A new and functionally unified National
Health Service administration on a country and area basis is, however, to
come into operation from April 1974 at the same time as the proposed new
structure of local government (see p. 74). So far the proposals for administra¬
tive reform have been embodied in legislation only for Scotland, but reports
have been published outlining the Government’s policies for reorganisation in
England and Wales (see Bibliography p. 473).
In the meantime the National Health Service in Great Britain continues to
be organised as follows:
1. The hospital and specialist services for which the Secretary of State for
Social Services, the Secretary of State for Wales, and the Secretary of State
for Scotland are directly responsible. These are administered by 20 regional
hospital boards and some 450 hospital management committees, or in the
case of teaching hospitals in Scotland, boards of governors.
2. The general practitioner services consist of the family doctor service, the
dental service, the pharmaceutical service and the ophthalmic service. They
are administered by 159 local executive councils on which doctors, dentists,
pharmacists, ophthalmic medical practitioners and opticians are represented.
The health ministers have indirect overall responsibility for the services.

In addition, the Secretary of State for Social Services has power to conduct,
or assist others to conduct, research work and he provides a public health
laboratory service and a blood transfusion service. He is advised by the Central
Health Services Council, by standing advisory committees on various aspects
of the service and by the Hospital Advisory Service, set up in 1969, on hospital
problems, in particular those of ‘long stay’ hospitals.
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the health ministers
in England and Wales but it is their responsibility to provide hospital clinical
facilities for the training of medical students. The universities are responsible
for the provision of teaching.
The Secretary of State for Scotland has similar duties.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 142.
The basis of the proposed reorganisation of the National Health Service for
England and Wales and Scotland will be the establishment of area health
authorities responsible for all health services in their area, including the public
health services and the school health service. These area authorities will in
general cover the same areas as the new major local authorities (see p. 74),
but will be quite independent of them, though they will co-operate on many
matters. Areas will be divided into districts, each with a district general
hospital serving a district population usually of between 200,000 and 500,000
people. In Scotland and Wales the area authorities will report directly to the
Scottish and Welsh Offices respectively, but in England, because of its
greater size, there will be an intermediate tier of regional authorities between
the area authorities and the Department of Health and Social Security.
The authorities, both area and regional, will consist mainly of unpaid part-
time members, appointed in the case of regional authorities by the health
minister concerned (the Secretary of State for Social Services), but in the case
of area authorities also by local authorities and universities.
A popular influence in the reorganised service is to be provided by district
community health councils and by the appointment, as a channel for com¬
plaints, of a health service commissioner or ombudsman with duties similar,
within the specialised area of health, to those of the existing Parliamentary
Commissioner (see p. 41). District community health councils are to consist
of 20-30 members, half of them appointed by local government district
councils and the rest mainly on the nomination of voluntary bodies.
Expenditure on the health services in Britain was estimated at £2,443 million
in 1971-72. The greater part of the cost falls on the Exchequer and is met from
general taxation, and a part is met from local rates. Other income is derived
from the national health service contribution paid with the national insurance
contribution and from charges paid by people using certain services.
There are charges for prescriptions (except for children, expectant and
nursing mothers, people aged 65 and over, patients suffering from certain
medical conditions, war and Service pensioners, and families in receipt of
supplementary benefits and family income supplement), for treatment in the
dental service (but not for examination only or for treatment given to people
under 21 years or to nursing or expectant mothers), for dentures (except for
children under 16 or still at school, and expectant and nursing mothers), for
spectacles (except children’s standard spectacles) and for certain other articles
and for some local authority services (see p. 139). Certain exemptions or
refunds are made and anyone may apply to the Supplementary Benefits
Commission for help in meeting any of these charges. A limited number of beds

may be made available for hospital patients wishing for privacy, provided that
this accommodation is not needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients;
a charge for part of the cost of the accommodation is made. Provision is also
made at certain hospitals for patients to be treated as private patients on pay¬
ment of the whole cost of their accommodation and treatment. Such patients
may make private arrangements for treatment by doctors of their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-
time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept
private patients. General medical practitioners in the National Health Service
are paid according to the amount of work and responsibility they undertake;
certain practice expenses are also directly reimbursed.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions they
dispense. Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians taking
part in the general ophthalmic service are paid approved fees for each sight
test made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number
and type of pairs supplied.
The general practitioner services cover the medical attention given to in¬
dividuals by doctors and dentists of their own choice from among those
taking part in the service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own
surgeries; practice in health centres established under the National Health
Service Acts is increasing. About 98 per cent of the 25,000 general medical
practitioners (principals and assistants) in Great Britain take some part in the
service, more than 75 per cent of them in partnership or group practice. The
attachment of local authority midwives, health visitors and home nurses to
doctors’ practices is becoming more widespread.
Doctors wishing to enter practice have to apply through the executive
council for the area to the IVledical Practices Committee, so that a balanced
distribution of doctors throughout the country may be facilitated. The maxi¬
mum number of patients’ names permitted to be on a family doctor’s list is
normally 3,500; the average number in Great Britain is about 2,400. It is
normally through the patient’s own doctor that access to most other parts of
the health service is obtained.
There are about 11,000 dentists in England and Wales and some 1,000 in
Scotland in the general dental service.
Some 900 ophthalmic medical practitioners and over 6,000 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians in England and Wales, and about 7° ophthalmic
medical practitioners and about 650 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in
Scotland are engaged in the general ophthalmic service. These services provide
for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Patients requiring treatment
are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
There are about 12,300 retail pharmacies under contract to the National
Health Service in Great Britain. They are responsible for the dispensing of all
prescriptions except for the small number dispensed by certain general
practitioners and hospital pharmacies.
The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all
kinds, including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic
facilities for in-patients, day-patients and out-patients, hospital maternity
departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric and geriatric facilities,
Hospitals
Rehabilitation

rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all forms of specialised treat¬
ment.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built
in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’ and St. Bartholomew’s Hospitals
in London. Much has been done in recent years to improve and extend existing
hospitals, some of which are housed in inconvenient buildings, and a number
of new hospitals have been built. In 1962 long-term plans for hospital building
were published by the Government and a revision made in 1966 set out the
probable future pattern of the hospital service and contained assessments of
the work to be undertaken in the ten years ahead. These plans were revised
upwards in 1972 and it is intended to spend £800 million on hospital building
in England in 1971-72 to 1975-76 compared with £550 million in the previous
five years.
Nearly 2,500 of the existing hospitals in the National Health Service are in
England and Wales, including the 25 teaching hospitals in London (actually
groups of hospitals, convalescent homes, branches, annexes, or treatment
centres, numbering over 100 altogether) and the 8 teaching hospitals else¬
where in England and Wales (comprising some 50 hospitals and other
establishments). They have 450,000 beds available for use and a nursing and
midwifery staff of some 195,000 full-time and about 110,000 part-time. There
are 368 hospitals in Scotland with over 65,000 beds and nearly 30,000 full-time
and over 16,000 part-time nurses and midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons.
Most of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and Jewish
Hospitals, were set up to serve a special group of patients; others are maintained
for the chronic sick or for convalescents by charitable organisations. There are
also private nursing homes which must be registered.
Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care and today treatment is
not limited to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions but aims at
helping people to resume normal living as soon as possible. Medical rehabilita¬
tion has been applied with advantage in the care of many patients, including
the chronic sick, the mentally disabled, the aged and the handicapped and has
enabled many patients to become self-sufficient and to resume an independent
life in their own homes. Specialised medical rehabilitation facilities are pro¬
vided in the majority of hospitals and at medical rehabilitation centres. The
work is carried out under the supervision of the appropriate medical specialist
by physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational therapists and social
workers acting as a team. The hospital departments work closely with the Dis¬
ablement Resettlement Service of the Department of Employment. Reports
published in 1972 by sub-committees of the Standing Medical Advisory
Committees of the Central and Scottish Health Services Councils called for
improved co-ordination and development of medical rehabilitation services.
Medical rehabilitation includes the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, invalid chairs, certain types of
invalid vehicles, and other appliances. Nursing aids for the handicapped at
home can be borrowed through the service.
Social workers are available in most hospitals to help those patients who have
difficulties connected with their illness. They help to solve social and emotional
problems and are concerned with the rehabilitation and resettlement of
patients especially where the illness has been long or where the disability
results in changes in the patient’s life.

Drug Dependence The hospital service plays a major part in the treatment of drug dependence,
providing treatment for both in-patients and out-patients either in specialised
drug dependence units or as part of the general psychiatric service. Only
doctors licensed for the purpose by the Home Secretary may prescribe heroin
and cocaine to addicts in the treatment of addiction and all medical practi¬
tioners are required to notify the Chief Medical Officer of the Home Office of
any person they consider to be addicted to dangerous drugs.
Abortion The Abortion Act 1967, which came into force in Great Britain in 1968
permits the termination of a pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner if
two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion that its continuance
would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical
or mental health of the pregnant woman or of any children in her family
greater than if the pregnancy were terminated, or if there is a substantial risk
that if a child were born it would be seriously physically or mentally handi¬
capped. An abortion may be carried out in National Health Service hospitals
or in premises approved for the purpose by the Secretary of State concerned.
Blood Transfusion The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is administered
by the regional hospital boards under the National Health Service. Donors
give their blood voluntarily without payment. There are two central labora¬
tories administered by the Medical Research Council on behalf of the Depart¬
ment of Health and Social Security: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory,
which prepares grouping serum and investigates blood grouping problems
referred to it, and the Blood Products Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma
and plasma fractions. In Scotland the Blood Transfusion Service is under the
direction of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Association, which is an
independent voluntary body but is supported in the main by a grant from the
Scottish Home and Health Department. In Northern Ireland the Blood
Transfusion Service is operated by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.
Chest Radiological A Chest Radiological Service, which is freely available, is provided by chest
Service clinics and the radiological departments of general hospitals. The success ot
mass radiography units has been such that their work is being phased into the
hospital radiography service. Mobile X-ray units are still used among especially
susceptible groups.
Bacteriological and The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
Virological and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
Laboratory Services research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection
of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
In Scotland there is no separate public health laboratory service and
bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital laboratories. In Northern
Ireland a central public health laboratory shares the bacteriological work with
hospital laboratories.
Safety of Medicines Under the Medicines Act 1968 the health and agriculture ministers are respon¬
sible for licensing the marketing, importation and manufacture of medicines
for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission has been estab¬
lished as an advisory body to the ministers on policy regarding medicines and

a statutory Committee on Safety of Medicines will follow similar procedures
to those undertaken by the former Committee on Safety of Drugs in assessing
the safety, efficacy and quality of new medicines.
Local authorities play a major part in promoting the health and well-being of
people in the community by means of the services provided under the National
Health Service by local health authorities and by the personal social services
for which local authority social services departments are responsible.
Most of the needs for which the services are designed arise among four
broad groups of people: mothers and young children; the elderly; the mentally
disordered; and the physically handicapped. Other smaller groups include the
ill and convalescent at home, and the homeless. To ensure that the services
bring the maximum benefit to those who use them, local authorities work in
close co-operation with the general practitioner and hospital and specialist
branches of the National Health Service.
The authorities chiefly responsible for health and social services are the
councils of counties, county boroughs, London boroughs and the City of
London and, in Scotland, counties and large burghs. Services provided by the
local health authorities include domiciliary midwifery, health visiting, home
nursing, vaccination and immunisation and the prevention, care and after-care
of illness. The social services departments, which local authorities set up under
the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 to integrate the personal social
services, are responsible for the social well-being of young children, deprived
or delinquent children (see p. 144), the physically handicapped, the mentally
disordered, the elderly and the homeless.
In Scotland, under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, social work com¬
mittees have been set up by local authorities to integrate functions which
include welfare, probation and the care and control of children.
Charges may be made for some local authority health and social services
(for example, domestic help, supplies from family planning clinics, day
nurseries, the loan of equipment and laundering of bed linen for people being
nursed at home, and chiropody services) but arrangements are made for free
provision to people with very low incomes.
Under the National Health Service all local health authorities have planned
programmes of vaccination and immunisation against diphtheria, measles,
rubella, poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. Such pro¬
tection is usually given by the family doctor or at child health clinics.
Maternity and child health centres offer regular supervision by doctors, mid¬
wives and health visitors to expectant and nursing mothers and young children.
Special sessions are held for vaccination and inoculation and for early testing
of babies for deafness and other defects. A feature of the service is the education
of mothers before and after the birth by means of talks, discussion groups,
demonstrations and classes. Some 80 per cent of babies born in England and
Wales and some 70 per cent of those born in Scotland are taken to the centres.
Family planning clinics, often run by the Family Planning Association on
behalf of local authorities, are in operation at many maternity and child health
centres.
The expectant mother may arrange to have her baby in hospital or at home
according to the advice given by the doctor or midwife. Some 85 per cent
of confinements in England and Wales and 96 per cent in Scotland take place
in hospital. For a home confinement the services of either a general practitioner
obstetrician or her own family doctor besides those of a trained midwife and,
140
The Elderly
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
if necessary, a consultant obstetrician, are available to every mother. The mid¬
wife cares for mothers and babies (whether born at home or in hospital) in
their own homes, generally for up to 14 days after the birth. After this health
visitors visit the home to give advice to parents on the care and development
of young children and on health education in general. Most premature babies
are cared for in hospital but special arrangements for those who are fit to
remain in their own homes are made by many local health authorities who
lend equipment and appoint experienced nursing staff to supervise their care.
Domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’) is made available by local
authorities during periods of special need, for example, confinement or during
the absence of the mother when children might otherwise have to be cared for
away from home.
Some local authorities make direct provision for the special needs of un¬
married mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work done
by voluntary organisations and other bodies (see p. 142).
Under the welfare foods service free milk is available to all but the first two
children under school age in any family; to expectant mothers who already
have two children under school age; to expectant mothers and all children
under school age in families in special financial need; to certain handicapped
children; and to children attending registered day nurseries, playgroups and
child minders. Welfare foods sold by local health authorities at a special price
are dried milk, children’s vitamin A, D and C drops and, for expectant and
nursing mothers only, vitamin A, D and C tablets. These are provided free
to all beneficiaries in families with low incomes. Some authorities also provide
through clinics other proprietary foods at reduced prices.
There are about 460 day nurseries (apart from nursery schools and play¬
groups) with places for some 25,000 children under five in Great Britain
provided by local authorities or voluntary associations working with them.
Private nurseries and playgroups must be registered with the local authority
to ensure that their premises and management are satisfactory. People who
mind children (other than relatives) under five years of age in their homes for
payment must also be registered.
A number of services for elderly people in their own homes are provided by
statutory and voluntary bodies to help them to live there for as long as possible.
The services which local authorities are empowered to provide include home
nursing, domestic help, a chiropody service, sitters-in, night attendants and
laundry services as well as day centres, clubs, recreational workshops and meals
services. Health visitors and social workers employed by local authorities are
spending an increasing proportion of their time helping old people with their
problems and in many areas ‘good neighbour’ and friendly visiting services
are also arranged by the local authority or a voluntary organisation.
Local authorities also provide residential accommodation for the elderly and
infirm and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisations or
privately (see p. 142). The newer homes provided by local authorities for
elderly and other infirm people usually have accommodation for 30 to 50
residents. About 2,400 homes for elderly people are provided by local authorities
in England and Wales which house about 2 per cent of the population over 65.
For many years local authorities have, under the Housing Acts, provided an
increasing number of smaller dwellings for old people, and flatlets for frail or
infirm old people who can lead independent lives with some help. Local
authorities may contribute towards the cost of employing a warden to under¬
take welfare duties in such specially designed housing.

Health Centres
I4I
Treatment for mental disorder is provided as part of the National Health
Service. Patients can consult the family doctor, and receive specialist advice
at hospital out-patient clinics as they would for any other kind of illness, and
can enter hospital for in-patient treatment without formalities.
In England and Wales under the Mental Health Act 1959, and in Scotland
the Mental Health (Scotland) Act i960, mentally disordered patients can,
where necessary in the interests of their health or safety or for the protection
of other people, be compelled to enter hospital for treatment. There are
procedural safeguards to protect patients from unnecessary detention in
hospital; in England and Wales patients may apply to a Mental Health Review
Tribunal for discharge and in Scotland to the Mental Welfare Commission or
to the sheriff.
Local authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping the mentally
disordered in the community, and for prevention and aftercare services.
Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness, which enable patients
to be discharged from hospital more quickly provided support is available in
the community, are adding to the demands for these services. Arrangements
include training centres for the mentally handicapped, day care and occupation
centres for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and residential accommoda¬
tion for the mentally disordered of all ages. If necessary, the local authority
can place a mentally disordered person under guardianship within the com¬
munity. In Scotland education authorities share the responsibility for provid¬
ing training or occupation and in England and Wales responsibility for
mentally handicapped children is with the education departments.
Local authorities in England and Wales have a duty under the National
Assistance Act 1948 and under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act
1970 to provide social services for people who are blind, partially sighted,
deaf, hard of hearing, or otherwise substantially or permanently handicapped,
physically or mentally. They are required to secure full information on the
number of handicapped people in their area and on their needs. A wide range
of facilities with which voluntary organisations give important help is available,
including advice on occupational, social and personal problems arising from
disability; assistance in overcoming the effects of disability; help in carrying
out adaptations in the home—for example, by fitting ramps, wide doorways,
ground floor toilets, guide rails, and the provision of various aids to living to
meet individual needs, including, in certain circumstances, a telephone;
specially designed housing; the means of access to public buildings; social and
occupational centres and clubs; teaching of handicrafts and other occupations
either at home or in centres; the provision of recreational facilities, outings and
holidays. They also provide residential homes for the severely handicapped.
Help available from other sources includes financial aid, preventive and
medical treatment, special education, training for employment and placement
in suitable occupations.
(For the provision of special educational treatment for handicapped children
see p. 152, and the child health clinics and the school health service, which
keep a watch for abnormalities, pp. 139 and 151.)
There has been a marked increase of interest in health centres at which
facilities can be made available for the provision of medical, dental and
pharmaceutical services and consultant and other hospital out-patient services
in association with local authority services. At the end of 1971, 307 were in
operation in England and Wales, 138 were under construction and many more
planned. In Scotland, where the provision of health centres is primarily the

BRITAIN 1973' AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, there were 35 centres in
operation, 14 under construction and many more planned.
Health education in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is the responsi¬
bility of the Health Education Council which assists in the development of
programmes of health education with local authorities, professional organi¬
sations, voluntary bodies and industry. There are separate arrangements in
Scotland. Expenditure is met from both central and local government funds.
Free conveyance by ambulance in England and Wales between home and
hospital is provided, where needed, by local authorities either directly or by
arrangement with voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car Service (organ¬
ised by the St. John Ambulance Association and Brigade, the British Red
Cross Society, and the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service) augments the
ambulance service in many areas by the conveyance of sitting patients. In
Scotland ambulances are run by the St. Andrew’s Scottish Ambulance
Service on behalf of the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern Ireland
they are run by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.
The health services established under the Health Services Acts (Northern
Ireland) correspond fairly closely to the medical care system established under
the National Health Service in Great Britain and they are financed in the
same way as in the rest of the United Kingdom. Personal social services are
provided under the Welfare Services Acts (Northern Ireland) by separate
statutory welfare authorities.
The hospital and specialist services, which include mental health services,
are administered on behalf of the Ministry of Health and Social Services by
the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority through hospital management com¬
mittees. The Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority has under its control 96
hospitals containing in all about 18,000 beds. The administration of the
general medical, dental, pharmaceutical and general eye services is in the
hands of the Northern Ireland General Health Services Board, which takes
the place of the executive councils in Great Britain. There are some 750
general practitioners (with an average of 2,070 patients each), 330 dentists,
15 ophthalmic medical practitioners and 127 ophthalmic and 10 dispensing
opticians. The provision of health centres is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Health and Social Services. The range of local authority services are similar
to those already described for the rest of the United Kingdom.
Plans are in hand to replace the existing tripartite arrangement for the
provision of health and personal social services by a unified structure in which
these services will be provided by four area boards acting as agents of the
Ministry of Health and Social Services. The services to be integrated include
hospital and specialist services, local authority welfare services, and genera
health services. The transition to the new structure will be synchronised with
the reorganisation of local government (see p. 74) and it is intended that the
area boards will assume their functions in April 1973.
In many areas invalid children, old people and others needing care in their
own homes are visited and helped by voluntary organisations (see p. 122).
There are specialist societies concerned with the blind, the deaf and people
with other disabilities. The extensive work done for elderly people 18 co_
ordinated by old people’s welfare committees which have been established m
some 1,540 areas and are affiliated to Age Concern (the National Old People’s
Welfare Council). In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland there are also
SOCIAL WELFARE
143
PRIVATE
MEDICAL
TREATMENT
national councils which co-ordinate the work of local committees. The
National Corporation for the Care of Old People, established by the Nuffield
Foundation, stimulates and undertakes research into the welfare of the elderly.
In 1971 some 3,000 homes for old and disabled people, run by voluntary
bodies or privately, were registered with local authorities in Great Britain. In
Northern Ireland voluntary homes are registered with the Ministry of Health
and Social Services and private homes with the welfare authorities.
Most of the homes and hostels for unmarried mothers and their children
are provided by voluntary organisations, which employ specially trained
workers to help the mothers to plan their future.
A great deal of help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and individual
voluntary helpers (see p. 122). Many hospitals have their own Leagues of
Friends or similar groups of voluntary workers who organise and undertake
a variety of services; and an increasing number of hospitals are appointing full¬
time organisers of voluntary help. The operation of canteens for out-patients,
and trolley-shops and book and picture library services for in-patients, visiting
in the wards, and escort services in out-patient departments, are among the
tasks commonly undertaken. Many convalescent homes are provided by
voluntary effort.
Though practically all residents in Britain use the National Health Service, a
number of people sometimes prefer to pay for private consultations and treat¬
ment. Among the major users are the families of the million or so subscribers
to the provident schemes which make provision for private health care in
return for annual subscriptions (now about £20 million or 2 per cent of the
expenditure on NHS hospital and specialist services).
THE MEDICAL,
DENTAL,
NURSING AND
ALLIED
PROFESSIONS
Only people whose names are on the medical and dental registers respectively
may practise as doctors and dentists under the National Health Service. Dental
auxiliaries (who have undergone a two-year training course) may carry out
some kinds of simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
The minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven
years’ training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year’s
experience as a resident assistant doctor in a hospital; for a dentist, four or
more years at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical
profession is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the
dentists is the General Dental Council which succeeded the Dental Board in
1956. The British Medical Association is the doctors’ main professional
association; that of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registra¬
tion as a nurse is normally three years. Training may be in general, sick
children’s, mental or mentally sub-normal nursing. An enrolled nurse takes a
two-year course. The examining bodies of the nursing profession in England
and Wales and in Scotland are the General Nursing Councils, and in Northern
Ireland the Joint Nursing and Midwives Council. Midwives in England and
Wales and in Scotland must have the certificate of the appropriate Central
Midwives Board, and in Northern Ireland of the Joint Nursing and Midwives
Council. Most pupil midwives are already registered general nurses or sick
children’s nurses; for them the two-year midwifery training period is reduced
to one year and, for other registered and enrolled nurses, to 18 months. The
Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives are the professional
bodies for nurses and midwives. Health visitors are registered general nurses
who have undergone at least the first part of the midwifery course or obstetric

Council for the Education and Training of Health Visitors.
To practise as a retail or hospital pharmacist, a pharmaceutical chemist
must have his or her name entered in the register maintained by the Pharma¬
ceutical Society of Great Britain, the governing body of the profession, or by
the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland. Four or five years’ academic
study and practical training are necessary for registration. The dispensing of
all medicines and the sale of certain specified medicines can be carried out
only by, or under the supervision of, a registered pharmaceutical chemist.
Under the Opticians Act 1958 the General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and dispensing optician; only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical practitioners) may test sight.
Training of ophthalmic opticians takes four years including a year of practical
experience under supervision. Dispensing opticians may take a two-year
full-time course with a year’s practical experience or a part-time day-release
course while employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists,
radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards
(called, for example, the Chiropodists’ Board or the Dietitians’ Board) under
the general supervision of the Council for Professions Supplementary to
Medicine. A professional training lasting two to four years is needed to qualify
for registration. Only members of these professions who are state registered
may be employed in the National Health Service and some other public services.
Social services of all kinds require for their effective operation professional
social workers, that is, full-time salaried workers trained in the principles and
methods of social work. Most professional social workers are employed by local
authorities (for the personal social services), by hospitals (for medical and
psychiatric social work), or by voluntary organisations. Training for most types
of social work consists of a basic university degree, diploma or certificate course
in social science followed by a university course in applied social studies or
specialised training for a particular service. Training is also possible in colleges
of further education. The statutory central training council for the United
Kingdom is the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work
which also undertakes the training functions carried out formerly by the
Advisory Council for Probation and After-Care. Advice on social work training
is given by the Social Work Advisory Service.
Government funds for medical research in Britain are channelled through
the University Grants Committee whose general grants to universities cover
research as well as teaching; the Medical Research Council which administers
two research institutes and numerous research units as well as providing
grants for research teams and individuals; and the Health Departments which
support research in aid of the National Health Service in universities, hospitals,
other government departments and industry. Further support is provided
by a large number of charitable foundations and organisations, such as the
Cancer Research Campaign and the Nuffield Foundation; and there is sub¬
stantial investment in medical research and development by the pharma¬
ceutical and medical equipment industries (see also p. 397).
Local authorities in Britain have a duty of care and protection towards children
who have no parent or guardian willing and able to provide for them and
SOCIAL WELFARE
145
control them adequately. Local authorities in England and Wales are em¬
powered under the Children and Young Persons Act 1963 to make available
such advice, guidance and assistance as may promote the welfare of children
by diminishing the need to receive or keep them in the authority’s care or to
bring them before a juvenile court. The Children and Young Persons Act
1969 (for England and Wales) provides for the care and treatment of juvenile
offenders and gives local authorities wider responsibilities for undertaking,
through social workers, enquiries and consultations with parents, schools and
the police, and for the supervision of a child or young person alleged to be an
offender and in need of care or control. Juveniles charged with offences or
brought before the court as being in need of care or control are dealt with in a
juvenile court unless they are charged with homicide or certain grave crimes
or are jointly charged with an adult. Every juvenile court must be constituted
of not more than three justices and must, except in certain special circum¬
stances, include a man and a woman.
Juveniles of ten years and over are still liable to criminal prosecution but
the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 enables the minimum age for
prosecution to be raised and the Government intends to raise it to 12 when
the social services have the necessary capacity to deal with the change. A
child below the minimum age may be subject to care proceedings in a juvenile
court but criminal proceedings cannot be brought against him. Care proceed¬
ings may also be brought when a child has been ill-treated or neglected, or is
of compulsory school age and is not attending school regularly.
The principal orders available to the juvenile courts in England and Wales
in both care and criminal proceedings are: (a) a care order, which commits
the child to the care of the local authority, (b) a supervision order (usually
valid for three years or less) under which a child will normally remain at home
under the supervision of the local authority or a probation officer, (c) an order
requiring a parent or guardian to enter into a recognisance to take proper care
of the child or young person and to exercise proper control over him, and
(d) a hospital or guardianship order in accordance with the Mental Health
Act 1959. In criminal proceedings the courts may also impose fines up to £50,
order payment of compensation, grant a conditional or absolute discharge or
make attendance centre or detention centre orders (see p. 103).
In England and Wales a child may be committed to the care of a local author¬
ity under a care order if the juvenile court, having considered all the child’s
circumstances, is satisfied that he is in need of care or control which he
would be unlikely to receive unless the court made an order. In England and
Wales local authorities have a further duty, under the Children Act 1948, to
receive into their care any child under the age of 17 who has no parent or
guardian, or who has been abandoned or whose parents are unable to provide
for him temporarily or permanently. A child so received remains in the care
of the local authority until he is 18 years old (or 19 years old, if already over
16) unless the authority finds it to his advantage to return him sooner to his
parents or guardian or to entrust him to friends. Both categories of children
are treated so as to further their best interests and afford them opportunity
for their proper development. In Scotland, under the provisions of the Social
Work (Scotland) Act 1968, the juvenile courts were replaced by a system of
children’s hearings which have powers to impose compulsory measures of
care on a child by means of a supervision requirement which can remain in
force until he is 18 years old.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents,
who receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home
146

BRITAIN I973‘ AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cannot be found for a child, or he is not suitable for boarding out, he may be
placed in residential accommodation usually provided by a local authority
or a voluntary organisation. The Children and Young Persons Act 1969
provides for the regional planning of accommodation for children in the care
of local authorities and the provision of community homes. These homes
will comprise local authority children’s homes and the voluntary homes which
become ‘assisted’ or ‘controlled’ together with approved schools and remand
homes which will gradually cease to function as such. In Scotland local
authorities are responsible for providing appropriate accommodation for
children in their care.
In England and Wales local authority child care functions are the responsi¬
bility of the social services committees appointed under the Local Authority
Social Services Act 1970. In Scotland child care work is undertaken by local
authority social work departments set up under the Social Work (Scotland)
Act 1968. Regulations for England and Wales for children in care of local
authorities and voluntary organisations and the conduct of children’s homes
are made by the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Secretary of
State for Wales and, for Scotland, by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland the welfare authorities of each county and county
borough (under the general direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs) are
responsible for caring for homeless and neglected children under the Children
and Young Persons Act (Northern Ireland) 1968. Arrangements for young
offenders follow the same general principles as in Great Britain.
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a valuable part in this work. The larger societies, such as Dr. Barnardo’s,
the Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic Child Welfare
Council are constituent societies of the National Council of Voluntary Child
Care Organisations, to which a large number of smaller voluntary homes are
also affiliated. In Scotland a valuable contribution is made by the churches
and by many other voluntary organisations. Children’s homes run by voluntary
organisations (with some 12,000 places in Great Britain) are required to be
registered under the Children Act in England and Wales, in Scotland under
the Social Work (Scotland) Act and in Northern Ireland under the Children
and Young Persons Act. Arrangements for the care of children and their
accommodation are subject to inspection by social work service officers of
the Department of Health and Social Security, the Welsh Office, the Scottish
Education Department and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Home Affairs.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own
homes include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units.
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its Scottish
counterpart maintain inspectors and visitors to investigate reported cruelty or
neglect.
Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926,. in
Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in 1930. About 25,000 adoption
orders are made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 500 in
Northern Ireland. Adoption is now regulated by the Adoption Act 1958 in
Great Britain and by the Adoption Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 in Northern
Ireland. The Registrars General keep registers of adopted children; adoption
societies (over 70 societies arrange adoptions) must be registered with the
local authority (in Northern Ireland with the Ministry of Home Affairs).
Local authorities have had the power since 1959 to act as adoption agencies
and increasingly do so. Adoption law in Great Britain is being reviewed.

After the 1950s considerable numbers of people entered Britain from

their families numbered nearly 1-4 million in mid-1970, about 2} per cent of
the total population of Britain.
Commonwealth immigrants are making an important contribution to the
economy and public services by relieving shortages of labour; but their
concentration in areas where opportunities for employment are greatest—
60 per cent have settled in Greater London and the West Midlands, including
Birmingham—led to an increased demand for housing and additional pressures
on the social services. The problems of these inner urban areas are being met
by continuous social service programmes in housing, education, hospitals and
health and welfare, which benefit the whole community, and the urban pro¬
gramme (see p. 123) which is directed at areas of special need. Additional
teachers have been appointed to schools in immigrant areas and government
grants are available to local authorities with substantial immigrant populations
towards the salaries of extra staff, such as interpreters, health visitors and
helpers in schools and community homes. The welfare of immigrants and
good relations between immigrant groups and the local community are pro¬
moted by voluntary community relations councils and other voluntary bodies.
The co-ordination of government action to promote the welfare of immigrants
is the responsibility of the Home Office. Voluntary efforts to achieve the
integration of immigrants as part of a wider aim of promoting harmonious
community relations are co-ordinated nationally by the Community Relations
Commission, a statutory body set up under the Race Relations Act 1968.
The Commission co-ordinates the activities of local community relations
councils, of which there are now 78 operating in areas where there is an
immigrant population. It makes grants towards the salaries of full-time com¬
munity relations officers and assistants and towards special projects which
help improve community relations and advises and makes recommendations
to the Home Secretary on matters affecting community relations. The Com¬
mission gives specialist advice to those working in education, youth and welfare
in the context of a multi-cultural society.
Discrimination on grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origin in places
of public resort was first made unlawful in Great Britain by the Race Relations
Act 1965, which established a Race Relations Board to secure compliance with
the Act. The Race Relations Act 1968 replaced the 1965 Act and is much
wider in scope, making discrimination unlawful in the provision of goods,
facilities and services, in employment and housing and in advertising. The
Race Relations Board has a statutory duty to receive and investigate complaints
and seeks to resolve them by conciliation. The Board constitutes regional
conciliation committees which between them cover all areas of Great Britain.
If conciliation fails the Board can seek remedies in the courts. Employment
complaints are dealt with in the first instance by the Department of Employ¬
ment whose function it is to see whether voluntary machinery exists within
industry to deal with them. Where no such machinery exists the complaints
are investigated by the Board.
6 EDUCATION
Educational
Administration
There are over 10*5 million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools, universities, colleges of education and technical colleges in Britain.
The great majority of schools, attended by some 95 per cent of school children,
and most further education establishments are publicly maintained or assisted.
Universities are autonomous self-governing institutions but are also aided
from public funds.
The bulk of expenditure on education in Britain comes from public funds
although some older-established schools and colleges continue to benefit from
private endowments. In 1971-72 estimated total public expenditure on educa¬
tion, including school meals, milk, and local libraries, was almost £3,000
million (nearly three times the expenditure in 1961-62), which was 13 per cent
of all public expenditure.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary
education started over a hundred years ago. In 1833 the Government had
begun to make annual grants to the voluntary societies which were providing
schools, but the Elementary Education Act of 1870 first established the
principle of compulsory education. By the end of the nineteenth century
elementary education had become virtually both compulsory and free of
charge. Public provision of secondary education (already begun in Wales)
started in England under the Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now
governs public education in England and Wales. The Scottish and Northern
Ireland educational systems both have long and separate histories, but the
same general policy is implemented throughout Britain, with some national
variations. Education is governed by the Education (Scotland) Act 1962 and
the Education and Libraries (Northern Ireland) Order i972-
Educational responsibilities are devolved in varying degrees to ministers of the
four countries of Britain: the Secretary of State for Education and Science is
responsible for all aspects of education in England, for further education in
Wales, and for universities, civil science and the arts (see p. 50) throughout
Great Britain; the Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for nursery,
primary and secondary education in Wales; the Secretary of State for Scotland
and the Minister responsible for Education for Northern Ireland have full
educational responsibilities in their countries except that the Secretary of State
for Scotland is consulted about Scottish universities but is not responsible for
them. . . ,
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is divided
between the central government departments (the Department of Education
and Science, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Education Department, and the
Northern Ireland Ministry of Education), local education authorities, and
various voluntary organisations. The relation between these three groups is
based on consultation and co-operation.
The local education authorities are responsible for the provision of school
education and further education. They also provide grants to students pro¬
ceeding to higher education; in Scotland grants are paid by the Scottish
Education Department.

SCHOOLS
Management
In England and Wales colleges of education (for teacher training) are under
the financial and administrative control of local education authorities or
voluntary organisations. The organisation of courses is based on university
institutes of education. The Scottish colleges of education are controlled by
specially appointed governing bodies; in Northern Ireland they are controlled
by the Government or voluntary agencies.
The universities are administratively independent of the central govern¬
ment departments. The Government exercises its responsibilities in relation
to the universities through the University Grants Committee (see p. 159).
Their governing bodies are appointed according to the terms of their individual
charters or statutory provisions.
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive efficient
full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
At present there are over 10 million school children at 37,485 schools.
In England and Wales there were 8-5 million children in publicly maintained
schools in 1971 besides 128,111 others at schools receiving direct grants
from the Department of Education and Science; there were also 408,394
children of all ages at 2,636 independent schools. In Scotland 988,753 children
were attending education authority or grant-aided schools and nearly 17,465
were at independent schools. In Northern Ireland 351,979 children were
attending publicly maintained or assisted schools.
The number of school children in Britain is increasing mainly because the
birth rate rose steadily between 1955 and 1964. Each year, too, more children
stay on at school beyond the minimum leaving age. The school population is
expected to rise, altogether, by 1 million by 1975. There is, therefore, a
continuing need for more teachers and more school buildings.
In Britain boys and girls are generally taught together in primary schools.
Some two-thirds of pupils in maintained secondary schools in England and
Wales and nearly one-half in Northern Ireland attend mixed schools. In
Scotland nearly all secondary schools are mixed. In the independent sector
most of the schools for younger children are co-educational; but of those
providing secondary education the majority are either for boys or for girls.
Schools supported from public funds are of three kinds in England and
Wales: county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained
by local education authorities wholly out of public funds; voluntary schools
(mostly ‘aided’ or ‘controlled’ schools) which have been provided by a
voluntary body, usually of a religious denomination1; and direct-grant schools
which are completely independent of local education authorities but receive a
grant from the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office.
These last (the smallest group) are mainly grammar schools; they include some
schools of ancient foundation. In Scotland most of the schools supported from
public funds are provided by education authorities and are known as public
schools (in England this term is used for a type of independent school, see
p. 153). There are also 28 grant-aided secondary schools comparable to the
1 The local education authority is responsible for the running costs of all voluntary
schools and for the cost of all building work at controlled schools. Aided schools have
more independence than controlled schools and are responsible for part of the cost of
external repairs and any building work (see p. 154). Over a third of the 29,349 schools
maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary schools
and the majority of these are Church of England schools. There are 2,559 Roman
Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to other religious bodies.

English direct-grant schools. In Northern Ireland county schools, managed by
local education authorities, and voluntary schools, under voluntary (usually
clerical) management, are both grant-aided by the Government.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
maintained schools (that is, over 90 per cent of the school population) and
books and equipment are supplied free. In Scotland, education authorities
have power to charge fees where this can be done without prejudice to the
adequate provision of free school education.
The direct-grant grammar schools in England and Wales and a few of the
grant-aided secondary schools in Scotland take pupils paid for by local educa¬
tion authorities as well as those whose fees are paid wholly or partly by parents.
(For independent schools, see p. 153.) In Northern Ireland no fees are charged
to parents of children attending grant-aided schools, with the exception of
grammar schools, where qualified pupils receive from the local education
authorities scholarships which cover the whole or most of the fees charged by
the school.
In England and Wales curricula in maintained schools are under the control of
local education authorities, though there is in practice a high degree of devolu¬
tion to the schools themselves. Teachers may seek help and advice from Her
Majesty’s Inspectors, who are responsible for the inspection of all schools
including independent schools; they review and report on the content and
value of the education provided and are available as advisers. Local education
authorities also employ inspectors to advise on maintained schools. Further
advice and encouragement for school-based research and development is
made available to teachers through the Schools Council for Curriculum and
Examinations. The council, an independent body representative of all educa¬
tional interests, acts as an advisory body and carries out research and develop¬
ment work on curricula, teaching methods and examinations in primary and
secondary schools. In Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in
general the same as that of the Inspectorate in England and Wales. The content
and balance of the curriculum is kept under continuous review by the Consulta¬
tive Committee on the Curriculum. Northern Ireland has a Schools Curricu¬
lum Committee which works in close liaison with the Schools Council, and
the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Education provides help and advice to
teachers
The schools’ freedom to frame their own curricula has facilitated a rapid
increase in study and experiment, partly stimulated by the Schools Council
and other organisations and partly prompted by the raising of the school¬
leaving age in September 1972. The general purpose is to adapt the curriculum
to the everyday life and needs of children and young people.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents wish them to be withdrawn. In county schools, and in
certain circumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruction of an un''
denominational Christian character is given. In all kinds of voluntary school
there is opportunity for denominational instruction. In Scotland, subject to
safeguards for the individual conscience, religious instruction must be given,
but the content is determined by education authorities or, more commonly,
by the schools themselves. Roman Catholic children generally have their own
schools. In county schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access to

give religious instruction to children of their denomination for a limited period
each week. The voluntary schools in Northern Ireland are almost all Roman
Catholic.
Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum
of all schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must
have the use of a playing field and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Organised games include tennis, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse and netball.
The School Health Service provides medical inspection and arranges,
usually in co-operation with the National Health Service, for free medical and
dental treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local
education authorities. Treatment facilities include dental clinics and child
guidance centres.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to children of 7 years
or under, to children aged between 7 and 12 if they have a medical require¬
ment, and to pupils in special schools. The School Meals Service provides a
mid-day meal at a subsidised charge (remitted where there is need). The price
is gradually being raised to cover the economic cost. About 60 per cent of
pupils in England and Wales and about 38 per cent of pupils in Scotland in
education authority schools have school mid-day meals. Education authorities
have a duty to provide free transport for children who live more than a certain
distance from the schools they attend.
Nursery schools and classes provide informal educational and play facilities
for a small proportion of children between two and five years old; additional
nursery schools and classes are being provided in areas of acute social need
under the Urban Programme started in 1968 (see p. 123). Compulsory educa¬
tion begins at five when children in England and Wales go to infant schools or
departments; at seven they go on to junior schools or departments. At present
the usual age of transfer from primary to secondary schools is 11 in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland but an increasing number of local authorities in
England are establishing ‘first’ schools for pupils aged 5-8 or 9, and ‘middle’
schools for pupils aged 8 or 9 to 12 or 13. In Scotland, the primary schools
take children from 5 to 12, normally having infant classes for children under 7,
although in some areas there are separate infant schools.
The content of curricula is very largely a matter for the schools themselves.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are no compulsory secular
subjects but generally a curriculum includes the teaching of reading, writing,
mathematics, English, music, art and handiwork, science and nature study,
history and geography. French is taught in an increasing number of schools.
Additionally, in Wales, the Welsh language is taught. Children who speak
Welsh at home normally receive the early stages of their primary education in
Welsh and are taught English as a second language. In Scotland the scope of
the curriculum is similar and provision is made, where appropriate, for the
teaching of Gaelic and its use for the purposes of instruction.
Primary education is undergoing considerable change with the introduction
of new subjects and new teaching methods, and a greater emphasis on meeting
the needs of the individual child. In England recommendations of the
Plowden report, published in 1967 (see Bibliography, p. 474), are being
adopted, including the establishment of ‘middle’ schools, the increased use
of teachers’ aides in primary schools, more in-service training for teachers
facilitated by the rapid growth of the number of teachers’ centres (now about
500) for the dissemination of new ideas, and the channelling of special help to

‘educational priority areas’ in poorer neighbourhoods in the form of more
teachers and increased salaries for teachers in schools of exceptional difficulty.
The public or state system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. The majority of school children in England
and Wales receive their secondary education in schools to which they are
allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11 (often referred to as the
‘eleven-plus’ examination). Schools receiving pupils on this basis are: about
1,146 grammar schools providing academic education (including 176 direct-
grant grammar schools); some 2,464 secondary modern schools giving a
general education with a practical bias; a few secondary technical schools
offering a general education related to industry, commerce and agriculture; and
schools providing all three, or any two, types of education, in separately
organised streams and known as multilateral or bilateral schools.
A third of the maintained secondary school population, however, attend
some 1,373 comprehensive schools which take pupils without reference to
ability or aptitude and provide a wide range of secondary education for all or
most of the children of a district. They can be organised in a number of ways
including schools that take the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18;
the middle schools whose pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at
12 or 13, leaving at 16 or 18; and the comprehensive school with an age-range
of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a sixth-form college for pupils over 16.
Secondary education in Scotland is largely organised on comprehensive
lines and in 1971 225,516 pupils (about 70 per cent of all pupils in education
authority secondary schools) were in schools with a comprehensive intake.
There are also a decreasing number of selective secondary schools which fall
mainly into one of three categories or are a combination of all three: (1)
schools providing non-certificate courses for pupils likely to leave school at the
statutory leaving age of 16; (2) schools which, in addition to non-certificate
courses, provide courses leading to the Ordinary grade of the Scottish Certifi¬
cate of Education; and (3) secondary schools which provide Certificate courses
of four, five and six years.
In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools and secondary (intermediate)
schools, the latter being the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in
England and Wales. Some comprehensive type schools exist, and arrangements
for transfer between the other types of schools are flexible.
Special education is provided for children who require it because of any
physical or mental disability, including maladjustment, either in ordinary
schools or special schools (including hospital schools). For children at special
schools attendance is compulsory up to the age of 16, and a number of children
remain at school beyond this age. There are over 1,600 special schools in
Britain, including hospital schools, day and boarding schools. There are also
boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary schools.
There are ten categories of handicapped pupils in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland and nine in Scotland for whom local education authorities
must provide special educational treatment: blind, partially sighted, deaf,
partially hearing, delicate, educationally subnormal, epileptic, maladjusted,
physically handicapped and children suffering from speech defects. There is no
separate category for the delicate in Scotland.
Independent schools in England and Wales receive no grants from public
funds but all are open to inspection and must register with the Department of
EDUCATION
153
Education and Science or the Welsh Office which has power to require them to
remedy any objectionable features in their premises, accommodation or in¬
struction and to exclude any person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or to be
the proprietor of a school. In default, the appropriate Secretary of State can,
in effect, close a school, but schools have a right of appeal to an Independent
Schools Tribunal against any of the requirements. The schools whose stan¬
dards are regarded by the Department or the Welsh Office as broadly com¬
parable with those of well-run maintained schools are, on application, granted
the status of ‘recognised as efficient’. Such schools (1,402 of 2,636 independent
schools registered) contain 74-8 per cent of the pupils in independent schools.
In Scotland where there are 107 registered schools, the position is the same
except that there is no ‘recognised as efficient’ status.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages and abilities. They include
the preparatory schools and the public schools.1 The preparatory schools
cater mainly for boys from about 8 to 13 years of age who are intending to
enter public schools, the largest and most important of the ‘recognised as
efficient’ independent schools. Combined tuition and boarding fees in public
schools generally range between £500 and j£86o a year. There are some 270
public schools about half of which are for girls. The boys’ schools in particular
include a high proportion of boarding schools and it is among these that some
of the most famous schools are numbered.
School Leaving The minimum school-leaving age was raised from 15 to 16 in September
and Secondary 1972, although many pupils continue at school until the ages of 17 or 18. The
School number staying on beyond the minimum school-leaving age has shown a
Examinations steady increase over the past decade.
There is no national leaving examination in England or Wales, but secondary
school pupils (and candidates not attending school) may take the General
Certificate of Education (GCE) or the Certificate of Secondary Education
(CSE). The GCE is conducted at ‘Ordinary’ (O) and ‘Advanced’ (A) levels.
Most candidates for the O-level are about 16 years of age, although some take
it earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. Most grammar, direct-grant
and independent school pupils and a number from other secondary schools
take the O-level examination, and passes in various subjects are widely accepted
for entry to courses of further education and training. Between i960 and 1971
the annual number of O-level GCE passes increased by nearly a half. The
advanced examination is at university entrance level and is accepted also for
purposes of entry to many forms of professional training. Since 1955 the
number of school-leavers obtaining two or more A-levels (often regarded as
the minimum qualification for university entrance) has more than trebled.
The CSE is designed for pupils completing five years’ secondary education
at the age of 16; it is controlled by teachers serving in the schools providing
candidates. The highest grade in the CSE is widely accepted as being of the
same standard as a pass in the GCE O-level. Control over the scope and
standards of examinations is exercised by the Schools Council (see p. 150) to
ensure national comparability. It does not lay down model syllabuses or
examination papers but it puts forward ideas and promotes research and
development.
1 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of the Head¬
masters’ Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association. Some other schools, mainly direct grant, which are not
independent schools, are also represented on these bodies. They should not be confused
with the state-supported public schools in Scotland.

In Scotland examinations are conducted by the Scottish Certificate of
Education Examination Board. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary
courses sit an examination at 16 years for the award of passes on the Ordinary
grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education, and pupils in the fifth or sixth
year are presented for the Higher grade. Passes at the Higher grade are the
basis for entry to university or professional training. For those who have
completed their main studies at the Higher grade but wish to continue their
studies in particular subjects there is a Certificate of Sixth Year Studies.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Northern Ireland General
Certificate of Education and, from 1973, the Northern Ireland Certificate of
Secondary Education.
Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible, under the
general supervision of the central departments, for providing the schools and
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central
departments decide on the size and nature of the authorities’ individual
programmes in the light of national priorities', they also offer guidance to
authorities by means of building bulletins and in other ways.
An extensive school building programme has been carried out resulting in
the completion of nearly 13,649 new schools in Britain since 1945; together
with extensions, alterations and remodelling of existing state schools, over
7-4 million new places have been provided.
Grants of up to 80 per cent of the approved cost are normally available from
the Department of Education and Science for the building of new voluntary
aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to existing aided schools.
In Northern Ireland capital grants of 80 per cent are available for voluntary
schools which have on their governing boards a one-third proportion of local
authority nominees or, in the case of voluntary grammar schools, ministry
nominees.
The school building programme has provided for new ideas and methods in
design and construction. Industrialised building techniques have been widely
adopted. The new schools are light, airy and colourful, with a high standard
of finish and generous provision of teaching area and outdoor games space. In
primary schools especially, traditional classroom designs are being modified
to allow more flexible use of space.
Further education is a broad term used to cover education beyond the second¬
ary stage; it includes much vocational education (full-time, part-time day or
evening courses), non-vocational and recreational evening classes, and adult
education. Further education advanced courses constitute one of the three
sectors of higher education (see p. 160 and below).
In England and Wales there are about 650 major establishments of further
education including polytechnics (see p. 161), technical colleges, colleges of
commerce, colleges of art, and a number of agricultural establishments. They
provide both full-time and part-time courses up to the levels of first and higher
degrees. There are also over 6,500 evening institutes (see p. 156).
In Scotland there are about 86 local further education colleges offering
full- and part-time day courses and a number of evening courses and 13 central
institutions for further education doing mainly advanced work.
In Northern Ireland there are 29 institutions of further education.
Since most further education establishments in Britain are either maintained

or aided from public funds, tuition fees are moderate, and nearly always
remitted for young people under 18 years of age. Where industrial training is
provided by the colleges, charges (the responsibility of the employer) broadly
reflect the economic cost of provision. Many full-time students are helped by
awards from local education authorities. The awards, generally based on the
results of the General Certificate of Education or a corresponding examination,
are assessed to cover tuition fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who
can afford to contribute towards the cost are required to do so. There are also
some scholarships available from endowments, and from particular industries
or companies for the most promising of their young workers.
In autumn 1971 there were 313,489 full-time and sandwich-course students
(277,700 in England and Wales, 23,911 in Scotland and 11,878 in Northern
Ireland) and 1,551,633 part-time students in vocational further education
(1,407,200 in England and Wales, 122,277 in Scotland and 22,156 in Northern
Ireland). The total number of students on advanced courses in England and
Wales was about 200,000, in Scotland 18,522, and in Northern Ireland 2,549‘
The courses provided are full-time, sandwich (up to five years in length,
generally consisting of alternate periods of about six months of full-time study
in a technical college and supervised experience in industry), block release (on
similar principles, but with shorter periods in college), day release (generally
attendance at a technical college for one day a week during working hours),
and evening classes.
Sandwich courses in higher education are becoming increasingly popular.
At the lower levels the numbers of day release and block release courses are
expanding, and to a large extent replacing evening classes in certain vocational
subjects. Many students attend courses in which further education and
industrial training are combined.
There is a wide variety of courses for young people in various trades and occu¬
pations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course of up to five
years. Other, more academic, courses lead to the National Certificates and
Diplomas approved by joint committees consisting of representatives of edu¬
cation departments, teacher organisations and the appropriate professional
bodies.1 These courses are normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. The
Ordinary National Certificate courses normally last two years part-time and
students usually follow them between the ages of 16 and 19; the level of the
certificate is generally considered to approach that of GCE A-level. The
Ordinary National Diploma courses are the full-time or sandwich counterparts
of the Ordinary National Certificate but involve study to a greater depth. In
1971 some 5,878 Ordinary National Diplomas were granted, over nine
times the number for 1961. The Higher National Diploma, which requires a
further two years’ full-time or three years’ sandwich study, is recognised,
within its more restricted field, as approaching the standard of a pass degree;
the Higher National Certificate (after two further years’ part-time study) is
lower in standard because it is more narrowly based.
Many technical colleges, evening institutes and independent colleges offer
courses in shorthand, typing and book-keeping. Most local technical colleges
1 Proposals for the establishment of a Technician Education Council and a Business
Education Council to administer technician and business courses at all levels in England
and Wales have been accepted by the Government (the Haslegrave Report, see Biblio¬
graphy, p. 475). Similar proposals for Scotland have also been accepted.

offer some lower-level work in business and commerce; higher-level work is
generally concentrated in colleges with a department of business studies or in
specialised colleges of commerce. There are a number of part-time and full¬
time courses leading to the Certificate or Higher Certificate in Office Studies.
Some business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies; large numbers of the candidates taking
such courses do so through correspondence courses. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland there are part-time courses leading to the Ordinary National
Certificate and Higher National Certificate in Business Studies. There are
also full-time and sandwich courses leading to the Ordinary National Diploma
and Higher National Diploma in Business Studies. In Scotland, similar courses
lead to the Scottish National Certificate, the Scottish Higher National Certifi¬
cate and the Scottish National Diploma in Business Studies awarded by the
Scottish Council for Commercial, Administrative and Professional Education.
Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of non-vocational education
for people over 18. In 1971 some two million people registered for these
courses which were provided by local education authorities, various voluntary
bodies, of which the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA) is the most
notable, certain residential colleges, and the adult education (‘extra-mural’)
departments of universities. The aim and effectiveness of adult education in
England and Wales, and Scotland are under examination by committees of
enquiry.
The residential colleges, the university departments and the voluntary
bodies, such as the WEA, recognised as competent to provide adult education,
receive government grants. So do various national bodies which promote
educational activities of a non-political kind, such as the National Federation of
Women’s Institutes and the National Council of Young Men’s Christian
Associations. Many of these bodies also receive grants from local education
authorities for services rendered locally.
A major part of adult education is provided by local education authorities.
Most of it is on a part-time basis, mainly in evening institutes (day schools
used by adults in the evening) and also in colleges of further education, schools
of art, adult education centres, community centres, literary institutes and
youth clubs. About 17 million students attended local authority adult educa¬
tion classes in 1971. There are about 30 short-term residential colleges or
centres in Great Britain maintained or aided by local education authorities,
providing courses varying in length between a weekend and a fortnight. Many
of the courses are practical, but there are widespread opportunities for
academic study.
The village colleges pioneered in Cambridgeshire and variously adapted in
Cumberland, Monmouthshire, Leicestershire, Peterborough and Somerset
are secondary schools planned also as cultural community centres, providing
educational, social and cultural opportunities for adults in mainly rural areas.
Community centres in general have a more social character and, though
aided by the local education authorities, are usually managed by voluntary
community associations many of which are affiliated to the National Federation
of Community Associations. The training of community centre wardens is
linked with that of youth workers (see p. 166).
Six residential colleges (five in England and Wales, one in Scotland) pro¬
vide courses of one or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The colleges
aim at providing a liberal education and do not apply academic entry tests.
In general, courses at the highest levels in liberal studies are provided by the

extra-mural departments of the universities, many of which have full-time staff
appointed for this purpose and can also call on the services of other members
of the university staff; and by the Workers’ Educational Association, which also
employs organising tutors and works closely with the university extra-mural
departments. In 1970-71 over 285,000 students in Britain attended such courses.
Similar work is promoted in some education authority centres.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many organisations in England and
Wales which are interested in this subject. It is mainly financed by contribu¬
tions from local education authorities and assisted by a grant from the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science. The Scottish Institute of Adult Education is
the corresponding body in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland extra-mural departments of the Queen’s University of
Belfast and the New University of Ulster organise and staff adult education
classes which are supplemented by classes organised by various non-official
bodies. The Workers’ Educational Association is responsible for classes at
other than university level and receives grants from the Ministry of Education.
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing
bodies or managers. In 1971 there were about 406,700 full-time and 50,131
part-time (equivalent to 23,805 full-time) teachers in publicly maintained
schools in Britain, an average of one teacher to 22*2 pupils. The supply of
teachers is increasing rapidly and the pupil-teacher ratio is improving each
year. Increasing numbers of university graduates are turning to teaching.
In 1971 there were over 58,432 full-time teachers in grant-aided establishments
of further education in Britain, and many more part-time teachers. Most
teachers in technical colleges have had industrial and professional experience.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland.
In 1971-72 the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) broadcast 80 radio
series for schools including nine regional series for Wales, eight for Scotland,
and four for Northern Ireland. These programmes were used by about 31,000
schools. Television reached some 24,000 schools and the BBC and the
Independent Television Authority (now the Independent Broadcasting
Authority) between them transmitted 69 series of educational programmes,
most of which were repeated.
Radio provides a great variety of educational programmes for adults, both
vocational and non-vocational; most of them are grouped in an hourly study
programme on five nights a week. Television programmes for similar audiences
are mostly shown on Saturday and Sunday mornings and in the evening during
the week. There have also been a number of experimental projects sponsored
between the BBC, some of the independent television companies, universities,
local education authorities and a voluntary body, the National Extension
College. (For the Open University, see p. 158.)
A number of other audio-visual aids are in use throughout the educational
system. Most universities and a high proportion of colleges of education use
closed-circuit television; it is also used increasingly in further education
colleges and schools—the Inner London Education Authority’s system links
about 1,400 educational establishments and is one of the world’s biggest
networks. There are about 1,500 language laboratories in use in Britain.

Schools and colleges co-ordinate different methods of audio-visual presenta¬
tion, including radio, television, films, colour slides, wall charts, maps, models
and tape recordings. For example, the BBC’s ‘Radiovision’ programmes for
schools use coloured film strips synchronised with sound. The National
Council for Educational Technology (NCET) and the Educational Founda¬
tion for Visual Aids advise all bodies connected with education and with
training in industry and in the Services on the use of audio-visual aids.1
The system of higher education includes universities, colleges of education
and advanced courses at various colleges in the further education system.
There has been a rapid expansion in higher education in the last decade; the
numbers in full-time higher education in Britain have increased from 198,200
in 1961 to 456,400 in 1970. (Advanced courses are dealt with on p. 160 and
higher education in Northern Ireland on p. 161.)
There are 44 universities (not counting the Open University) in Britain, com¬
pared with 17 in 1945. Although the Government is responsible for providing
about 80 per cent of universities’ income it does not control their work or
teaching nor does it have direct dealings with the universities. The grants are
distributed by the University Grants Committee, a body appointed by the
Secretary of State for Education and Science to advise her on state aid to the
universities; its members are drawn from the academic and business worlds.
The English universities are: Aston2 (Birmingham), Bath,2 Birmingham,
Bradford,2 Bristol, Brunei2 (London), Cambridge, City2 (London), Durham,
East Anglia,2 Essex,2 Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury,2 Lancaster,2
Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough,2 Manchester, Newcastle
upon Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford,2 Sheffield, Southampton,
Surrey,2 Sussex,2 Warwick2 and York.2 The federated University of Wales
includes five university colleges, the Welsh National School of Medicine, and
the University of Wales Institute of Science and I echnology. The Scottish
universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee,2 Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt2
(Edinburgh), St. Andrews, Stirling,2 and Strathclyde2 (Glasgow). In Northern
Ireland there is Queen’s University, Belfast, and the New University of
Ulster2 in Coleraine (see p. 161).
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
There are five other institutions where the work is of university standard:
the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology; the two
postgraduate business schools which are supported jointly by industry and the
Government—the Manchester Business School and the London Graduate
School of Business Studies, associated with the London School of Economics
and the Imperial College of Science and Technology; Cranfield Institute of
Technology for mainly postgraduate work in aeronautics and other subjects;
and the Royal College of Art.
The Government has established the Open University to provide part-time
degree and other courses, using a combination of television, radio and corres¬
pondence courses together with a network of viewing and listening centres. No
formal academic qualifications are required to register for these courses, but
1 A government committee has recommended that the NCET should be replaced by a

the standards of its degrees (to be awarded on a system of credits for each
course completed) will be the same as those of other universities. The uni¬
versity is financed by fees and a direct grant from the Department of Education
and Science. The first courses began in January 1971 and in July 1972 some
30,674 students were following courses.
In spite of the large sums of public money spent on universities they have
remained autonomous institutions, due largely to the existence of the University
Grants Committee. The Committee acts as a link between the Government
from which it receives a block grant and the universities to which it allocates
this grant. In this way the Government contributes over 70 per cent towards
the current income of universities and about 90 per cent towards their capital
programmes for building work, purchasing sites and properties, professional
fees and furniture and equipment. Further sums are raised by the universities
themselves.
In Great Britain the recurrent grants for the academic year 1972-73 are
estimated to be about £250 million. Capital grants are expected to be about
£25 million. Total public expenditure on universities rose from £4 million
in 1945 to £336 million in 1971-72. The Comptroller and Auditor General
(see p. 203) has access to the books and records of the University Grants
Committee and the universities to check that the funds entrusted to the
universities are efficiently administered. He cannot question policy decisions
or those reached on academic grounds.
Courses in arts and science are offered by most universities. Imperial College,
London, the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology
and some of the newer universities concentrate on technology although they
also offer a number of courses in social studies, modern languages and other
non-technological subjects. About 45 per cent of full-time university students
in Great Britain are taking arts or social studies courses and 41 per cent science
and technology: about 10 per cent are studying medicine, dentistry and health,
and the remainder agriculture, forestry, veterinary science, architecture and
town and country planning.
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though
in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science five or six years are required.
The first degree of Bachelor (Master in the arts faculties of the older Scottish
universities) is awarded on the completion of such a course, depending on
satisfactory examination results. Further study or research is required at the
modern universities for the degree of Master and by all universities for that of
Doctor. Actual degree titles vary according to the practice of each university.
A uniform standard of degree throughout the country is ensured by having
external examiners on all examining boards. In the last decade there has been
a tendency for degree courses to become more broadly based in subject matter,
particularly in the new universities.
University teaching combines lectures, practical classes (in scientific sub¬
jects) and small group teaching in either seminars or tutorials.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all
universities there are postgraduate students engaged in research.
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with
men but at Cambridge their numbers may be limited by ordinance. The general
proportion of men to women students is about three to one; at Oxford it is
over four to one, and at Cambridge seven to one. Over a third of all full-time

university students in Britain are living in colleges and halls of residence,
slightly under a half are in lodgings, and the remainder live at home.
Despite recent expansion programmes, applications for places at universities
for arts studies still exceed the number available. Prospective candidates for
nearly all the universities apply for places through the Universities Central
Council on Admissions. The only students to apply directly are applicants to
the Open University and British candidates who apply only for the universi¬
ties of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Strathclyde.
In 1971-72 there were about 234,000 full-time university students in Great
Britain including 43,000 postgraduates. In 1970-71 there were some 22,822
part-time students. Some 30,000 home and overseas candidates were also
registered in 1972 for London University’s external first degree examinations.
In 1970-71 there were about 23,000 full-time university teachers in Great
Britain; about 10 per cent of them were professors. The ratio of staff to
students was about one to eight, one of the most favourable in the world.
Teachers in maintained schools must hold qualifications approved by the
education departments. In England and Wales the majority qualify by under¬
taking a three-year course at a college of education.1 Some college students
obtain a degree—Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.)—and a professional quali¬
fication by means of a four-year course. An additional year’s compulsory
professional training for people with degrees and certain other specialist
qualifications, hitherto qualified by virtue of their qualifications, is gradually
being introduced. In Scotland all teachers in secondary schools must be
graduates (or have equivalent qualifications) and must have taken a course of
teacher training but primary school teachers may qualify by taking a three-
year course at a college of education. The General Teaching Council has
almost complete powers over the profession excluding salary matters but
including the function of maintaining a register of qualified teachers. Proposals
for a similar body for England and Wales are under consideration.
In England and Wales there are 153 colleges of education, 14 of which are for
day students only, 7 departments of education in polytechnics, 30 university
departments of education, 4 colleges for training teachers for technical institu¬
tions and 13 art teacher training centres. In October 1971 there were about
113,340 students in colleges and departments of education outside universities
(including over 7,000 in day colleges), some 6,367 in university departments of
education, and 2,590 in colleges of education (technical) and art teacher
training centres. In Scotland there are 10 colleges of education; the number of
students in training in 1971-72 was over 13,300.
The education departments, universities, local authorities and other bodies
provide a variety of short in-service training courses for practising teachers.
In 1971-72 over 218,500 students in Great Britain were taking advanced
courses other than in universities and colleges of education in a wide variety
of subjects including architecture, art and design (see p. 418), catering, engin¬
eering, natural sciences and business studies. An increasing proportion of the
students were taking courses leading to the awards of the Council for National
Academic Awards. The Council has power to award degrees and other aca-

demic qualifications, comparable in standard with those granted by universities,
to students who successfully complete approved courses of study in establish¬
ments which do not have the power to award their own degrees. In 1971-72
there were 396 courses being followed by about 29,020 students .These courses
were mainly in science and technology but included the arts, social studies,
business studies and law.
In England and Wales higher education provision outside universities and
colleges of education is being concentrated within 30 major national institutions
named ‘polytechnics’. They are comprehensive institutions providing all types
of courses (full-time, sandwich, and part-time) at all levels of higher education.
By 1971 some 28 polytechnics had been designated.
Management studies are provided by universities, polytechnics and other
further education colleges, by individual companies and by trade and industrial
federations. (For the two postgraduate business schools, see p. 158.) Certain
independent colleges specialise in management training. Many universities
have introduced management studies into the curriculum and courses for the
postgraduate Diploma in Management Studies are run by about 40 further
education colleges. In Scotland courses leading to the Certificate of Business
Administration are provided for students in junior supervisory positions.
Awards to enable students to undertake higher education are made under one
of the most generous grant systems in the world. It is national policy that no
boy or girl should be prevented by lack of means from taking an advanced
course at a university or elsewhere. As a result, over 90 per cent of students in
higher education in Great Britain are aided from private or public funds.
In England, Wales and Scotland most adequately qualified British students
can obtain awards from public funds in order to attend full-time at a university,
college of education or major further education establishment. In England and
Wales local education authorities provide awards. In Scotland students’
allowances for advanced courses are granted by the Scottish Education De¬
partment. The amount of these awards depends upon the income of the student
and his parents. Grants for postgraduate study are offered annually by the
Department of Education and Science, the Research Councils and the Scottish
Education Department.
Two institutions provide university education in Northern Ireland—Queen’s
University of Belfast and the New University of Ulster, Coleraine. The New
University consists of four schools (biological studies, social and economic
studies, physical sciences and humanities) and an education centre with the
status of a school. Technological studies are provided at Queen’s University,
Belfast, in addition to a wide range of courses in other faculties. In October
1971 there were 5,955 students at Queen’s University and 1,593 at t^ie New
University. Government grants to the universities are made by the Ministry of
Education which first seeks the advice of the University Grants Committee.
Higher education outside the universities is mainly centred in a new poly¬
technic called Ulster College which has 1,189 full-time and 519 part-time
students.
Teacher training takes place in the two university education departments,
three colleges of education, the Ulster College and one technical college. In
1971-72 there were about 3,093 students in training. The principal courses are
three-year (certificate) and four-year (Bachelor of Education) but there are
also one-year courses for graduates or holders of other appropriate qualifications.
University and further education scholarships are awarded by local authorities,

and postgraduate awards and teacher training scholarships by the Ministry of
Education, the conditions of award being the same as those for Great Britain.
Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of edu¬
cational services is supported financially by the education departments, local
education authorities, philanthropic organisations, universities and teachers’
associations. The Schools Council and the Social Science Research Council are
additional channels for government support.
The major institute undertaking research in education, outside the uni¬
versities, is the National Foundation for Educational Research, an autonomous
body which derives its income mainly from corporate members, including local
education authorities, teachers’ organisations and universities and from an
annual grant from the Department of Education and Science. There are also
the Scottish Council for Research in Education and the Northern Ireland
Council for Educational Research.
Some research is undertaken at colleges of education and polytechnics and
by a few independent research organisations.
Among philanthropic organisations that provide generously for research are
the Nuffield Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Gulbenkian Trust, the
Leverhulme Trust, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, the Rockefeller Foun¬
dation, the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, the Wolfson Foundation and the
Foundation for Management Education.
There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and for
British students to study abroad and British teachers are encouraged to serve
overseas for a period.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
the academic year 1970-71 there were 69,283 overseas students in Britain, of
whom about 18,338 were at universities, another 15,712 at technical colleges
and the remainder learning English or training as teachers, doctors and nurses,
for the law, banking and accountancy, or in industry. About 60 per cent of all
overseas students were from the Commonwealth.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers from
other countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan,
the governments of certain Commonwealth countries have made awards
available at their own institutions of higher education to men and women from
other Commonwealth countries. At the beginning of the academic year 1971-72,
647 scholarships and fellowships (including medical awards) were held in
Britain under the plan. Also the Commonwealth Bursary Scheme achieved a
total of 549 teachers and others training in Britain. An example of a smaller
government scheme is the Indian Centres of Advanced Study Scheme in which,
as part of a plan for establishing links between British and Indian universities,
academic staff from Indian universities spend a period of time with British
universities.

Britain, are offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Twenty-four
Marshall Scholarships for two years’ study at any university in Britain are
offered annually by the British Government to graduates from the United
States of America and over 60 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to
Commonwealth and United States graduates for two years of study at the
University of Oxford. A further two Rhodes scholarships are awarded to
graduates from the Federal Republic of Germany. Other universities and col¬
leges themselves offer many scholarships for which graduate students of any
nationality are eligible.1
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are avail¬
able under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Colombo Plan, the Special
Commonwealth African Assistance Plan and British technical assistance pro¬
grammes for many countries. Over 1,400 awards for study or training in
Britain are also made under the United Nations Programmes of Technical
Assistance and by the United Nations specialised agencies such as UNESCO,
FAO, and WHO.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal
direct dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth, and
regular Commonwealth education conferences are held.
The national representatives in London (Office of the High Commissioner or
Embassy) of a number of countries accept certain special responsibilities for
their students in Britain. The British Council acts as an agent for the British
Government in matters affecting the welfare of overseas students, and provides
certain services, such as meeting on arrival, introduction courses, an accom¬
modation bureau and a student centre in London which organises a varied
programme of lectures, discussions and social and other activities and arranges
introductions of students to people who wish to invite them to their homes. In
the vacations there are courses in many parts of the country which offer op¬
portunities for getting to know more about British life in town and country. In
term time there are visits to various places of interest, and theatre and con¬
cert parties are arranged.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas
students are Rotary, Round Table, the Victoria League, the Royal Over-Seas
League, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the National Union of Students,
the English-Speaking Union and Churches of all denominations. The United
Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs, established in 1968, is an inde¬
pendent central body serving overseas students and organisations and indivi¬
duals concerned in overseas students affairs; it provides both a forum for the
exchange of ideas and machinery for consultation with government and other
authorities. In many London boroughs and in other large cities there are
nominated by ministers. It is financed almost entirely from public funds. The activities
of the Council, which has staff in 76 overseas countries, are advising and assisting in
English teaching and other educational work including science; fostering personal con¬
tacts between British and overseas people, especially in the educational, professional and
scientific fields; running, or helping to maintain, libraries of British books and periodi¬
cals overseas; and presenting overseas the best in the arts in Britain. Its work in Britain
is concerned mainly with professional visitors and with the welfare of overseas students.
1 The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes a handbook, Awards for
Commonwealth University Staff (see Bibliography, p. 473)> which lists sources of
financial aid for university teachers. The Association promotes co-operation between
Commonwealth universities. It provides publication and information services, and also
makes available secretariats for various bodies affecting its member institutions, such
as the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission and the Marshall Aid Commemoration
Commission.

committees which help students to make contact with local residents and
organisations. These organisations also help by entertaining overseas students
and many of them have established hostels with the financial help of the Over¬
seas Students Welfare Expansion Programme which is administered by the
British Council. By the beginning of 1972 grants had been approved for 138
projects, providing places for about 6,250 students.
British Students Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, a number of
Overseas scholarships are made available annually to British students by the govern¬
ments of other Commonwealth countries for study in their universities,
colleges and other institutions of higher learning. In 1971-72, 33 awards were
accepted by British students in nine Commonwealth countries. In addition
the Study and Serve Scheme, administered by the Inter-University Council
for Higher Education Overseas, enables British students to undertake a year’s
postgraduate study at universities in the developing countries on condition
that they also work in appropriate employment in the country concerned.
The United States-United Kingdom Educational Commission (still some¬
times called the Fulbright Commission) offers travel grants for postgraduate
study in the United States. Notable among more recently established scholar¬
ships are the Kennedy scholarships, to enable British students to study at three
American universities, and the Churchill travel scholarships, for men and
women in all walks of life. British students are also offered scholarships at
institutions of higher education in 22 European and 10 non-European countries
outside the Commonwealth.
About 1,100 teachers were recruited in Britain during 1971 for posts in schools,
colleges of education, technical colleges and universities in developing countries,
including about 956 for posts in the developing countries of the Common¬
wealth ; almost all of them are supported by public funds. Steps taken by the
Government to help school teachers to serve for a period overseas have in¬
cluded the establishment of a National Council for the Supply and Training of
Teachers Overseas and the introduction of special measures to safeguard their
interests both while abroad and on their return home. Recruitment is carried
out by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, the British Council and the voluntary teacher recruit¬
ing agencies, such as the Overseas Appointments Bureau and Catholic Over¬
seas Appointments.
There are 1,214 British university teachers serving in developing countries,
most of them recruited through the Inter-University Council for Higher
Education Overseas and the Association of Commonwealth Universities and
the British Council. Government encouragement also includes support for a
number of schemes of assistance for overseas universities which are ad¬
ministered by the Inter-University Council, including the scheme for Special
Commonwealth Awards, which are made to leading scholars from British
universities who are willing to work for a minimum of two years in important
posts in the universities of developing Commonwealth countries.
Outside the schemes, an increasing number of graduate and qualified volun¬
teers, and cadet volunteers (including school leavers), nearly 1,670 in 1971-72,
are going overseas for one or two years, many to teach. Recruitment is carried
out by four voluntary organisations (co-ordinated under the British Volunteer
Programme) which receive financial assistance from the Government.
Interchange schemes, under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for a
year with teachers overseas, include one with the United States and another

with Commonwealth countries whereby each year about 120 British teachers
exchange posts. Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and
several European countries both for teachers and for temporary assistants
posts for language specialists.
Britain provides, on request, assistance to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for technical and con¬
sultant services and specialist missions, through various educational organisa¬
tions and the ODA. The Centre for Educational Development Overseas
(CEDO) is the British centre to which those concerned with the modernisation
of education in developing countries may apply for information, advice and
assistance.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The aim of the youth service in Britain is to encourage the development of
young people by helping them to broaden their interests, to enjoy recreational
pursuits, and to mix socially in their leisure time.
The service (which in Scotland forms part of the Youth and Community
Service) is provided by local education authorities and voluntary organisations,
in co-operation with the government education departments. Membership of
youth groups is voluntary and groups vary greatly in their activities, there
being no attempt to impose uniformity or to create anything in the nature of a
national youth movement.
Organised activities for young people were first promoted by voluntary bodies,
often of a religious nature, during the nineteenth century, and the number of
such organisations and the range of their activities have continued to grow
over the past 100 years. The involvement of local authorities and the education
departments in the youth service dates back principally to the 1940s when the
service first became recognised as part of the education system.
The education departments formulate broad policy objectives for the service
and encourage their achievement through financial assistance and advice.
They make known the Government’s attitude by means of circulars to local
education authorities and through contacts between departmental officials and
representatives of the authorities and the voluntary organisations. Ministers in
Scotland and Northern Ireland are advised on the finance and development of
the service by councils representing all those concerned in youth work.
Financially the departments in Great Britain assist voluntary organisations
through grants towards their costs for central administration and local build¬
ing products; in 1971-72 these amounted to £581,000 and £1*32 million re¬
spectively. In the same year estimated expenditure in Northern Ireland on
current and capital grants to the voluntary organisations amounted to some
£380,000.
Almost all local education authorities assist local voluntary groups by lend¬
ing premises and equipment and some contribute to their capital and running
costs. To supplement the work of voluntary groups, many authorities now
construct and run youth centres and clubs; in Great Britain there are over
3,700 youth centres fully run by local education authorities. Most authorities
have appointed youth committees on which official and voluntary bodies are
represented, and employ youth organisers to help in the promotion and en¬
couragement of youth work. In 1971-72, local education authorities spent an
estimated £27-4 million on the youth service in England and Wales and
£743,000 in Scotland.
j66 BRITAIN 1973- AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Although the number of local education authority youth clubs and centres is
growing, national voluntary organisations still promote the largest share of
youth activities through local groups, which raise most of their day-to-day
running expenses by their own efforts \ these have an estimated membership
in Britain of 5-5 million. Twenty-four national organisations (with member¬
ships of at least 10,000) are constituent members, and a further 37 are asso¬
ciate or observer members, of the Standing Conference of National Voluntary
Youth Organisations (SCNVYO), a consultative body which takes action only
in the name of its member bodies and with their consent. In Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland there are similar representative bodies.
Among the most important of the voluntary youth organisations belonging
to SCNVYO are the Scouts and Girl Guides Associations (with 467,000 and
758,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs (319,000), the
National Association of Boys’ Clubs (164,000), the Boys Brigade (142,000),
and the Young Men’s Christian Association (92,000).
Certain pre-Service organisations for boys, which provide facilities for
social, educational and physical development along with training for possible
entry to the armed forces, are also members of SCNVYO; they are assisted
financially by the Ministry of Defence.
Local education authority youth groups in England and Wales normally cater
for young people of both sexes mainly in the 14-20 age-range. Voluntary
organisations frequently cater for young people on a single-sex basis and their
membership often covers a wider age-range. Of young people between the ages
of 14 and 20 an estimated 29 per cent participate in youth service activities, and
of these three times as many belong to voluntary as to local education authority
youth groups. A smaller proportion of girls than boys take part. The main in¬
volvement is between the ages of 13 and 16.
Training of Most youth workers operate part-time and many of them are unpaid. Part-
Youth Workers time workers usually have no professional qualification in youth work but
many have allied qualifications, for instance as teachers, and a large number
attend short courses and conferences on youth work.
In England and Wales, for full-time youth workers there is a basic two-
year training undertaken in conjunction with the training of community centre
wardens. Provided at colleges of education and further education, the course
leads to a professional qualification. In addition a number of colleges of educa¬
tion provide a study of youth work as a principal or subsidiary subject within a
teacher training course. In Scotland one- and three-year courses are provided
at certain colleges of education. There are over 2,400 qualified youth workers
in Great Britain.
There are in Britain a number of organisations, which, although primarily
concerned with the welfare and out-of-school pursuits of young people, operate
in a context broader than that of any individual youth movement. Among the
most important are the Sports Councils for England, Wales and Scotland (see
p. 440), which provide practical and advisory services for many youth organi¬
sations; the National Playing Fields Association, which advises local authorities
and sports organisations on the acquisition, layout, construction and use o
sports grounds; and the Outward Bound Trust, which maintains six sea and
mountain schools in Britain offering full-time residential courses designed to
encourage a sense of adventure, responsibility, confidence and achievement.

such as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, is
designed as a challenge to young people to reach certain standards in leisure¬
time activities with the voluntary assistance of adults. Some 160,000 young
people between the ages of 14 and 21 from Britain and other Commonwealth
countries took part in the scheme in 1971. There are three awards—Bronze,
Silver and Gold—for each of which young people must attempt activities in
four out of five sections: service; interests; expeditions; and either physical
activity or design for living.
The King George’s Jubilee Trust is a charitable body which, since its
creation in 1935, has distributed more than £2 *3 million in grants to voluntary
youth organisations and towards experimental youth projects.
A notable trend in recent years (both within and outside the youth service)
has been the growth in voluntary service by young people to those in need in
the community, for example, the elderly, the sick, the mentally ill and the
handicapped. Organisations such as International Voluntary Service, Task
Force and Community Service Volunteers receive grants from the Department
of Education and Science, and through them thousands of young people are
doing full- or part-time voluntary work for the community. Many schools
organise community service activities as part of the curriculum. Young people
also play an active part in fund-raising for charitable organisations.
The Government established the Young Volunteer Force Foundation in
1968 as an independent body to advise interested organisations in England and
Wales on methods of involving young people in providing service to the com¬
munity. The Foundation is grant-aided by the Department of Education and
Science and employs teams of young people who are available on request to
assist such bodies as local authorities, voluntary organisations and hospital
boards in encouraging and promoting voluntary service. In Scotland, a similar
organisation, ‘Enterprise Youth’, has been established to co-ordinate and pro¬
mote voluntary service to the community.
7 ENVIRONMENTAL
PLANNING
Over many years successive British Governments have taken action to manage
and protect the physical environment, and have established a legal and
administrative framework, particularly of planning law, to control develop¬
ment, to reduce pollution and to emphasise positive planning to ensure the
wise use of land.
Following studies of the major problems of planning, the Government
introduced in 1947 two comprehensive Town and Country Planning Acts
(one for England and Wales and one for Scotland) which provide the basis of
the modern system of land planning (the law in England and Wales has been
consolidated in the Town and Country Planning Act 1971). Compulsory
planning duties are imposed on all local planning authorities (the councils of
counties and county boroughs, the London authorities and, in some cases,
joint planning boards) and there is a centralised planning structure under the
Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretaries of State for Scotland
and Wales.
Development All local planning authorities must prepare plans setting out their proposals
Plans and objectives for the development of their areas, and submit them for
ministerial approval. A development plan system introduced in 1968 (for
England and Wales) and 1969 (for Scotland) is designed to reduce adminis¬
trative delays, to emphasise positive planning for the creation of a pleasant
environment rather than the negative control of undesirable development, and
to enable the public to play a greater part in the planning process. ‘Structure’
plans are drawn up by local planning authorities, setting out broad policies
for the future use and development of land (including traffic management)
and showing ‘action areas’ where comprehensive development or improvement
is expected to start within a specific period. Once the plans have received
ministerial approval, local plans containing more detailed proposals, including
plans for the action areas, are prepared (normally without the need for
ministerial approval). All the plans are under continuous review and may be
amended periodically.
The local authorities have wide powers for undertaking development, in¬
cluding the compulsory purchase of land. With a few exceptions, all other
development (which includes most forms of construction, mineral extraction
and any material change made in the use of land or existing buildings) can be
carried out only after the local planning authority has given its permission.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity
to express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative
stages of the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must
ensure adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans;
representations may be made about them to the authorities. Where specific
proposals for development differ substantially from the intentions of a develop¬
ment plan, they must be publicised locally. Other schemes affecting a large

number of people are usually advertised by the local planning authority and
applications seeking permission for certain types of development must also
be advertised. There is a right of appeal to the appropriate Secretary of State
if planning permission is refused or granted subject to conditions; in England
and Wales some 60 per cent of appeals are transferred to inspectors for decision.
An appellant always has the right to put his case before an inspector appointed
by the Secretary of State. In the case of development schemes of national or
regional importance or of a very technical or scientific nature, the ministers
responsible may decide to set up planning inquiry commissions to carry out
investigations and hold inquiries locally. Where highway development is pro¬
posed, the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales can
hold such inquiries as they consider appropriate.
Voluntary organisations are particularly active in ensuring that proposed
changes in the use of land take full account of the interests of the public and
considerations of amenity. The National Trust for England, Wales and Nor¬
thern Ireland, founded in 1895, is the largest private landowner in Britain.
For the benefit of the public it owns and protects from harmful development
420,000 acres (169,964 hectares) of land, 200 historic buildings and large
stretches of coastline (see p. 174). Properties in Scotland covering some 80,000
acres (32,375 hectares) are protected by the National Trust for Scotland, an
independent body founded in 1931, which has about 50,000 members.
The Town and Country Planning Association, founded in 1899, seeks to
improve the qualities of land use and planning in Britain, and helped to pro¬
mote, for example, the New Towns Act 1946 (see p. 170). The Civic Trust
(and associate trusts) was established in 1957 to encourage high quality in
architecture and planning, and to stimulate public interest in the appearance
of town and country. It has, for example, produced plans for the redevelopment
of town centres and for a recreational area in the Lee Valley to the north-east
of London, and was closely associated with the drafting of the Civic Amenities
Act 1967 (see p. 173). The Civic Trust supports and advises nearly 900 local
amenity societies throughout Britain.
Other voluntary societies concerned with amenity in town and country
include: the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association for the Preservation of Rural
Scotland and the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside;
the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society; the
Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings;
the Georgian Group and the Scottish Georgian Society; the Ulster Archi¬
tectural Heritage Society; the Victorian Society; the Pilgrim Trust; and the
Historic Churches Preservation Trust. The Committee for Environmental
Conservation, comprising many of the main voluntary organisations, acts as a
liaison body and is concerned with broader questions of amenity than those
covered by individual societies.
Advisory machinery for planning on a regional basis has been set up by the
Government. Local planning authorities and the regional economic planning
councils have consultations before structure plans are drawn up within the
framework of the economic planning and development of each region as a
whole (outside London many local planning authorities in England and Wales
are combining in the preparatory work for their plans and, in some cases, they
are to submit a joint plan for ministerial approval). Studies showing the
economic and social resources in all the regions have been made and certain
170

BRITAIN I973* AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
areas, where land, communications and facilities are favourable, have been
proposed as places where development should be concentrated.
Special provisions, in addition to the general town and country planning
measures, control the location of industry and offices (see p. 264). General
problems of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of
government departments, but each development scheme, as a rule, requires
the local planning authority’s consent. Financial incentives to encourage the
location of industry in particular areas have been made available by the
Government (see p. 262).
In Great Britain the New Towns Act 1946 and subsequent legislation (now
consolidated in Acts of 1965 and 1968) give the Secretaries of State for the
Environment, Scotland and Wales power to designate as the site of a new town
any area of land (which may include an existing centre of population). In
Northern Ireland there are similar powers under the New Towns Act
(Northern Ireland) 1965.
The appropriate minister must consult the local authorities concerned and
allow the public an opportunity to comment on the proposed designation. A
development corporation (development commission in Northern Ireland) is
appointed by the Government to create and plan the growth of the town. It is
responsible for the master plan, which is prepared in consultation with the
appropriate minister, government departments, and the local authorities in
the area. Residents are given an opportunity to state their views and, if
necessary, a public inquiry is held. When the plan has been agreed, the
development corporation draws up detailed proposals for particular areas and
submits them to the responsible minister for approval which (given after
consultation with the local planning authorities) constitutes planning per¬
mission. A development corporation has general powers to acquire by agree¬
ment or compulsory purchase any land or property within the designated area
necessary for its purposes, and is empowered to provide houses, offices,
factories and other essential buildings, estate roads and, in certain circum¬
stances, the main services essential to the development of the town.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced from public
funds and is repayable over 60 years. Under the New Towns Act 1946
Parliament approved a fund of £50 million to provide for advances to the
development corporations for work on the new towns. This fund was increased
by subsequent Acts and now stands at £1,500 million; a total of some £930
million had been advanced by March 1972. The corporations submit annual
reports (which include copies of their audited accounts) to Parliament.
Of the 32 new towns designated in Britain between 1946 an(^ July I972> 23
are in England and Wales, five in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland.
Eleven of the new towns in England and Wales (Basildon, Bracknell, Crawley,
Harlow, Hatfield, Kernel Hempstead, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Peter¬
borough, Stevenage and Welwyn) are designed to help to relieve housing
problems in the Greater London area. Of the others, Aycliffe, Corby, Cwm¬
bran, Peterlee and Washington are serving the special needs of their areas;
Newtown is being developed to stem rural depopulation in mid-Wales and
create conditions for growth in the area; Runcorn and Skelmersdale are
helping to meet the overspill needs of Liverpool and north Merseyside,
Telford and Redditch are taking population from Birmingham; and Warrington
is being expanded for economic growth and to take people from Manchester.

BRITAIN 1973- OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In central Lancashire a new town has been designated to ease further the
housing problems of Liverpool and IVIanchester and to provide a growth
point for the region’s economy; and at Llantrisant in Glamorgan a new town
has been proposed, to provide a planned growth centre to reduce emigration
from south Wales and create a centre for economic expansion. The Govern¬
ment proposes to designate a substantial area near the site of London’s third
airport (see p. 361) for development by a new town development corporation.
The five Scottish new towns (Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Glenrothes,
Irvine and Livingston) are helping to house people from Glasgow and are
major growth areas in the central belt of Scotland; in the Stonehouse area of
Lanarkshire a new community is to be established, making use of the develop¬
ment corporation of East Kilbride new town. In Northern Ireland, Craig-
avon is being developed as a new city and is rapidly becoming an area of major
industrial growth; Antrim and Ballymena are also becoming centres of econo¬
mic growth; and Londonderry and the surrounding district have been desig¬
nated as an area of special development.
Four new towns (Crawley, Hatfield, Kernel Hempstead and Welwyn) have
been substantially completed and are now the responsibility of the Commission
for the New Towns, a government-appointed agency.
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use. They
are generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experiments,
both socially and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment.
The population of the new towns in Great Britain is about 1-7 million;
more than half a million people have moved into them during the past 25
years. Young people form a higher proportion of new town populations than
of the country as a whole. An extensive building and civil engineering pro¬
gramme has provided houses, flats, factories, schools, shops, churches, health
centres and libraries as well as public buildings including town halls and law
courts. Roads, water supplies, sewerage, gas and electricity, police, fire and bus
stations, postal, telegraph and telephone facilities have also been provided;
most of the towns are well-equipped with parks and playing fields of various
kinds. All the new towns have become concerned with the increasingly high
level of car ownership of their inhabitants and are making more adequate
provision for parking and the segregation of pedestrians from motorists.
A number of the more developed towns are becoming regional centres and,
as the populations grow large enough to give the necessary support, offices,
hotels and department stores, as well as arts centres and full entertainment
and recreational facilities (skating rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, swimming
pools, sports stadia, golf courses and youth centres) are gradually being
provided. The expansion of large existing towns such as Northampton,
Peterborough and Warrington has the advantage, among, others, that many of
these facilities are already available.
The Town Development Act 1952 makes provision for the relief of congestion
in large industrial towns in England and Wales (such as London and Birming¬
ham) by encouraging the transfer of population to areas suitable for expansion
where employment is provided. Schemes have been approved, providing some
163,000 dwellings in this way, of which about half have been completed or are
under construction. Some of the expanding towns (for example, Aylesbury,
Basingstoke, Swindon and Thetford) are already well established, providing
new opportunities for people from large cities. In some places, like Cramling-
ton and Killingworth, relatively undeveloped areas are being expanded.
The Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act 1957 makes similar

provision for Scotland, where the only congested town so far involved is
Glasgow.
Existing towns and cities are being renewed and re-shaped to improve the
environment and to meet the growth in population and traffic. Local authorities
have extensive powers (often aided by government grants) to clear slum
dwellings, to improve individual houses or whole residential areas, to reclaim
derelict land (see p. 177), to secure clean air (see p. 178) and to manage traffic.
The Government believes that greater integration of land use and transport
planning is of basic importance, and the creation of the Department of the
Environment (see p. 51) has brought a total strategic approach to environ¬
mental planning and protection. Research into urban planning problems is
also undertaken by a number of institutes and university departments and by
the Centre for Environmental Studies, established in 1966 and financed
jointly by the Government and other sources, including the Ford Foundation.
Lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; 166,000 buildings are
already listed. It is an offence to demolish or alter the character of any listed
building without special consent from the local planning authority or the
appropriate Secretary of State; where consent is given to demolish a building,
the Royal Commissions on Historical Monuments have an opportunity to
make a photographic record of the building. Emergency ‘building preservation
notices’ can be served by the local planning authority to protect buildings not
yet listed. The respective Secretaries of State (on the recommendation of the
appropriate Historic Buildings Council) can make grants and loans for the
repair or maintenance of buildings of outstanding interest, and local authorities
can make grants and loans for any building of architectural or historic interest
even if it is not listed. Some 2,000 buildings in Great Britain have received
grants and loans totalling about £9-5 million under the Historic Buildings and
Ancient Monuments Act 1953. The Civic Amenities Act 1967 (partly con¬
solidated in the Town and Country Planning Act 1971) requires local planning
authorities to designate ‘conservation areas’ of special architectural or historic
interest. Special studies have been made in Bath, Chester, Chichester and
York of the difficulties of preserving features of historic interest in ancient
towns in the face of commercial development and increasing motor traffic.
The Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales are
responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and for the protec¬
tion of ancient monuments of which over 700 are in their care. Some 14
million people visited them in 1971. The Royal Commission on Historical
Monuments (for England), and similar bodies for Scotland and Wales, survey
monuments and specify those worthy of preservation. In Northern Ireland
some 80 historic monuments are maintained and protected by the state;
historic buildings legislation similar to that in Great Britain is proposed.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
special character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’
(areas where it is intended that the land should be left permanently open and
free from new development and where townspeople can seek recreation) have
been established around all or part of certain urban areas and cover 1,793
square miles (4,644 sq. km.) in England and Wales. About 80 per cent of
i74

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
London’s green belt is agricultural land or woodland (much of which can be
used also for recreational purposes) and more than 6 per cent is used speci¬
fically for recreation (playing fields, golf and race courses and open spaces).
In Scotland there are green belt areas around the main cities.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use
at the coast. Since 1963 the authorities have made special surveys of their
areas, and their development plans include policies to safeguard the coast’s
natural attractions, to provide facilities for holiday-makers and for other
developments, to create or improve amenities, and to take into account coastal
areas of scientific interest.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales was under¬
taken by the Countryside Commission in 1966-70. Its report, The Planning of
the Coastline (see Bibliography, p. 475), shows that although a quarter of the
coast was developed or committed for development, almost two-thirds were
covered by specific local planning authority policies restricting new develop¬
ment. Of the total, some 15 per cent was under the protective ownership of
local authorities, the National Trust, the Forestry Commission, national and
local nature reserves, and other bodies; some 40 per cent was covered by nation¬
ally defined areas—national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty—
which imply some degree of protection; and nearly 5 per cent was held by
government departments for defence and other purposes. Special studies have
been made of coastal recreation and holidays and coastal nature conservation.
With government financial help the National Trust (see p. 169) is engaged
on a jT2 million campaign, Enterprise Neptune, to focus public attention on the
dangers affecting the coast and to protect stretches of coastline of great beauty
and recreational value.
The protection of the coastline against erosion, for which the E)epartment
of the Environment and the Welsh Office are centrally responsible in England
and Wales, presents difficult engineering problems and heavy costs for the
maritime local authorities. All sizeable coast protection schemes drawn up by
the authorities under the Coast Protection Act 1949 are investigated by
government engineering staff. Substantial grants from central funds (up to a
maximum of 80 per cent) are made to authorities with small resources.
Protection against sea flooding where there is no question of erosion is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (see p. 325).
To help to prevent the pollution of the coastline by oil washed to shore by the
sea, special regulations restrict the discharge of oil into British territorial
waters (see p. 340).
Under the Countryside Acts 1967 (for Scotland) and 1968 (for England and
Wales) Countryside Commissions (with an advisory committee for Wales)
encourage the provision and development of facilities for open-air recreation
in the countryside. These include the provision by local authorities (sometimes
in association with other bodies) and private individuals of country parks
within easy reach of towns; the establishment of camping sites and picnic
areas; and the increased use of reservoirs, canals and other waterways for
bathing, sailing and other activities. By August 1972, 72 country parks and
81 picnic sites had been approved in England and Wales by the Government.
In Scotland a large number of local authority schemes for the provision of a
variety of countryside facilities have been approved for grant aid. The Country¬
side Commission for Scotland has approved three country parks. The com¬
missions are also responsible for encouraging and promoting measures to

conserve and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside and
may undertake research projects and experimental schemes, working in consul¬
tation with local authorities and such bodies as the Nature Conservancy and
the Sports Council (see p. 440). Grants to local authorities are available from
the Government for certain approved schemes and the commissions have
powers to make grants or loans to people carrying out similar projects.
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) replaced and assumed
the functions of the National Parks Commission set up under the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 to select national parks and
‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’ and to make proposals for the creation of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished: Northumberland, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, the North
York Moors and the Peak District in northern England; Snowdonia, the
Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons in Wales; Exmoor and Dart¬
moor in south-west England. They cover 5,258 square miles (13,618 sq. km.),
or 9 per cent of the area of England and Wales. Administration is based on
local authority representation, with some members appointed by the Govern¬
ment. The establishment of a new national park has been proposed for mid-
Wales. By August 1972, 28 areas of outstanding natural beauty had been
designated, covering some 4,589 square miles (11,885 S(l- km.).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures,
for which government grants are available, such as tree planting and preserva¬
tion, and the removal of eyesores. In the national parks, other measures for the
benefit of the public include the provision of car parks, camping and caravan
areas, and information centres. All national parks and some other designated
areas have warden services. Some 1,500 miles (2,414 km.) of long-distance
footpaths and bridleways had been approved by August 1972. Large stretches
of these paths are already public rights of way; the 250 miles (402 km.) of the
Pennine Way form Britain’s first long-distance footpath and the South Downs
Way, stretching for some 80 miles (129 km.) is the first long-distance bridleway.
Further routes are being established.
Under the Amenity Lands Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 the Ulster Country¬
side Committee advises on the establishment of national parks and the
designation of areas of outstanding natural beauty. Seven areas have been
designated. Four amenity areas, acquired by the Ministry of Development, are
being managed as country parks. Although there are no national parks as such
in Scotland, five large national park direction areas are subject to special
planning control under ministerial supervision. The areas are: Loch Lomond-
Trossachs; Glen Affric-Glen Cannich-Strath Farrar; Ben Nevis-Glen Coe-
Black Mount; the Cairngorms; and Loch Torridon-Loch Maree-Little Loch
Broom. Over 98 per cent of the land in Scotland has been designated as
countryside within the jurisdiction of the Countryside Commission for
Scotland.
The Forestry Commission (see p. 333) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven forest parks in some of the finest country in Great Britain: Argyll, Glen
Trool, Glen More and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and
Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park on the borders of
176
Local

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
England and Scotland. The parks cover some 600,000 acres (243,000 hectares).
Camping and other recreational facilities provided in all the parks are used by
several million holidaymakers each year. The historic New Forest, in Hamp¬
shire, although not a forest park, is also open to the public. In Northern
Ireland, the Ministry of Agriculture has established five forest parks Tolly-
more Park, Castlewellan, Gortin Glen, Drum Manor and Gosford Castle—
and there are also five forest scenic drives; in some 40 forests recreational
facilities have been provided.
Under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 county
councils in most areas of England and Wales have prepared maps showing all
public rights of way, which must be kept free of vehicles and obstructions and
must not be permanently disturbed. If a path is not shown on the map, a
private citizen can show that it is a public right of way if it has been used and
regarded as such without interruption for at least 20 years. Public footpaths are
maintained by local highway authorities who must also provide signposts and
supervise the duty of landowners to repair stiles and gates. Local authorities in
Great Britain can create paths and ways, close existing paths which are no
longer in public use, and divert paths to secure a more efficient use of the land
or simply a shorter route. Local planning authorities can convert minor roads
into footpaths or bridleways and provide recreational facilities.
The 1949 Act is also concerned with access to open country, which now
includes mountains, moors, heaths, downs, cliffs and foreshores, woodlands,
rivers and canals and their banks, but not farmland unless it is simply used for
grazing. There is no automatic right of public access to open country, but
local planning authorities can secure access by means of agreements with land-
owners; if agreements cannot be obtained, authorities may acquire land or
make orders for public access. These powers were extended in 1967 to cover
Scotland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 1-5 million acres (607,030 hectares) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually
privately owned, but people other than the owner have various rights on or
over it, for example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by
law and cannot be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries
of State for the Environment or Wales. The Commons Registration Act
1965 provided for the registration of all commons and village greens, and by
the close of the registration period in 1970 over 16,000 areas had been regis¬
tered. Under the Countryside Act 1968 local authorities can provide facilities
for enjoyment on any common land to which the public has access.
The Nature Conservancy Council, set up by the Government to replace the
Nature Conservancy, is the main body responsible for nature conservation
in Great Britain. There are 131 national nature reserves, covering 271,500
acres (109,600 hectares). Some 26 nature reserves are run by local authorities;
in woodland areas there are 13 forest nature reserves; and some 600 reserves
set up by voluntary bodies (see below) protect a further 75,000 acres (30,000
hectares). There are also over 2,600 sites of special scientific interest in Great
Britain, designated because of their flora, fauna or geological or physiological
features: local planning authorities must consult the Nature Conservancy
before granting planning permission for development affecting them, n
Northern Ireland 30 sites have been scheduled by the Ministry of Develop¬
ment and are subject to special planning control. Some 13 nature reserves

have been established by the ministry on the advice of the Nature Reserves
Committee.
Throughout Britain voluntary organisations co-operate in the conservation
of nature (and in many cases establish their own reserves or other specially
protected areas); these include: the National Trust, the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds, the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the
County Naturalists Trusts and the Council for Nature (which consists of some
450 natural history and conservation societies).
While specific measures have been adopted to ensure that the use of land in
towns and in the countryside is properly supervised, a growing concern for the
wider aspects of planning has meant that the restricted notion of protective
planning has evolved into a positive concept for the enhancement of the land
and of the enjoyment of the people who live and work on it.
In 1970 Britain became the first major country to establish a Department for
the Environment (see p. 51); all government departments in Great Britain
have a legal duty when exercising functions relating to land to keep in mind
the desirability of conserving the countryside’s natural beauty and amenity;
and major planning inquiry commissions consider environmental factors when
discussing, for example, the siting of a new airport.
Many of the detailed aspects of planning for the environment are under¬
taken by local authorities. The local planning authorities have power to
preserve trees and woodlands in the interests of amenity by means of tree
preservation orders; when granting planning permission for development, a
local planning authority must impose conditions to secure the preservation or
planting of trees; and landowners are generally required to replace ‘preserved’
trees which die or are removed or destroyed. Outdoor display of advertise¬
ments is controlled by planning legislation; local planning authorities must
give their consent for most forms of outdoor advertising, and in rural and
other localities requiring special protection on grounds of amenity special
controls may be applied. In addition to the general town and country planning
controls over development, land may not generally be used as a caravan site
unless a site licence has been issued by the local authority. The Litter Act 1958
made it an offence to leave litter on land to which the public has free access;
under the Civic Amenities Act 1967 local authorities are empowered to
remove abandoned cars and other bulky rubbish; the Countryside Act 1968
allows the Secretaries of State for the Environment and Wales to make grants
to the authorities for the removal of objects disfiguring the countryside; the
Dangerous Litter Act 1971 improves provision for the prevention of dangerous
litter; and the Deposit of Poisonous Waste Act 1972 introduces more stringent
controls to prevent illegal dumping of poisonous waste materials.
Local authorities are responsible for reclaiming land so damaged by in¬
dustrial or other development that it is not capable of being used fully without
special treatment. Local planning authorities have powers for reclaiming land
in pursuit of the general well-being of their districts—for example, in the
course of providing open spaces and schools; they can acquire and develop
land and carry out restoration and improvement; and they can require an
owner of land which is damaging and offensive to the surrounding area to
improve its condition. Exchequer grants cover half the cost of local authority
clearance schemes, and higher grants are available for clearance in the less
prosperous areas and in the national parks and areas of outstanding natural
beauty (see p. 175). Planning controls to prevent the spread of dereliction

Other Measures
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
require that, when permission is granted for mineral working, conditions are
attached ensuring various measures to minimise the disturbance caused by the
work and to secure whatever restoration is practicable when working ceases.
The use of land for tipping is also subject to conditions restricting height or
requiring treatment on completion. Specialist derelict land units within the
Department of the Environment, the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office
provide central information and advice and make a continuous assessment of
land reclamation problems.
Responsibility for clean air in towns and cities rests with local authorities,
who may declare ‘smoke control areas’ within which the emission of smoke
from chimneys constitutes an offence: some 3,700 smoke control orders had
been confirmed by April 1972 and 5-2 million dwellings and commercial
premises are subject to smoke control. Central government is responsible
through the clean air and alkali inspectorate for enforcing control of emissions
to the air of noxious and offensive substances including smoke, grit and dust
from certain industrial processes. The emission of smoke from motor vehicles
is also controlled. The Clean Air Council (set up in 1956) and a similar council
for Scotland review the progress made in abating air pollution in Great Britain.
Partly as a result of air pollution control, London no longer experiences dense
(‘pea-souper’) fogs or serious smogs and in central London winter sunshine has
increased by 70 per cent since 1962.
Local authorities are also responsible for the enforcement of the Noise
Abatement Act i960 which requires them to inspect their areas for noise
nuisances and to take action (which can be enforced by the courts) to secure
abatement. Some 9,800 complaints about noise were received by local
authorities in 1970, and in 57 per cent of these cases the authorities considered
that nuisance existed and took appropriate action. The Advisory Council on
Noise is studying the working of the Act.
Other special measures have been introduced to help to combat water
pollution (see p. 283), to reduce the level of fumes from motor vehicles and to
ensure that the use of agricultural chemicals is properly supervised (see p. 327).
The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (see p. 391) gives
advice on matters concerning the pollution of the environment.
8 HOUSING
Administration
There are about 19-4 million dwellings in Britain: nearly 17*2 million in
England and Wales, 1 -8 million in Scotland and 460,000 in Northern Ireland.
Nationally the numbers of households and dwellings are about equal, but they
are unevenly distributed, and housing shortages persist in the more pros¬
perous commercial and industrial centres, such as London and Birmingham.
The large majority of people in Great Britain—85 per cent in the 1966
sample census—live in houses or bungalows, mostly with gardens; the remain¬
der live in flats or maisonettes, normally in blocks of from two to 20 storeys.
About a half of all dwellings in Britain are owned by their occupiers, some
30 per cent are rented from public housing authorities, and most of the
remainder are rented from private landlords (see diagram below). There are
variations, however, in the distribution of tenure between the different
countries of the United Kingdom—in Scotland more than half the dwellings
are rented from public authorities—and in different regions and areas of those
countries. Private rented accommodation is generally more common in the
central districts of large towns, while owner-occupation is more frequent in
their outer suburbs and in country areas.
New house construction in Britain is undertaken by both public and private
sectors. Of the 364,000 dwellings completed in 1971, some 54 per cent were
provided by private interests and three per cent by voluntary housing associa¬
tions and societies. Public housing authorities provide dwellings mainly for
renting, while private interests build mainly for sale to owner-occupiers. The
construction of private dwellings to rent has dwindled to a very low level.
Some 8 million new dwellings have been built in Britain since 1945, and
two families in every five now live in a post-war dwelling (see diagram below).
There remain a large number of older dwellings, some of which have been
kept in good repair and modernised, while many others—particularly in the
centres of cities—are unsatisfactory by modem standards. A survey carried
out in 1971 established that out of a total stock of 17-1 million dwellings in
England and Wales, some 1 -2 million (7 per cent) were unfit, while a further
2-9 million (17 per cent) lacked basic amenities. The demolition of slum dwell¬
ings and more advanced standards for new house-building (particularly in
the public sector) have, however, led to significant improvements in the general
quality of British housing. The average size of houses owned by public authori¬
ties has risen appreciably in the last 30 years and comparative European
statistics show that the degree of overcrowding in Britain (defined as more than
one and a half persons to a room) is lower than in most other countries.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Secretary of State for the Environment in England,
by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, and by the Minister
responsible for development in Northern Ireland.
In Great Britain most of the public housing is provided by the 1,600 local
housing authorities, which are responsible for ensuring that the supply of
housing in their areas is adequate. These are: in England and Wales, the

councils of county boroughs, boroughs, urban and rural districts; in London,
the Greater London Council, the London borough councils and the Common
Council of the City of London; and in Scotland, the town and county councils.
Other public housing authorities in Great Britain are the new town authorities
(see p. 172) and the Scottish Special Housing Association (SSHA), which was
established in 1937 to supplement building by local authorities in Scotland.
The central government departments specify certain standards for the con¬
struction and equipment of all new dwellings; these are enforced 1 e
local authorities. In the public sector, the government departments control the
numbers and costs of new dwellings through the exercise of loan approval for
local authority building schemes. Subsidies are made available to the authori¬
ties to assist them with housing costs, and guidance is given on design and
layout. The local housing authorities decide the details of expenditure within
the framework of controls, help and guidance provided by the Government.
Besides providing public housing, local authorities are involved in many
other aspects of housing policy, including paying house improvement grants to
the private sector, granting mortgages (see p. 183) to owner-occupiers, and
carrying out slum-clearance and redevelopment programmes. A growing
number are establishing housing advisory centres to provide the public with
information on local housing opportunities in both public and private sectors.
In Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, a public
body established in 1971, has assumed the housing responsibilities previously
exercised by local authorities and the Northern Ireland Housing Trust. On
taking over the functions of the new town development commissions in April
1973, the executive will become the sole public housing authority. The
executive is aided by a housing council representing each local authority area.
The main objectives of government housing policy are to secure a decent home
for every family at a price within its means, to offer families a fairer choice
between owning a home and renting one, and to ensure fairness between one
citizen and another in giving and receiving help towards housing costs. As t is
policy is implemented, government subsidies are available for local authorities
which incur financial deficits in clearing slums and providing adequate public
sector housing in areas of housing shortage. Another major objective is to

enable more people with moderate means to become owner-occupiers. The
Government is specially concerned to ensure that best use is made of the
existing housing stock.
A national system of rent rebate and allowance schemes is being introduced
to assist poorer tenants in both the public and private sectors. Operated by
local authorities, the schemes are financed by central government, where their
cost results in a deficit for the authorities.
Research into building materials and techniques, as well as into the needs of
families, is undertaken by the Directorate-General of Research within the
Department of the Environment, the Research and Development Group of the
Scottish Development Department, the Building Research Establishment, the
architects’ departments of major local authorities and the research groups in
big constructional firms. The government is advised on the need for, and
application of, research and development by the Construction and Housing
Research Advisory Council. Advice on ways of increasing productivity in
house-building is also provided by the National Building Agency.
Public housing authorities in Britain own some 6 million houses and flats
and in 1971 completed about 168,000 new dwellings—rather less than half
the total house construction in the country. The number of houses owned
by each authority varies; some have less than 100, while, for example, the
Birmingham City Council has nearly 150,000. Authorities plan their own
building programmes within the framework of government policy.
Local authorities in Great Britain meet the capital costs of new house con¬
struction by raising loans on the open market or by borrowing from the Public
Works Loan Board (see p. 74). Current expenditure, including maintenance
costs and loan interest and repayments, is met from rents, supplemented by
subsidies from the Exchequer and sometimes (particularly in Scotland) from
the rates.
Subsidies for the construction of public housing in 1971-72 totalled some
j£i8o million in England and Wales and about £45 million in Scotland. In the
past government subsidies have been designed to reduce the interest paid by
all local authorities on loans raised to finance house-building. These subsidies
have enabled many authorities to maintain rents at a level well below that
current in the open market. However, under the Housing Finance Act 1972
and Housing (Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1972, these are being
replaced by new subsidies designed to concentrate assistance on those authori¬
ties and tenants in greatest need.
Under the Acts all local authorities in England and Wales are to be required
to base their rents upon the ‘fair rent’ principle which already applies to much
rented accommodation in the private sector (see p. 184), while those in Scot¬
land must ensure that rents are at such a level that (taking new subsidies into
account) they can balance their housing expenditure without any deficit falling
on the rates. In England and Wales the resulting rent increases will enable an
increasing number of local authorities—especially those with a high proportion
of older council housing—to meet their housing expenditure without further
subsidies. Other authorities—those with substantial building programmes and
a large proportion of newer council housing—will be in deficit and they will be
assisted by new subsidies designed to help them balance expenditure. Similar
subsidies will assist those authorities in Scotland which have rising expendi¬
ture resulting from a heavy building programme.

Supplementary subsidies have been made available under the Acts to assist
local authorities throughout Great Britain with slum clearance. In addition,
the Acts provide for the introduction of a national system of rent rebates
covering all local authority tenants, and financed largely by government sub¬
sidy where they cause a deficit in housing revenue accounts. The scheme will
assist poorer tenants in meeting rents of accommodation suited to their needs.
In Northern Ireland, the capital expenditure of the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive is financed by loans raised on the open market or borrowed
from the Government Loans Fund. New dwellings completed by the executive
qualify for government subsidy at a rate which varies according to the number
of persons for whom each dwelling is designed.
In selecting tenants for new or vacant dwellings, local authorities normally
give preference to large families and to those living in overcrowded or un¬
satisfactory conditions, but they are free to allocate houses according to their
own schemes. Authorities normally establish waiting lists and treat applicants
(outside priority categories) in order of application; some require applicants to
fulfil residence requirements before they are accepted on waiting lists.
Although a number of authorities employ direct labour to build houses, most
building is undertaken by private firms under contract. Some authorities work
in consortia to make the best use of industrialised systems in their house¬
building programmes.
Dwellings are constructed to meet the needs of different sizes of household.
More than a quarter are of the single bedroom type suitable for smaller house¬
holds including the elderly, but the majority are designed for families and
have two or three bedrooms, two living rooms and a kitchen, bathroom and
lavatory. The standard of new local authority housing has improved consider¬
ably in recent years, particularly in the floor space provided and heating
systems installed. In England and Wales in 1970 almost 90 per cent of new
dwellings had central heating, and houses built for families of four or five
people had a superficial area of 960 square feet (89 square metres) and cost an
average of about £3,400 to build.
jjome In 1971 more than 196,000 private sector dwellings were completed, almost all
Ownership of which were intended for owner-occupation. The number of people owning
their own houses has more than doubled in the last 20 years, and the 9'5 million
owner-occupied dwellings in Britain now account for half of the total housing
stock. Although most owner-occupied houses were built for that purpose, in
recent years many private rented dwellings have been sold for owner-
occupation. Local and new town authorities are encouraged by the Govern¬
ment to offer houses for sale to sitting tenants and sales are increasing. The
Government also encourages voluntary housing societies which provide co-
ownership housing (a form of tenure similar to owner-occupation).
Mortgage Loans Loans to enable people to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
are available from various sources, including building societies, insurance
companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities.
Building societies (see also p. 220) are the most important of these agencies.
They do not build houses themselves but provide long-term loans on the
security of property bought for owner-occupation. They usually advance 80
to 90 per cent of the value of the houses. Loans are normally repayable over
periods of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years in exceptional circumstances)

by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and interest. The average price of
new houses mortgaged to building societies in 1971 was £5 >775'’ houses in
London and the south-east of England cost some 50 per cent more than the
national average. In 1971 the societies advanced some £2,740 million.
Local authorities are encouraged to concentrate their mortgage resources on
helping people with housing needs who are unable to obtain loans elsewhere.
Their mortgage lending in 1971 amounted to £175 million.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on their mortgage interest payments,
and in 1971-72 this amounted to £340 million. An alternative form of assist¬
ance—the option mortgage scheme—designed to help those with smaller
incomes was introduced in 1968. Under the scheme, borrowers receive, through
the lending agency, a subsidy (instead of tax relief) which reduces the rate of
mortgage interest which they pay by up to 3 per cent. Subsidy payments under
the option mortgage scheme amounted in 1971-72 to £17 million. Associated
with the scheme is the option mortgage guarantee scheme, whereby mortgage
loans of up to too per cent of the valuation of a house (not exceeding £7,5°°)
may be made to those participating.
In Northern Ireland, the Government pays lump sum subsidies to private
people who build dwellings for owner-occupation or for letting.
For building in the private sector the National House Builders’ Registration
Council (NHBRC) sets standards and enforces them by inspection and
certification. Over 95 per cent of all new private houses carry a ten-year
guarantee against any major structural defect. A two-year guarantee is also
given against faulty workmanship. Most building societies do not grant
mortgages on a new house unless it is covered by a NHBRC certificate.
During the last 20 years there has been a steady decline in the number of
rented dwellings available from private landlords—from nearly 45 per cent
of the housing stock in 1951 to about 14 per cent in 1971. Major factors in
this decline have been the increased demand for owner-occupation, the greater
availability of public rented housing, and the operation of rent restriction.
Privately rented dwellings form a high proportion of Britain’s older housing
and many have been demolished under slum clearance programmes. Of the
nearly 3 million dwellings which remain, about three-quarters are 50 years
old or more. While most landlords in Britain are private individuals with
limited holdings, a proportion of all privately rented housing is provided by
the small number of larger property owners, including property companies.
Most privately rented dwellings are subject to rent restriction under legisla¬
tion which provides separate machinery for dealing with unfurnished and
furnished accommodation. Tenants have a wide degree of security of tenure,
and eviction from any dwelling (without a court order) and harassment of
occupiers are criminal offences with severe penalties.
An estimated five-sixths of all private rented accommodation in Great Britain
is let unfurnished. Most unfurnished accommodation is subject to either ‘rent
control’ or ‘rent regulation’. Rent control applies to some half of the un¬
furnished dwellings—those with a 1956 rateable value of £30 or less (£40 in
London and Scotland). Tenants of controlled dwellings enjoy security of
tenure during their lifetime and pay fixed rents determined by reference to
1956 rateable values or, in Scotland, to historic rent levels. These are very low
by comparison with other rents. Landlords of controlled dwellings whose
houses are of a satisfactory standard or who improve them to such a standard
184

and Societies

are able to transfer them to the alternative system of rent regulation. The
transfer of all remaining controlled tenancies into the rent regulation system
is being speeded up.
Rent regulation was introduced in 1965 and applies to private unfurnished
dwellings (but not while they remain controlled under previous legislation)
with a 1965 rateable value of £200 or less (£400 in London). Under the
Housing Finance Act 1972, its principle has been extended to cover rented
dwellings (within the rateable limits) owned by public housing authorities
(see p. 181) and housing associations and societies.
Under the rent regulation procedure, a ‘fair rent’ may be fixed for a tenancy
by independent rent officers at the request of the landlord, the tenant, or both.
Factors taken into account by rent officers in determining rents include the
age, character and locality of the house. To eliminate any artificial value
derived from scarcity, the assumption is made that for similar dwellings to let
in the area demand does not exceed supply. If the landlord or tenant objects
to the decision of the rent officer, the case is referred to a rent assessment
committee. Since 1965 some 363,000 applications to fix fair rents have been
made in Great Britain. Once determined, the rent is not normally reviewed for
at least three years. Controlled and regulated tenants enjoy security of tenure.
The tenants of private unfurnished accommodation will be eligible for
assistance with their rent under a national scheme of rent allowances to be
introduced in January 1973. Operated by local authorities, the scheme is
financed mainly by government subsidies.
In Northern Ireland, houses of a 1939 rateable value of less than £50 are
subject to rent control with rents fixed by reference to their rateable value in
that year. However, prescribed increases were permitted in the rents of certain
controlled dwellings in 1951 and 1956, and dwellings of which landlords are
in, or obtain, possession and dwellings completed since 1956 are freed from
rent control.
The tenants or landlords of furnished housing under the 1965 rateable value
limits may refer tenancy agreements to a local rent tribunal for determination
of a reasonable rent. Tribunals may grant tenants security of tenure for up to
six months with a possibility of further periods if they so decide. Tenants in
furnished accommodation are to be covered by a rent allowance scheme.
Since the early 1960s the Government has done much to encourage the growth
of non-profit-making housing associations and societies, which between them
own some 170,000 dwellings in England and Wales 5 in 197^ they completed
over 10,000 new dwellings.
Housing associations have long existed as voluntary bodies set up for the
purpose of providing low-rent housing for people in need. The associations
have in the past borrowed money to finance house-building, mainly from local
authorities, which may make up to 100 per cent loans. Encouragement to pur¬
chase and convert old houses into new dwellings was offered by the Housing
Acts of 1969 which provided for a 20-year subsidy equivalent to three-eighths
of all charges (capital and interest) on loans raised for the purpose. Under the
1972 legislation housing associations will, like housing societies (see below), be
able to borrow from the Housing Corporation for new building. The rents of
housing association houses are to be based on fair-rent levels, and their tenants
are to be entitled to rent allowances (see p. 182). Where fair rents produce
insufficient revenue to cover the cost of a scheme, associations receive a
government subsidy covering a proportion of the deficit.
Housing societies build dwellings either for co-ownership by a group of
HOUSING
Improvement

occupants or to let at unsubsidised rents. Following a pilot scheme introduced
by the Housing Act 1961, the Housing Corporation was set up under the
Housing Act 1964 to stimulate the formation of such societies. Half of the
money needed for approved housing society schemes is advanced by building
societies, with the Housing Corporation providing the remainder. Rented
housing society dwellings like those owned by housing associations are being
brought within the fair-rent and rent-allowance schemes.
Private owners in Great Britain can obtain grants from local authorities to
improve their houses by providing amenities such as baths and for carrying
out other works to modernise their properties. Grants are also available for
converting large houses or other buildings into flats. The grant normally
amounts to half the approved cost of the works up to a grant limit of £ 1,000
(£1,200 in Scotland). If a house of three or more storeys is converted into
flats the upper limit of grant is £1,200 for each flat provided. A government
contribution amounting to three-quarters of each grant is paid to the local
authority. Aid on a similar basis is given by the Government to local authorities
and housing associations, but this includes the cost of buying properties for
conversion and improvement as well as that of carrying out works. Under the
Housing Act 1971 increased grants up to a maximum of £1,500 (£1,800 in
Scotland) are available until June 1974 to private owners and local authorities
within the development and intermediate areas (see p. 262).
Since improvement grants were first introduced in 1949, nearly 2 million
dwellings in England and Wales and some 150,000 in Scotland have been
improved with their aid. In 1971 an estimated 193,000 dwellings were improved
with grant aid—a 35 per cent increase over the previous year. Grants for house
improvement are also provided in Northern Ireland.
In order to tackle systematically the improvement of whole areas of older
housing, local authorities in England and Wales have been given powers to
declare ‘general improvement areas’. The aim in these areas is to encourage
householders to improve their dwellings with the aid of grants, while the local
authority uses its comprehensive powers to improve the environment. A
government contribution is available of half the local authority’s expenditure
on environmental improvements on costs of up to £200 a house. There are
similar grants in Scotland for the improvement of residential areas.
Over 2-5 million people have been rehoused in England and Wales since the
mid-1950s as a result of slum clearance programmes and during 1971 over
90,000 houses were demolished or closed in Great Britain as a result of slum
clearance and other action. Some housing authorities have eliminated all their
slums and others expect to achieve this within a very few years, but in Inner
London and certain of the older industrial towns, such as Glasgow and Liver¬
pool, clearance will take longer. Local authorities with major slum and over¬
crowding problems are being given special assistance by the Government
towards the cost of slum clearance. Their house-building programmes have
increased sharply in recent years and in many cases the designation of new
towns (see p. 170) nearby has further eased their housing problems.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or
can be provided by them, for people displaced by slum clearance. Owners
of land compulsorily acquired during slum clearance programmes receive as
compensation either the full market value or, if the land consists of unfit
houses, a restricted sum based on the value of the cleared site. There are special
arrangements to prevent hardship to owner-occupiers of unfit houses.
9 THE CHURCHES
The Church of
England
Every person living in Britain has the right of religious freedom and may mani¬
fest his faith in teaching, worship and observance without interference from
the community or the State. Churches and religious societies of all kinds may
own property, conduct schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech and in
writing. There is no religious or denominational bar to the holding of public
office, except in the case of the Lord Chancellor, where there is some doubt
whether existing statutory provisions would permit this office to be held by a
Roman Catholic.
In the services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, the
national hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of
England or the Church of Scotland provide the principal ministrations and
are paid a salary by the State for this part of their work. Clergy of other de¬
nominations may also be appointed as required. Voluntary schools (see p. 149)
provided by churches of any religious denomination may be wholly or partly
maintained from public funds. .
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number
of adherents to the various churches in Britain, since no inquiries are made
about religious beliefs in population censuses1 or other official returns, and
each church adopts its own criteria in counting its members. The membership
figures given in this chapter are therefore approximate.
The Church of England’s status as the established church of the land derives
from the Reformation in the sixteenth century. The Church’s relationship with
the State2 is one of mutual obligation—privileges accorded to the Church
balanced by certain duties which it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always
be a member of the Church, and promises on his or her accession to uphold it;
Church of England archbishops, bishops and deans are appointed by the
Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; all clergy take an oath of
allegiance to the Crown; the Church must obtain Parliament’s consent to
change its forms of worship (which are contained in the Book of Common
Prayer of 1662), although it has temporary powers to use alternative forms
without the need for parliamentary approval; and the two archbishops (of
Canterbury and York), the bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and
21 other bishops (according to their seniority as diocesan bishops) have
permanent seats in the House of Lords (see p. 32). Clergy of the Church of
England (together with those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of

of all churches should be permitted to stand for election to the House of Commons and,
if elected, to take their seats; and leading members of other churches should be mvi e

Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are legally disqualified from sitting
in the House of Commons (see p. 34).
The Church is organised into 43 dioceses, grouped into two provinces:
Canterbury, comprising 29 dioceses, and York, 14 dioceses. The dioceses are
subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which there are some 14,300. The
Archbishop of Canterbury is styled ‘Primate of All England’, and the Arch¬
bishop of York is ‘Primate of England’. Of the population born and resident in
the two provinces (roughly 46 million), about 60 per cent are baptised into the
Church and some 21 per cent are confirmed members.
The central governing body of the Church, the General Synod, is invested
with both spiritual authority and legislative and administrative powers; and
bishops, clergy and lay members are equally involved in decisions affecting the
whole range of the Church’s concern. In the dioceses, diocesan and deanery
synods are linked both with the General Synod and parish organisations.
Certain important issues must be referred for the approval of the dioceses
before they are finally decided by the General Synod. Lay members of the
Church are associated with church government in the parishes through
parochial church councils on which are members appointed by baptised
members of the Church over the age of 17 who are on the church electoral roll
of their local parish.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with
various aspects of the Church’s work—such as education, recruitment and
training for the ministry, and church work at home and overseas. It is re¬
sponsible for the Church of England schools (attended by about 11 per cent
of the 8-3 million pupils in the publicly maintained schools of England and
Wales in 1971); a number of direct grant and independent schools; church
colleges of education in England and Wales; theological colleges; and establish¬
ments for the training of women in pastoral work.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
matters of purely ecclesiastical concern.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses, with
contributions to a central General Synod Fund which the Central Board of
Finance administers for the maintenance of central services, including capital
expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants for training can¬
didates for ordination. (Although the State pays for or contributes towards
services provided by the Church—see p. 186—it makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses as such.) The Church’s endowment income
(from its assets amounting to over £421 million in land and investments) is
mainly administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely respon¬
sible for the payment of clergy stipends and the provision of finance for
pensions. The total net income (£25-4 million in 1970-71) has greatly increased
in recent years—in broad terms this has meant a rise in the stipends of the
poorer clergy and the introduction of schemes for better parsonage houses, for
church buildings in new areas of population, and for better pensions for clergy¬
men and their widows.
The Anglican Communion comprises 20 autonomous provinces in Britain and
overseas and two regional councils overseas with a total membership of over
60 million. In the British Isles, in addition to the established Church of
England, there are other, unestablished, Anglican churches: the Church in
Wales, the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years (most recently in 1968) the Lambeth Conference meets for
j88 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
unofficial consultation between all Anglican bishops; presided over by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, it has no executive authority, but enjoys great
prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other com¬
munions, and attitudes to political and social questions are widely studied.
The Anglican Consultative Council—an assembly of laymen and clergy as well
as bishops which meets every two years—is designed to provide consultations
within the Anglican Communion and to serve as an instrument of common
action.
The Church of The Church of Scotland, established by law, has a presbyterian form of
Scotland government. It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which
is established and yet is free’. It derives its status from the Treaty of Union
1707 and the Church of Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete
freedom in all spiritual matters. The Church appoints its own officers and its
decisions on questions of doctrine and discipline are not subject to parliamen¬
tary discussion or modification.
All ministers of the Church of Scotland are of equal status, each of some
2,000 churches being governed locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the
minister and the elected elders of the church; above the Kirk Session is the
Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the Synod, and finally the General
Assembly, consisting of elected ministers and elders, which meets annually
under the presidency of an elected moderator who serves for one year. The
Sovereign is represented at the General Assembly by the Lord High Com¬
missioner.
The training for the ministry (to which women may be admitted) has given
the Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The adult communicant membership of the
Church of Scotland is estimated at about 1-25 million.
The Free The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe the ‘nonconformist’
Churches churches of England (which dissent from certain practices of the established
church and, generally speaking, have distinctive convictions regarding organisa¬
tion and worship) and Protestant churches in other parts of Britain (apart from
the established Church of Scotland). Certain other churches and religious
associations have links with the main Free Churches.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with some 650,000
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evan¬
gelical revival by John Wesley, and is nowadays based on a 1932 union of most
of the separate Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not
join the union include the Independent Methodists (some 6,000 members) and
the Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 4,700 members).
Members of the Congregational Church in England and Wales (with some
167,000 members, the oldest community of dissenters in Britain) and the
Presbyterian Church of England (59,000 members) have voted to unite their
churches as the United Reformed Church—the first transdenominational
union of churches in Britain since the Reformation in the sixteenth century.
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of
which belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in
1813), within which over 2,000 churches have a total membership of about
202,000; in addition there are about 66,000 members of churches in the
separate Baptist Unions of Scotland, Wales and Ireland and other Baptist
chu relics •
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland

(with some 143,000 regular communicants in Northern Ireland); the Pres¬
byterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the
revivalist movement led in 1735 by Howell Harris and now numbers some
108,000; the Free Church of Scotland; the United Free Church of Scotland;
the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church
of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland; and the Non-
Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations in Britain include: the Unitarian and Free
Christian Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States
of America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an organised community
in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the British Province of the
Moravian Church, which is an international missionary church; and the Free
Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in
1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement. The Society of Friends
(Quakers)—with some 20,000 members in Britain—came into being in the
middle of the seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox and
works for peace and the relief of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 76
other countries. Within Britain it has some 175,000 active members operating
from more than 1,000 centres of worship and a total community strength of
about 350,000. Believing in a very practical expression of Christian concern, the
Salvation Army also has 191 centres providing help for some 10,000 people in
need.
Also there are a number of other religious organisations with churches or
assemblies in Britain, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church) with about 100,000 members, and the Christian
Scientists with some 304 branch churches and societies in the British Isles.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became tem¬
porarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish
hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in
1878. There are now 7 Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each under
an archbishop, 20 episcopal dioceses, and nearly 4,500 parishes. In Northern
Ireland, there are 9 dioceses, some of which have territory partly in the Irish
Republic. It is estimated that there are some 5-3 million adherents (including
children) to the Roman Catholic faith in the whole of Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
its children in their own faith, and requires that the children of marriages
between its own members and members of any other denomination should be
brought up as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children
in Britain are staffed by members of the religious orders for men and women,
who also undertake other social work such as nursing, child care, and the con¬
duct of homes for old people.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
Anglo-Jewish community in Britain dates from 1656; consisting of some
410,000 people, including both Sephardi (originally from Spain and Portugal)
and Ashkenazi (from Germany and Eastern Europe), it has become one of the
largest groups of Jews in Europe. The community is divided into two schools
of thought—the Orthodox, to which about 90 per cent of practising Jews
belong; and the Reform, which originated in 1840 and was followed in 1901 by
the Liberal Jewish movement. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group

(Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi
group. Synagogues in Britain number about 350. There has been an increase
in the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now attended by
about one in five Jewish children.
Immigrants to Britain from overseas Commonwealth and foreign countries
have established centres of worship, especially in London, for their own com¬
munities. Among the Christian communities represented are Orthodox,
Lutheran and Reformed Churches of various European countries and the
Armenian Church.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims and the Buddhists. The Muslims are the more widely repre¬
sented, their number in Britain being estimated at several hundred thousand.
There are mosques or Islamic centres in London, Manchester, Liverpool,
Bradford, Cardiff and in many of the other larger cities in Britain. The
community’s headquarters are at the London Central Mosque and Islamic
Cultural Centre.
Buddhism has several thousand adherents in Britain. The Buddhist Society
has its headquarters in London, with a Shrine Room and a Buddhist library
claimed to be one of the finest in Europe; there are also Shrine Rooms in the
three Viharas in London, one of which is run by Thai monks and supported
by the Thai Government. In Scotland there is a Shrine Room at the Tibetan
Centre.
The British Council of Churches, composed of representatives or consultant
observers from all the main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates
common action among the churches and seeks to further Christian unity. It
works with the Conference of Missionary Societies of Great Britain and
Ireland.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches in England and
Wales and aims to promote unity and joint action among the Free Churches
and to provide a channel for communication with central and local govern¬
ment authorities.
The Anglican-Roman Catholic Permanent Joint Commission explores points
of possible unity between the two Churches.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches in the British Isles also partici¬
pate in the World Council of Churches (of which the British Council of
Churches is an associate national council), which links together some 252
churches in 80 countries for co-operation and the study of common problems.
The Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding among
members of the two religions and deals with problems in the social field.
The New English Bible, a translation into modern English completed in
1970, is the result of co-operation among many of the Christian churches in
Britain.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made

10 THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY
Two features of fundamental importance to Britain’s economy are the con¬
tribution of manufacturing industry to national output—accounting for
one-third of the total—and the associated significance of trade. Britain ranks
third in world trade (after the United States and the Federal Republic of
Germany) and accounts for over 7 per cent of the total. It takes 9 per cent of
the world’s exports of primary products, and provides n per cent of the
world’s exports of manufactured goods.
As a result of a high level of agricultural productivity, Britain provides
just over half the food it needs from its own soil (no other major industrial
country has such a small proportion of its working population engaged in
agriculture—about 2-5 per cent). The remaining agricultural supplies are
imported, Britain being among the world’s largest importers of such products
as wheat, meat, butter, fodder grains, fruit, tea, tobacco and wool. Other
imports include raw materials (such as metallic ores, crude oil and timber) and
semi-manufactures (for example chemicals and textile yarns).
The imports are paid for by exports of (mainly) manufactured goods and by
invisible exports—earnings on overseas investment, travel, civil aviation,
British-owned shipping, financial, banking, insurance and other services.
Britain is one of the world’s largest exporters of aircraft, motor vehicles,
electrical equipment, finished textiles and most types of machinery. The
country’s competitive ability strongly influences the economic growth rate and
the standard of living. The gross national product per head of population rose
in real terms by over 22 per cent between 1961 and 1971.
The significant contribution made to export earnings by invisibles is in
large measure a reflection of Britain’s position as a major financial centre.
Its banks, insurance underwriters and brokers and other financial institutions
provide financial services throughout the world. The City of London provides
perhaps the most comprehensive and advanced service for a capital market
in the world.
Earlier
Development
of the Economy
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker and investor and supported a rapidly
increasing population at a rising standard of living. In the period from 1870 to
1890 British industry had a clear lead over that of other countries. Between
1890 and 1914, industrial competition from Europe and North America grew,
but its effects on Britain’s export industries, particularly cotton textiles and
coal, were offset by a number of factors including the rise in world trade and
the returns on Britain’s large overseas investments.
Following the first world war Britain’s older industries met increasing com¬
petition, for example, in coal and iron and steel from other European countries
and textiles from some eastern countries where labour was cheaper. The result
was heavy unemployment.
After 1932 levels of production and employment improved. The decade saw
a strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemicals and aircraft industries,
192

World War

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
while the construction of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the
building and ancillary industries.
In spite of generous aid from the United States and Canada, the second
world war ran down British domestic capital by about £3,000 million, through
shipping losses, bomb damage, and arrears of industrial maintenance and
replacements. Some £1,000 million worth of overseas investments were sold,
nearly half in North America, and new external debts of £3,000 million were
accumulated. By 1944 exports had fallen to less than one-third of their 1938
volume.
After the second world war rationing and other war-time controls were
relaxed gradually as civil production expanded and trade recovered. The
abolition of quantitative restrictions on imports, other than from the dollar
area, was largely completed by 1955. Exchange controls on transactions
between the sterling area and the rest of the world were also for the most part
lifted, and in 1958 convertibility of sterling on current account for all non¬
residents was introduced.
The period since 1945 has been one of rising production and living standards
and, until 1970, a low level of unemployment (generally 2-5 per cent or lower).
Economic growth, however, averaging nearly 3 per cent in the decade up to
1965 and over 2 per cent from then to 1971, has been rather slower and more
intermittent than in most other western Europe countries and there have been
certain persistent economic problems, especially repeated crises in the balance
of payments particularly during periods of relatively rapid economic growth.
In spite of the contribution from invisibles, there were in a number of years
substantial deficits on current account transactions with the rest of the world
and a low level of reserves meant there was little room for manoeuvre.
In the 1960s successive governments sought to deal with these difficulties
in a number of ways, restraining the growth in home demand and implement¬
ing policies designed to hold down rises in incomes and prices. During 1967,
however, the reserves fell to dangerously low levels and in November the
Government devalued sterling from $2-80 to $2-40 = £1. It then proceeded
to take a number of fiscal, monetary and administrative measures to bring about
a major reorientation of the economy.
Between 1967 and 1971 exports of goods and services increased in real terms
more than four times as fast as the gross domestic product. Visible trade,
which was in deficit throughout the 1960s, showed a surplus of £12 million
in 1970 rising to £299 million in 1971 when, on the balance of payments as a
whole, there was a record surplus on current transactions of over £1,000
million. By the end of May 1972 the reserves of gold and convertible currencies
stood at £2,740 million, the highest level recorded up to that time.
Inflationary trends, which gathered momentum in Britain as in most other
industrial countries during the 1950s and 1960s, became a cause of major
concern, although the pace of increase in wage rates moderated slightly towards
the end of 1971 and fiscal measures taken by the Government helped to lower
the rate of price increases (see p. I94)- While the underlying rate of unemploy¬
ment rose to a peak of about 4 per cent early in 1972, physical output remained
steady and there were marked gains in productivity.
As part of the realignment of the exchange parities of major currencies at
the Washington Conference in December i97I> which the main changes
were the devaluation of the United States dollar and the revaluation of the
Deutsche mark and the Japanese yen, the dollar-sterling parity was raised

from $2.40 to $2.6057 = j£i, representing a sterling revaluation of 8-57 per
cent against the dollar (see p. 194).
The principles of the Government in managing the economy are to extend
and encourage opportunities for profitable enterprise and to promote industrial
and regional development. Its executive policies are carried out by the main
government departments with economic responsibilities on a national scale:
the Treasury with its responsibility for public and national finance; the Depart¬
ment of Trade and Industry which is responsible for government policy on
most aspects of industry and trade and for regional policy; the Department
of Employment; the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; and the
Department of the Environment with its specific responsibilities for transport
and building and its general responsibility for all the relevant factors of en¬
vironment and amenity.
An important advisory body on general economic policy is the National
Economic Development Council, which brings together representatives of
government, management and trade unions under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister. It has an independent but publicly financed secretariat and
has established a number of economic development committees dealing with
different industries and services and different aspects of industry. Other
bodies responsible for advice on specific aspects of policy include the National
Joint Advisory Council (on labour matters), the Monopolies Commission (on
action to prevent the abuse of monopoly power, see p. 251) and the Office of
Manpower Economics (which provides the secretariat for bodies advising on
certain wages and salaries in the public sector and undertakes research on pay
questions generally).
On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy,
and problems such as inflation and industrial relations, the Government makes
known its purposes, and keeps in touch with developments throughout the
economy, by means of informal and continuous links with the chief industrial,
financial, labour and other interests.
Final responsibility for the broad lines of economic policy rests with the
Cabinet (see p. 45) which alone can take into account all the political, social
and economic considerations. There has for some time been a system of inter¬
departmental committees designed to help in co-ordinating departmental
policies in each of the main areas of government concern and to ensure that
final decisions command the agreement of the Cabinet as a whole. In 1970 a
Central Policy Review Staff, a small multi-disciplinary body, was established
within the Cabinet Office itself to work under the supervision of the Prime
Minister on the formulation and review of the Government’s general strategy.
The Government’s central economic purpose is to ensure that the economy
grows at a sustained and faster rate, bringing permanent improvement in the
level of employment and in living standards. In facing the problem of a
relatively high rate of unemployment it embarked, in July 1971, on a refla¬
tionary policy which was continued and extended in the 1972 budget. Follow¬
ing the earlier removal of hire purchase controls, consumer spending was given
further stimulation in the budget by reductions in the higher rates of purchase
tax and increases in personal income tax allowances and national insurance
pensions. Free depreciation (allowing the full expenditure on certain forms of
investment to be written off against profits in the first year for tax purposes)
was introduced in July 1971 for the development areas, and made available

nationally in 1972. The Government took powers to provide financial assist¬
ance on a selective basis to promote regional and industrial development, and
new regional development grants for the assisted areas were introduced
(see p. 262).
Within the framework of planned public expenditure (an increase at an
annual rate of about 3 -2 per cent in real terms between 1971-72 and 1975-76—
see p. 201) certain capital spending programmes, including infrastructure
works in areas of high unemployment, were brought forward in 1971 to make
use, in the short term, of resources that were under-employed.
To reduce the rate of inflation, measures have been taken to slow down the
rate of rise in prices. A policy was initiated by the Confederation of British
Industry (see p. 383) and agreed to by many of its member firms and the
nationalised industries for a 15-month period ending in October 1972, to keep
price increases of goods within a limit of 5 per cent—or, after July 1972, 5 per
cent on average for each firm. Other measures having a direct effect on prices
included the cuts in indirect taxation, such as the halving of selective employ¬
ment tax in 1971 and reductions in purchase tax in the 1972 budget.
Although the Government has taken no powers to act directly on the level
of wage settlements it has sought to reduce the rate of increase in both public
and private sectors as the basis for greater price stability.
Monetary policy has been in general expansionary. Interest rates declined in
1971-72 following reductions in the bank rate in April and September 1971
(from 7 to 5 per cent) but rose towards the middle of 1972, and bank rate was
increased to 6 per cent in June. There was a strong growth of bank lending
and consumer credit, and an increase in the rate of growth of money supply
(by 7^ per cent in the second half of 1971, and I2|- per cent in the first half of
1972). New methods of credit control introduced by the Government in 1971,
including the abandonment of quantitative controls over bank lending and the
conventional liquidity ratios observed by the clearing banks (see p. 212),
involved a shift to more flexible controls placing greater reliance on interest
rates.
In spite of the continuing high level of the reserves, international short-term
capital movements in June 1972 brought sterling under pressure. The Govern¬
ment announced that as a temporary measure the £ sterling would be allowed
to float, and exchange control would be applied to transactions with the sterling
area (see p. 228).
By the middle of 1972 the achievements of the Government’s policies had
included: a reduction in the rate of price increases, some moderation in the
average level of wage settlements, and a rise in spending on consumer goods,
including cars, and on house purchase. In May the first fall for 18 months in
the number of wholly unemployed was recorded, bringing the level down
to 3-6 per cent of the labour force. There were strong indications of a general
improvement in business optimism and in the outlook for production and
employment. The underlying trend in the growth of output between the
first halves of 1971 and 1972, excluding temporary dislocating factors, indi¬
cated a rise to the 4 to 4^ per cent annual level to which the Government’s
policies for the period had been directed.
The balance of payments on current account was very strong throughout
1971 and remained broadly in balance in the early part of 1972, although there
was some falling away owing to special factors. In April 1972, with the support
of the record high level of gold and convertible currency reserves, Britain was
able to repay the last of its debt to the International Monetary Fund and, for
Longer-term
Policies
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 195
the first time since 1964, had no short- and medium-term official debt out¬
standing.
The Government launched a major programme to strengthen the economy
in preparation for Britain’s entry into the European Communities with effect
from January 1973 (see p. 459), which will bring participation in a much larger
domestic market.
As a first step towards closer co-ordination in monetary matters Britain
began, in May 1972, to take part in the European Economic Community’s
scheme for narrowing exchange margins between the currencies of member
countries (see p. 233), although this participation was temporarily suspended
following the decision to allow the £ to float. The step was regarded as comple¬
mentary to the broader objectives of world monetary reform on which the
Government is engaged in international discussions. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer took the lead in 1971 in suggesting a development of the Special
Drawing Rights (SDR) system of the International Monetary Fund that would
make the SDR the unit in terms of which parities would be expressed, and the
main asset, in place of reserve currencies, in which countries would hold their
reserves. The Government has stated its willingness to envisage a gradual
rundown in the reserve role of sterling.
In 1971 the Government embarked on a reform of taxation (described by
the taxation authorities as the most comprehensive undertaken in the present
century) in order to increase its fairness and to reduce the economically
distorting effects of the present system. The reforms announced so far include
a unification of income tax and surtax into a more evenly graded system of
personal taxation, the introduction of a value added tax in place of purchase
tax and selective employment tax, and a new system of corporation tax (see
p. 208). The Government is also studying the possible replacement of estate
duty by an inheritance tax and (one of the most far-reaching of all the pro¬
posals) a tax credit system combining features of a negative income tax, to
supersede social security payments, with a new system of personal direct
taxation (see p. 206).
Policies are also being implemented to deal with the human and economic
problems arising from the under-employment of resources. With the expansion
of some sectors of industry (such as petrochemicals, electronics and man-made
fibres) and the contraction of others, including traditional industries such as
cotton textiles or certain types of heavy engineering (notably shipbuilding),
there is a need for workers to move to new types of employment and for
additional, expanding industries to move in to the regions of declining employ¬
ment opportunities. The Government’s measures to broaden the economic
base of these regions and to improve the infrastructure, described by the
Prime Minister as the most comprehensive and extensive programme of
regional regeneration ever undertaken in Britain, have involved heavy capital
spending and the introduction of regional development grants towards in¬
dustrial investment in plant, machinery and buildings (see p. 262).
Associated with regional policies, but of wider national significance also,
is the Training Opportunities Scheme (see p. 372). The Government regards
an adequate supply of trained manpower as essential to its strategy for achiev¬
ing sustained economic growth. It also seeks to provide easy access to training
in new skills as a means of giving people the chance to improve their economic
prospects and to achieve satisfaction in their working lives. The modernisation
of employment policies (see p. 370) and of the system of industrial relations
(see p. 382) is also regarded as essential to economic expansion.

THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ECONOMY
The following sections sketch briefly the salient features of Britain’s national
economy in recent years.
In 1971 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the
value of total goods and services produced at home and net income from
abroad) is estimated to have totalled £48,200 million. In real terms, that is,
after allowing for price changes, the increase over the 10 years since 1961 was
nearly 29 per cent.
About a third of total output can be attributed to manufacturing industry
and this proportion has remained more or less constant for a number of years.
The expanding industry groups are gas, electricity and water, communications
and services (financial, health and educational, professional and personal).
Agriculture, forestry and fishing account for a small and slowly declining
share, and mining for a small and more rapidly declining share. The relative
contributions of the distributive trades and transport are also declining. Table
10 summarises the contribution of each industry group to the gross domestic
product (at current prices).

The main trends since 1961 are a fall in the proportion of total available
resources devoted to personal consumption and to public authorities’ current
expenditure and a significant rise in the proportion devoted to exports.
Personal incomes before tax at current prices rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from some £22,890 million in 1961 to nearly £47,090 million in 1971—a
compound rate of about 7-5 per cent a year. The increase in consumer expen¬
diture at constant prices has, however, been very much lower—under 2-5 per
cent per annum. The difference is accounted for mainly by rising prices and
to a lesser extent by a higher incidence of direct taxation and increased personal
savings.
Income from employment in 1971 totalled £33,491 million and accounted
for 71*1 per cent of total personal income (compared with 717 per cent in
1961). The three other main sources of personal income were self-employment
(8-4 per cent), income from rent, dividends and interest (10-3 per cent), and
grants from public authorities (iO’2 per cent). The general pattern of income
distribution is thus dominated by the pattern for income from employment.
The effects of income from rent, dividends and interest, which tends to add to
the income of the already affluent, are relatively slight and to some extent
counterbalanced by the effect of grants from public authorities to those in need.
British direct taxation falls heavily on the rich and the combined effect of
taxation and transfer payments and benefits in kind is a redistribution of
income on more egalitarian lines. According to studies by the Central Statis¬
tical Office, the effect in 1970 was to raise the highest income among the poorest
fifth of households (that is, the income at the lowest quintile) from 34 to 54
per cent of the median income of all households. There are a number of
theoretical and practical limitations to these studies, but the broad result is
too marked to be in dispute.
The rise in the volume of consumers’ spending has been accompanied, in
Britain as in other advanced industrial countries, by changes in its pattern.
The proportions of expenditure devoted to food, and clothing and footwear
have been falling while the proportions spent on housing, fuel and light, and
cars and their running costs, have risen.

Current expenditure on goods and services by the central Government
(including the national insurance funds) and local authorities rose by 124 per
cent at current prices over the period 1961 to 1971 when it amounted to
about 21 per cent of the gross national product. The main cause of this increase
was the continuing growth of the social services, especially education. Defence
has recently accounted for a declining share of public expenditure on goods and
services—27 per cent in 1971 compared with 37 per cent in 1961 and a post¬
war peak of over 50 per cent in 1953.
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
national insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and

Fixed capital formation represents nearly 21 per cent of the gross national
product at factor cost. The total value of fixed assets in Britain, valued at
constant replacement cost, is estimated to have increased by 46 per cent
between 1961 and 1971 when their current replacement value, net of deprecia¬
tion, was some £135,000 million, of which about two-thirds was accounted for
by buildings and one-third by plant and machinery, and vehicles.
Of total investment in 1971, 90-2 per cent was accounted for by domestic
fixed capital formation, 0-3 per cent by physical increase of stocks and work in
progress and 9-5 per cent by investment overseas. Table 13 shows gross

domestic fixed capital formation by sector and type of asset. By industry group
about 21-4 per cent of gross domestic fixed capital formation was in manu¬
facturing industry, and about 16-4 per cent in the social and other public
services. Within the manufacturing sector, the largest investments were in the
chemical and allied industries, the engineering industries and the food, drink
and tobacco industries. The most marked trends in recent years have been
the increases in investment in the chemicals and textile industries (reflecting
respectively the expansion of petrochemicals and the growth of synthetics),
and the gas supply industry (mainly provision for natural gas).
Saving has made a significant contribution to the rising levels of investment
in all the main sectors of the economy. The extent to which each sector
contributed on balance, by way of lending, to the capital formation of the other
sectors (and to net investment abroad) in 1961 and 1971, or drew on the saving
of the other sectors is shown by the sector’s net acquisition of financial assets
(see Table 14).
The personal sector’s net contribution to capital formation rose by two-
thirds between 1961 and 1971. Increasingly, the main financial assets which
it acquires are insurance policies, interests in pension funds and deposits with
building societies and banks. National Savings reached the record level of
nearly £9,220 million at the end of 1971, net savings during the year totalling
over £580 million (see p. 214). The purchase of new dwellings constitutes the
main type of net fixed capital formation undertaken by the personal sector.
The companies’ sector, though a large gross saver, is also a large investor;
in 1970 its gross fixed investment considerably exceeded its saving, but in 1971
the two were broadly in balance.
200
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
TABLE 14
Saving and
Investment
Within the public sector, the central Government’s policy of restraining
home demand in the late 1960s is reflected in a large increase of £2,680
million in its saving between 1967 and 1970 to £3,723 million, while the fall to
£2,841 million in the following year is a consequence of the expansionary
policy after July 1971.
The level of local authorities’ fixed investment is three to four times that
of their saving, their capital needs being otherwise met by short- and long¬
term borrowing from the Government, banks and elsewhere.
The big investment programmes of the public corporations have been run¬
ning at over twice the level of their saving and, as with the local authorities,
the bulk of their remaining capital is borrowed from the Government.

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Between i960 and 1970 total public expenditure grew in real terms at about
twice the rate of the economy as a whole. The social services programmes now
take 41 per cent of the total, whereas in i960 they represented just over 35
per cent. On the other hand defence budget expenditure has declined from
17 per cent to 11 per cent.
Of the £24,470 million in 1971-72, £14,654 million represented direct
purchases of goods and services. Some 68 per cent of this expenditure was
for current purposes, for example, salaries and wages of the armed forces,
police, teachers, nurses and civil servants, and the running expenses of, foi
example, schools, prisons, the health service, and the armed forces. Capital
expenditure, on the hospitals and schools as well as on services such as housing
and roads, accounts for the remaining 32 per cent. Apart from the direct
purchases of goods and services public expenditure includes substantial trans¬
fers of money to individuals, companies and other institutions in the private
sector. The largest item of transfers is retirement pensions (£2,051 million
in 1971-72) but substantial amounts are paid also for supplementary benefits,
sickness benefit, family allowances, unemployment benefits and for a range of
subsidies, the largest being the agricultural subsidies to farmers, and grants
and loans. In total, transfer payments amounted to £7,204 million in 1971-72,
29 per cent of all public expenditure. These transfer payments, unlike public
authorities’ direct purchases of goods and services, do not represent a direct
demand on the nation’s product, but form part of the expenditure incurred
by the recipients; this transferred expenditure will be smaller than the amount
of the gross sums transferred, because of the tax incurred on the payments and
of any savings that take place. Thus, while the total of public expenditure is
the equivalent of half the gross national product, the public sector’s expendi¬
ture accounts for about one-third of the nation’s output.
Up to i960 discussion of public expenditure centred on the expenditure of the
central Government departments, including grants to local authorities, set
out in the annual Estimates which were presented to and approved by Parlia¬
ment for one year ahead. These Estimates did not (and do not) cover certain
major areas of public expenditure, such as the nationalised industries capital
expenditure, the bulk of the payments from the national insurance fund, and
local authorities’ expenditure financed from the local rates on property.
Following the recommendations of the Plowden Committee on the Control
of Public Expenditure in 1961, surveys were instituted of the whole range of
public expenditure, for the period five years ahead. The surveys take place
each year, rolling forward the period to be covered. They are carried out by
officials in the spending departments and the Treasury, under the direction
of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee.
The primary purpose of the survey is to present to ministers an up-to-date
assessment of the cost of their existing policies as a basis for decisions about
the total and the composition of public expenditure over the whole area over
which the Government has control or influence. The five-year period covered
by the surveys gives the Government the opportunity to plan ahead significant
changes without causing wasteful disruption in existing services.
The initial recosting normally takes place in the first half of the year, to be
followed by ministerial consideration of the survey report. Since 1969 the
public expenditure plans as settled by the Government have been published
towards the end of the year, forming the basis of an annual public expenditure
debate in the House of Commons.
Early in 1971 the Expenditure Committee of the House was created, replac-
FINANCE

ing the Estimates Committee, to consider public expenditure, and its reports
will provide further information on which the debates can draw. The Expendi¬
ture Committee has formed sub-committees, one to consider general Govern¬
ment financial control and the presentation of information about public
expenditure, and others considering public expenditure in particular areas:
defence and external relations; education and the arts; employment and social
services; trade and industry, and environment; and the Home Office. These
committees can question departmental ministers as well as their officials, and
can take evidence also from witnesses outside Government.
The Estimates are submitted by the departments concerned to the Treasury
in the December preceding the 1st April commencing the financial year to
which they relate. This ensures that they fit satisfactorily into the public
expenditure plans.
The Estimates are presented to Parliament shortly before the presentation
of the Budget (see p. 204) and are approved by Parliament, by means of an
annual Appropriation Act, in July (expenditure to this date from 1st April is
covered by a Vote on Account approved by Parliament before the beginning
of the financial year). The Estimates are debated by the House of Commons
during 29 days (known as Supply days) allocated for this purpose. The choice
of subject for debate on these days rests with the Opposition, and normally
general questions of policy relevant to the Estimates are discussed, although
members can discuss the detail of the Estimates if they wish.
Certain expenditures are not approved annually, but are covered by Acts
of Parliament allowing payments to continue from one year to another. These
include the financial provision for members of the royal family, and salaries
and pensions of judges. Further, Government lending and service of debt are
carried out on a continuing basis by Act of Parliament through the National
Loans Fund, a fund separate from the general fund, known as the Consolidated
Fund.
The Treasury’s control of expenditure is closely linked with Parliamentary
control through the requirement laid down by Act of Parliament in 1861, that
Treasury approval should be given for all expenditures in excess of Estimates,
or outside Estimates. The Treasury’s authority is required for any new item
of expenditure, for any increase in expenditure beyond that originally author¬
ised, for any change in policy which means an increase in expenditure, and
for extra-statutory payments. This requirement is, however, subject to any
delegated authority which may be given to departments to deal with particular
types of expenditure. Treasury control does not imply final sanction by the
Treasuiy—in the last resort the decision is taken by the Government as a
whole, and carried out subject to Parliamentary consent.
Control over issues of money to departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, a permanent officer of
the Crown. Since 1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller he controls
receipts and issues of public money to and from the Consolidated Fund and
the National Loans Fund, and as Auditor General he audits departmental
accounts and submits his report on the Appropriation Accounts and other
accounts, as required by statute, to Parliament. His statutory function is to
ensure that all expenditure is properly incurred, for example, that no payments
are made which go beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury
sanction has been obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
been encouraged by successive Public Accounts Committees to examine
departmental expenditure for cost-effectiveness with a view to drawing their
attention to any cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made by
the Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a select committee
called the Public Accounts Committee. This was first set up in 1861, for the
purpose of ensuring that expenditure was properly incurred in accordance
with the purpose for which it was voted and with any relevant Acts of Parlia¬
ment. The terms of reference of the committee are simply to examine the
accounts and these terms have been widely interpreted by successive com¬
mittees which have investigated whether full value has been obtained for the
sums spent by departments and have examined cases in which the administra¬
tion appears to have been faulty or negligent. The committee has therefore
become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and inefficiency. It
embodies the findings in reports which may be debated in the House of
Commons. Its recommendations are considered by the Treasury in consulta¬
tion with departments and put into effect, so far as they are accepted, according
to Treasury instructions. A reply to each report is submitted to Parliament by
Treasury Minute and both documents are debated at the beginning of the
following session.
THE BUDGET The Budget (an old word which meant a bag containing papers or accounts)
is a set of proposals, made annually, normally in April, for financing Govern¬
ment expenditure. They are described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in
the Budget speech, against the background of a statement of the Government’s
past and prospective revenue and expenditure, and the Chancellor s assess¬
ment of the position and prospects of the economy as a whole.
The Budget speech is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means
resolutions, in which the proposals are embodied. These resolutions, when
passed by the House, become the foundation of the Finance Bill, which expresses
the proposals in statutory form.
The Budget is principally an instrument of economic management, and the
annual Budget speech is normally the main occasion for a review of general
economic policy. The scale of Government expenditure and taxation has an
important influence on the general level of output and distribution of resources.
The Budget judgment is therefore concerned with the balance between the
total of goods and services which are likely to be available to the nation and
the total claims which are likely to be made on them. Taxation provides the
Government with a means of exerting a considerable influence on the overall
pressure of demand. Taxation measures can also have a broader influence on
the pattern of demand and the long-term performance of the economy.
The Budget deals with the means of financing expenditure and particularly
with changes in taxation and not primarily with expenditure itself. On occasions
changes affecting expenditure, such as increases in pensions and family
allowances, have been announced in the Budget speech as have financial and
monetary measures not related to the Finance Bill, such as changes in Bank
Rate and exchange control policies. Such measures, however, are not reflected
in the resolutions or the Finance Bill but are applied by whatever procedure
is appropriate to implement them—separate legislation, statutory instruments
or administrative action.
The scope of the Budget and that of the Finance Bill which follows it are
different although they are closely interrelated. The Budget is essentially
204
The Public
Accounts
Committee
FINANCE
205
concerned with the measures that give effect to the Chancellor’s decision to
increase or reduce to an appropriate extent the predicted level of demand on
economic resources by use of the instruments at the Chancellor’s disposal, and
especially by increasing or reducing the yield of central government taxes.
The tax changes made necessary by the Budget judgment are enacted in the
Finance Act. But the Finance Act also provides the annual opportunity for
non-Budgetary changes in the tax system and for certain other financial
matters, such as provisions relating to Government borrowing.
The bulk of the taxation proposals in the Budget are concerned with changes
in the rates or coverage of existing taxes, the introduction of new taxes or the
abolition of existing ones, and changes in the administrative machinery relating
to taxation. In two cases however—income tax (including surtax) and corpora¬
tion tax—annual Ways and Means resolutions followed by a Finance Bill clause
are necessary to maintain the taxes in existence at all, since they are in form
annual taxes. It is this which makes an annual Budget at or about the beginning
of each financial year a necessity.
New taxes and changes in certain existing taxes, like other changes in statute
laws, do not come into effect until the Finance Bill has received Royal Assent
(in the case of the annual Budget, normally at the end of July) or at some other
date laid down in the Bill. Some changes, however, come into effect earlier,
usually from Budget Day or from the start of the tax year, under the Provi¬
sional Collection of Taxes Act. This enables the Government to collect certain
taxes provisionally, income tax for example, either at the rates previously in
operation or at new rates following the passing of the appropriate Ways and
Means resolutions. Tax proposals are not limited to the annual Budget. They
may be made at other times in the year, to meet changes in economic circum¬
stances. To this end the Treasury may activate the ‘Regulator’, a power to
increase or reduce by up to 10 per cent the principal Customs and Excise
revenue duties and purchase tax. Alternatively the Government has separate
powers to alter purchase tax rates by Order.
The economic background to the Budget and the transactions of the central
Government and the public sector as a whole are presented in the Financial
Statement and Budget Report (see Bibliography, p. 477) which is laid before the
House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when opening the
Budget. The report is in three parts: the economic context of the Budget;
the accounts of the public sector; and the accounts of the central Government,
for the past financial year and the one immediately ahead. The accounts are
designed to assist in assessing the impact of changes in revenue and, where
relevant, public expenditure on the economy.
The accounts of the public sector show the transactions of the central
Government, local authorities, nationalised industries and other public corpora¬
tions combined into a consolidated account covering the whole of the public
sector. The transactions within the public sector cancel out on consolidation
and the net balance on the consolidated account represents therefore the
borrowing required by the public sector from the private and overseas sectors.
The accounts of the central Government show transactions both on the
conventional cash basis of exchequer accounting and in accordance with the
framework of the national income accounts.
Central government borrowing may be in the form of borrowing from the
public either through the National Savings Movement (see p. 214) or by
borrowing on the market by means of new issues of securities. New issues of
government securities are made from time to time for the purpose of refinancing

maturing issues (conversion loans) or to raise new money (issues for cash).
The capital requirements of the nationalised industries are met by the central
Government while those of the local authorities are met partly by the central
Government through the Public Works Loan Board (see p. 74) partly
by borrowing direct from the public, although some nationalised industries
and local authorities have obtained statutory power enabling them to borrow,
with Treasury consent, in foreign currencies.
After allowing for the Budget changes in 1972, the central Government’s
borrowing requirement for 1972-73 is expected to be £2,933 million, compared
with £659 million in 1971-72, and that for the public sector as a whole £3,358
million compared with £1,336 million in 1971-72.
Table 16 shows total revenue from taxation and other sources anticipated
in 1971-72 and 1972-73 together with the effects of the Budget changes.
Far-reaching changes in the structure of personal and company taxation and
in taxes on expenditure were announced in the 1971 Budget. The changes
will constitute the most comprehensive reform of the British tax system in this
century. The present system of income tax and surtax will be replaced by a
single graduated personal tax. Company taxation will be reformed so as to
remove the discrimination against distributed profits. As from April 1973 b°th
selective employment tax (SET) and purchase tax will be abolished and a
value-added tax (VAT) will become operative. Unlike purchase tax, which is
collected at a single stage, VAT is collected in instalments with liability to
tax arising on the ‘value added’ at each stage in the production and distribution
process. VAT, like purchase tax, falls on imports. VAT is not charged on
exports and unlike purchase tax it enables tax entering indirectly into export
costs to be rebated. Further information about these changes was given in the
1972 Budget, notably the choice of an imputation basis for corporation tax and
of a single basic rate, provisionally set at 10 per cent, for VAT. Also announced
were the new and longer-term proposals for a tax credit system to improve and
simplify the PAYE system of taxation and the system of social security.
The over-riding aim of the 1972 Budget was to sustain a higher rate of
economic growth in Britain. Tax reductions were made amounting to £1,200
million in the financial year 1972-73. These measures, together with a new
combination of national and regional investment incentives, were designed to
raise the rate of economic growth to 5 per cent (second half 1971 to first half
1973 annual rate). .
Full details of Budget proposals are published each year in the Financial
Statement and Budget Report.
The three principal sources of tax revenue are first, taxes on income, which
include income tax, surtax and corporation tax; second, taxes on capital,
which include estate duty and capital gains tax; and third, taxes on expendituie
(including taxes on the ownership or use of certain assets) these include not
only customs and excise duties and the purchase tax, but also the selective em¬
ployment tax, local rates, stamp duties and licence duties (for example, on
motor vehicles). Taxes on individual (but not corporate) incomes are progres¬
sive taxes in that larger incomes and estates bear a proportionately higher rate
of tax. The Board of Inland Revenue collects the taxes on income and capital
and the stamp duties; the Board of Customs and Excise collects the most im¬
portant taxes on expenditure, the customs and excise taxes and the purchase
tax, while a variety of authorities is responsible for the collection of the
Income Tax

remainder, including the Department of Health and Social Security for the
selective employment tax.
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April, which is at present 3875 per cent. The effective rate on earned
income, after taking two-ninths earned income relief into account, is approxi¬
mately 30 per cent. The tax imposed on an individual is graduated by means
of personal allowances and reliefs, and by the surtax. Married couples receive

higher allowances than a single person. Husband and wife may choose to have
the wife’s earnings charged separately for tax on condition that the former
receives the single personal allowance instead of the married allowance.
A single person earning £1,500 a year pays £273 in income tax, while a
married man with the same earned income pays £219; if he has two children
under the age of 11, his tax falls to £115; when the children are between the
ages of n and 16, the tax is £96; if the children are over 16 and receiving full¬
time education, £76. The range of tax (including surtax where applicable)
payable by a single person varies from, for example, £123 on an earned income
of £1,000 a year to £3,859 on an earned income of £10,000; if the income is
entirely from investment, tax liability on £1,000 will be £209 and £2,271 on
£5,00°.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay as
You Earn’) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons resident in the
United Kingdom. The main exceptions are that interest on certain United
Kingdom government securities belonging to persons not ordinarily resident
in the United Kingdom is exempt; and income from certain classes of posses¬
sions abroad is chargeable not on the amount of income arising but on the
amount of income remitted to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has
entered into agreements with many countries providing for relief from double
taxation; where such agreements are not in force unilateral relief is allowed.
The surtax, which is essentially an income tax at higher rates, is charged on
personal incomes exceeding £3,000 a year after deducting certain personal
allowances in excess of the single person’s basic allowance. In addition, the
same earned income relief as for income tax and a special earnings allowance
(not exceeding £2,000) are deductible from earned income only. Surtax is
imposed at rates which increase progressively until, on the portion of taxable
income above £15,000, the combined rate of income tax and surtax payable
in 1972-73 (being income tax for 1972-73 and surtax for 1971-72) reaches
88-75 per cent.
Companies are liable to corporation tax on both their profits and their capital
gains. In addition, a company deducts income tax from dividends and other
distributions and pays it over to the Inland Revenue as a separate matter from
its own liability.1 The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the
Budget for the past financial year; for 1971 it is 40 per cent. The tax is assessed
on the profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate for the
financial year in which the accounting period falls. The basic rule for the
calculation of income for corporation tax purposes is that, except for special
provisions, it is computed in accordance with income tax principles.
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of all property which passes at death.
The charge to duty is not limited to property owned by the deceased but may
1 From April 1973, a company will pay corporation tax at a single rate on all its profits,
whether distributed or not. Income tax will no longer be deducted from dividends but a
company which distributes profits to its shareholders will be required to make to the
Inland Revenue an advance payment of corporation tax. In general, that advance pay¬
ment will be set against a company’s corporation tax bill and the recipient ot the
distribution in respect of which the advance payment was made will be entitled to a tax
credit.

extend to other property, for example, to trust funds from which the deceased
received income in his lifetime and to gifts made by the deceased within seven
years of his death (one year in the case of a gift for public or charitable pur¬
poses). Since the 1972 Budget estates not over £15,000 are exempt from duty.
On estates of a higher value duty is chargeable by reference to rates ranging
from 25 per cent to 75 per cent, applied to successive slices of the estate. In
addition, property going to a surviving spouse up to a sum of £15,000 is left out
of account for estate duty purposes, so that where a man leaves his whole
estate to his widow no duty is payable at all unless the estate exceeds £30,000.
Capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax
or, in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax for persons other
than companies is 30 per cent, but in the case of individuals may be less,
depending on their circumstances. Certain assets are exempt from tax including
the principal private residence, chattels worth less than £1,000 (and any
chattels, except those used for the purpose of a trade, with a predictable life of
less than 50 years), private motor cars, and National Savings Certificates. The
1971 Finance Act also exempted an individual from capital gains tax where the
total proceeds of disposals do not exceed £500 in any year. All gains are now
subject to long-term capital gains tax whatever the length of period of ownership
except for gains on gilt-edged securities which continue to be exempt from
capital gains tax if held for more than 12 months.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the
Customs and Excise Department, namely, the duties on tobacco, hydrocarbon
oil, alcoholic drinks, purchase tax, protective duties, betting and certain
miscellaneous items.1 In British usage the distinction between customs and
excise depends on whether the goods are imported (customs duties) or pro¬
duced in Britain (excise duties). These taxes are sometimes known as indirect
taxes since they are normally paid by the importer, manufacturer, or whole¬
saler, who adjusts the prices charged to customers accordingly. In 1972 the tax
burden was equivalent to about £0-22^ on a gallon of petrol, £0-24 on a packet
of 20 standard plain cigarettes, £2-20 on a bottle of whisky, and £o-o\% on a
pint of beer of average strength.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has power to vary by Order by up to 10
per cent the rates of purchase tax and any of the other main groups of customs
and excise duties (that is, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, oil and the minor revenue
duties). This power, known as the ‘regulator’, requires annual renewal.
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly all of them consumer
goods, at three rates, which are currently 11^ per cent, 18 per cent and 25 per
cent of the wholesale value. Articles subject to revenue duties of customs and
excise are in general exempt from this tax; other goods free of purchase tax
include food (other than confectionery, soft drinks, ice cream and crisps), fuel,
books and newspapers, young children’s clothing and footwear, certain non¬
proprietary drugs and medicines, and some household appliances. Purchase
tax is to be abolished after April 1973 (see p. 206).
The principal betting duties are: the pool betting duty (which applies to
football pools and betting by coupon at fixed odds) charged at a rate of 33^ per
cent of the stake money; and the general betting duty, which is charged at the
rate of 6 per cent of stake money except for on-course betting which is charged
at 5 per cent. Gaming is taxed at different rates mainly by licence fees.

Taxes on motor vehicles are collected by the local taxation authorities (the
county or county borough councils in England and Wales and the correspond¬
ing councils in Scotland); the proceeds are paid by the local authorities into
the Consolidated Fund. The licence duty on a private motor car is £25 a year;
motor cycles and three-wheel vehicles, etc., pay £2-50, £5 or £10 a year
according to engine capacity.
The selective employment tax was introduced in the 1966 Finance Act. Its
rates were halved in the 1971 Budget when it was also announced that the tax
would be abolished as from April 1973 (see p. 206). Following the 1971
Budget reduction, which took effect on 5th July 1971, it is paid by all em¬
ployers throughout Britain at a rate per week of £1*20 for men, j£o-6o for
women and boys and £0-40 for girls. The tax is refunded to eligible employers
in manufacturing industries, most of transport and communications, agri¬
culture and the extractive industries. Most activities of the nationalised
industries and local authorities also receive repayment of the tax. Employers in
construction, distribution, insurance, banking and miscellaneous services pay
the tax without refund, except that two-thirds of the tax is refunded for all
employees aged 65 and over for part-time staff working fewer than 21 hours a
week.
The National Debt increased rapidly during and immediately after the first and
second world wars. It rose from £650 million in 1914 to £7,435 million at the
end of the first world war, and from £7,131 million in 1939 to £23,637 million
in 1946. On 31st March 1972 the total National Debt (provisional) was £35,854
million, of which £1,883 million was repayable in currencies other than
sterling, mainly to the United States and Canadian Governments. Of the
£33,971 million of internal debt, £4,089 million was short-term debt, mainly
in the form of 91-day Treasury bills, while the long-term loans included a
variety of stocks, bonds, loans and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest
(ranging from 2^ to 9 per cent) and with fixed or indeterminate dates of re¬
payment.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole, under
which public revenues, with a few minor exceptions, are paid into the Ex¬
chequer Account, from which no money can be withdrawn except on the
authority of Parliament. That authority is expressed in the case of Consolidated
Fund charges in permanent legislative form, and in the case of Supply Services
by annual Appropriation Acts1 based on estimates prepared by departments
and sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major sources of revenue flowing into the Northern Ireland Exchequer
are the main national taxes imposed by the United Kingdom Parliament over
the whole country and paid, in the first instance, into the United Kingdom
Consolidated Fund. These taxes, which are referred to in the Government of
Ireland Act 1920 as reserved taxes, comprise the Inland Revenue group
(income tax, surtax, corporation tax and capital gains tax) and customs and
excise duties on goods. After the cost of collecting these taxes in Northern
Ireland (and the cost of some other reserved services) and an Imperial Contri¬
bution have been retained in the United Kingdom Consolidated Fund, the
balance, termed the ‘Residuary Share of Reserved Taxes’, is paid to the
Northern Ireland Exchequer where it joins up with the transferred taxes

(that is, where taxation powers have been transferred to the Northern Ireland
Parliament) to form the public income. Among items of Transferred Tax
Revenue are estate duties, stamp duties, betting duties, various excise licence
duties, motor vehicle duties and selective employment tax.
A Joint Exchequer Board, representative of the Treasury and the Ministry
of Finance for Northern Ireland, was constituted in accordance with the
Government of Ireland Act 1920, to determine the amount of Reserved
Revenue and the cost of Reserved Services attributable to Northern Ireland
for each year, the amount of the Imperial Contribution, and such other ques¬
tions affecting the financial relations of the two Governments as may be
referred to it.
In the Northern Ireland Financial Statement for 1972-73 (year ending 31st
March), total revenues were forecast at £442 million and expenditure at £441
million. After allowing for the Imperial Contribution, provisionally estimated
at £500,000 there was a Budget surplus of £21,200 on the assumption that
some £26-2 million of capital expenditure shown in the Estimates will be met
from available balances or be charged to borrowing.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £452 million on 31st March
1972 is covered by repayable advances and investments held by the Ministry
of Finance.
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have been
established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific
purposes. In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern, the
principal funds being those relating to National Insurance and government
loans. The latter constitutes a pool of capital money available mainly for local
and public authority borrowings; on 31st March 1972 a sum of approximately
£319 million was outstanding against such borrowers.
THE CENTRAL BANK
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It comprises
a central bank; commercial banks which carry on the usual main banking
services; the United Kingdom offices of banks whose main business is in other
countries; merchant banks and other specialised institutions.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and
Royal Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by
the Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. As the central bank,
the Bank acts as banker to the Government, to overseas central banks and to
commercial banks; it is the note-issuing authority and the registrar for some
200 government, nationalised industry, local authority, public board and
Commonwealth government stocks. As agent for the Government the Bank
administers exchange control. On behalf of the Treasury it manages the
Exchange Equalisation Account (EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves
of gold and foreign exchange; using the resources of the EEA the Bank designs
its interventions in the foreign exchange market both to prevent undue
fluctuations in the exchange value of sterling and to conserve the means of
making payments abroad.
As banker to the Government the Bank examines and seeks to anticipate
banking and financial problems and to undertake the appropriate operations
in the money, capital and the foreign exchange markets; consequently the Bank
has a major responsibility for advising the Government on the formulation of
monetary policy and for its subsequent execution (see p. 212).
In implementing monetary policy the Bank is ready to act daily in the money

market, by buying or selling Treasury bills, and similarly in the market for
government stocks. A prime concern is to maintain orderly conditions and,
when necessary, the Bank also exerts influence on interest rates; an important
instrument in this context is Bank Rate, which is the minimum rate at which
the Bank will discount approved bills of exchange for the members of the
London Discount Market or will normally lend to them; a wide range of other
short-term interest rates is related to it.
The Bank is the recognised channel of communication between the commer¬
cial banks and other financial institutions of the City of London on the one
hand, and the Government on the other.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government securities and other assets. The Scottish and Northern
Ireland banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart from an
amount specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered by Bank
of England notes and by coin. The provision of coin for circulation is the
responsibility of the Royal Mint, a government department.
Following discussions by the Bank of England with the banks, the hire pur¬
chase finance houses and the discount houses, new arrangements for the
control of credit came into effect from September 1971. While it is still neces¬
sary for the Government, as an indispensable part of economic management, to
regulate the development of credit and the money supply, the new system has
replaced rigid quantitative controls over lending in sterling with policies for
influencing bank and finance house lending which combine effective control
with greater flexibility and freedom for these institutions. The techniques now
in operation involve more reliance upon changes in interest rates. The ceiling
controls on lending by the banks and finance houses have been removed and
the London and Scottish clearing banks have abandoned their collective
agreements on interest rates. Greater scope for competition and innovation
by these institutions has thereby been introduced into the domestic economy.
THE PRIVATE SECTOR
The primary business of the deposit banks is the receipt, transfer and encash¬
ment of deposits. The principal deposit banks are the six London clearing
banks, three Scottish banks and two Northern Ireland banks. Mergers have
resulted in the formation of six banking groups, four based in London and two
in Scotland. The two Northern Ireland banks are owned by London clearing
banks, but two groups of banks based in the Republic of Ireland also operate
in Northern Ireland. _
At the end of 1971 current and deposit accounts with deposit banks operat¬
ing in Britain totalled £14,547 million, and accounted for nearly 40 per cent
of the total deposits (in sterling and foreign currencies) of the banking sector,
which also includes the National Giro, the accepting houses, overseas banks,
other banks and the discount market. The deposit banks provide full banking
services throughout Britain, and operate through over 14,000 branches.
Several of them have interests in British overseas and Commonwealth banks,
and in other banks which have been formed specially to compete in inter¬
national markets. They have also acquired substantial interests in hire-purchase
finance houses, and some have set up their own unit trusts.
Together with the Bank of England the London clearing banks make up the
membership of the London Bankers’ Clearing House. In 1971 cheques, drafts,
FINANCE
2I3
bills and bankers’ effects passing through the interbank debit clearing system
averaged in value £70,363 million monthly, while the average monthly value
of the credit transfer clearing was £1,552 million.
Current account balances with the deposit banks are repayable on demand
and no interest is paid on them, but on deposit account balances interest is paid
at a rate generally 2 per cent below individual banks’ base rates. The deposit
banks’ more liquid assets consist of: cash, balances at the Bank of England,
money at call (mainly loans to discount houses), and their holdings of Treasury
and commercial bills; the banks also hold a proportion of their assets as port¬
folio (mainly British Government securities) or trade investments.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts and partly in the form of loans (with or without
collateral security). The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total
deposits in 1971 averaged 53 per cent.
The bank giro, originally introduced as the credit transfer scheme, and the
direct debiting system, by which a creditor with the prior approval of the
debtor may claim money due to him direct from the latter’s banking account,
have helped to improve the money transmission services. Another banking
innovation has been the introduction by some banks of automatic cash dis¬
pensing machines. Credit cards have become popular for the settlement of
accounts in retail shops; and cheque cards enable the card holder to cash a
cheque up to £30 at any office of the major British and Irish banks.
The Post Office National Giro which was opened in October 1968 to provide
a low-cost current account banking and money transfer service, is operated
through most post offices in Britain. All accounts and transactions are main¬
tained by means of a computer complex at the National Giro Centre at Bootle,
near Liverpool. Giro now has more than 450,000 accounts with total balances
in excess of £55 million. The level of weekly transactions had risen from 500,000
in September 1969 to 1-35 million by September 1971. Following a review of
its operations in 1971 the service will be reshaped so that it can profitably offer
a competitive service to the public, to commerce, to local authorities and
government. All gas and electricity boards operate Giro accounts as do all major
local authorities. More than 500 firms are using the Giro’s cash collection
service making more than 25,000 deposits a day. Seven of the ten largest
companies in Britain now hold Giro accounts.
There are also some 37 British overseas and Commonwealth banks, many of
which have their headquarters in London. They provide a comprehensive
banking service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of
trade not only between Britain and other countries but also between third
countries. There are also currently in London about 37 United States banks,
50 European banks, 13 Japanese banks and over 30 other foreign banks.
The merchant banks have an influence on Britain’s financial affairs which is
much greater than their size in relation to other financial institutions might
suggest. Traditionally merchant banks have been primarily concerned with
acceptance credits1 and with the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf of their
1 Acceptance credits have been defined as fundamentally three-month operations
financing exports from and imports to Britain and to other markets. The expression is
derived from the method of financing trade by which commercial bills are ‘accepted’ or
guaranteed by a merchant bank against documents, after which they may be discounted
for cash by a discount house.

customers. Today they have a widely diversified and complex range of activi¬
ties with an important role in: international finance and the short-term capital
markets; the provision of expert advice and financial services to British
industrial companies especially where mergers, takeovers and other forms of
corporate reorganisation are involved; and the management of investment
holdings, including trusts, pensions and other funds.
The Money or Discount Market is an institution which is unique to the City of
London. Its function in the monetary system is to provide a financial mecha¬
nism designed to promote an orderly flow of short term funds. The market
consists of 11 discount houses which borrow money ‘at call’ or short notice and
lend for somewhat longer periods. They have recourse to the Bank of England
as lender of last resort and normally the Bank lends to the houses at Bank Rate
for seven days, although it may charge a higher rate and has also at times lent
overnight, or for short periods, at the rates of interest prevailing in the market.
Most of the market’s borrowed funds come from the commercial banks, which
are thus provided with a flexible means of earning a yield on surplus funds
which they have at any given time.
The assets of the discount houses mainly consist of Treasury and commercial
bills, government and local authority securities and negotiable certificates of
deposit denominated in both sterling and US dollars. The market accepts as an
informal responsibility that it should cover the Government’s need to borrow
on Treasury bills which are offered on tender each week.
The National Savings Movement started in 1916 to help finance the war by
promoting savings. The present movement encourages the widespread invest¬
ment of savings in Trustee Savings Banks and the National Savings Bank
(see p. 215) and in National Savings securities. The movement is led by the
National Savings Committee for England and Wales and similar committees
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. The committees are comprised of represen¬
tatives of the voluntary savings movement in the Regions and of various
national institutions connected with finance, industry and education. They
have a staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often sup¬
ported by local authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary local savings
groups.
The administration of the National Savings Bank and other forms of national
savings is carried out by the Department for National Savings. Five forms
of National Savings securities are currently on sale: National Savings Certifi¬
cates, British Savings Bonds, Premium Savings Bonds, National Savings
Stamps and Gift Tokens. National Savings Certificates, in units of £1, are
encashable at par at any time; interest, which is free of income tax, surtax
and capital gains tax is paid only on encashment; the limit on individual
holdings is 1,000 units of the current ‘decimal issue’ introduced in October
1970. Seven per cent British Savings Bonds (Second Issue), sold in units of
are repayable at par on one month’s notice. If the bonds are held to maturity (five
years from the date of purchase) they are repaid with a bonus of £3 per cent
tax free. Maximum holding of the current issue introduced in May 1971
£10,000. Premium Savings Bonds are in units of £1 (minimum purchase £2)
and individual holdings are limited to £2,000. After a qualifying period of three
months the bonds give investors a chance to win tax-free prizes instead of
receiving interest. There is now a weekly draw for a prize of £25 )000 and a

Savings Banks also deal in stock on the National Savings Stock Register.
A contractual savings scheme, known as ‘Save as You Earn’ (SAYE), enables
savings to be made in regular monthly amounts within a minimum of £1 and a
maximum of £20 in deposits with the Department for National Savings or
Trustee Savings Banks by means of deductions from pay or by other regular
payments. At the end of five years, savings will qualify for a bonus equivalent
to one year’s savings free of tax. Completed savings which are not withdrawn
will qualify for a double bonus at the end of seven years, that is, two years’
savings. For example, contributions totalling £60 payable over five years at a
rate of £1 per month will qualify for a bonus of £12 at the end of that period,
or £24 if left on deposit for a further two years. Savers who wish to stop pay¬
ments will be able to withdraw the total sum saved (but there cannot be partial
withdrawals). Tax-free compound interest will be paid at the rate of 2^ per cent
per annum on amounts withdrawn after the first but before the end of the
fifth year, or at 4^ per cent where the contributions cease but the savings are
left invested for the remainder of the five years or where the saver dies before
the contributions are completed. A separate ‘Save as You Earn’ scheme (with
the same maximum limit) is operated by the building societies.
The National Savings Bank provides a countrywide system for depositing and
withdrawing small savings and has over 22 million active accounts. Ordinary
Accounts bear interest at 3^ per cent and the first £21 of interest is tax free. Up
to £20 can be withdrawn on demand at any savings bank post office, but a few
days’ notice is required for larger amounts. The moneys are lodged with the
National Debt Commissioners and are invested in government securities.
Deposits up to a limit of £10,000 bearing a higher rate of interest (at present 7^
per cent) may be made in Investment Accounts where investors have a quali¬
fying deposit of £50 in an Ordinary Account. All deposits carry a government

guarantee; at the end of May 1972 the sum of the two accounts totalled £1,914
million.
The Trustee Savings Banks, most of which were founded in the nineteenth
century, operate under their own trustees but are subject to statutory provi¬
sions and National Debt Office surveillance. There are 73 individual banks with
over 1,500 Trustee Offices and 12 million active accounts. Deposits can be
made either in the Ordinary Department, the Special Investment Departments
or the Current Account Department. Savings in the Ordinary Department earn
interest at 3^ per cent and the first £21 of interest is tax free. Withdrawals can
usually be made on demand though notice is required for large sums. Deposits
are invested with the National Debt Commissioners and both capital and
interest are guaranteed by the Government. The Special Investment Depart¬
ments offer a higher rate of return, which is taxable. Deposits are limited to
£10,000, but are not government guaranteed. At the end of May 1972 total
sums in the Ordinary Departments of the Trustee Savings Banks were £1,237
million and in the Special Investment Departments £1,756 million. Most
Trustee Savings Banks operate cheque services on deposits in the Current
Account Departments. In January 1968 the Trustee Savings Banks set up their
own unit trust (see p. 218).
At the end of July 1972 National Savings totalled £9,841 million. The
diagram on p. 215 shows the distribution of National Savings between the
different outlets in 1958 and 1971.
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of many
special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities, which
are supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are mainly
provided through the savings banks, finance corporations, hire-purchase
finance companies, the stock exchanges, investment trusts, building societies
and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are in the main
highly specialised, for example, discount and other finance houses, stock¬
brokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers.
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited (FCI) and
the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited (ICFC), were
set up in 1945 to assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction
and development. The corporations are ordinary limited companies with no
official representation on their boards and no recourse to public funds.
Another corporation, the Commonwealth Development Finance Company
Limited (CDFC), was established in 1953 to assist development projects in
the Commonwealth.
The FCI was formed in the national interest to assist in the provision of capital
(in amounts of £200,000 and upwards) for the re-equipment and development
of industry.
The FCI has an authorised and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of
£125 million. The share capital is held by insurance companies, by invest¬
ment trust companies and by the Bank of England. At 3 Ist March 1972
capital called and paid up was 10 per cent (£2-5 million); the Bank of England
paid £5 million in advance of call in 1958. The liability of the shareholders
in respect of the uncalled capital represents security to the banks providing
loans for the corporation’s working capital. The value of its loans and invest¬
ments at 31st March 1972 was £85 million.

The main function of the ICFC is to provide capital, financial advice, and
computer bureau and other services to small- and medium-sized companies in
the British Isles. It has a number of subsidiaries, including Technical Develop¬
ment Capital Ltd. established in 1962 to provide venture capital for the com¬
mercial development of technological innovation. The shareholders of ICFC
are the Bank of England, the English Clearing and the Scottish Banks. At 31st
March 1972 the ICFC had more than £170 million invested in 2,250 British
companies.
The Commonwealth Development Finance Company is no longer confined to
the Commonwealth in its activities. It supports business enterprise overseas
by providing finance in the form of share capital and loans on mutually
acceptable terms. Its authorised share capital is £30 million, of which about
14^ million ‘A’ ordinary shares of ^1 (^o-io paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in the United Kingdom, and nf
million ‘B’ ordinary shares of ^1 (^0-50 paid) are held by the Bank of England
and certain central banks in the Commonwealth. At 31st March 1972 the
CDFC held investments worth -£30 million spread over a wide range of
industries placed in more than 35 countries.
There are seven stock exchanges in the British Isles. In addition the Provincial
Brokers’ Stock Exchange operates in many cities and towns throughout Britain
and the Irish Republic. The Federation of Stock Exchanges in Great Britain
and Ireland, comprising with one exception all these organisations, was set up
in July 1965 to co-ordinate their work. Proposals have been put forward for
the unification of the United Kingdom exchanges and the Irish Exchange, and
it is hoped that amalgamation will be complete by March 1973. The new body
will be known as The Stock Exchange.
The number and variety of securities officially listed on the London Stock
Exchange is greater than in any other market and its turnover of company
securities is roughly equivalent to that of all the European Bourses combined.
Some 9,000 securities are quoted on the London Stock Exchange; at the end
of March 1972 these had a total market value of £149,531 million. About 7,580
securities of companies are quoted, including a number of leading overseas
companies. Company issues represented more than four-fifths of the securities
at market valuation, the remainder being United Kingdom and overseas
government and corporation stocks.
The London Stock Exchange is linked by cable or telephone with stock
exchanges all over the world. A quoted company has a world-wide market for
its issues subject to any limitations imposed by the exchange control regula¬
tions. This is an important factor in the raising of new capital by government
and commercial borrowers.
The stock exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains
are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand for
the securities concerned. All the stock exchanges operate under strict rules of
conduct which they formulate themselves.
There has been substantial growth in demand in the post-war period for
ordinary (equity) shares, partly in expectation that such shares will maintain
or increase their real value in periods of rising prices. There is a growing level
of institutional investment on the London market by insurance companies,
pension funds, and by investment and unit trusts. The percentage of total
market holdings of United Kingdom quoted ordinary shares held by these
four groups of institutions together rose from 25 per cent to 31 per cent over
the six-year period March 1964-70.

It is estimated that in 1966 about 2^ million individuals in Great Britain
owned shares and that direct private clients now account for 45 per cent of the
number of total bargains made on the Stock Exchange.
Investment trusts and unit trusts enable investors to spread their risks and
obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The ordinary type of investment trust is constituted as a public company
registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business is
to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies,
it may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits
to build up reserves. Investment trusts grew to importance in the latter half
of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital towards
overseas investment.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the securities. Normally, the managers
sell units to the public and invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of Stock
Exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly by an
initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a semi¬
annual service charge which is usually taken out of the income of the trust.
The level of both charges is controlled by the Department of Trade and
Industry, whose authorisation is required before units can be offered to the
public; this is only granted if the trust deed is satisfactory to them.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. This medium of saving has
grown considerably since 1957- A* the end of April 1972 there were 2-29
million unit holdings. The value of the funds invested in authorised trusts rose
from £60 million in 1958 to ,£2,419 million at the end of April 1972; it has
nearly trebled since the end of 1967' There is now a wide variety of trusts,
both as to the range of investments covered and the ways in which they cater
for the differing needs of investors.
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by friendly societies and
trade unions, most insurance services in Britain are in the hands of mutual or
joint stock companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.
There are about 590 insurance companies incorporated in the United Kingdom.
This figure includes companies which became subject to the provisions of the
Insurance Companies Acts 1958-67 as a consequence of the extension of
those Acts to all classes of insurance business. Most British insurers write
several classes of business although some specialise in one class, particularly in
life assurance, where about 125 companies write only that type of business. A
few specialise in re-insurance.
In addition about 160 overseas companies carry on business (and even more
companies are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasising the
international nature of the London market. Some of the large British com¬
panies, however, have their administrative headquarters in the provinces.
In 1969 the total assets of the British insurance companies amounted to
about £16,750 million, the bulk of which is life assurance business.
There is no government control over the investment policy of insurance
funds at home and these represent one of the most important sources of funds
for investment in commerce and industry. About one-half of the total assets
of British insurance companies is now invested in equity shares and deben¬
tures.

Lloyd's

Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of private insurers in London. The name
‘Lloyd’s’ is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late
seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
Lloyd’s coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business
and intelligence of shipping movements. Although in its earlier history the
activities of Lloyd’s were confined to the conduct of marine insurance business,
there has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world-wide market
for the transaction of other classes of insurance business in its non-marine,
aviation and motor markets.
Lloyd’s is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting in 1871;
the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are administered
by the Committee of Lloyd’s, which does not itself transact insurance business.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business is
transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and in
competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd’s
broker’s, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the insured.
Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact insurance
with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent financial regula¬
tions laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to transact
business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give a security behind the
Lloyd’s policy which is second to none. Since 1969 non-Commonwealth
underwriters have been admitted to membership of Lloyd’s, if they satisfy the
requirements.
Today there are about 6,000 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped
into some 280 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents
who accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
In conjunction with its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a
world-wide organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelli¬
gence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf
of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a
valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance
business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London representa¬
tives of the latter.
About two-thirds of the general insurance business (that is non-life) is carried
on overseas, partly by re-insurance on the London market and partly through
branches and agencies established in over 100 countries. The basic principle
of this international business is that resources capable of meeting any potential
loss are instantly available for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the deposits, underwriting trust funds and other re¬
sources of Lloyd’s underwriters.
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome insurance and re-insurance in the
European Communities are regulated by directives addressed to the govern¬
ments of member states. The purpose of such directives is to harmonise the
legislation of the various member countries, thus providing a ‘common
market’, which would avoid distortion of competition. The programme of work
in the field of insurance and re-insurance has been delayed and only one direc¬
tive has so far been adopted which deals with re-insurance and retrocession.

BRITAIN I973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A draft directive dealing with the freedom of establishment in non-life
insurance (that is, the freedom of insurers in one member state to set up an
agency or branch in another member state on the same conditions as insurers
of that member state) is nearing completion. This directive would impose certain
requirements on United Kingdom insurers additional to those imposed by the
Insurance Companies Acts 1958-67. The EEC Commission is also preparing
draft directives on life insurance, insurance contracts, taxation of insurance
policies, and on the freedom of non-life insurers to transact services (that is,
to offer insurance cover from a head office in a Community country to another
Community country without being established there).
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner-occupation,
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and
industrial premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived
mainly from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount
of share capital is not fixed; shares, which have a fixed value, are not dealt
with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.
The Building Societies Act 1962, which consolidated a number of earlier Acts,
prescribes the general way in which societies must conduct their business.
The Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies has discretionary powers to stop
a society either advertising or accepting money from investors if he considers
that the way in which the society’s business is conducted is jeopardising
investors’ money. The rapid expansion of building society activity in the
twentieth century has been accompanied by a concentration of most of the
business in the hands of a few large societies. At the end of 1971, 467 societies
were in operation, with total assets of ,£12,919 million; half of this amount
being accounted for by the five largest societies. The amount advanced on
mortgage in 1971 was £2,705 million, 38-5 per cent more than in 1970.

OVERSEAS TRADE
Although relatively small in area and accounting for less than 2 per cent of
the world’s population, the United Kingdom is the world’s third largest trading
nation, conducting over 7 per cent of international trade in 1971.
For well over a century international trade has been of vital importance to
Britain’s economy. Britain relies upon imports for about half its total con¬
sumption of foodstuffs and nearly all the raw materials needed for its industries.
Its exports of goods represent nearly one-fifth of the gross national product.
It is a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures,
electrical apparatus, chemicals and textiles. It is the world’s largest market for
foodstuffs, and among the largest for metals and ores, textile raw materials,
petroleum and many other products.
Changes in value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
In 1971 Britain’s exports on a balance of payments basis were valued at about
£8,882 million (f.o.b., that is, excluding the cost of freight and insurance
outside the United Kingdom) and imports at about £9,834 million (including
the cost of freight and insurance to the United Kingdom). Valued on the
same basis as exports, imports in 1971 were about £8,585 million. Since 1961
the value of imports has more than doubled while that of exports has increased
by 132 per cent. In both cases the volume of trade has risen by 62 per cent.
The growth in trade has not, however, been even. There was a particularly
rapid expansion of imports in 1964 (14 per cent in value and 11 per cent in
volume) and again in 1968 (23 per cent in value and 10 per cent in volume)
after the devaluation of the pound in November 1967. In 1971 imports rose by
9 per cent; about half of the increase was attributable to higher prices. Exports
increased steadily from 1961 to 1966, but in 1967 they declined slightly in
value as well as in volume. Following devaluation, they proceeded to rise
rapidly (see Table 17). In 1971 they rose by 13 per cent in value and 5 per cent
in volume. From 1964 to 1967 there was a steady improvement in Britain’s
terms of trade, that is, export prices rose faster than import prices. Although
after devaluation both export and import prices in pounds sterling rose
sharply it was not until May 1970 that export prices were higher in dollar
terms than in 1967.
The value and volume of exports and imports in selected years from i960

The expansion of domestic agricultural production has reduced Britain’s
dependence on imported food supplies and the ratio of imported foodstuffs
to total imports has fallen from 39 per cent in 1954 to 22 per cent in 1971 when
imports of foodstuffs were £1,970 million. There has been a similar down¬
ward trend in the proportion accounted for by basic materials—from 30 per

synthetic materials to replace such imported natural materials as rubber, wool
and cotton.

Imports of crude petroleum and lubricants are by far the biggest single item
by value, having risen to 12-7 per cent of the total value of imports during
1971 when their value was £1,249 millkm-
The most marked change in recent years has been the rise, in Britain as in
other industrial countries, in the proportion of imports of finished manu¬
factures, particularly capital goods and industrial components. Such imports
rose from under 6-5 per cent of total imports in 1957 to 24-7 per cent in 1971,
worth £2,432 million, when three-quarters were of capital goods (including
industrial components). Imports of semi-manufactures have also been in¬
creasing steadily and since 1962 have formed a larger part of the total import
bill than basic materials, partly because the countries producing the basic
materials tend to embark upon the subsequent stages of manufacture them¬
selves. Imports of semi-manufactured goods (including chemicals) totalled
£2,577 million in 1971 and accounted for 26 per cent of total imports.
About 85 per cent of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods. By far
the most important group are engineering products—in 1971 45 per cent of
total exports. Within this group, exports of many types of machinery, electrical
equipment, road vehicles, tractors and scientific instruments have been
increasing rapidly. The share of chemicals has grown fairly steadily, reaching
9-7 per cent of total exports in 1971. The share of metals has been fairly steady

cent of the total in 1948 to 7 per cent in i960 and 4-6 per cent in 1971. Exports
of coal are now of minor significance (0-2 per cent), and those of petroleum
products constituted 2-3 per cent in 1971. The proportion accounted for by
food, beverages and tobacco has remained steady at 6-4 per cent apart from a
slight fall in 1969.
An analysis of the commodity composition of total imports and exports
and the composition of engineering exports and food imports is given in the
diagram above.
Trade between Britain and Western Europe has been increasing in recent
years, and conversely there has been a decline in the proportion of Britain’s
exports going to primary producing countries. In 1958, 27 per cent of exports
went to Western Europe, but in 1962 these exports began to exceed those to
the sterling area and by 1971 they formed over 40 per cent of the total. Their
growth rate, which had approached 20 per cent in 1968 and 1969, fell to 10
per cent in 1971 when they accounted for just under 40 per cent of the total.
The decline in the rate of growth was a part of the general slow-down in the
growth of world trade during 1971. Exports to the European Economic
Community (EEC) increased by 10 per cent in 1971 compared with 15 per
cent in 1970, and to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) they in¬
creased by over 8 per cent compared with 18 per cent in 1970.
Imports from Western Europe increased by 13 per cent in 1971, about the
same rate as in 1970, and formed nearly 40 per cent of total imports.

the sterling area as a whole has tended to decline relatively but in 1971 exports
to the sterling area rose by 20 per cent compared with only 8-6 per cent in
1970 and as a proportion of total exports rose slightly to 29 per cent after falling
from the 1958 level of 42 per cent. Imports, which had shown a similar fall,
maintained their share of the total in 1971. Canada, Australia, South Africa
and the Republic of Ireland are still among Britain’s most important trading
partners, but since 1957 the United States has been Britain’s largest single

America in 1971 was just under 16 per cent. Exports to Latin America rose by
19 per cent in 1971 but imports were unchanged having fallen by 8 per cent in
1970. Britain’s trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe fell in 1971
after growing rapidly since i960. Trade with Japan continues to grow; exports
rose by 6 per cent in 1971 while imports rose by 50 per cent to exceed £200
million for the first time.
For nearly two centuries Britain has usually been able to earn a surplus from
its invisible overseas transactions, that is, transactions in services, including
the provision of finance. This has provided it with the means to pay for part
of its imports of goods and to finance the purchase of capital assets overseas.
Invisible transactions are divided for statistical purposes into six main
groups: government services and transfers; transport (shipping and civil
aviation); travel; other services (which covers a variety of items including
royalties, films and television transactions, financial services, and other
commercial and miscellaneous services); interest, profits and dividends; and
private transfers (migrants’ funds, legacies and private gifts). Table 19 shows
the breakdown of the figures from 1966 to 1971. Some of these figures are
reliable (for instance, for government transactions), others are only approxima¬
tions. The total invisible balance in 1971 was ^,’741 million (in the five years to
1970 the annual surplus averaged £406 million). Excluding government
expenditure on services, transfers and interest, profits and dividends, the net
balance was a surplus of £1,268 million. Private invisible receipts in 1971 rose
to £5,276 million. Gross earnings from invisibles were well over half the total
from visible exports.

rapidly rising net surplus on ‘other services’ and another large surplus on
interests, profits and dividends. Nearly half of Britain’s receipts under this
heading comes from investments in the sterling area. There has also been a
surplus on civil aviation services throughout the past decade. Shipping
transactions which had been roughly in balance between 1965 and 1967, have
been in deficit since 1969. Travel credits have exceeded debits since 1968.
Over half the net deficit in respect of government expenditure relates to
military expenditure overseas; other substantial items of expenditure are
grants to developing countries, expenditure on the diplomatic service, and
subscriptions to international organisations.
Tourism yields a substantial income from overseas; in the ten years 1961-71
overseas visitors spent nearly £2,928 million in Britain. For 1971 these travel
and tourist receipts, excluding fares, are estimated at about £469 million.
United Kingdom residents on holiday, or travelling for business or other
purposes overseas, spent about £443 million (excluding fares) in the same
year. The continuing increase in both the average expenditure per visitor and
in the number of travellers visiting Britain have produced the surpluses on
travel credits mentioned above since 1968. The estimated total number of
visits to the United Kingdom in 1971, including visitors from the Republic of
Ireland, was a record figure of over 7 million—more than twice the level of
1956 and an increase of 4 per cent over the 1970 level.
Britain’s national tourist organisation consists of four independent govern¬
ment-financed statutory bodies—the British Tourist Authority, which is
responsible for the overseas promotion of tourism in Britain and for certain
general matters affecting the country as a whole, and the English, Scottish
and Wales Tourist Boards which are responsible for encouraging the develop¬
ment and improvement of facilities and amenities for tourists in their respective
countries, and for tourist promotional work and publicity within Britain.
There is a separate statutory Tourist Board for Northern Ireland.
The English, Scottish and Wales boards administer a scheme of incentives
for hotel investment for projects started before 31st March 1971, and also
offer financial assistance to selected tourist projects in Development Areas.
Britain’s prosperity depends on the prosperity of those who buy its exports
which in turn depends on how they sell their exports elsewhere. Thus Britain
is a strong advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade and to this end
has taken a leading part in the setting up and subsequent activities of such
organisations as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the General Agree¬
ment on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). It played a full part at the three
plenary sessions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Develop¬
ment held in 1964, 1968 and 1972 and is a member of the Trade and Develop¬
ment Board which acts on behalf of the conference between sessions.
Customs duties on imports into Britain are divided into two broad cate¬
gories: revenue duties (to which there correspond excise revenue duties on
comparable British-produced goods) and protective duties. Purchase tax
(to be replaced by Value-Added Tax in April 1973, see p. 206) is chargeable
on imported as well as home-produced goods but in the main the charge on
imports is deferred until the goods are sold by a registered to a non-registered
trader. In the financial year 1971-72 revenue duties charged on imported
goods yielded about £2,780 million, by far the greater part of which came
from tobacco and hydrocarbon oils (petroleum products). The yield from

protective duties was ^270 million, or about 2*6 per cent of the value of all
imports.
At the beginning of the twentieth century the only customs duties were
those imposed for revenue purposes on a small range of products. Certain
duties were imposed during the first world war (the McKenna Duties), in
1921 (for strategic reasons) and in 1925 (initially for revenue purposes) but it
was not until the Import Duties Act 1932 that any serious departure was made
from the principle of free trade. This measure provided a degree of protection
for British industry and, at the same time, a basis for negotiations with foreign
countries already in possession of a tariff structure. A series of bilateral trade
negotiations between 1932 and 1939 led to some modification in the level of
protection but in the next ten years, because of government purchase and
import controls introduced during and immediately after the second world
war, the tariff lost much of its importance. The substantial relaxation of
quantitative import controls from 1949 onwards re-established the tariff as
the main instrument of protection.
The Import Duties Act 1958 replaced existing legislation relating to the
protective tariff and brought it up to date in a single measure. The tariff was
recast into an internationally agreed form (the Brussels Nomenclature), which
came into use from 1st January 1959. Under the Customs Duties (Dumping
and Subsidies) Act 1969, the DTI is empowered to impose duties on imported
goods of any description which are being dumped or subsidised, if it is satisfied
that this is causing or threatening material injury to a particular industry and
that such action would be in the national interest. The Act also empowers the
DTI to take provisional action where a prima facie case of dumping or subsi¬
disation and consequent material injury has been made out.
The United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably modified in
recent years as a result of a series of international tariff negotiations held under
the auspices of the GATT, which seeks to increase the volume of world trade
by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade, and by eliminating discrimina¬
tion in international commerce. Tariff reductions, and bindings against
increase, negotiated between countries under the GATT are applied equally
to all other GATT countries under the ‘most favoured nation’ clause.
As a result of the latest series of GATT tariff negotiations, the ‘Kennedy
Round’ (May 1964-June 1967), average reductions of over 30 per cent have
been made by the major trading countries in their tariffs on industrial goods.
The reductions made between 1968 and 1972 in the British tariffs on dutiable
industrial goods imported from the EEC, the United States and Japan
amounted to about 37 per cent, 40 per cent and 34 per cent respectively. This
is closely in line with the reductions made by these countries, which affect
well over 70 per cent of British exports of dutiable industrial goods to these
countries. Some reductions were also made in the tariffs on agricultural goods.
Reciprocal preferential tariff treatment for trade between Britain and other
independent Commonwealth countries dates from the Ottawa Conference of
1932. Although levies may be charged on imports of certain foodstuffs from
the Commonwealth most imports from the Commonwealth preference area
enter free of duty.
In 1964 at the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) in Geneva, Britain declared itself prepared to extend tariff
preferences on a non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis to all the
228

developing countries if other major industrialised countries would do the
same, if the Commonwealth countries concerned would agree and provided
that preferences were not given in such a way as to impede the continuing
reduction of tariffs on a most-favoured-nation basis. The establishment of a
system of generalised preferences for manufactures and semi-manufactures
exported by developing countries was agreed in principle at the second
UNCTAD in New Delhi in 1968. Britain’s scheme came into effect early in
1972; it provides for relief from import duty for practically all industrial goods
and raw materials imported from certain developing countries (the major
exceptions are certain textiles and goods subject to revenue duties). The scheme
also provides for relief or partial relief from import duty on a range of pro¬
cessed agricultural products.
From 1st January 1973 Britain will be a member of the European Communities
(see p. 459). The accession of Britain and certain other members of the
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) to the European Economic
Community (EEC) will mean their withdrawal from EFTA which was set up
under the Stockholm Convention of January i960 with the objects of creating
an industrial free trade area between the members and of working towards a
wider European settlement. Protective tariffs and quotas on trade in industrial
products between members of EFTA were eliminated with certain minor
exceptions by 31st December 1966. EFTA was the first completed free trade
area in the world, forming a single market of almost 100 million people.
A free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the Republic of
Ireland came into operation on 1st July 1966 when Britain removed the few
remaining duties on imports from the Republic of Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland agreed to progressively eliminate by 1st July 1975 duties on most
British goods.
Methods of export trading, virtually all of which is conducted by private
firms, vary considerably, according to the firm, the industry, the product and
the market. Much of Britain’s export trade, especially of the smaller manu¬
facturing firms, is conducted through export merchants in Britain; many
firms, however, sell to importers and consumers abroad through their own
agents or resident representatives in the countries concerned; in other cases,
sales are made through a firm’s own branch offices, distributing organisations
or subsidiary companies established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or
domestic trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may
find it more convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export
houses, commission agents, and the representatives of overseas firms.
There are now very few restrictions imposed by Britain on the movement of
goods and services.
Exchange control is confined mainly to transactions between residents of the
United Kingdom and residents of countries outside the sterling area.1 The
latter may settle transactions between themselves in sterling, and to comply
with Britain’s obligations to the IMF regarding freedom of current inter-
1 Temporary restrictions on transactions within the sterling area were imposed following
the decision to float the pound sterling in June 1972. Arrangements for non-sterling
area countries were not altered.

national transactions, any sterling held on an external account is freely
convertible into other currencies.
The remaining important restrictions relate to the movement of capital
from the United Kingdom to non-sterling area countries. Because of balance
of payments problems, exchange control requirements for investments outside
the sterling area have, since 1961, been designed to limit or defer any cost to
the reserves. The improving balance of payments position in recent years,
however, has made some relaxations possible. Exchange control policy is not to
discourage investment abroad but to regulate the manner in which investment
outside the sterling area is financed. Official exchange is more readily available
for projects which directly promote British exports and for investment in
EEC countries (including Norway and Denmark) than it is for other invest¬
ments. Where the use of official exchange is not permitted investors can
finance their project, either by borrowing abroad or by making use of the pool
of investment currency which is bought and sold by residents at a premium
over official market rates of exchange. Exports of goods to destinations outside
the sterling area have, in general, to be paid for within six months in foreign
currency (except Rhodesian currency) or by sterling from an external account
unless they are covered by an approved export credit arrangement. Control is
also exercised over imports to ensure that currency authorised for their pay¬
ment is used for that purpose. The programme of voluntary restraint on invest¬
ment in the other developed countries of the sterling area which had been in
operation since 1966 was abolished in the 1972 Budget.
There are certain restrictions on dealings in gold bullion and on the use of
gold for manufacturing and industrial purposes. The buying, selling and
holding of gold coins does not require Exchange Control permission, although
their export remains controlled.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but the
detailed administration is delegated to the Bank of England as agent of the
Treasury; in turn, the Bank of England has delegated to the commercial banks
a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.
Under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 the
Department of Trade and Industry is empowered to prohibit or regulate the
import or export of goods.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the
IMF, the British Government has progressively removed quantitative
restrictions from almost all its imports from the countries of the free world.
There has also been a continuing substantial relaxation of quantitative
controls on imports from the Soviet Zone. The very short list of goods on
which controls remain includes some items of special difficulty and a few
where restrictions are recognised internationally, such as arms, ammunition
and radioactive materials. They require a specific import licence and quotas
have been set up for many of them. Some quotas refer specifically to individual
countries and are usually shared out among exporters by the authorities of the
countries concerned. Others are accorded on an overall or global basis, and
are generally allocated by the British authorities to British importers, usually
on the basis of their share of the trade in the commodity in the past. Apart
from these quantitative controls, some further restrictions or prohibitions are
applied on health grounds (for example, on animals, plants and drugs). There
is also a general import restriction on goods from Rhodesia.
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations outside

the sterling area are paid for in the proper manner most British exports are
not subject to any government control or direction. The few controls that are
in operation are imposed to supervise exports of military and strategic import¬
ance; to conserve materials which may be in short supply; to assist exchange
control operations in preventing the export of capital in the form of valuable
goods; to ensure the humane treatment of cattle, sheep and pigs; and to
prevent the export of antiques (including works of art) on grounds of national
importance. Normally, individual licences are required for specific consign¬
ments of goods subject to export licensing control. Goods controlled for
strategic reasons, not included in the category of atomic energy materials and
appliances, arms and ammunition, may, with certain exceptions, be exported
to the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic, the Republic of South Africa and
the United States of America without licence. There is also a general export
restriction on goods to Rhodesia.
The British Government assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions
favourable to the export trade and by providing credit insurance facilities and
information and advice about opportunities for trade in other countries.1
Facilities exist for the repayment of protective duties paid on goods which
have been imported for export trade purposes.
Information
and Advice to
Exporters
Export Credit
Insurance
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult DTI offices throughout
Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts of the British
Diplomatic Service overseas. There are over 200 posts located in all the
principal cities and trade centres abroad and they supply the DTI with
information of every kind affecting trade with their territories.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial
conditions, pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities,
and generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of govern¬
mental regulations. These officers investigate potential markets for British
products, advise about methods of trading with particular areas, and seek out
and pass on opportunities for export business and enquiries for British goods.
Assistance is also given to British exporters in appointing agents and locating
potential importers. From records kept up to date in London by reports from
its overseas commercial officers, the Export Services Division of the DTI can
provide information concerning any country on the prospects for exports and
requirements of particular markets, government regulations affecting trade
(including import restrictions and tariffs and duties on particular com¬
modities), methods of trading, local tastes and preferences in design, and the
commercial standing of firms with which an exporter contemplates business
relations.
The Government’s official information services overseas are used extensively
to promote Britain’s export trade.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) (see p. 52) provides
credit insurance for more than a third of the country’s export trade and for
much of the external trade of British merchants.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer,
governmental action which stops the British exporter receiving payment, new
1 Export promotion is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry)
and the Development Corporation for Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Ministry of
Commerce provides a liaison service with the DTI Export Services Division and the
overseas posts.

occurring outside the United Kingdom and not within the control of the
exporter or the buyer, and not normally insurable with commercial insurers’.
Cover may commence from the date of contract or (at lower premiums) from
the date of shipment. Premiums for all business of up to six months’ credit
average 0-25 per cent and increase with the length of credit.
This insurance may be supplemented by unconditional guarantees of re¬
payment given directly to banks financing the exporter. Alternatively, for
contracts over £250,000, the ECGD will guarantee loans direct to overseas
buyers enabling them to pay on cash terms, or ‘lines of credit’ similarly
covering an agreed buying programme of an overseas country. The banks
provide finance against these guarantees at a special interest rate fixed by the
Government, the bulk of this being in turn refinanced by the ECGD.
Britain stages many exhibitions and trade fairs which attract both the general
public and trade buyers for domestic and overseas markets and provide an
important means of advertising and selling British goods.
British products are shown at most of the large international trade fairs
throughout the world and British manufacturers have been prominent at the
many specialised fairs held in Europe and North America.
Participation in trade fairs, ‘British weeks’ and store promotions overseas is
a form of export promotion for which the Government provides information,
financial assistance and, in certain cases, free facilities. (‘British weeks’ differ
from trade fairs and exhibitions in that they are primarily designed to promote
sales of consumer goods in shops overseas.) In 1971 the DTI assisted nearly
5,30° British firms at 270 specialised and general trade fairs in 38 countries;
and gave practical help to 1 major British Week, 1 British Trade Week,
3 ‘British Shopping Weeks’, and some 38 overseas store promotions. The
amount allocated to the DTI for these purposes has risen from £0-5 million in
1962-63 to £5-5 million in 1971-72.
Export promotion is among the functions of the British Overseas Trade Board
(previously the British Export Board) which in 1972 took over the full range of
activities formerly divided between the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) and the British National Export Council.
The board directs export intelligence work, the work on trade fairs and
other promotional activity overseas, the schemes for financial support for
firms to participate in missions overseas and for inward commercial visits to
Britain. It consists of businessmen and DTI and Foreign and Commonwealth
Office representatives and operates under the general authority of the Minister
for Trade who is the President.
In the nineteenth century, the rapid growth of British industry, commerce
and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial revolution made Britain
the site for the chief world markets in raw materials (see below), freight,
insurance and precious metals. A sound commercial banking system and a
flexible system of central bank control have been built up, while specialised
institutions such as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the
stock exchanges, investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to
satisfy particular needs for short-term or long-term finance. The facilities
provided by merchant banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been
used to finance shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but also
between other overseas countries.

At the same time, the banks which were already engaged in financing trade
were able to assist in raising finance for longer-term ventures. British capital
invested in overseas countries has furthered their development, increased
their output and exports, and provided markets for manufactured goods. A
number of specialised institutions provide financial services for overseas
countries.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities. The bulk of sales negotiated in these markets relates
to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The need for
close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance services
often determined the location of these markets in the City of London. Among
the more important are the Baltic Exchange (the market for shipping and air
transport), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee, copra, rubber and
sugar), the London Wool Terminal Exchange and the London Metal Ex¬
change. A soya bean oil futures market opened in London in 1967 and a
coconut oil futures market in 1969. These markets not only cater for the
import of goods for home consumption but do much business in effecting
transactions between buyers and sellers in other countries. In addition to
these formal markets, there is scarcely any product which cannot be traded
through an intermediary in Britain.
The market consists of about 200 authorised banks and 11 firms of foreign
exchange brokers which act as intermediaries between the banks. The market
provides those engaged in international trade with foreign currencies for their
transactions. The foreign exchange banks are in close contact with financial
centres abroad and are able to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and
future delivery. An important function of the market is to engage in arbitrage
transactions which serve to eliminate differentials in exchange rates between
different centres. The forward market enables traders, who at a given date in
the future are due to receive or make a specific foreign currency payment, to
determine in advance the precise sterling equivalent of the foreign currency.
All authorised banks may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely
concentrated in the hands of the five members of the London gold market.
The five members meet twice daily to fix a price for all transactions which
customers ask to have executed at the fixing. Since March 1968 most monetary
authorities have ceased dealing in gold in the market, and officially held gold
is now used only to effect transfers between monetary authorities.
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, several
countries tended not only to use sterling as their natural currency for intei -
national transactions, but also to maintain central currency reserves in
Britain. When Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931 these countries,
which came to be known as the ‘sterling bloc’ and later as the sterling aiea ,
did likewise, and pegged their currency exchange rates to the pound sterling.
In 1939, after the outbreak of war, the pound sterling was no longer freely
convertible into other currencies and the sterling area became more formally
defined as a currency area for exchange control purposes (see p. 228). Sterling
became convertible again in December 195^ kvrt there is still exchange control
on transactions, effectively capital transactions, with the non-sterling area.
The sterling area at present consists of all the Commonwealth countries
(except Canada and Rhodesia), together writh Bahrain, Iceland, the Republic of
Currency
Realignment
TRADE AND PAYMENTS 233
Ireland, Jordan, Kuwait, The Maldives, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar,
South Africa, South West Africa, the People’s Democratic Republic of
Yemen, and the United Arab Emirates. The main features of the sterling
area are that much of the overseas trade of member countries is financed in
sterling, while much of their international reserves is held in sterling.
(Transactions between residents of the United Kingdom and the overseas
sterling area—except the Republic of Ireland—became subject to exchange
control on 23rd June 1972.1)
The reduction in the balances of sterling area governments in 1968 led to
the series of agreements concluded between the United Kingdom and the
countries of the sterling area in September 1968 by which each country under¬
took to maintain an agreed proportion of its official reserves in sterling, and the
United Kingdom undertook to provide a dollar-value guarantee of the bulk
of official sterling holdings. The majority of these arrangements expired in
September 1971 when nearly all of them were renewed to September 1973.
The new terms provide for a uniform reduction in the proportion of sterling
which the countries concerned undertake to hold in exchange for the dollar
value guarantee.
Britain has declared its willingness to see an orderly and gradual run down
of official sterling balances after Britain’s accession to the EEC. Such a run¬
down would have to avoid imposing undue strain on the balance of payments,
contribute to the smooth functioning of the international monetary system,
and be acceptable to sterling holders.
A general realignment of exchange rates, involving the revaluation of main
currencies against the US dollar, was agreed at the ministerial meeting of the
Group of Ten countries and Switzerland which was held in Washington in
December 1971. Provision was made for 2^ per cent margins of exchange rate
fluctuations above and below the new exchange rates. The United States
undertook to raise the dollar value of monetary gold from $35 to $38 per fine
ounce. This change represents a 7-89 per cent devaluation of the dollar in
terms of gold. A new middle rate for sterling against the US dollar of
£1 = $2-6057 was announced after the meeting.1
In May 1972 Britain began to participate in the EEC scheme for narrower
exchange margins (participation was temporarily suspended following the
decision to float the pound—see p. 194). Under the scheme the central banks
of participating countries ensure that the spot rate of each participating
currency against any other participating currency does not diverge by more
than 2^ per cent from its parity cross-rate against that currency.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Estimates of Britain’s balance of payments and its main constituent items are
given in summary since 1965 in Table 20 and in greater detail since 1969 in
Tables 21 and 22. The balance of payments statistics contain two indicators
of particular importance. The first is the balance on current account, covering
both visible (exports and imports of goods) and invisible (trade in services,
investment income and transfers) transactions, which provides a measure of
how far Britain is paying its way abroad and thus adding to or using up over¬
seas assets. (Traditionally Britain has had a deficit on visible trade and a
surplus on invisible earnings.) The second indicator is the total currency flow.
1 The pound sterling was temporarily floated on the foreign exchange markets on 23rd
June 1972.
234
BRITAIN I973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
This is the net result of all external flows, that is the current account, invest¬
ment and other capital flows (including official long-term capital transactions,
investment flows, trade credit, and changes in United Kingdom external
banking and money market liabilities in sterling) and other flows which are
unidentified transactions reflected in the balancing item. The total currency
flow shows the impact of all external flows on the reserves and debt position,
that is how much is available to add to the reserves and to repay any official
borrowing in the case of a net inflow or how much must be financed by draw¬
ing on the reserves or by borrowing if there is a net outflow. Table 21 gives
details of the current account since 1969. Both exports and imports have risen
strongly since the devaluation of sterling at the end of 1967. In 1969, with a
faster rise in exports than in imports and an increase of 55 per cent in net
invisible earnings, there was a substantial surplus on current account trans¬
actions as a whole. In 1970 exports continued to rise in value faster than
imports and there was, for the first time for many years, a small surplus on
visible trade which rose in 1971 to its highest-ever level at £299 million. This,

along with an increased substantial surplus on invisibles, produced a record
current account surplus of £ 1,040 million.
The total currency flow was outward in each of the years 1963-68 and in¬
ward in 1969, 197° and 1971. In the period 1963-68, there was an outward
flow of ,£3,778 million (including a gold subscription of £44 million to the
IMF) financed mainly by official borrowing totalling ,£3,134 million, but also
by transfers to the reserves of the dollar portfolio totalling ^£520 million; and a
reduction of ,£124 million in the reserves. Approximately one-quarter of the
outflow stemmed from current account deficits. In 1969 there was a reversal of
the net currency flow, and a rapidly increasing currency inflow reached very
large proportions in 1971. During this period almost all short- and medium-
term official borrowing was repaid, and there was a substantial increase in the
reserves.
Britain’s official reserves fluctuated during the 1960s, but stayed on the
whole a little above f 1,000 million. In 1971 Britain’s reserves rose from

£1,178 million to £2,526 million. The end-December 1971 figure is calculated
at the new middle rate of £1=$2-6057. The effect of the valuation changes
consequent upon the realignment of exchange rates agreed in Washington in
December 1971 on the end-December level was to increase their sterling
value by considerably less than the equivalent of the increase in their dollar
value (see p. 233).
Britain is a participant in the Special Drawing Rights scheme which came
into effect in 1970 in order to supplement world reserves as necessary. Special
Drawing Rights are reserve assets created and distributed by decision of the
members of the IMF. Any member of the IMF may join the scheme, and its
share is based on its IMF quota. Participants in the scheme accept an obliga¬
tion to provide convertible currency, when designated by the IMF to do so,
to another participant in exchange for SDRs up to a total amount equal to
twice the net amount of their own allocation of SDRs. Only those countries
with a sufficiently strong balance of payments are so designated by the IMF.
SDRs may also be used in certain direct payments between participants in the
scheme and for payments of various kinds to the IMF.
Britain has drawing rights in the IMF based on its IMF quota which was
raised at the end of 1970 to $2,800 million.
Britain has also taken part since 1961 in the international network of re¬
ciprocal credit (swap) facilities arranged between central banks. Facilities
available to the United Kingdom include one of $2,000 million with the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Under these arrangements each central
bank is able to exchange on request its own currency for the currency of an¬
other country up to a maximum agreed for a limited period. It agrees to reverse
the transaction at a specified date at the same rate of exchange. The currencies
so obtained can be retained in the reserves or used in exchange operations.
The significance of any inventory of Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities1 is limited because a variety of claims and obligations are included
that are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method of valua¬
tion. The inventory for the end of 1971 shows that Britain had a substantial
net creditor position estimated at some £4,135 million.
Identified external liabilities at the end of 1971 totalled some £19,650 million,
against assets of about £23,785 million. Total official short- and medium-
term liabilities to the IMF and other monetary authorities were £415 million.
Inter-governmental loans to the United Kingdom and other official liabilities,
mainly a consequence of the second world war and its aftermath, totalled
£1,906 million of which £1,503 million was owed to the United States and
£345 million to Canada. Other public sector liabilities of £3,465 million com¬
prised overseas holdings of United Kingdom government and public corpora¬
tions sterling securities, holdings of Treasury bills and notes, local authority
mortgages and stocks, and foreign currency borrowing by United Kingdom
public corporations and local authorities. United Kingdom banking and com¬
mercial liabilities including liabilities in sterling, and in foreign currencies,
totalled £5,405 million.2 Liabilities in the form of overseas investment in the
United Kingdom private sector totalled £8,655 million.
1 Figures at the end of 1971, and for earlier years are published in the 1972 United
Kingdom Balance of Payments, produced by the Central Statistical Office (see Biblio¬
graphy, p. 478). .
2 This sector covers the London banks’ operations in the Eurocurrency markets in which
very large non-sterling currency liabilities are broadly matched by non-sterling assets.
Only net liabilities of £1,179 million are included in the figure above; they represent the
difference between assets of £16,369 million and liabilities of £17,548 million.

Liabilities in sterling comprise both public sector and banking and money-
market liabilities within the totals above. Sterling held in the United Kingdom
by foreigners in the form of bank deposits, deposits with local authorities and
hire purchase companies, Treasury Bills and British Government securities
(where these were held by central monetary institutions and international
organisations other than the IMF) totalled £5,596 million at the end of March
1972. Of this, £1,253 million was held by residents of the non-sterling area and
£4,343 million by residents of the sterling area. The total of these liabilities
(excluding the counterpart of borrowing) remained broadly constant between
the end of 1945 and 1970 but rose sharply during 1971. They reflect the
international trading and reserve role of sterling and in part the financial
services of the City.
Overseas liabilities arising from investment in the private sector of the British
economy rose from £3,165 million in 1962 to £8,655 million at the end of 1971.
Overseas investors in Britain are free to repatriate the proceeds of the sale
of their investments, including any capital gains that they may have accrued.
Earnings and dividends are transferable irrespective of their size. In 1971
the inflow of direct, portfolio and other private investment, including oil,
amounted to £921 million.
The value of overseas investment in the United Kingdom private sector at
the end of 1971 comprised: the book value of direct investment in Britain by
companies incorporated abroad—£3,650 million (excluding oil, banking, and
insurance); portfolio holdings of British securities—£2,840 million; the book
value of the net assets in Britain of overseas oil companies—£1,600 million;
and the balance of £565 million which included borrowing by United King¬
dom companies overseas and identified investment in real estate and in the
insurance industry in Britain.
About three-quarters of the direct investment of £3,650 million came from
North America and about one-fifth from Western Europe. Of the £360 million
inflow of direct investment into Britain in 1971 £335 million originated in the
non-sterling area and £25 million from the overseas sterling area. Foreign
investment inflow presents British industry with many opportunities to match
new competitive standards which in turn will strengthen the economy and its
balance of payments position.
Private investment abroad may take several forms: portfolio investment, that
is, investment in overseas securities including the loans raised by overseas
countries on the London capital market; or direct investment by the establish¬
ment of subsidiary companies abroad; or by acquiring an interest in an over¬
seas enterprise.
Following the 1972 Budget, investment in the sterling area is in general free
from control. Approval is readily given for financing projects in the non¬
sterling area by borrowing abroad on appropriate terms, and for financing from
Britain where the project is expected to yield substantial and continuing
benefits to the United Kingdom balance of payments. There is also consider¬
able scope for the investment of retained profits of subsidiary companies
overseas and in recent years about 60 per cent of net direct investment outflow
has been financed in this way from unremitted profits.
Estimates prepared by the Department of Trade and Industry show that
direct investment outflow, excluding oil, was £508 million in 1970, £213
million of this being placed in the overseas sterling area and £295 million in
non-sterling countries. Within the latter figure the flow to the EEC area was
238

£721 million, to EFTA £21 million and to Latin America £13 million. In the
same year the flow to Western Europe was j£ioi million compared with a
flow to North America of £178 million. Direct investment outflow (excluding
oil) in 1971 was above the 1970 level, amounting to £535 million. With the
inclusion of oil, portfolio and other investment aggregate private investment
outflow in 1971 totalled £725 million.
Britain’s assets arising from private investment overseas are estimated to have
been £14,855 million at the end of 1971. This compares with a figure of
£8,070 million at the end of 1962. Direct investment, including oil, accounted
for £9,355 million of the total figure, the balance consisting of £5,500 million
of portfolio investment.
United Kingdom banking and commercial claims at the end of 1971 totalled
£4,047 million. Within this total banking claims in sterling and overseas
sterling area currencies were £2,098 million; suppliers export credit to un¬
related firms was £1,447 million. With the increase in recent years in British
aid to developing countries, inter-governmental loans of £963 million form the
largest item among official external assets, which at the end of 1971 were
£1,492 million. The latter figure, together with official reserves of £3539°
million, £4,047 million in banking and commercial claims and private invest¬
ment overseas of £14,855 million resulted in aggregate identified external
assets at the end of 1971 of £23,785 million.
Britain’s aid programme to the developing countries consists of loans and
grants for economic and social development, technical assistance, budget
support and contributions to multilateral agencies providing financial aid and
technical assistance to these countries. To complement the official programme
private investment is encouraged by the provision of government insurance
to private investors by the ECGD (see p. 230). In addition an important
contribution is made to economic development by private voluntary organisa¬
tions engaged in relief, development and educational work.
Since 1945 total official aid disbursements have amounted to nearly £3,300
million. The average gross annual disbursement over the four years 1968-71
was about £229 million (see Table 23). In 1971 the total was over £277
million, of which bilateral aid accounted for £247 million including £53
million technical assistance; assistance provided through multilateral agencies
was £30 million. Repayments of capital and payments of interest during the
year on loans made previously came to £42 million and £32 million respec¬
tively. The strategy for the Second UN Development Decade, adopted in i97°>
included a recommendation that each developed country should devote 1 per
cent of its GNP at market prices to total net financial flows to developing
countries by 1972, or i97t> ^ latest. Britain has undertaken to do its best
to reach this target by 1975- In British flows to developing countries have
exceeded 1 per cent of GNP since 1969. The Government does not accept the
need for a separate target for official aid within the 1 per cent target, though
it has announced its intention to maintain official aid as a substantial part of
total flows. Private investment is also expected to play a substantial part, and
the Government has introduced measures to stimulate this flow to developing
countries. . .
Total net British official and private flows in 1971 amounted provisionally to
1*15 per cent of gross national product; official flows were 0-42 per cent. Public
expenditure on economic aid is to be increased and plans published in Public
Expenditure to 1975-76 (see Bibliography, p. 477) show an increase from £205

million in 1970-71 to £289 million in 1975-76, at 1971 prices, net of amortisa¬
tion—an annual increase of over 7 per cent in real terms. Under the new
method of aid determination, introduced in 1971, gross expenditure in each
year will be calculated in current prices. After allowing for price increases and
the deduction of expected amortisation receipts, decisions can then be imple¬
mented in terms of real resources. This represents gross official flows only; the
volume of private flows, although influenced by government policies, is not
determined by the Government and is difficult to predict, as also is the future
level of the gross national product.
Bilateral financial aid in 1971 totalled ^247 million; over 41 per cent was in
grants and the rest in loans. Budgetary aid, £6 million in 1971, is provided in
the form of grants. Development aid is in grants or loans, depending on the
economic and constitutional circumstances of the recipient countries; the
greater part of it is in loans. The terms of new development loans from Britain
have been progressively softened since 1958 and a policy of making interest-
free loans to lighten the repayment burdens of the poorer developing countries
was introduced in June 1965. In 1971 the total value of bilateral loan commit¬
ments entered into by the British Government, excluding investments by the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (see below), was ^132 million and
of this over 69 per cent was on interest-free terms. The recipients included
India, Pakistan, Ghana, Turkey, Guyana, Sri Lanka and Indonesia.
Where loans bear interest it is at fixed concessionary rates ranging from 2
per cent to 7J- per cent, and both kinds of loan may carry grace periods during
which repayments of capital are not made. Of all loans committed in 1971,
the average grace period was six years and the average maturity 24 years.
Britain more than fulfils the recommendations of the Development Assistance
Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), made in February 1969, on easing the terms of financial aid.
Loans and grants are tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and services
from Britain, although there may be a limited element for local costs and for
£ million

procurement from third countries in appropriate cases. Between 1958 and the
end of 1971, 343 loans were negotiated involving a commitment of £1,044
million, of which £890 million has been disbursed. The recipients of the
largest amounts have been India and Pakistan. During the same period bilateral
grants amounted to around £1,077 million.
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of its
responsibilities towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains
on Commonwealth countries. In 1971 million (88 per cent) of the bilateral
programme was disbursed to Commonwealth countries and dependencies.
In the past, development aid to the dependent territories was given under
the Colonial Development and Welfare (CD & W) Acts, largely in the form
of grants but also in loans. Expenditure on economic and social development
up to the termination of the Acts on 31st March 1970 amounted to some £450
million. The aid requirements of the few remaining dependencies, which are
regarded as a first charge on aid funds, are now provided under the authority of
the Overseas Aid Act 1966. In 1971 the territories received £19 million in
bilateral financial aid and technical assistance.
An important role in development assistance is played by the Common¬
wealth Development Corporation (CDC), set up by the British Government
in 1948, which provides finance and management for development projects
in Commonwealth countries and dependencies, often in partnership with
governments or private enterprise. In 1970 the CDC’s borrowing powers
were increased and the area of its operations was extended to non-Common-
wealth countries. By the end of 1971 sorne £I5I million had been invested
out of a total commitment of £190 million. Of the latter, £35-7 million was in
the Far East, £46 million in the Caribbean and virtually all of the remainder
in Africa. New investment approved in 1971 totalled over £29 million.
Expenditure on bilateral technical assistance (the provision of skilled person¬
nel, advice and training) has increased in recent years and was £53 million,
23 per cent of total aid, in I971, The largest component of expenditure (£26-1
million in 1971) was on sending or maintaining experts, including volunteers;
the next largest was for students and trainees in Britain (£8-4 million).
Under the Overseas Service Aid Scheme (OSAS) and associated schemes
Britain meets the additional costs of employing experienced expatriate British
personnel in the public services of developing countries. The schemes cost
£16 million in 1971.
At the end of 1971, of the 11,214 British persons other than volunteers who
were working in developing countries and financed by the British Govern¬
ment, some 3,140 were engaged in the field of education, 2,338 in public
works and communications, 1,200 in public administration, 1,022 in agriculture
and allied fields, and 881 in health services.
In addition, under the British Volunteer Programme in 1971 there were
1,850 volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified, working in develop¬
ing countries, the majority of them teaching. Recruitment, training and placing
overseas is undertaken by a number of voluntary bodies; 75 Per cent of tl16
British costs (£o-8 million in 1971) are met by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Over 13,500 were financed in Britain in 1971 under regional pro¬
grammes of technical assistance, by awards under the Commonwealth Educa¬
tion Co-operation Scholarships and Bursary Schemes, and under the various
schemes of the British Council.

Britain is the second largest contributor (after the United States) to the World
Bank group of institutions—the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the International Finance Corporation and the International
Development Association (IDA). The British commitment to IDA in the
three years 1968-70 was nearly £65 million; the proposed contribution for the
three years 1971-73 is nearly ^130 million. Britain has contributed, or has
agreed to contribute, to the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the African
Development Bank. Britain has contributed £58 million to the United Nations
Development Programme since its inception in 1950 and has provided more
experts and training places under multilateral schemes than any other country.
Some 1,825 British nationals were serving in developing countries under the
United Nations and its specialised agencies in 1971. Other contributions
include those to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine
Refugees (UNRWA), the World Food Programme and the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
INTERNAL TRADE
Internal trade can be divided into two broad categories: trade in raw materials,
capital goods and intermediate products (for example, vehicle components)
and trade in consumer goods, involving the network of distributive trades by
which home produced or imported goods reach the consumer. (For the pattern
of consumers’ expenditure, see p. 197).
Estimates of the value of trade flows at current prices, to intermediate as
well as final customers, relating to 1968 show total sales of goods and services
in that year to intermediate buyers amounting to ^26,616 million and total sales
to final buyers of £47,154 million, divided between private consumption
(£23>i29 million), public authorities’ current expenditure (£7,373 million),
gross domestic capital formation (£7,928 million) and exports (£8,723 million).
The metals, metal goods, mining and chemical industries sold predominantly to
intermediate buyers. The engineering industries sold mainly components to
intermediate buyers and capital goods to final buyers. About 70 per cent of the
output of the textile industries was divided almost equally between inter¬
mediate buyers and private consumption, while over a quarter went to exports.
Agricultural output was divided equally between intermediate buyers and
final buyers (mainly private consumption), while the food and clothing
industries sold predominantly for private consumption.
There have been a number of official statistical enquiries into the distributive
trades. The latest censuses taken in Great Britain refer to the wholesale trades
in 1965 and the retail trades and certain service trades in 1966. Sample
monthly and annual enquiries are also undertaken, covering such aspects of
the distributive trades as turnover, stocks and capital expenditure. Most of the
figures given in the following pages derive from either the last published
censuses or the sample enquiries. A full census of retail distribution is being
taken in 1972 for the year 1971.
The first census of retail distribution and other services to be taken in
Northern Ireland relates to 1965 (see p. 244).
Only a proportion of the trade in consumer goods passes through wholesalers:
sales are also made to consumers through producers’ own selling organisations
(including their own retail outlets and mail order businesses); and other sales
are made directly by producers to retailers. The 1965 enquiry showed that a
242
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
total of 23,643 business units were engaged in wholesale distribution in Great
Britain; 3,435 dealt in clothing, footwear and textiles, 2,007 in grocery and
provisions, 2,630 in vegetables and fruit, and 3,469 in other food and in drink.
In addition, there were 8,282 dealers (wholesale or retail) in coal, builders’
materials, grain or agricultural supplies, and 9,117 dealers in other industrial
materials and machinery. The value of stocks held by wholesalers and dealers
at the end of 1971 is estimated at £1,770 million; expenditure on capital assets
during the year was about £17° million.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers (who
sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or, increasingly, is
sold by contract to fryers and processors, or direct to retailers. Fruit and
vegetables may be sold by growers to commission agents (who dispose of the
produce either to wholesalers or direct to retailers) or the grower may deal
only with wholesale firms. The sale of some agricultural products is regulated
by statutory marketing boards (see p. 322).
London’s wholesale markets play a leading part in the distribution of food¬
stuffs, particularly imported supplies. Every year Covent Garden (see p. 326)
handles over 1 million tons of fruit and vegetables, and about 300,000 tons
of meat and poultry pass through Smithfield market; Billingsgate is the princi¬
pal distributing centre for fish. Others in London include Leadenhall Market
(poultry) and Spitalfields Market (fruit and vegetables).
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
societies, the two largest being the Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd.
(CWS) and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd. (SCWS), to
serve the needs of retail societies, membership being restricted to incorporated
co-operative organisations. The CWS had sales of £539 million in 1971 and
the SCWS had sales of some £90 million.
Since the early 1950s, many wholesalers have joined, either singly or in
groups, with numbers of retailers to form voluntary groups to help to preserve
the existence of retail outlets for the wholesaler and to give to retailers the
advantages of the lower costs of large-scale trading without significant loss of
independence. The 1966 Census of Distribution showed that about 27 per
cent of the turnover of independent grocers was attributable to wholesaler-
sponsored voluntary groups and chains.
The number of Cash and Carry wholesale warehouses is increasing. By
bulk purchasing and little spending on attractive surroundings or credit and
delivery facilities they can offer large price discounts to bulk-buying retail
traders. The numbers of this type of store have grown rapidly from 400 in
1967 to an estimated 578 in May 197L with a turnover of some £53°
a year. Cash and Carry wholesalers account for about two-fifths of all grocery
warehousing. Some warehouses permit the general public to buy in bulk on
trade terms.
RETAIL TRADE
Types of
Retailers
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under four headings: (1) multiple
traders with ten or more branches; (2) retail co-operative societies (see below),
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small multiple
stores (that is, chains of stores with nine or fewer branches) and (4) department
stores. Other retail outlets include gas and electricity showrooms owned by the
area gas and electricity boards, and mail order houses (see p. 245).
The 1966 Census of Distribution (Table 24) showed that, in comparison
with 1961, a larger volume of trade had been handled by rather fewer shops.
A notable feature is the continuing expansion of large multiple firms relative
Multiples and

ments
Retail

Societies

to other types of shop. Independent shops, however, still account for about
half of Britain’s retail trade.
A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. Four
shops had sales in 1966 exceeding £10 million (equivalent to takings of more
than £4,000 an hour) at the other extreme there were more than 16,000 shops
with sales of less than £20 a week. In addition there were market and street
traders, whose volume of business may be very small.
According to the Census of Distribution there were nearly 74,000 shops owned
by multiples (including multiple department stores) in 1966 with a total
turnover of nearly £4,000 million. This form of organisation showed the
largest rise in numbers between 1961 and 1966 and their share in total sales
went up from 29 per cent to 34 per cent. Their turnover increased faster than
that of independent businesses between 1966 and 1971, and in 1971 their
share of total sales rose to over 38 per cent.
The share in total retail trade of co-operative stores dropped from 11 to 9 per
cent between 1961 and 1966 which was rather less than the relative decrease in
the number of stores. Between 1966 and 1971 their turnover rose by 15 per
cent but their share of retail trade fell a little further.
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisations controlled
by their members. Membership is open to anyone paying a small deposit
on a minimum share, which entitles the member to an equal voice with other
members in the society. Share investment by individual members is limited
to £1,000 (less in some societies) and only a low rate of interest is normally
paid on the shares. One large society is introducing a scheme of bonus shares
carrying a higher rate of interest than the ordinary shares.
Traditionally the trading surplus was paid out to members in the form of a
dividend in proportion to their purchases. Recently a large number of societies,
accounting for over four-fifths of total co-operative sales, have introduced
dividend stamps redeemable for cash, other goods, or credit to a share account,
at different redemption rates.
In February 1972 there were about 260 retail co-operative societies.
Amalgamations are rapidly diminishing the number of societies (the total in
1958 was 1,015). The largest single society in Britain is Co-operative Retail
Services Limited with 1 -36 million members and a turnover of £132 million in
1971. Total sales of the retail co-operative societies in 1971 amounted to about
£1,200 million and accounted for 8 per cent of total retail trade compared
with 11 per cent in 1961.
Independent shops have been giving ground gradually in the face of increased
competition from the larger undertakings. The number of independent shops
fell by about 10 per cent between 1957 and 1966, but the decline has been
partly reduced by the existence of voluntary buying groups (see p. 242). The
proprietors of many of the smaller shops often have other means of livelihood.
Average turnover per shop has continued to increase, though by less than for
the retail trade as a whole.
There were 760 department stores in Britain in 1966 with a turnover of
£653 million; 214 were owned by multiples and 308 by independents.
Department stores were defined for the purposes of the census as having 25 or
more persons engaged in selling a wide range of commodities notably clothing
and household goods. Co-operative societies owned a further 238 department
stores in 1966, with a turnover of £118 million. Sales of all department stores
in 1971 were estimated to be £730 million.

Out of a total of over 500,000 establishments recorded by the 1966 Census
of Distribution, and shown in Table 24, grocery and other food retailing
groups numbered over 227,000 establishments, and the clothing and foot¬
wear group over 83,000.
Though the total value of retail trade in Great Britain (inclusive of electricity
and gas showrooms and mail order business) rose by a quarter between 1961
and 1966, rates of growth (measured in turnover) varied appreciably between
different types of trade. The slowest growth was in general stores, in the food
and clothing sectors, and department stores. The fastest growth was in radio
and television hire, mail order business, gas and electricity showroom sales of
durable goods, sports and leisure equipment, chemists’ and photographic
goods and sales of automatic vending machines.

However, the actual trends are blurred by the introduction into specialised
shops of other specialities, for example, clothing multiples opening food
sections, and vice versa. Though gas and electricity showroom business was
buoyant between 1961 and 1966, their combined turnover is relatively small,
amounting in 1966 to ^186 million.
The real expansion in the volume of sales in Great Britain between 1961 and
1966, taking into account the exclusion of market traders (included in the 1961
Census) and a general increase in prices of 15 per cent, was about 10 per cent,
or an average of 2 per cent a year. Sales by all kinds of retail business increased
in real terms by 5 per cent between 1966 and 1971, when they were valued at
some £15,500 million.

The development of self-service trading has been a feature of the last two
decades. In 1969 there were some 23,000 stores operating wholly or partly
on self-service lines, compared with about 9,500 towards the end of 1961 and

less than 500 in 1950. This development has been accompanied by a trend to
larger shops in terms of both staff and floor space.
Supermarkets may be defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling
area of 2,000 square feet. There were about 870 supermarkets in 1961, accord¬
ing to the Census of Distribution, of which 524 were owned by multiples,
308 by co-operative societies and 38 by independents. It has been estimated
that by the end of 1971 nearly 5>000 bad been opened and were handling over
half of all grocery shop sales.
New forms of automatic vending machines have come to the fore since 1955.
About 400,000 machines are in use. Sales from automatic vending machines
totalled j£i55 million in 1971; about £79 million was accounted for by
sales from cigarette machines. Machines now sell not only cigarettes, sweets
(£9 million) and stamps but also hot and cold beverages (about £56 million),
prepared foodstuffs, stockings, paper-back books and other commodities,
including various types of fuel. Total sales through machines fell by some £15
million in 1971, largely because of a fall in the number of machines following
Britain’s conversion to decimal currency. Organisations operating automatic
vending machines (not otherwise engaged in retail trade) numbered 56 in
1966, and sales of machines totalled nearly £11 million.
Some 11,700 mobile shops1 were reported in the Census of Distribution for
1961, with sales amounting to £93 million. Nearly a quarter of this turnover
was concentrated in Scotland (where the density of population is lower than
in England) compared with a tenth of all retail sales. Co-operative societies
accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food shops, against 16 per
cent in ordinary food shops. For the most part, mobile shops were concerned
with food sales; about 42 per cent were travelling grocers, and over 28 per cent
and 21 per cent respectively were greengrocers and butchers. Only about 6 per
cent were non-food shops, and these specialised mainly in paraffin supplies
and hardware.
A number of large ‘out of town’ stores are being opened, providing a range
of goods under one roof, associated with extensive car parking facilities, away
from established central shopping areas.
Forms of consumer sales promotion include reduced price offers, competitions,
gift schemes, and stamp trading. The stamps can be exchanged for goods but,
by law, have to be marked with their cash value and redeemed for cash on
request.
The ‘credit card’ is now widely used in Britain. The cards enable users to have
their signatures accepted on bills in participating shops, hotels and restaurants.
The issuers, which include banks, then meet the bills and recover from the
card-holder through a single account presented periodically. Users of certain
cards are also required to pay a regular subscription.
Mail order trading has been one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain in recent years. The 1966 Census of Distribution showed that the
sales of retail mail order businesses had almost doubled in five years from
£227 million to £429 million. Turnover continued to rise strongly between
1966 and 1971, when at £570 million it accounted for 4 per cent of total retail
1 Excluding roundsmen and vans selling ice-cream.

sales. Turnover in 1971 showed little further increase as a temporary result
of the postal strike in the early months of the year.
Sales by manufacturers direct to the public totalled ^144 million in 1961,
compared with £70 million in 1950. Mail order sales accounted for 24 per
cent of the former total, sales to employees for 11 per cent, and charges for
work done for 9 per cent. Other direct sales, including sales by door-to-door
salesmen, accounted for the balance. Included in these sales were items as
various as carpets, washing machines, brushes, books and soft drinks.
The Direct Sales and Service Association consists of 18 companies which
sell all their products directly to the consumers. Sales by members of the
association amounted to about £300 million in 1970.

Closely connected with the distributive trades are those which offer a service
directly to the public, notably catering and hotel trades, laundries and dry
cleaners, garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and boot and shoe
repairers.
In 1964 there were 149,000 establishments concerned with catering (defined
to include public houses, canteens and fish and chip shops, as well as licensed
hotels and restaurants) with a total turnover of nearly £2,000 million. Hotels
and holiday camps had receipts of about £286 million, of which ^124 million
was from residential accommodation; in addition over £100 million was spent
on accommodation in unlicensed hotels and boarding houses. Nearly half the
total turnover of the catering trades was from the sale of alcoholic drinks.
Between 1964 and 1971 the catering trades’ turnover increased by 49 per cent,
rising by 13 per cent in 1971 alone. In addition, about 100,000 offices and
factories have installed coin-operated beverage and snack machines.
There were about 5,600 commercial laundries, launderettes, linen and overalls
hire businesses and dry-cleaning businesses with an annual turnover of £170
million in 1966. Between 1961 and 1966 turnover increased by 53 per cent
with particularly marked growth in launderettes and linen and overalls hire.
Between 1966 and 1971 turnover of traditional laundries and dry-cleaning
businesses rose by only 10 per cent.
There were nearly 43,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain in 1967
with 51,000 establishments. Total turnover amounted to £4,198 million, of
which sales of new vehicles accounted for £1,475 million and sales of used
vehicles for £766 million. The value of sales of accessories and receipts from
repairs and servicing was £982 million; sales of petrol and oil amounted to
£849 million. Between 1967 and 1971 motor trades turnover increased
rapidly by about 47 per cent and in 1971 was 17 per cent more than in i97°-
Of the total turnover of about £6,170 million in i97I> sa^es °f new vehicles
accounted for some 37 per cent, sales of second-hand vehicles for 17 per cent
and other sales (including over £600 million for servicing and repair work)
for the remainder.
Takings in hairdressing establishments increased very rapidly between 1950
(£38 million) and 1961 (£97 million), and between 1961 and 1966 to £136
million. In 1966 there were about 48,000 hairdressing establishments.
In 1966 there were some 8,800 boot and shoe repair establishments (excluding
repairs by footwear shops); they had takings of £26 million.
Other establishments offering a service to the public include those of radio and
television rental companies (over 3>8oo shops), about 14,500 licensed betting
offices and over 3,500 funeral undertaking businesses.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
247
British industry’s expenditure on packaging in 1971 has been estimated at
about j£i,ooo million, a rise of some 11 per cent over the 1970 level. The expan¬
sion of self-service shops, the spread of branded and standardised products,
and developments in partly prepared foods, for example, ready-washed vege¬
tables and ready-made cake mixes, have been major factors in the great changes
which have taken place in packaging methods. Paper packaging, including
cartons and boxes, remains the most extensively used (turnover of some £442
million a year), the fastest growing sector being paper sacks (£38 million in
1971). Other important materials are tinplate (£180 million), plastics (£120
million), glass (£103 million) and cellulose film (£12 million). New uses are
being found for tinplate, especially in sales of soft drinks and beer; sales of glass
bottles and jars for newer packaging uses at £63 million greatly exceed sales for
their traditional use as containers for wines, spirits, beer and cider (£39 million).
The use of plastics continues to develop; output of plastics films is some
100,000 tons per year and that of polypropylene about 1,600 tons, while the
annual output of low-density polythene bottles has risen to about 550 million,
providing further competition for the traditional glass bottle.
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such
as cars, furniture, washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and cookers,
has been greatly helped by instalment purchase. Total new credit extended in
1971 amounted to over £2,000 million, 17 per cent more than in 1970; nearly
half was advanced by finance companies and half by durable goods shops,
department stores and other instalment credit retailers (mainly mail order
businesses).
The DTI has powers to regulate the terms of hire-purchase, credit sales
and rental agreements in order to restrain the expansion of consumer credit.
In July 1971 all restrictions on terms were removed.
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating from offices in Northern Ireland amounted in 1971 to
£26-2 million.
About £591 million is estimated to have been spent on all forms of advertising
in 1971; as a proportion of the gross national product (1 - 2 per cent) and of con¬
sumer expenditure (i’7 per cent), it has fallen slightly over the last ten years.
About £409 million was spent on display advertising and ^182 million on
classified, financial and industrial advertising. Most of the advertising is carried
out by agencies, which, in some cases, also provide marketing, consumer
research and other services; their representative organisation is the Institute of
Practitioners in Advertising. The trade association for the whole industry,
including agencies, advertisers and media owners, is the Advertising Associa¬
tion. It was responsible for the setting up of the Advertising Standards Authority,
an independent body whose objective is the promotion and enforcement of the
highest standards of advertising, in particular through the British Code of
Advertising Practice.
Industry and commerce pay great attention to improving public understand¬
ing of their work and objectives. Public relations consultancy firms and the
public relations departments of advertising agencies provide general services,
apart from the increasing employment by industrial organisations and trade
associations of staff specialists in public relations. Their professional body,
founded in 1948, is The Institute of Public Relations which has members in
commerce, industry, the professions, national associations, and central and local
government.

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Various legislative measures exist in the United Kingdom to protect the
consumer against specific abuses. The most important are the Weights and
Measures Act 1963 and the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, which are enforced
by local weights and measures authorities; the Food and Drugs Acts 1955 and
1956 which control the purity, hygiene and description of food and are en¬
forced by local food and drugs authorities; and the Consumer Protection Act
1961 which empowers the Government to make regulations to ensure the
safety of any class of goods.
The Hire-Purchase Act 1965 and the Hire-Purchase (Scotland) Act 1965
provide safeguards to the consumer who buys goods on hire-purchase or
credit sale terms. The protection extends to agreements up to £2,000 although
most of the safeguards do not apply to credit sale agreements for less than £30.
Similar legislation operates in Northern Ireland. As a precaution against
fraud, virtually every hire-purchase agreement on a car is registered with
H.P. Information Ltd., a non-profit-making company whose members are car
dealers or finance companies concerned with car sales.
The British Standards Institution (see p. 260) has established a number of
standards for consumer goods, and the Design Council (see p. 260) helps to
foster improvements in the design of consumer goods.
A number of private organisations exist to further the consumer’s interests.
The largest is the Consumers’ Association (CA) with a membership of over
600,000. The CA conducts an extensive programme of comparative testing of
goods bought on the open market. Its views and test reports are published in
its monthly bulletin Which?, issued to members.
Work of this kind is also carried out by some 80 local consumer groups,
whose representative body is the National Federation of Consumer Groups.
Other private consumer organisations include the Housewife’s Trust and the
Research Institute for Consumer Affairs. A general advisory service dealing
with individual consumers’ problems is provided by the Citizens’ Advice
Bureaux (see p. 123).
The practice of resale price maintenance and its enforcement by cutting off
supplies was made unlawful under the Resale Prices Act 1964; some limited
exemptions for certain classes of goods (notably pharmaceuticals) have been
granted by the Restrictive Practices Court (see p. 251).
13 INDUSTRY
The Structure
of Industry
Manufacturing
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to become highly
industrialised, and today 28 people work in manufacturing, mining and building
for every one engaged in agriculture. It is the world’s third largest exporter of
manufactured goods, and the range of its industrial manufactures reflects its
position as one of the most important workshops of the world.
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms, and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary from
the many small workshops to vast organisations such as the National Coal
Board, a public corporation with about 355,000 employees, Imperial Chemical
Industries Ltd. and the General Electric Company Ltd., which, with labour
forces in the United Kingdom of 137,000 and 205,000 respectively, are among
the largest limited liability companies; and the Co-operative Wholesale Society
Ltd., with about 33,000 employees.
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Exceptions include
fissile materials and radioactive isotopes made by two statutory companies,
iron, steel and a small range of chemicals from the plants of the British Steel
Corporation, aero-engines made by Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd., locomotives and
rolling-stock built in the workshops of British Railways and military equipment
and supplies made in establishments of the defence services. Staff of the
Stationery Office do some printing and bookbinding. Certain factories giving
employment to the severely disabled are operated by Remploy Ltd., a non-
profit-making public company financed on the Vote of the Department of
Employment, which appoints the directors (see p. 370). The Government holds
about 49 per cent of the equity of a major oil company, British Petroleum
Limited, and has a controlling interest in a few other companies.
The most recent analysis of the size distribution of establishments and
enterprises in manufacturing industry, and of the degree of concentration, is
contained in the Report of the Census of Production 1963. This shows that some
57 per cent (52,000) of the 90,000 or so establishments which submitted returns
had fewer than 25 employees each, and accounted for only 6 per cent of total
employment; some 30,000 establishments, one-third of the total, had between
25-500 employees, and accounted for over two-fifths of the total labour force;
2,400 establishments, each with between 500 and 2,000 employees, were
responsible for 28 per cent of employment; while 19 per cent was in the hands
of the 430 leading groups each with over 2,000 employees. A high proportion
of the biggest establishments were in the heavy industries; the average size of
establishments in industries making consumer goods was smaller than in
manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with results obtained in
earlier years suggested a slow but significant trend towards increased average
size of establishments.
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of manu¬
facturing enterprises, as a single enterprise may own several establishments,
not all of them necessarily engaged in the same or similar activities.

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
An enterprise, as defined in the 1963 census, normally consists of either a
single firm or a parent company together with its subsidiaries. Just over 60 per
cent of all employment in British manufacturing industries in 1963 was
accounted for by about 975 large private enterprises employing 1,000 or more
people, the largest 100 or so accounting roughly for a third. A further indica¬
tion of company size is the value of capital employed (net assets). In the case
of three companies the Imperial Chemical Industries group, British Petroleum
and Shell Transport and Trading, the figure exceeds £1,500 million; about
75 companies registered in Britain have over £100 million net assets.
With intensified competition in the economy and, in many branches of
industry, the growing dependence of profitable operation on concentration and
an increasing scale of production, the trend towards mergers and regrouping
gathered momentum throughout the last decade. Larger units of control have
been established in almost all the leading industries and in some a small
number of big companies and their subsidiaries are responsible for most of
total production. Examples are oil refining, non-ferrous metal smelting, motor
vehicles and aircraft, heavy electrical engineering, electronics, machine tools,
brewing, textiles, basic chemicals, tobacco and magazine publishing. Shares
in these companies are usually distributed among a great number of holders
and it is rare for a few large holders to have a controlling interest. For example,
six of the largest public companies each have more than 100,000 shareholders.
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on
pp. 286-310.
Large-scale building and civil engineering work is usually carried out by
private contractors, although the Department of the Environment (see p. 51)
is the largest single employer of building labour while some two-fifths of the
industry’s output is for public authorities. Building firms may be divided into
those undertaking general building and civil engineering work and those con¬
cerned with highly specialised work, many of which operate outside as well as
inside the building industry. Building is an industry of small firms; almost
three-quarters of the firms employ fewer than 25 employees. For a fuller
account of the building and civil engineering industries, see p. 284.
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining.
Britain’s coalmining industry is operated as a single co-ordinated enterprise
under National Coal Board direction. Nearly all other mining and quarrying
(sand, gravel, chalk, limestone, salt, tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is under¬
taken by private enterprises, usually owned and operated by limited liability
companies; about 55,500 workers are employed, excluding coalmining.
Legislation exists for scrutinising and, if desirable, for the investigation by an
independent administrative body of monopoly situations and for the judicial
examination of restrictive trading agreements.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Acts 1956 and 1968 govern the registration
and judicial examination of restrictive agreements. They require the entry in
a public register of the particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements
(including those relating to common prices, approved lists of dealers and the
limitation of production) which affect the supply or processing of goods for
the United Kingdom market. Proposed agreements of national importance
which promote efficiency or provide for new productive capacity, can be
exempted from this requirement for a specified period by the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry (see p. 258). The Registrar of Restrictive Trading
Agreements is responsible for keeping the register and for bringing the agree-

ments before the Restrictive Practices Court set up under the 1956 Act. The
Court, which includes laymen but is presided over by one of Her Majesty’s
judges, is, in effect, responsible for deciding whether an agreement is in the
public interest. If the parties to an agreement fail to satisfy the Court that
special circumstances set out in the legislation exist, and that the restriction is
not unreasonable, having regard to the balance between the benefit it confers
and any public detriment likely to result from its operation, that restriction
must be found contrary to the public interest. Agreements are void in respect
of restrictions so found. The Court can make orders preventing the parties
from operating their agreement, or from making new arrangements having the
same effect. Agreements relating exclusively to exports are not subject to this
procedure but have to be notified to the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry.
Under the 1956 Act collective enforcement of resale price maintenance was
prohibited, but individual suppliers remained free to enforce minimum resale
prices in the courts. The Resale Prices Act 1964 made minimum resale price
maintenance unlawful, except in respect of classes of registered goods for
which temporary exemption has been sought under the provisions of the Act.
Where resale price maintenance is prohibited, it is also unlawful to notify to
dealers prices stated or calculated to be understood as the minimum price
which may be charged on the resale of goods in the United Kingdom, or to
seek to maintain such prices by withholding supplies. Suppliers may continue
to practise resale price maintenance on registered goods, pending a decision
by the Restrictive Practices Court as to whether a case for exemption has
been made out against the criteria in the Act. Periodically, the Registrar of
Restrictive Trading Agreements issues lists of classes of goods in respect of
which the Court has refused to make an Order exempting them from the
terms of the Act. Only two classes of goods (books and maps and medicaments)
have so far gained exemption under an order from the court; nearly 500 classes
have been refused exemption.
Monopolies and kindred arrangements (other than those within the scope
of the Restrictive Practices Court) may, in circumstances indicated in the
Monopolies and Mergers Act 1948 and 1965, be referred to the Monopolies
Commission by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for investiga¬
tion and report. If the Monopolies Commission finds that monopoly conditions
operate against the public interest, the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) has powers to remedy or prevent harm which in its opinion may result.
These powers are implemented by Order, with the approval of Parliament.
The 1965 Act strengthened and extended the legislation on monopolies. It
reorganised and enlarged the Monopolies Commission; provided for the
investigation, at the reference of the DTI, of services as well as goods and of
proposed or recently completed mergers; made special provision for newspaper
mergers; and improved and extended the Government’s powers—subject to
parliamentary control—for taking action on the basis of the Monopolies
Commission reports including new powers to prohibit mergers and break up
undesirable monopolies and mergers.
Direct State participation in productive and commercial activities is effected
mainly through special statutory bodies set up to deal with a particular
activity. Such bodies, though not part of a government department, are under
a considerable but varying degree of public control (see below). The most
important of these statutory bodies are the public corporations which operate
major industries and services in the public interest. Altogether about 12 per
252
Industrial
Association
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
cent of the labour force works for these bodies. Their managing boards and
staffs are chosen for their experience and competence in a particular field; they
are not civil servants, and, although accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring depart¬
ments who are responsible for the management of the corporations. Certain of
the corporations are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer grants to help
them carry out duties with which they have been charged.
These corporations are described in their relevant sections.
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working
of the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of
each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to how
the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day management.
It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister any in¬
formation, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In practice,
as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy decisions
are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion for him to
issue a formal directive.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual
statutory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so
that receipts at least balance outgoings. The responsible minister is usually
empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to say what shall be done with any
surplus revenues which may accrue. As regards finance of capital expenditure,
the present system is that finance which cannot be met from internal sources is
provided mainly by interest bearing loans from the Exchequer; bank advances
are used for normal requirements of short-term capital.
It is usual for the minister responsible for each nationalised industry to be
required by statute to take steps to see that the interests of the industry’s
customers are protected. This is generally done by the establishment of
representative consumers’ councils to consider complaints and suggestions
made to them, and to advise the board or the minister on the changes they
think desirable.
Financial targets have been agreed by the Government with the different
industries (or are under discussion) ranging from 12-4 per cent gross return
on capital employed to ‘breaking even’ after interest and depreciation have
been allowed for. In addition the industries are expected to apply a test
discount rate for new investment of 10 per cent.
Government policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are
afforded by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts,
and by answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible
only if concerned with policy rather than details of administration. A House of
Commons Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries, which examines
the reports and accounts of the nationalised industries and reports to Parlia¬
ment, has been in operation since 1957.
From the middle of the nineteenth century, private industrial undertakings
have increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different
purposes. Some of the more important of these are classified as: (1) the pro¬
vision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison with the
Government, and representation of their members’ point of view; (2) the
regulation of trading practices, sometimes including the regulation of prices

and the South-east
Region
(see p. 250); (3) negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of
work. Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with varying
completeness, most of British industry, but there are wide sectors of industry
where there are no collective agreements to regulate trading practices. Em¬
ployers’ organisations which deal with labour matters usually consist of firms
engaged in the same type of operation or manufacturing process. Trade
associations, concerned mainly with representation to the Government, the
provision of common services and the regulation of trade practice are normally
composed of firms manufacturing a particular product or group of products.
In an industrial sector concerned wholly with an allied group of products, a
single association may undertake all the required functions.
There are about 70 national federations and probably altogether about
1,300 employers’ organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or
branches of the national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages
and conditions of work. The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned
with providing common services is not known precisely but is thought to total
some 1,200, varying greatly in importance, structure and activities.
The central body representing British industry nationally is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI). It is recognised by the Government as a
channel for consultation between government departments and representatives
of private employers as a whole. For its members it acts as an advisory and
consultative body providing them with information and statistics, ascertaining
their collective views and representing them nationally to the Government
and the public and also internationally, for example in the Council of European
Industrial Federations. CBI representatives sit on a number of government
advisory committees, on other statutory bodies and on voluntary bodies con¬
cerned with matters affecting industry.
The CBI membership consists of some 13,000 companies and about 210
trade associations and employers’ federations. Nationalised industries have
joined as industrial associates. The CBI has a regional organisation in the
United Kingdom and is widely represented abroad.
In matters of common concern the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers
of commerce. These are open to all kinds of producers and traders and exist
to promote the interests of local industry and commerce. The Association of
British Chambers of Commerce, founded in i860, is the central organisation
to which 92 local chambers of commerce (together with 19 British Chambers of
Commerce operating abroad) are affiliated. In Scotland there is an additional
central organisation, the Scottish Chamber of Commerce, and in Northern
Ireland, the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry to which
local chambers are affiliated.
The following is a summary of the geographical distribution of British industry
today, grouped according to the eight standard regions of England, plus Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
London, lying at the head of ocean navigation on the Thames estuary, is
Britain’s capital and main communication centre, probably still the world’s
most important financial centre, and one of the world’s four largest cities
(with Tokyo, New York and Mexico City) and three largest ports (with New
York and Rotterdam). It is the main centre in Britain of printing, cinema film
production and the manufacture of clothing, food and drink, furniture, materials
for the arts, precision instruments and many other specialised products. Small
firms predominate in many of these industries and the average size of manu-

facturing firms (particularly in the central area) is well below the national
average. London is also important, especially in its outer ring, for light
engineering, chemicals and consumer goods and has some heavy engineering
plants and a number of leading research establishments.
Towards the periphery of Greater London (population 7,379,014) and in
the new urban development outside it, industry, particularly the electronics
and a variety of consumer goods industries, has expanded greatly; some of the
largest aircraft plants are in these areas, for example at Weybridge and Hatfield,
as well as factories, at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable, of two of the four
main motor vehicle manufacturers. There are other major motor vehicle
manufacturing plants at Cowley, Oxford (109,000), some 50 miles north-west
of London. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries there are large oil
refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering works and major
concentrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
A great part of the Channel coast eastwards from Poole (population 107,000)
and Bournemouth (153,000) consists of built-up areas, which from Brighton
(166,000) eastwards are partly dormitories for people working in London.
Holiday resorts fringe the coast. Portsmouth (197,000) is a naval port with
some shipbuilding and general manufactures. Southampton (215,000) is
Britain’s largest port for ocean-going liners; its industries include ship repair¬
ing, oil refining, cable-making, electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover,
Folkestone and Newhaven are packet ports.
Devon and Cornwall have a considerable tourist trade. Bristol (425,000) is a
leading port and commercial centre with aircraft, aero-engines, tobacco, food
processing, paper, printing and other industries and important non-ferrous
metals and basic chemicals plants at Avonmouth. Gloucester (90,000), origin¬
ally an inland port and commercial town, Cheltenham (70,000), originally a
resort town, and the area between and adjacent to them produce a variety of
manufactures, including machinery, instruments and accessories, and cloth.
Swindon (91,000), besides railway workshops, has important engineering
works. Bath (85,000), originally a resort town and centre of an agricultural
district, has become noted for engineering and other manufacturing.
Besides being one of the most productive agricultural regions, the eastern
counties possess some sizeable towns. Cambridge (99,000) is a leading centre
of research-based industry; Ipswich (123,000) and Peterborough (70,000) are
noted for diesel engines, agricultural machinery and engineering generally;
and Norwich (122,000) for footwear and food manufacture. Food canning and
freezing, based mainly on locally grown produce, have developed rapidly.
The fishing ports of Great Yarmouth (50,000) and Lowestoft (52,000) have
fish processing plants, and have also become important bases for companies
engaged in natural gas exploitation in the North Sea.
The West Midlands conurbation, which stretches from Birmingham (1,013,000)
to Wolverhampton (269,000) and includes parts of Staffordshire, Worcester¬
shire and Warwickshire, has an unusually wide variety of industry, including
the manufacture of metals, electrical and engineering products of all kinds and
also jewellery, rubber products, chemicals and domestic metalware. The
largest concentrations of motor vehicle manufacture (including components
and accessories) in Britain are in Birmingham and Coventry (335,000).
The smaller conurbation of North Staffordshire, centred on Stoke-on-Trent
(265,000), is devoted chiefly to the manufacture of pottery and china and to
INDUSTRY
255
coalmining, although other industries are growing in importance, while
Stafford (55,000) has heavy electrical and other engineering works.
Other industrial centres are Rugby (59,000), electrical engineering;
Worcester (73,000), machinery; Burton upon Trent (50,000), brewing and
rubber; and Kidderminster (47,000), carpets.
The industrial cities and towns of the East Midlands include Leicester
(284,000), noted for hosiery and knitwear, boots and shoes and machinery for
making these products; Derby (219,000) for general engineering, aero-engines
and man-made fibres; Nottingham (303,000) for hosiery, cycles and a variety
of other engineering products, lace, pharmaceutical products and tobacco;
Northampton (127,000), footwear and engineering; Chesterfield (69,000),
engineering. Corby (48,000), a new town in Northamptonshire, has a large
integrated steel works. Part of Britain’s richest and most highly mechanised
coalfield lies under the north-east of the area. Some of the towns on the coal¬
field, such as Mansfield (58,000), have important manufacturing industries,
particularly textiles.
Manchester (541,000) is the commercial hub of the cotton and man-made
fibre textiles industries, a very important financial and commercial centre and
a major port. It is also one of the chief centres for electrical and heavy engineer¬
ing and the production of machine tools, petrochemicals, dyestuffs, and
pharmaceutical goods, while it has a wide range of other manufactures. In
the traditional cotton-manufacturing towns man-made fibres are also pro¬
cessed alone or blended with cotton; the largest of these are Bolton (154,000),
Oldham (106,000), Rochdale (91,000), Stockport (140,000), Burnley (76,000),
Blackburn (102,000), Preston (97,000) and Bury (68,000). In the majority of
these towns engineering industries, notably the manufacture of printing, paper
making, textile and electrical machinery and heavy commercial vehicles
(especially in the Chorley-Leyland area), have been expanding while the
cotton industry has been declining. The Lancashire coalfield also lies in the
Manchester-Wigan area.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of overseas
trade, links Manchester and Merseyside. It passes through Warrington
(68,000), with its metal industries (such as wire-drawing), Widnes (57,000) and
Runcorn (36,000) with their chemicals, and Ellesmere Port (62,000) with its
oil refinery installations, before reaching the Mersey estuary. St. Helens
(104,000), to the north of the canal, is famous for glass manufacture. Liverpool
(607,000) is the second port of Britain, a great commercial and insurance
centre and, after London, the greatest centre for processing imported food¬
stuffs and raw materials, noted especially for flour milling, soap manufacture,
sugar refining and rubber products. Among its older industries is ship repair¬
ing; shipbuilding is a major industry across the river at Birkenhead (138,000).
Many new industries, including electrical engineering, manufacture of heavy
industrial equipment and, more recently, of motor vehicles, have been
established around Liverpool. Salt, extracted in Cheshire, is used mainly by
chemical works on Merseyside.
Barrow (64,000) in the north-west of Lancashire, is well known for ship¬
building and marine engineering. Blackpool (151,000) on the coast is one of
Britain’s most popular holiday resorts.
About three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s worsted and woollen industries
are found in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Bradford (294,000) is the com¬
mercial centre of the wool trade and important for worsted; Wakefield
256

Wales
BRITAIN I973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(60,000) produces both worsted and woollens; Morley (44,000) and Leeds
(495,000) have specialised in cheaper cloths, and Batley (42,000), Dewsbury
(51,000) and Spenborough (41,000) in heavy cloth, but their production is
becoming more diversified. Huddersfield (131,000) has a reputation for fine
woollens and worsteds and Halifax (91,000) for carpets. In most of the larger
centres of the wool industry a variety of engineering products are manu¬
factured. Leeds, the commercial capital of the area, has a large ready-made
clothing industry and important engineering plants. Farther south is the heavy
engineering centre of Sheffield (520,000), famous for its high quality steels,
cutlery and tools. The area’s extensive coalfields provide over one-fifth of
Britain’s coal; Doncaster (83,000), also with tractor and nylon manufacturing,
and Barnsley (75,000) are the largest towns on the coalfield.
York (104,000) is noted for chocolates and confectionery manufacture and
has important railway workshops, and Hull (285,000), one of the world’s
largest fishing ports and with many manufacturing industries, including
engineering, vegetable oil processing, chemicals and sawmilling, is the most
important industrial town in the East Riding of Yorkshire.
On the south (Lincolnshire) side of the Humber lie Scunthorpe (71,000),
an important and expanding steel-making centre, and the major fishing port of
Grimsby (96,000) which has a food processing industry and also growing
chemicals and textiles industries close by at Immingham.
The greater part of this region (Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland,
Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire) is an area of mountains, lakes and
moors and is relatively thinly populated. Most of its population is concentrated
in the coastal strip from the coalfields north of the Tyne to the Tees. Within
this area the main centres are Tyneside, including Newcastle upon Tyne
(222,000), Gateshead (94,000), Tynemouth (69,000), South Shields (101,000),
Wallsend (46,000) and Jarrow (29,000); and Teesside (395,000) and Hartlepool
(97,000). Other large towns are Sunderland (217,000), Darlington (86,000) and
in the west, Carlisle (71,000).
The whole region is more dependent than other parts of England on
traditional heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manufacture,
shipbuilding and repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical plants on
both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe), which
together employ over one-quarter of the male workers. This proportion has
been falling steadily as the result of the region’s efforts, with government help,
to attract new types of enterprise. It is one of the most important areas for the
manufacture of electrical plant, and the many other industries include mining
machinery, rolling mill plant, earth-moving equipment, machine tools, ropes,
paint, glass, clothing and scientific instruments. An aluminium smelter is
nearing completion on the Northumberland coast. Atomic energy is important
in Cumberland, with two nuclear power stations and other installations.
Over two-thirds of the population of Wales and Monmouthshire live in the
two counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. In this area are the coal
mines which, though long worked and operating at increasing depths, still
produce nearly all Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and other
specialised coals, and employ more workers than any branch of manufacturing
industry. Rhondda (89,000) and Merthyr Tydfil (55,000) are the largest
centres in the coalmining area. The steel industry, with some of the most
modern plants in Europe, supplies almost all Britain’s output of tin plate and
much of its sheet steel. In the past 35 years many new industries have been
established, often on government industrial estates; they include plastics,

synthetic fibres, clothing, electronics, motor vehicle components and light
engineering.
The main urban centres are also the three major ports—Cardiff (278,000),
Newport (112,000) and Swansea (173,000). Milford Haven (14,000), a magni¬
ficent deep-water harbour recently developed, has two major oil refineries.
In North Wales a number of light industries, notably man-made fibres, are
located in the seaside resorts and some other towns, particularly Wrexham
(39,000), and there is a large steelworks in Flintshire.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population (5-2 million) is concentrated in
the central Lowlands between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The
principal cities in this area are Glasgow (897,000) and Edinburgh (453,000).
Clydeside, which includes Glasgow, is a major shipbuilding and marine
engineering centre; it also has a great variety of general engineering enter¬
prises and other industries. The steel industry, sited mainly in north Lanark¬
shire, produces a wide range of products. The widely dispersed electronics
equipment industry is represented by a growing number of firms in such
centres as Glasgow, north Lanarkshire, Dundee and central Fife, as well as in
Edinburgh, where this and other modern industries are expanding alongside
the long-established engineering, printing and brewing industries. Motor car
manufacture has been established in Renfrewshire and in West Lothian there
has been a major expansion of commercial vehicle building.
With the major oil discoveries which have been made in the North Sea (see
p. 271), the area around Aberdeen is becoming a major oil centre and substantial
development by oil-based industries is taking place.
Outside the central Lowland belt there is considerable industrial concentra¬
tion in and around Dundee (182,000) and Aberdeen (182,000) and a number
of towns outside these areas have attracted light industries in recent years.
Dundee’s traditional manufacture, jute, has been supplemented by office
machinery, clocks and watches, refrigerators and electronic products. In
north-east Scotland is the largest concentration of whisky distilleries, while
the paper and metal industries are also important.
Most of northern Scotland is mountainous and much of southern Scotland
is hilly and rugged. These regions are sparsely populated, but the Scottish
Highlands possess significant resources of hydro-electric power (see p. 276).
There are high-quality tweed and knitwear industries both in the valley
towns of the Borders and in the Highlands and Islands. Small engineering and
electronics industries have recently been established in towns in the Borders
and the south-west. Small-scale manufacturing has also been introduced in the
Highlands, and larger enterprises include the experimental atomic reactor
establishment at Dounreay and the aluminium smelter recently commissioned
at Invergordon. (see p. 289).
Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small and lacking in
minerals, there is substantial and growing industrialisation, particularly in and
around Belfast, the capital city (359,000). Britain’s largest single shipyard
incorporating the world’s biggest shipbuilding berth is in Belfast; other long-
established activities include the manufacture of textile machinery and other
engineering products; ropes, twine, tobacco and clothing. Northern Ireland
has also long been an important centre for textiles—it is particularly well
known for linen. The textile industry is now diversified; Northern Ireland is
one of the most important areas in Europe for man-made fibre production and
provides over one-fifth of Britain’s output. There has also been extensive

development in vehicle components, oil-well equipment, electronic instruments,

The Government can influence industrial activity in a number of ways—
through fiscal and monetary policy, through the level of public expenditure,
through the placing of government contracts, through the policies of publicly
owned enterprises, by physical controls, by inducements, by exhortation and
by the provision of services, information and advice. Apart from labour
legislation (see Chapter 16) and certain export and import controls over a
small range of products (see Chapter 12), there are few physical controls over
industry—the main ones are the use of the legislation concerning monopolies
and restrictive practices already described (see p. 250) and the operation of
powers to control new industrial and office building and changes in land use.
There is close association between industry and the Government through
such channels as the National Economic Development Council, the main forum
for consultation between the Government, management and the trade unions,
and Economic Development Committees (EDCs) which cover particular
industrial sectors.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), set up in October 197° f-0
combine the functions of the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Technology,
is the first single body with responsibility for all policies affecting production
and trade (both internal and export), and for the Government’s relations with
individual industries. Following a review of the machinery for aerospace policy
and defence procurement, the former, together with civil aerospace research,
has become the responsibility of the DTI, while the latter is handled by a new
procurement executive at the Ministry of Defence.
Policies on labour matters, including industrial relations, industrial training
and manpower in general are the concern of the Department of Employment.
Other departments involved with industrial issues are the Treasury (fiscal and
monetary policy and medium- and long-term economic questions); the
Department of Education and Science, which is responsible for the promotion
of education and for civil science, operating primarily through the research
councils; and the Department of the Environment (relations with the con¬
struction industry and some regional matters).
In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Commerce deals with industry and
industrial development.
The Central Statistical Office (CSO), which is attached to the Cabinet Office,
is the central body for government statistics. Although departments them¬
selves compile statistics relating to their responsibilities and may publish them
in their own standard publications, the comprehensive statistical publications
are prepared by the CSO, which acts as co-ordinator. The Business Statistical
Office, which is responsible to the CSO for policy but is administratively part
of the DTI, will eventually take over the responsibility for compiling a wide
range of statistics relating to industry and commerce.
Industrial production (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction,
and gas, electricity and water) was in the first half of 1971 fractionally less
than a year previously, about one-third higher than in i960 and about double
the pre-war level. The course of production and employment from 1963 to
1971 is shown in Table 25.
Among manufacturing industries output rose fastest between 1963 and 1971
in the chemical and allied industries (61 ‘5 per cent), in coal and petroleum

The size of the labour force has fallen slowly in the last five years and the
increases in production have been due mainly to a variety of factors influencing
productivity, including advances in products, machinery, processes and
methods of work; the rate of fixed capital formation; more intensive competi¬
tion and sales promotion; and improved management.
Although gross fixed capital formation at home has, as a whole, been well
maintained since 1966, the proportion devoted to manufacturing has tended
to fall. The total in 1971 amounted to 20 per cent of the gross domestic product
and was estimated (at current prices) to be more than double the 1959 level.
Part of this rising investment is associated with the introduction of new
techniques and equipment and in particular of machines and instruments
which lessen the demand for human skill and supervision though they may
require more skill from fewer people. This process of automation is giving rise
to far-reaching changes in the pattern of industry and in the internal organisa¬
tion and labour requirements of business enterprises and has already been
responsible for consequential increases in production and efficiency which, in
the long run, are likely to be very large. Much investment, however, still con¬
sists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more traditional kind.
Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity thus depend
most directly on the decisions of individual undertakings. But though the
promotion of productivity is regarded as primarily a matter for industry,
government departments and educational and research establishments also
have an important contribution to make. Government budgeting and financial
policies also have a strong influence on the extent and direction of demand,
and government purchasing policies take account of national industrial
objectives.
Within industry, employers’ organisations often provide technical assistance,
conduct market surveys, and support schemes of vocational education and
training, and many trade unions organise special training schemes and courses
to promote understanding of modern management techniques. Changes in
working methods to facilitate higher output feature in a number of produc¬
tivity agreements negotiated between management and workers. Private con¬
sultants specialising in management and work study are available to advise
firms on measures to increase their productive efficiency; there are also many
specialist institutions, both public and private, concerned with various aspects

of productivity. The local organisations arrange meetings, inter-factory visits,
courses, conferences, film shows and exhibitions.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making
body incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards
in respect of, among other things, quality, performance, dimensions, testing
methods and codes of practice. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by
manufacturers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies
the specification of requirements. The BSI is governed by a council consisting
of representatives of the main organisations of employers and workers, pro¬
fessional institutions and the larger government departments.
The Design Council, set up by the Government in 1944 as the Council of
Industrial Design to promote higher standards of design in British industry,
is concerned with all aspects of industrial design from durable consumer goods
to capital goods. The Council, with its Scottish Committee, is a grant-aided
body sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry; its members
include industrialists, engineers, retailers, architects, designers and educa¬
tionists and trade unionists. At The Design Centre in the Haymarket,
London, a selective but changing display of modern British consumer goods
is maintained; exhibits are chosen from Design Index, the Council’s illustrated
record of more than 10,000 well-designed products. Special exhibitions on
particular themes are also arranged regularly. An annual awards scheme,
Design Council Awards, covering capital goods and engineering equipment
as well as consumer products, was introduced in 1967* The Duke of Edinburgh
also presents his annual Design Prize. The Scottish Committee runs the
Scottish Design Centre in Glasgow, and there is an independent regional
design centre, maintaining a duplicate of the Index, at Manchester. The
Council organises temporary exhibitions in regional centres and overseas;
arranges regular conferences and training courses; undertakes industrial study
tours in Britain; and operates a designer selection service which can make
recommendations to any individual or organisation from a list of over 3,000
British graphic and industrial designers. It publishes a monthly magazine,
Design, and maintains reference and photographic libraries.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of
Arts (see p. 393), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is the
representative professional body in Great Britain of designers engaged in
industry and commerce, and the Design and Industries Association (DIA), a
voluntary association of industrial companies, designers, and others interested
in the promotion of good design in industry. The Crafts Council of Great
Britain, the Crafts Centre of Great Britain and the Scottish Craft Centre are
all grant-aided by the Department of Trade and Industry. Their aims are to
improve craft design and to promote closer relations between craftsmen and
industry.
The Department of Trade and Industry is responsible for the co-ordination of
activities related to the improvement of industrial productivity. It is represented
on the EDCs (see p. 258)—which are concerned primarily with the removal of
obstacles to efficiency—by seconded industrial advisers. The DTI is also
charged with extending the introduction of automatic control systems and
advanced techniques into industry, sponsors the BSI, the British Calibration
Service1 and the National Computing Centre, supports the National Data

scientific instruments and industrial test gear.

Processing Service, and provides technical advisory services. It is concerned
directly with research into such factors as productivity measurement tech¬
niques, group technology, production engineering and fatigue among operators.
The Conciliation and Advisory Service of the Department of Employment
advises firms on aspects of productivity connected with manpower utilisation
and industrial relations. A number of other departments have responsibilities
which bear on productivity.
Management

Industrial and
Regional Policy
In Britain, as elsewhere, management is recognised as a subject requiring
special skills and knowledge. This is reflected both in a change in the general
educational qualifications of recruits and in the spread of systematic education
and training for management.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) is the central national manage¬
ment body, independent, non-political and non-profit-making. Its purpose is
to study and promote scientific management, including management education
and training, throughout industry, commerce and public administration. The
BIM receives an annual government grant of about £100,000 to help it expand
services to industry. The Industrial Society works to promote better use of
human resources; it advises members and conducts conferences and courses.
Management studies and education for management are expanding rapidly
in Britain and have become a recognised feature of higher education (see
p. 161). There are graduate business schools in London and Manchester.
Training courses for higher management are held at several universities and
colleges, including the Administrative Staff College, Henley-on-Thames, and
Ashridge College of Management, Berkhamsted. The larger firms, especially
those with wide responsibilities, often provide general management courses
for senior executives, and systems of informal training within an organisation
are numerous. There are also bodies concerned with specialised branches of
management, for example, the Institute of Personnel Management, the
Institution of Works Managers, the Institute of Office Management and the
Institute of Marketing.
The growing number of professional personnel working as management
consultants—now about 5,000—and the use of the services of independent
management selection firms in the appointment of senior staff are further
indications of interest in the science of management in Britain.
Under the Finance Act 1972 incentives to encourage capital expenditure in
plant and machinery take the form of a system of free depreciation enabling the
whole of such expenditure to be written off against profits for tax purposes in
the year in which it is incurred; there is in addition a 40 per cent initial allow¬
ance on new industrial buildings and structures and an annual writing down
allowance of 4 per cent. To maintain a greater incentive in the development
and special development areas (see below) the tax allowances available nation¬
ally and free depreciation are reinforced by regional development grants of 20
per cent and 22 per cent respectively towards capital expenditure on certain
new plant and machinery and on new or existing industrial buildings. The
building grants are also available in the intermediate areas and—until March
1974—in derelict land clearance areas.
The aim of industrial and regional policy is to secure a full and balanced
development of the country’s resources and to stimulate a faster and steadier
expansion in national output.

Help for

Areas
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Major changes in the administration of policy were given effect by the
Industry Act 1972. A Minister for Industrial Development has been
appointed—under the broad direction of the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry—to take charge of a new Industrial Development Executive which
includes divisions of the Department of Trade and Industry concerned with
regional development. A Development Unit within the executive is responsible
for the appraisal and implementation of regional policies. The Minister is
advised on major specific cases for assistance by an Industrial Development
Board composed of representatives from industry, banking and finance.
Regional Development Boards advise on general industrial opportunities and
on applications for selective financial assistance.
The new machinery supplements and strengthens the regional economic
planning councils and boards set up in Great Britain in 1965. The councils,
comprising part-time members with wide experience of their regions, are
advisory bodies concerned with studying the needs and potentialities of the
regions; the boards consist of senior civil servants and aim at co-ordinating the
regional work of government departments. The councils and boards operate in
each of the standard regions of England (see p. 253). Scotland has its own
council and board, and there is a Welsh council (supported by an economic
planning board), concerned with both economic and social affairs.
Some parts of Britain have long been less prosperous than others. Their rate of
economic expansion has been below average and their level of unemployment
above average as a result of the decline of some traditional industries or the
lack of job opportunities. For many years unemployment has remained a
persistent problem in Scotland, Wales and the north-east and some other
parts of England. This regional imbalance has been aggravated by the tendency
for new industries to concentrate in the Midlands and the south-east where, as
a result, the demand for labour has been high and there have been increasing
problems of congestion. An important aim of the Government s regional
policy is to achieve a better distribution of industrial development betw een the
different parts of the country. The Government has in recent years taken
important measures aimed at securing balanced economic development.
Government aid to areas of high unemployment began in the 1930s and has
been developed in various ways since the end of the second world war.
Since August 1966 large parts of Britain have been designated as ‘develop¬
ment areas’ qualifying for particular assistance, with first priority being given
to smaller ‘special development areas’. Following the report of a committee set
up in 1967 to investigate the needs of areas with special economic problems
but situated outside the development areas, the Local Employment Act 1970
designated a number of such regions as intermediate areas and also created
derelict land clearance areas. The extent of the former was increased by the
Industry Act 1972. The boundaries of the assisted areas are shown in the map on
opposite page.
Besides the free depreciation allowances and grants on capital investment
there is a wide range of financial and other inducements available under the
Industry Act 1972 and the Local Employment Act 1970 to encourage industry
to expand in the assisted areas. In the development and intermediate areas the
Department of Trade and Industry may build factories for leasing, in some
cases with an initial rent-free period, or for sale on deferred terms, and provide
selective assistance including loans, and in certain circumstances grants
towards removal expenses.
Factory building and estate management are undertaken on the Department

of Trade and Industry’s behalf by the English, Scottish and Welsh Industrial
Estates Corporations; premises administered by the three Corporations total
over 60 million square feet and give employment to over 250,000 people.
Assistance from other government departments includes 85 per cent capital
grants to local authorities for clearing derelict or neglected sites and for im¬
proving basic services; and help from the Department of Employment with
the cost of training additional labour in development areas and of transferring
workers in connection with establishing new enterprises.
Since 1948 control of new industrial building has been exercised through
the use of a system of Industrial Development Certificates. Any application
under the normal town and country planning machinery for planning per¬
mission for industrial development involving more than 15,000 square feet
of industrial floor space (or 10,000 square feet in the south-east) must be
accompanied by a certificate from the Department of Trade and Industry
certifying that the development in question can be carried out consistently
with the proper distribution of industry. In considering applications the
Secretary of State pays particular regard to the need for providing appropriate
employment in the assisted areas. In practice this obligation has led to the
refusal of certificates for most projects outside the assisted areas unless it can
be shown that the project could not reasonably be undertaken in such an area
or in Northern Ireland. Subject to this priority, the control is also used to
encourage dispersal of industry to new or expanded towns taking population
from the more congested areas. Under the Town and Country Planning ct
1971 the Department of the Environment has power to control office develop¬
ment in certain areas. Office development permits are needed only for develop¬
ments of over 10,000 square feet in the south-east of England.
Northern Ireland
Under separate legislation capital grants are available at 20 per cent of the cost
of new machinery and equipment and 35 per cent of the cost of new buildings
for the manufacturing, construction and extractive industries in Northern
Ireland. There is also provision for assisting firms by means of loans to carry out
major schemes of re-equipment, to move to another area in particular need of
industrial development or to undertake a rehousing of their business in associa¬
tion with a major scheme of modernisation and reorganisation. Help under the
investment grants legislation is made without regard to how much employment
is created as a result.
As an alternative means of assistance in Northern Ireland there are compre¬
hensive and flexible powers authorised under the Industries Development Acts
for projects which offer a reasonable amount of employment. In such cases
individual development grants are available of up to 40 per cent of expenditure
on new machinery and equipment and 55 per cent of the cost of new buildings.
For those projects which offer exceptionally attractive returns in employment
or location within Northern Ireland, the assistance offered could include
tenancy of a government-built factory at a very low rent, grants towards
operating costs in the initial stages, and grants towards costs of removing
existing machinery and installing it in a factory in Northern Ireland.
Since 1945 over 300 new firms have been established in Northern Irelani
with government assistance, giving employment to some 90,000 people. The
Ministry of Commerce is the department concerned with the administration
of industrial development policies. A Finance Corporation with an initial
capital of /50 million has been formed to aid industrial and commercial
concerns which have short-term liquidity problems but long-term prospects of
viability.

Certain regions and areas in England have industrial development associations
concerned with promoting local industry. These are sponsored mainly by local
authorities, trade associations and individual firms.
Several voluntary associations are concerned with Welsh industry. The
Development Corporation for Wales, founded in 1959, is the most prominent.
In Scotland, the Highlands and Islands Development Board, set up by
statute in 1965, works to stimulate the economic and social development of
the seven ‘crofting’ counties (see p. 324). It provides grants and loans to
industrial, commercial and other enterprises; it may also acquire land, provide
management and other advisory services and set up and carry on businesses.
The Scottish Council (Development and Industry), a voluntary association,
promotes the general economic development of Scotland.
Encouragement is given to the development of rural industries. Much of this
work is done under the aegis of the Development Commission1 with finance
from the Development Fund, notably advice and guidance to small businesses
in rural areas and country towns and loans for assistance to tourism in the
rural parts of development areas. In England and Wales this service is pro¬
vided by the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas acting in consulta¬
tion with the Rural Community Councils through their Small Industries
Committees in the counties; by the Small Industries Council for Rural Areas
of Scotland; and in Northern Ireland by the newly formed Local Enterprise
Development Unit of the Ministry of Commerce. Another service provided
by the Commission is the financing of small factories to stimulate rural
industries and to combat rural depopulation.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of energy currently used in Britain are coal,
petroleum and, to a lesser extent, nuclear energy, natural gas and water power;
secondary sources produced from these are electricity, town gas and coke.
Coal, mined within the country, represents 43 per cent of primary energy
consumption, although the amount of coal used and its share of the total energy
market has been falling. Oil, on the other hand, virtually all imported, has
expanded rapidly, its share of total energy consumption having risen from 20 per
cent in 1958 to nearly 46 per cent in 1971. With the advent of nuclear power and
North Sea natural gas Britain has moved over from two fuels to four. A pro¬
gramme for nuclear power stations has been in progress since 1955 and nuclear
power now provides a significant share of electricity supplies although only
3 per cent of total energy requirements. The share of natural gas is expanding
rapidly from supplies from the North Sea discoveries. Water-power resources
are very small and cannot be developed much further. Trends in primary
energy consumption are shown in Table 26 and in the diagram on p. 268.
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of petroleum, are under
public ownership. General responsibility for the effective and co-ordinated
development of fuel and power resources lies with the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry. Research is undertaken by the fuel and fuel-using
industries. The Secretary of State also has an Advisory Council on Research
and Development.
1 The Development Commission recommends, and the Treasury approves and
administers, advances by grants or loans from the Development Fund, established by
the Development and Road Improvement Funds Acts 1909 and 1910. At the present
time the Fund may be used to help and expand the rural economy (including accom¬
modation of tourists) and also to promote the development and improvement of
fisheries.

Million tons coal equivalent
The nationalised fuel and power industries in Britain employ in total some
three-quarters of a million people, or 3 per cent of the working population;
their capital investment in 1972-73 will be in the region of £800 million; their
annual turnover is about £3,000 million; and the value of their net output is
about 5 per cent of the national product. The nationalised industry boards’
investment is financed through internal resources and borrowing from the
Government (long term), the clearing banks (short term), and from overseas
(long term) sources.
The responsible ministers—the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
in England and Wales and, for Scottish electricity, the Secretary of State for
Scotland—are required by statute to set up consultative councils for each of
the nationalised fuel industries to protect the interests of consumers. National
Industrial and Domestic Coal Consumers’ Councils were set up in 1947 and
Area Electricity and Gas Consultative Councils (supported by district com¬
mittees) were set up in 1948 and 1949 respectively. Each consists of a chairman
and from 20 to 30 unpaid members appointed from nominations put forward
by interested bodies, mainly local authorities. However, entry into the European
Coal and Steel Community (see p. 459) will involve abolition of the Industrial
Coal Consumers’ Council and modification of the terms of reference of the
Domestic Coal Consumers’ Council.
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coal¬
mining industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years
longer than in any other country. British coal exports dominated the world
market until about 1910. In 1913—the peak production year—the industry
produced 287 million tons of coal, exported 94 million tons and employed over
a million workers.
In 1947 the coal mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal
Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board as
a statutory corporation to manage the industry.
The National Coal Board (NCB) consists of a chairman and between eight
and eleven members appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry. The NCB has, with minor exceptions, exclusive rights over the
extraction of coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to license private
operators to work small pits and open-cast sites. It has no monopoly in
distribution, and retail sales remain largely in private hands, but it has some
retail depots and makes bulk sales to large industrial consumers.
The NCB is responsible for the day-to-day running and the commercial
management of the industry, but is answerable to the Secretary of State (and
268
Supply and

through him, to Parliament) for its efficiency. The Secretary of State has power
to issue general directives on matters affecting the national interest, and to
authorise borrowings to finance capital investment. Under the Coal Industry
Act 1971 he also has power to give directions relating to the Board’s non¬
colliery activities.
At the end of March 1972 there were 289 NCB collieries in operation, each
on average producing some 462,000 tons of coal, compared with 192,000 in
1947. Of these, 286 were grouped into 17 areas, each controlled by a director
responsible to the NCB. The remaining three collieries (in Kent) are controlled
by a general manager who is also responsible to the NCB.
Coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of nearly
4 million tons between 1947 and 1956; sales fell sharply, however, between

1956 and 1959 and large stocks of coal accumulated at pit heads. Growing
competition from oil, increasing efficiency in the use of coal and reduced
requirements of the gas, steel, railway transport and other industries con¬
tributed to the fall in demand which is still continuing (see Table 27). Un¬
distributed stocks have recently been run down considerably and at the end
of March 1972 were 7 million tons.
Nearly half of total consumption is by the electricity authorities and over
one-quarter by domestic and industrial users together. Coke ovens are other
large users while consumption by the gas industry is falling rapidly with the
switch to natural gas. Consumption by the electricity industry has increased
by 38 per cent since i960 to 71 - 7 million tons in 1971 whereas the requirements
of most other classes of consumer have declined. For domestic users this
fall has been slightly offset by increased purchases of solid smokeless fuels.
Coal exports have declined for somewhat similar reasons and now average
about 3 million tons a year. The peak post-war figure was 19 million tons in
1949. The biggest customer is the Federal Republic of Germany; over 90 per
cent of exports go to EEC and EFTA countries. Because of the low stock
situation, restrictions on imports of coal, coke and manufactured fuels were
lifted in December 1970. In 1971 imports amounted to over 4 million tons.
The fact that the British industry was developed so early has meant that many
of the best seams of coal are now worked out, but there are abundant reserves of
coal with which production can be maintained well into the next century;
there is also scope for opening new collieries should these be required. The
main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottingham¬
shire field, which produces about half of the total output, (2) the Durham and
Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and (4) the Scottish field.
Other important coal-bearing areas are those of Lancashire and the west Mid¬
lands (Staffordshire and Warwickshire).
Table 27 shows the main trends in the industry since 1950.
Coal consumption has fallen steadily over the past 20 years as shown in
Table 26, and fell by as much as 23-4 million tons in 1971-72 (due to a pro¬
longed industrial dispute). The fall in demand has been accompanied by
increases in productivity and has resulted in a rundown of the labour force

from some 700,000 to about 274,000. There were 12,363 fewer workers in
March 1972 than in March 1971. Overall productivity has risen by half since
1961 to 2-i tons per manshift in 1971-72. Productivity at the coal face has
doubled over the last 20 years to 6-9 tons per manshift in 1971-72- The
increases have been obtained largely by concentration on the more productive
mines and faces, by increasing mechanisation at the face, and by the use of
multishift working. At mechanised faces, output now averages 8 tons per
manshift compared with 4 tons at non-mechanised faces. Other important
measures which have contributed to increased productivity include new tech¬
niques for obtaining information about the reserves before they are worked,
intensive training of management and men to obtain the maximum utilisation
of equipment on highly mechanised faces, the increasing use of powered sup¬
ports, the use of higher horse-power machines and improvements in the
mechanised handling of coal below ground and on the surface.
The NCB raises capital, including working capital, by borrowing from the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The statutory limit on such borrow¬
ing was raised from £900 million to ^950 million in 1972. Within certain
limits the Board may also, with the permission of the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry, borrow temporarily (by way of overdraft or otherwise).
The greater proportion of investment is financed from internal resources.
Capital expenditure by the industry from 1947 to March 1972 totalled £1,864
million. The total debt to the Secretary of State at the end of March 1972
amounted to £724 million.
Under the nationalisation statute, the NCB has been required to break even
on its current account (taking one year with another) after meeting all proper
charges including provision for reserves. It has made surpluses in some years
and deficits in others. In certain areas, such as Scotland, Lancashire and 'Wales,
deficits have been persistent, and profits from the areas of high productivity,
for instance, the Midlands, have been inadequate to cover the losses sustained.
In the year ending March 1972 the NCB made an operating loss of £120
million, and after payment of interest there was a deficit of £157 million. The
maximum permitted level of accumulated deficit was raised from £7 5 mil ion
to £100 million following a miners’ strike and subsequent wage award early in
1972; in addition a £100 million emergency grant was made.
To assist the redeployment of manpower and the elimination of uneconomic
colliery capacity, the Coal Industry Act 1971 authorised the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry to make grants on a tapering basis up to a maximum
aggregate amount of £24 million over the three years to 1974-
The NCB has two research organisations: a Coal Research Establishment,
at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, providing facilities for
fundamental research; and a Mining Research and Development Establish¬
ment, near Bretby, Derbyshire, for the investigation of underground problems,
developing new machines and testing equipment.
Research associations receiving grants from the NCB and the Department
of Trade and Industry include the British Coke Research Association and the
Coal Tar Research Association. Much of the work of other bodies, such as
the Safety in Mines Research Establishment (SMRE), is closely related to the
Board’s problems; the SMRE carries out research on explosions and fires,
pneumoconiosis, engineering and metallurgy.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,

a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858 and ceased
production in 1962. At present nearly all of Britain’s oil supplies are imported.
Seismic prospecting in the North Sea for natural gas and oil has been going on
since 1962 and full-scale exploration activities since 1964, following the enact¬
ment of the Continental Shelf Act 1964, and the subsequent award of a first
round of licences. Further licences were awarded in 1965, 1969-70 and 1971-
72. The total area now under licence is 43,415 square miles (112,444 square
kilometres) out of a total area, over which Britain has exercised its rights to
explore and exploit the seabed and subsoil, of 166,000 square miles (430,000
square kilometres).
Drilling, which started in 1964, has proved the existence of five major fields
of natural gas in the British sector all of which are now in production (see
p. 279). Oil in significant quantities was first found in the British sector in
1970; development plans were announced for the Forties field in December
1971, to provide for output of 12-5 million tons a year by late 1975. First
deliveries through a 115-mile (185-kilometre) submarine pipeline are expected
in late 1974. Several other major discoveries have been made including that
of the Auk and Brentfields, planned to come into operation by 1974 and
1975-76 respectively.
A production rate by the mid-1970s of 25 million tons a year has been
estimated, with a possible trebling of this amount by 1980.
Annual production of crude oil from land-based oilfields in Britain now totals
about 81,000 tons. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the
establishment of several small oilfields, notably in Nottinghamshire (Egmanton
and Bothamsell), in Leicestershire (Plungar), in Lincolnshire (Gainsborough)
and in Dorset (Kimmeridge).
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East, Africa and Caribbean areas.
Today production by these companies amounts to about 18 per cent of total
world production and they operate a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and
partly on charter) amounting to over one-fifth of the world’s tanker tonnage.
(British registered tanker tonnage is about 14 per cent of the world’s total.)
In 1971 Britain imported 105-9 million tons of crude oil valued at £931-5
million, the largest single item among imported products. Kuwait, Libya and
Saudi Arabia supplied 20-4 per cent, 19-1 per cent and 19-8 per cent respec¬
tively. Other major suppliers were Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption in 1971 totalled about
96 million tons, having more than doubled since i960. Fuel oil consumption
in 1971 constituted 43 per cent of the total. Demand for gas and diesel oils
(including derv fuel used in road vehicles) rose by 600,000 tons to over 17
million tons in 1971. Sales of motor spirit have expanded by an annual average
of 6-2 per cent since i960 and totalled some 14-7 million tons in 1971.
The most important uses of gas and diesel oils in 1971 were for non¬
industrial central heating, agricultural tractors and the railways; over 5 million
tons of derv fuel were consumed. Electricity generation accounted for 35-1
per cent of total fuel oil consumption, excluding that used in oil refineries;
272

the steel industry accounted for 11-7 per cent; and non-industrial central
heating for a further 10-6 per cent. Of the remainder, the largest users were the
cement, paper-making, general chemical, glass, engineering, brickmaking and
textile industries.
Before 1939 three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum
products was refined overseas, as it was considered more economic to refine
at the source of production. Since the second world war the industry has
favoured the siting of refineries in the consuming areas.
At the end of 1971 rated refinery capacity in Britain amounted to 120 million
tons a year; capacity is expected to reach an estimated 133 million tons by the
end of 1973. Of the 23 refineries in operation, five have a capacity of under
0*5 million tons. The eleven largest are situated at Fawley, near Southampton
(19 million tons); Stanlow, in Cheshire (10-5 million tons); Isle of Grain
(11-3 million tons), Shell Haven (10 million tons), and Coryton (67 million
tons), all three on the Thames Estuary; Teesport, Yorkshire (5-3 million tons);
Grangemouth, east Scotland (8-9 million tons); Milford Haven and Pembroke
in Pembrokeshire (6 million tons and 6-8 million tons); Llandarcy near
Swansea (8*2 million tons); and Killingholme near Grimsby (6-9 million tons).
Other important refineries are located at Belfast, Billingham, Heysham (Lancs.)
and second refineries at Killingholme and at Milford Haven. Stanlow is to
be expanded by 7-5 million tons and Shell Haven by 9 million tons. A new
refinery is under construction at Milford Haven; another is to be built at
Canvey Island, Essex. .
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) has
risen steadily; from 4 million tons in 1948 to 25-5 million tons in 1954, 4°
million tons in i960 and the peak total of 97 million tons in 1971. There is a
substantial external trade in refined products which tends to follow trading
and seasonal requirements and the commercial arrangements of the major oil
companies. Exports from Britain, mainly in the form of heavier products
to European countries, were valued at £211 million in 1971. Imports of refined
products (including liquefied gases) amounted to £233 million.
Three main crude oil pipelines are in operation in Britain between harbours
capable of berthing very large tankers and refineries: in west Scotland, from
Finnart to Grangemouth; in South Wales, from Angle Bay, Milford Haven
to Llandarcy; and in north-west England, from Tranmere to Stanlow and
Heysham. Pipelines also carry refined products to major marketing areas; for
example, from the Humber to the Manchester area, from Fawley to Staines and
Heathrow Airport, and from the Isle of Grain to Walton-on-Thames and
Heathrow Airport. A 245-mile (394-kilometre) pipeline, opened in 1969 feeds
refined products to north London and the Midlands from refineries and
installations on the Thames and Mersey; a similar line 265 miles (426 kilo¬
metres) long from Milford Haven to the Midlands and Manchester is under
construction. Pipelines carrying petrochemical feedstocks run from Stanlow to
Carrington, near Manchester, from Fawley to Severnside, near Bristol, and
from Teeside to Fleetwood and Runcorn. The Pipelines Act 1962 is designed
to secure the orderly development of privately owned industrial pipelines.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(the British Petroleum Company), Thornton, in Cheshire, and Woodstock,

in Kent (Shell), and Abingdon, in Berkshire (Esso). The first of these covers
the full range of petroleum research and development, from geology and
production to product utilisation and petroleum chemicals. In general, the
remainder are concerned with the evolution of new and improved fuels and
lubricants and the development of new uses for petroleum products and of
new products based on petroleum, especially chemicals.
A public supply of electricity was first provided in Britain in 1881, at
Godaiming, Surrey. From its earliest days a measure of public control has
been a feature of the industry. In 1919 the Electricity Commissioners were
created as a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation on a national
scale through voluntary agreement. In 1926 the Central Electricity Board
was set up to construct and operate a national grid inter-connecting individual
power stations, thus co-ordinating generation and transmission. In 1943 the
North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB) was established as a public
corporation to develop the water-power resources of the Highlands. In 1948
all municipal and private undertakings (other than those in Northern Ireland)
were acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British
Electricity Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland
where they became the responsibility of the NSHEB. Two subsequent Acts
(1954 and 1957) effected a measure of decentralisation and gave the industry
its present structure. Electricity supply employs about 201,000 people, in¬
cluding 5,900 in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales, electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and distributed by 12 separate area
electricity boards; co-ordination is effected by the Electricity Council. In
Scotland, two boards—the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB)—both generate and distribute electricity. In Northern Ireland,
the Belfast Corporation and the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland
generate and distribute electricity, and the Londonderry Development Com¬
mission distributes only.
The Electricity Council is the central body of the supply industry with a
general responsibility for promoting electricity supply and for advising the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry; it is also responsible for a number of
common services, principally capital financing, research and industrial rela¬
tions. The council consists of a chairman and two deputy chairmen, the chair¬
man and two designated members of the CEGB, the chairmen of the 12 area
electricity boards and not more than three other members. The CEGB
controls the operation and maintenance of power stations and the main trans¬
mission system (the national grid) and supplies electricity in bulk to the 12
area boards. The CEGB consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and
between six and eight members. Each of the 12 area electricity boards acquires
bulk supplies of electricity from the CEGB and is responsible for distribution
networks and sales of electricity to its area consumers.
Area consultative councils were set up under the Electricity Act 1947 in
the area of each board to represent the interests of consumers; their chairmen
are ex officio members of their respective area boards. The Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry appoints the chairmen, deputy chairmen and members
of the Electricity Council, the CEGB, the area boards and the consultative
councils; approves each board’s capital development programmes and the
industry’s research programme; and approves, in consultation with the
Treasury, the industry’s borrowing requirements.

The boundary separating the areas covered by the two Scottish boards runs
roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth of
Tay. Members of both boards and of the respective consumer consultative
councils are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland; each board
comprises a chairman and between four and eight members, one of whom is the
chairman of the other board. The Secretary of State’s responsibilities in rela¬
tion to the boards are similar to those of the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry.
In Northern Ireland electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh. Those in Belfast are operated by the city
corporation and the remainder by the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland.
Generation is co-ordinated by the Northern Ireland Joint Electricity Authority,
set up by statute in 1967. The output of the stations has, since 1948, been
purchased in bulk and re-sold to distributors—the Belfast Corporation for
Belfast and district, the Londonderry Development Commission for the City
of Londonderry, and the Electricity Board for the rest of Northern Ireland.
(A single organisation is to be set up to deal with electricity supply in Northern
Ireland as a whole.)
As Britain has abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail and water
transport for moving it, most of its electricity is produced by coal-fired steam
generating stations. In some areas oil or natural gas would provide cheaper
fuel but the rate of conversion from coal to these fuels is controlled to cushion
its effects both on the balance of payments and on employment of coalminers.
Hydro-electric development on any scale is comparatively recent, water-power
resources being relatively small and in remote areas. Since 19655 nuclear
energy has become increasingly important.
The output capacity of the generating stations of the electricity boards in
Great Britain at the end of 1971 totalled 60,768 megawatts (MW), an increase
of nearly 50 per cent since 1965.
In the years 1965 to 1971 an annual average of 3,400 MW of generating
capacity was installed, including 4,509 MW in 1970, and 8,300 MW in 1971.
About 10,500 MW of capacity is coming into operation in England and Wales
in the period 1971-73. The SSEB’s plans provide for its total capacity of
5,214 MW at the end of 1970 to be increased to some 7,400 MW by 1973. The
NSHEB capacity of 1,830 MW will be increased to 2,140 MW by 1974.
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where, of the total installed
generating capacity of 1,204 MW, 720 MW is in oil-fired and the remainder in
coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to 4,075 million kilowatt-hours in 1971.
Generation for the public supply in Great Britain reached nearly 230,000
million kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 1971; conventional steam power stations
provided 88 per cent of the total and nuclear and hydro-electric stations about
10 per cent and 2 per cent respectively. A high rate of expansion of output has
been a feature of the industry since its earliest years; though the rate has
slackened recently the total of electricity generated in 1971 was still over 30 per
cent higher than in 1965. , . .
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small
—20,280 million kWh in 1971. The major sources outside the fuel industries
themselves are the chemical, iron and steel and paper industries and the
nuclear power plants of the Atomic Energy Authority. . • rp ui q

fuels continues to expand, but at a slower rate than was at one time expected,
because of some temporary slowing down of the growth of demand for elec¬
tricity and because of the increasing thermal efficiency of the generating
stations. This has led to some rephasing of the capital programme.
Oil-fired stations of 2,000 MW have been commissioned at Fawley, on
Southampton Water (one of the most fully automated stations in Europe), and
at Pembroke, South Wales, and another is under construction at Inverkip,
Renfrewshire. A dual-fired station of the same size to burn either coal or oil
has been commissioned at Kingsnorth, Kent, and other stations involving some
4,000 MW of plant have been or are being converted to dual-firing; two can
burn natural gas. An oil-fired station of 3,300 MW is to be built at the Isle of
Grain. Average thermal efficiency (that is, the ratio of the electrical energy out¬
put to the heat energy input of the fuel consumed) of conventional steam
stations in England and Wales rose from 2075 per cent in 1947 to 29-1 per cent
in 1971 as new plant was brought into use. The 20 most efficient stations,
containing much of the newest plant, had an average thermal efficiency of 32-86
per cent in 1970-71.

Striking advances have been made in the design of steam-generating plant.
Forty-seven single-shaft units of 500 MW are being installed in 13 stations. By
the end of 1971 40 sets had been installed, of which 36 had been commissioned
at 12 stations. Station capacities are also increasing. By 1973, ten stations,
each with capacities of 2,000 MW, with four 500 MW single-shaft generating
units, will be in service. Sixteen 660 MW single-shaft generating units are on
order for installation: three for Drax (Yorkshire); five for Isle of Grain (Kent);
and two each for four nuclear power stations under construction (for locations
see map, p. 266). Units of 1,300 MW are under construction. In Scotland, a
1,200 MW station at Cockenzie was commissioned in 1968 and one of 2,400
MW (four generating units of 600 MW) at Longannet in 1970. A 1,980 MW
station at Inverkip (three units of 660 MW) is expected to be commissioned in
1975-
Large gas turbine units of 55 MW and 70 MW, based on aero jet engines,
have been introduced since 1965 for peak load operation. The CEGB and
SSEB have installed 721 MW of such units and a further 1,200 MW are
planned. Many others of 17 to 35 MW capacity are being used in new stations

to safeguard the auxiliary supplies to the large new steam units, and also to
provide capacity for peak operation. Auxiliary units of this kind in service at
the end of 1971 totalled 1,020 MW.
Hydro-electric generation is at present confined to Scotland and Wales. Most of
the water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with their own
natural catchment areas. The setting up of the NSHEB in 1943 marked the
beginning of an era of intensive water-power development in the Highlands.
In 1971-72, 2,346 million units were sent out by the NSHEB from water¬
power, compared with 322 million in 1949. At the end of March 1972 there
were 54 main hydro-electric conventional stations in operation in the north
of Scotland with a total installed capacity of 1,049 MW and the largest—the
Loch Sloy station—has a capacity of 130 MW. The Cruachan pumped
storage section of the Awe scheme, with an installed capacity of 400 MW from
four reversible-pump-turbines, came into full operation at the end of *9°7-
Construction of a 300 MW pumped-storage project at Foyers, Loch Ness,
began in November 1969. It will have two 150 MW reversible-pump-turbines
and is planned for completion in 1974. In addition, there are stations generat¬
ing electricity by water-power in the south of Scotland (123 MW) and in
Wales (469 MW). The latter includes the 360 MW pumped-storage station
at Ffestiniog, which was completed in 1963. (In pumped-storage schemes
electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to pump water to higher levels
from which it descends at peak periods to operate turbo-generators.)
Some 10 per cent of Britain’s public supply generation was in nuclear power
stations in 1971 and the proportion is expected to rise to about one-sixth by
the mid-1970s. Britain accounts for some 25 per cent of world nuclear
generation. Since 1962 Britain has produced over 200,000 million kWh of
electricity from its nuclear stations, much more than any other country, an
about 47 per cent of the world’s generation of electricity from nuclear sources
(excluding the Soviet Union). < . ,
The Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) has three main stations which produce
electricity for the national grid: the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) at
Windscale, Cumberland (14 MW electrical output); the experimental fast
breeder station at Dounreay, Caithness (14 MW); and the Steam Generating
Heavy Water Moderated Reactor (SGHWR) at Winfrith, Dorset (too MW).
The former AEA stations Calder Hall, in Cumberland (198 MW) an
Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire (198 MW) are now owned and operated by
British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. (see p. 277). # . Tt j +L
Others are owned and operated by the electricity authorities. Under the
first commercial programme, originally announced in 1955 but since twice
modified, nine stations with a total design capacity of 4,500 MW were in
operation in 1971: Berkeley, in Gloucestershire (276 MW design capacity),
and Brad well, in Essex (300 MW), were both commissioned in 1962; Hunter-
ston ‘A’, in Scotland (300 MW), in 1964; and in the following year Hinkley
Point ‘A’, in Somerset, Trawsfynydd, in Wales (both 500 MW), and Dungeness
‘A’ in Kent (550 MW); Sizewell, in Suffolk (580 MW), was commissioned in
1066; and Oldbury, in Gloucestershire (600 MW), in 1968. A ninth station,
Wylfa in Anglesey (1,180 MW), was commissioned in 1971. These stations,
like Calder Hall and Chapelcross, are all magnox stations—graphite-moderate ,
carbon-dioxide cooled, using natural uranium metal fuel elements canned in

further 8,ooo MW of nuclear capacity is planned of which about 6,500 MW
will be commissioned by 1976. The reactor design chosen for the programme
is based on the AGR at Windscale, which uses slightly enriched uranium
dioxide fuel canned in stainless steel, a logical development of the magnox
system. The first five AGR stations under construction are Dungeness ‘B’
(1,200 MW), Hinckley Point ‘B’, Hunterston ‘B’, Seaton Carew and Heysham
(each of 1,320 MW capacity). Further stations of about 2,500 MW total
capacity have been planned for at Sizewell. They will produce electricity more
cheaply on base load than the best contemporary coal stations.
A large prototype fast reactor (PFR) of 250 MW capacity is to be commis¬
sioned in 1973 at Dounreay (where in October 1962 the experimental fast reactor
became the first of such type to produce electricity for public use and to operate
at a high power level).
British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. was set up under the Atomic Energy Authority
Act 1970 to take over from the Atomic Energy Authority the manufacture and
reprocessing of nuclear fuels for nuclear reactors in Britain and overseas at
Springfield in Lancashire, Capenhurst in Cheshire and Windscale in Cumber¬
land.
Main electricity transmission lines—the national grid—supply most of the
country. By 31st March 1971 those of the CEGB totalled over 8,700 circuit
miles (14,001 kilometres), of which 6,230 miles (10,026 kilometres) were at
400,000 volts, and 2,500 miles (4,023 kilometres) at 275,000 volts. Primary dis¬
tribution in England and Wales is at 132,000 volts, comprising 11,000 circuit
miles (17,700 kilometres) of lines, with secondary distribution at 33,000 volts,
tertiary at 11,000 volts and general low voltage distribution at 415/240 volts
(standardisation of supply to consumers at 240 volts is almost completed). In
Scotland there were some 4,700 circuit miles (7,600 kilometres) of main trans¬
mission lines at the end of March 1971, of which 1,578 circuit miles (2,539 ^^°"
metres) operated at 275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Primary
distribution in Scotland is at 33,000 volts. Energy movements on the grid in
England and Wales are controlled through the seven operational areas, set up for
that purpose and distinct from the regions in which the generating side of the
industry is organised; each area has a separate control, and the operations are
co-ordinated by a National Control in London. The grid in Scotland is
operated from the control centres at Pitlochry (NSHEB) and at Kirkintilloch
(SSEB).
The development of the grid system has made the British system the largest
fully interconnected power network under unified control in the world.
Twin cross-Channel cables laid between Dungeness and Boulogne, capable of
transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current), have been in
operation since 1961; by this means advantage is taken of the differences
between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads.
A direct current transmission link to reinforce supplies in the London area
is being installed; due for completion in 1972, the scheme—the first of its
kind in the world—will have a capacity of 640 MW.
In England and Wales the Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers
electricity acquired mainly from the CEGB, supplemented from other sources,
such as industrial plants, and the nuclear power stations of the AEA. There
are 18-6 million consumers. Industrial concerns are the biggest users of
electricity. The principal domestic uses of electricity are for lighting, cooking
and for space and water heating, but the demand for numerous other domestic
purposes is rising steadily.

The NSHEB has about 482,000 consumers, many in remote areas. The
SSEB supplies more than 1 -5 million consumers.
Some 5 per cent of the annual gross fixed capital formation of the United King¬
dom in 1971 was attributable to the electricity supply industry. The industry’s
plans for new capital investment are based on a growth in demand estimated at
an annual average rate of about 5 per cent up to 1977-78.
Capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry has been expanding
very rapidly: from £249 million in 1956 it rose to £720 million in 1966 but has
since fallen to £500 million in 1971-72. About one-half of the industry’s
capital requirements has been financed from internal resources. The statutory
limit to borrowings by the industry in Great Britain has been raised from
£5,200 million to £7,700 million. The Gas and Electricity Act 1968 empowered
the industry to borrow (long term) from overseas sources.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry, is responsible for drawing up a general programme of research,
comprising direct research carried out by the electricity boards themselves,
supported by co-operative research with selected industrial research associa¬
tions and by research contracts placed with universities and other organisations.
The council itself is empowered to conduct research. It is advised by the
Electricity Supply Research Council. Collaboration on research between the
supply industry and the plant manufacturers is co-ordinated by the Power
Engineering Research Steering Committee set up in 1966.
The main research establishments of the industry are run by the CEGB and
comprise the Central Electricity Research Laboratories at Leatherhead,
Surrey, the Berkeley Laboratories in Gloucestershire, concerned with nuclear
problems, and the Engineering Laboratories at Marchwood, on Southampton
Water. Research on distribution technology and electricity utilisation is under¬
taken at the Electricity Council Research Centre at Capenhurst, Cheshire, and
by the area boards.
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
either on their own or in co-operation with other electricity authorities. The
SSEB undertakes a wide range of research and development work, both
independently and in conjunction with the universities and manufacturers and,
with the NSHEB, is associated with the activities of the Electricity Council
and CEGB.
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London,
was first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light
and Coke Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London.
In the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting,
provided by a growing number of company and municipal undertakings.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the period
between the two world wars when increasing competition from electricity had
to be met, and by 1939 the industry had become mainly a supplier of heating
rather than lighting.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about
115,000 people are at present employed, under public ownership and control
on 1st May 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged to
local authorities, were vested in 12 area gas boards. The central body is the Gas
Council, appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. It is both

a co-ordinating council and, since the enactment of the Gas Act 1965, a trading
body. Its general duties are to advise the Secretary of State on questions
affecting the industry and promote the efficient performance of their duties by
the area boards. It also has specific duties relating to finance, labour relations
and research.
The area gas boards, which have a large measure of financial and operational
responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies of the
other publicly owned corporations, are responsible for the local manufacture
of gas and its distribution to consumers. The industry’s structure is about to be
adapted to take account of the change from manufactured to natural gas. A
new British Gas Corporation will come into operation on 1st January 1973, to
be formed from the present Gas Council and to take over the assets of the area
boards, which are to be abolished.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a
number of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
The main single source of gas in Britain is now natural gas, supplied either
directly or as feedstock for town gas manufacture, and accounting for well over
90 per cent of the total demand in 1971.
The first productive well in the North Sea was discovered in 1965. Five
major gasfields have now been located: Leman Bank, West Sole, Hewett,
Indefatigable and Viking, all now in production. A number of smaller struc¬
tures have also been found and exploration continues.
The first pipeline to pump natural gas to the shore, at Easington in York¬
shire, was put on flow early in 1967. Since then further pipelines have been laid
to bring gas to the terminals at Bacton, Norfolk, and Theddlethorpe, Lincoln¬
shire. Supplies of gas are obtained from an on-shore field at Lockton, York¬
shire. Natural gas now accounts for about 5 per cent of total energy consumption.
During 1971 the average daily quantity of natural gas received by the Gas
Council amounted to some 1,800 million cubic feet (51 million cubic metres),
with a maximum daily take of 3,000 million cubic feet (85 million cubic
metres) reached towards the end of the year.
In 1971 the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was about
31-5 million therms, most of it for household use.
Since 1964 deliveries of natural gas from the Sahara have been made in liquid
form to Britain. The pipeline system then begun has been expanded to form a
national high-pressure pipeline system for distribution of natural gas derived
mainly from British fields in the North Sea. By March 1972, some 2,000 miles
(3,200 kilometres) of the required 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometres) had been
constructed. The central distribution system is fed from the two shore termi¬
nals by five feeder mains.
Three-fifths of all gas sold by gas boards is for household use and the remainder
for industrial and commercial purposes. Total consumption has been rising
steadily since 1961, after a period when growth was almost negligible and is
now doing so with increasing rapidity. It rose by 17 per cent in 1970-71, and
by 30-4 per cent in 1971-72. Sales reached a level of nearly 7,490 million therms1
fires and cookers accounting for a further 45 per cent.
About 45 per cent of the domestic load is used for central heating, with gas
fires and cookers accounting for a further 45 per cent.

Gas has traditionally been used extensively in industries which require the
control of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the pottery
industry and in certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products.
Natural gas is being used as a chemical feedstock and in bulk fuel markets. In
1971 sales of gas to industry totalled 2,720 million therms; they have risen
sharply since the arrival of natural gas.
Under the Gas Act 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the area gas
boards was limited to £250 million. Since then the limit has been raised as
necessary. For the British Gas Corporation (see p. 279) borrowing has been
fixed at £2,500 million, to be raised by order if necessary to £2,700 million.
The Gas and Electricity Act 1968 empowered the industry to borrow (long
term) from overseas sources.
The industry had been spending about £50 million a year on capital
investment in the period 1955 to 1961 but since 1961-62 expenditure has
increased sharply. Capital needs over the four years to March 1975 are estima¬
ted at over £1,200 million, of which the largest items are £531 million on bulk
transmission and distribution and £371 million on conversion to natural gas.
About half of the total is to be met from internal resources.
Much of the gas industry’s current research and development effort is
concentrated on transforming the industry from one based on manufactured
gas to one based on indigenous natural gas. In 197° the Gas Council estimated
that the switch over to natural gas in Great Britain would be completed in
seven to eight years.
A phased programme of converting the 30 million gas appliances is in
progress. Some 45 per cent of consumers had had their appliances converted
at the end of March 1972. Investigations are being made into projects in¬
volving various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions.
Liquefaction and storage facilities for natural gas have been constructed near
Coatbridge, Scotland, and other facilities are planned.
The Gas Council has a research committee which advises on research policy
at four research centres. The engineering research station at Killingworth,
Northumberland, has concentrated on large-scale distribution problems.
Research is also done on behalf of the Gas Council at a number of universities
and colleges. Work is being carried out on Gas Council processes for manu¬
facture of substitute natural gas, in which there is wide interest overseas,
especially in areas where natural gas is running short. The Gas Council’s total
expenditure on research amounts to some £5 million a year.
Efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, has
been assisted by various bodies representing producers and consumers and
by the technical advisory services of the fuel and power industries.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National
Coal Board, solid fuel distributors and appliance manufacturers and distri¬
butors. Originally formed in 1932, it informs and advises domestic users on the
best use of solid fuel, including the choice of installation and the operation
of solid fuel appliances.
A non-profit-making company, the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency
Service, was formed in 1954 2nd sponsored by the fuel and power industries
to promote fuel saving in industry. In addition to consultancy work, it provides
advice and services to all non-domestic fuel users in a variety of forms, from
‘spot’ inspection to full-scale surveys and regular visits on a contract basis.

WATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, sufficient for
domestic and industrial requirements. The sources of water are often distant
from the areas where supplies are needed, however, and water undertakings
are therefore mainly concerned with abstraction, storage, treatment and
distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and river
intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits and
boreholes. Ministerial responsibility in England and Wales lies with the Secre¬
tary of State for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Wales
respectively; in Scotland with the Secretary of State for Scotland; and in
Northern Ireland with the Minister responsible for Development.
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service, largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick
(a well-known social reformer) and his colleagues who demonstrated the
dangers arising from inadequate water supply and sanitation. The Public
Health Act 1848 laid the basis for a long series of statutes dealing with public
health. From the middle of the nineteenth century onwards a number of water
undertakings were set up to provide water to the expanding urban population,
and the water supply system developed rapidly, although in piecemeal fashion
and with some overlapping and waste.
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water
supplies are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this
either by operating water undertakings themselves or by ensuring that other
bodies are providing adequate supplies. The householder receives his domestic
water supply at a comparatively small charge, varying in different areas, which
he usually pays by way of a water rate levied, like other rates, on the value
of his house. Industrial users are charged in most cases according to actual
metered consumption.
The Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary of State for
Wales have a duty to promote the conservation and proper use of water supplies
in England and Wales respectively and are advised by the Central Advisory
Water Committee on general questions relating to water and organisation of
supplies.
The Water Resources Acts 1963 (which came into full operation in April
1965) and 1968 created a new administrative structure consisting of a number
of river authorities and a central Water Resources Board to meet growing
domestic, industrial and farm irrigation needs. The river authorities, including
the Thames Conservancy and the Lee Conservancy Catchment Board which
though bodies of much longer standing have similar functions, have a majority
of members appointed by the county and county borough councils in their
areas. The remainder are appointed by ministers mainly for their knowledge of
land drainage, fisheries, the public water supply and water used in industry
and in agriculture. The authorities manage the water resources of river basins
and carry out other functions in respect of land drainage, flood control,
administration of fisheries and prevention of pollution. They are responsible
for assessing water resources and requirements, controlling and developing
resources and securing regulation by a system of licensing. Special arrange¬
ments exist for the Greater London area, where the full range of river authority
control is not necessary. The work of the river authorities is co-ordinated by
the Water Resources Board, an expert advisory body which reports to the

Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office. It reviews national
water resources and requirements, encourages the transfer of water between
areas according to need, and initiates research. Since April 1969 water con¬
servation has been financed from charges levied by river authorities on the
licensed abstractors and users of water.
Water supply is at present in the hands of over 1,400 separate bodies, in¬
cluding: 22 river authorities in England, three lying across the Anglo-Welsh
border, and four in Wales; 160 water undertakers providing supplies of piped
water for domestic and other uses; and over 1,200 sewerage authorities, which
are mainly local authorities or in some cases joint boards of local authorities.
There are also nearly 2,000 miles of canals and river navigation administered by
the British Waterways Board (see p. 353).
A major reorganisation of water services in England and Wales was proposed
by the Government in December 1971, following a report of the Central
Advisory Water Committee (see Bibliography p. 479)- The present large
number of bodies involved are to be replaced by ten Regional Water Authori¬
ties, including a Welsh National Water Development Authority, to be brought
into operation in April 1974 at the same time as the new local authorities to be
set up under the prospective reorganisation of local government (see p. 74).
A National Water Council is to replace the Water Resources Board. The
proposals involve the abolition of the British Waterways Board. The new
water authorities’ functions would include, in addition to the major task of
water supply, prevention and control of polluting discharge into rivers and
estuaries; augmentation of river flows through storage schemes; treatment of
water for public use; dealing with sewerage; and ensuring full development
for amenity and recreation of rivers, canals and, where appropriate, reservoirs.
Public water supplies in England and Wales—reaching over 99 per cent of
the total population—now total some 2,960 million gallons (13,471 thousand
cubic metres) a day, out of a total estimated abstraction of nearly 6,000 million
gallons (26,115 thousand cubic metres) a day (excluding water used for cooling
in connection with electricity generation). Capital expenditure on water
supply, sewerage and sewage disposal is estimated at £280 million in 1971-72;
an annual increase of 7 per cent in real terms is envisaged.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by
grants under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1971. By
March 1972 schemes costing over £120 million had been completed or were
in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.
The administrative arrangements for water supply and distribution in Scotland
were reorganised by the Water (Scotland) Act 1967 under which the functions
of 200 local water authorities were transferred to 13 regional water boards in
May 1968. The Act also established the Central Scotland Water Development
Board which supplies water in bulk to its seven constituent regional water
boards; it does not supply direct to individual consumers. All the members of
these boards are members of town or county councils.
The water problem in Scotland is broadly similar to that in England and
Wales except that there is not the same need to allocate water between
competing interests and less reliance needs to be placed on underground
sources. The Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for general over¬
sight and co-ordination and has a general duty to promote the conservation of
water resources in Scotland; and to require regional water boards to provide

supplies of wholesome water everywhere in their districts, where this can be
done at reasonable cost; at present, they supply over 99 per cent of the total
population. The Scottish Water Advisory Committee advises the Secretary of
State on general questions relating to resources and supplies and the organisa¬
tion of the water service. The Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Act i944>
as amended, makes available to Scottish regional water boards and to local
authorities grant assistance up to a maximum of £60 million towards the cost
of water supplies and sewerage schemes in rural areas.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of water for both domestic and
industrial consumption. Distribution is the responsibility of local authorities,
some of which have combined to form joint boards. About 90 per cent of the
population has a piped supply and some 100 million gallons are supplied daily.
Under the Water Supplies and Sewerage Act (Northern Ireland) 1945 the
Ministry of Development may pay grants towards the cost of water schemes.
Since 1945 over £80 million has been invested, of which over ^40 million
was government grants. It is proposed that the Ministry of Development,
already responsible for water conservation and pollution control, will take over
from local authorities, in April 1973, responsibility for water supply and sewer¬
age services.
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation s surface
water resources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain,
published annually by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. This publication
contains particulars of the run-off and related rainfall from a large number
of rivers, streams and reservoired areas. The Water Resources Board is
responsible for the collation and publication of hydrological information: the
fieldwork of surface water measurement is done by river authorities, water under¬
takings and other bodies. Detailed studies of the resources and use of water in
specified areas have been published in the series of hydrological surveys which
cover approximately half of England and Wales. General information on rain¬
fall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the responsibility of the Meteoro¬
logical Office, while advice on ground water is the responsibility of the Water
Resources Board. The Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of
the Environment at Wallingford and the Water Research Association’s station
at Medmenham carry out research into problems of the design and calibration
of gauging weirs and flumes for the measurement of surface water, and into
other hydraulic problems.
Barrage projects involve dams across or within tidal estuaries to form a lake
of fresh water, and studies have been carried out for several estuaries in
Britain. A report on a study for Morecambe Bay, Lancashire, published early
in 1972, put forward several suggested schemes, including a barrage and storage
reservoirs. A full feasibility study of the use of pumped storage artificial reser¬
voirs in the Wash has been authorised.
Each river authority is responsible for the control of pollution of rivers and
certain tidal waters in its area and its approval must be sought before polluting
effluents are discharged. Control of pollution in the tidal Thames is exercised
by the Port of London Authority. In Scotland there are nine river purification
boards. The Secretary of State for Scotland is advised by the Scottish River
Purification Advisory Committee on questions affecting the cleanliness of
Scottish rivers. In several ports the petroleum companies co-operate in the
prevention of oil pollution from tankers and refineries.

The Government’s aim is to improve the quality of water in all the main rivers
by the early 1980s. According to the River Pollution Survey (see Bibliography
p. 479) much progress has already been made in diminishing river pollution
in recent years.
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory at Stevenage investigates
problems connected with the treatment of polluted water, the treatment and
disposal of sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and prevention
of pollution of surface water and underground water.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry includes firms engaged on the construction, altera¬
tion, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage and
sewerage systems, waterworks, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works,
electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, open-cast coal prospect¬
ing and mining, and structural work connected with thermal and hydro¬
electric power stations and telecommunications. About 1 -5 million people are
engaged on construction in both the public and private sectors. They repre¬
sent nearly 6-2 per cent of the total civilian labour force and their net output
provides about 11 per cent of the gross national product.
The construction industry is changing to metric from Imperial weights and
measures. Nearly all design work in the public sector is now fully metricated.
Constructional work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. Over five-sixths of the work is
done by private firms. Although there are over 72,500 firms in the industry,
about a quarter of them are one-man businesses. At the other end of the scale
are nearly 200 firms each with more than 600 employees.
Public authorities as a whole employ about 296,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these are engaged on repair and maintenance work which
local authorities, for example, carry out with their own labour.
Over 40 per cent of operatives are occupied on building maintenance, valued
at over ^1,430 million annually. The total labour force includes about 661,000
skilled craftsmen, who have been trained for four or five years under the
industry’s apprenticeship schemes. A further 87,000 are employed as appren¬
tices.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake respon¬
sibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the
smallest projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either
by architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects,
by consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a
client, embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans
and the supervision of the constructional work by the contractor.
The Department of the Environment (see p. 15) is responsible for the
construction programmes undertaken directly by the Government (except for
health and education projects), including work for the armed services, both at
home and overseas. The Department is also responsible for co-ordinating
research and development throughout the government service and seeks to
influence methods and techniques in the building industry as a whole. A
Property Services Agency was set up within the Department in September
1972 to deal with the Government’s property and building functions.

The output of the industry has been rising steadily over many years. The
value of work done in 1971 amounted to £5,435 million, of which £846
million represented work carried out by the labour employed directly by
public authorities. Private contractors carried out the remaining £4,588
million (£3,668 million on new work and £920 million on repair work).
About 358,200 houses were started in 1971 and some 364,400 were completed,
of which 196,000 were for private owners. Of the £1,245 million of new
housing carried out by private contractors, £667 million, or over half, was
for private owners and the remainder for public authorities. Industrialised
building methods employing prefabricated components are used in much of
the work.
The National Building Agency is an independent advisory body, managed
by a board of directors appointed by the Department of the Environment and
the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, and at present financed by a
government grant and the fees which it earns. Fee income has increased
rapidly, and the grant is to end by April 1974. Its main function is to encourage
the adoption of advanced methods of house building, and to provide technical
advice and services to government departments, local authorities and other
clients.
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale
modern industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment
to carry out major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent
figures in the early development of civil engineering included John McAdam,
pioneer in road construction; Thomas Telford, builder of roads, bridges,
canals, docks and railways; George and Robert Stephenson and Isambard
Kingdom Brunei, pioneers of railway building.
Among important construction projects in hand in the United Kingdom in
1972 were several major conventional power stations and nuclear power
stations (see p. 275), dams and reservoirs, hospitals, large-scale housing
developments, such as the Thamesmead (London) project to house 60,000
people, a £10 million office and shop development in Victoria Street, London,
and a £15 million scheme to extend the London underground railway system
to London Airport (Heathrow). Projects for road construction, bridges and
tunnels included about 159 miles (256 kilometres) of motorways under con¬
struction in England alone (see p. 347), and the £28 million second Mersey
Tunnel scheme of which the first of two tunnels was opened in 1971.
British constructional firms have been as active overseas as in the United
Kingdom. British consulting engineers, in particular, have built up a tradition
of knowledge and integrity which has caused their standards to become
international practice and their services to be in world-wide demand.
A British firm acts as consultant to the World Bank on the Indus Basin
irrigation scheme, the largest in the world, and several firms were involved in
the design of the Mangla Dam, Pakistan, which forms part of it. Other design
projects included: a deep-water port at Limassol, Cyprus; irrigation schemes in
Indonesia and Iraq; and road works in Iran and Fiji.
Among important construction projects being undertaken by British con¬
tractors in overseas countries during 1972 were: an underground power station
in Zambia adjacent to the Kariba dam; road schemes in many areas; an £11
million irrigation scheme in Romania; and several airport projects in the

Middle East. A British company is helping to build the ^14 million Bosphorus
bridge.
The value of new overseas contracts obtained by British construction firms,
in a large number of different countries, has been running at about £300
million over each of the last three years. A substantial and growing amount of
overseas business is also being done by British architects and surveyors, as
well as by other types of consultant. British members of the Association of
Consulting Engineers had projects worth about ^2,778 million in hand on 1st
January 1972.
The Directorate-General of Research and Development in the Department of
the Environment (Construction Industries) is responsible for co-ordinating
research and information services to increase efficiency in the building
industry. The Building Research Establishment (see p. 181) which forms part
of the Department was originally set up in 1921 (as the Building Research
Station), thus making Britain the pioneer of organised building research, and
is concerned with all aspects of building. It provides a technical advisory service
for construction firms. An Agrement Board, set up by the Government, tests
and certifies new products and methods.
The Construction Industry Research Association carries on research affect¬
ing all sections of the industry.
The Heating and Ventilating Research Association, an industrial research
organisation, deals with problems of heating and ventilation of large buildings.
The major construction firms have research departments working on plant,
materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with research include the
universities and colleges of technology. Most of the producers of primary
building materials have trade associations which maintain research institutions
chiefly devoted to seeking new and more efficient use for their materials.
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
Britain’s manufacturing industries supply a wide range of products, many of
which are of major importance in world trade. Output has increased by over
one-quarter since 1963, although in 1971 it was marginally lower than the pre¬
vious year; output per head advanced by 3-3 per cent in 1971 bringing the
rise since 1963 to 31 per cent. In 1971 this sector spent £1,503 million on
fixed capital equipment (at 1963 prices), 73 per cent of which was spent on
plant and machinery. The number of employees in manufacturing industry
(including the unemployed and those absent from work through sickness and
other causes, but excluding employers and the self-employed) was 8-6 million
in June 1971, 32 per cent of the total number of employees.
The employment and production figures listed in Table 29 give an indica¬
tion of the relative importance of broad sectors of manufacturing industry.
Expansion has been particularly marked in those industries utilising advanced
technologies such as electronics, the newer branches of mechanical engineer¬
ing, instrument engineering, most sectors of the chemical industry and man¬
made fibres.
In the subsequent sections, employment statistics refer to numbers at June
1971, export figures are taken mainly from the Overseas Frade Statistics of the
United Kingdom, and the company populations of various industries are taken
from the Census of Production 1963.
The metal manufacturing industries employ 558,100 persons. Of these, 315,300
are in the iron and steel industry, 105,200 in the manufacture of iron castings,

Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and British inventors were responsible for the
discovery of the processes which led to the great expansion of steelmaking in
the second half of the nineteenth century. Today Britain is the world’s fifth
largest steel producing nation.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public super¬
vision since 1932. The Iron and Steel Act 1967 brought into public ownership
13 major steel companies together producing well over 90 per cent of Britain’s
crude steel and employing some 70 per cent of the manpower in the industry.
Their shares and securities were vested in July 1967 in the British Steel
Corporation (BSC), whose specific duties include promoting the efficient and
economic supply of iron and steel products, exports and research and develop¬
ment; it is also statutorily responsible for the finances of the nationalised
industry. Since March 1970, the BSC has been organised on the basis of six
product divisions, four covering iron and steelmaking and two covering

constructional engineering and chemicals. The private sector includes some
200 companies accounting for about one-third of the value of the industry’s
sales. Plans for rationalising the boundary between the public and private
sectors were announced by the Government in June 1971.
Output of crude steel in 1971 totalled 23-8 million ingot tons, 13 per cent less
than in 1970 (adjusted for comparison to a 52-week basis); the fall reflected lower
industrial investment and the running down of stocks by the industry’s do¬
mestic customers and stockholders. Pig iron production in 1971 totalled 15-2
million tons. Net deliveries of finished steel amounted to 20-3 million tons in
1971. The 5 million tons of iron and steel products which were exported were
worth £402-5 million; the United States (£79-2 million), India (£31-5
million) and Spain (£21-9 million) were the main overseas buyers.
The main producing districts are: Wales (33 per cent of total crude steel
output); Yorkshire and Humberside (24 per cent); Northern (16 per cent);
and Scotland (12 per cent). Wales concentrates mainly on the manufacture
of flat products, especially sheet steel and tinplate; the output of the north-east
coast and Scotland is predominantly of heavy steel products (plates, sections
and rails), but a wide strip mill for sheet production is also in operation in
Scotland. Production of special alloy and stainless steels is centred on Sheffield,
while Scunthorpe concentrates on heavy and medium products.
Since i960 fixed capital expenditure has totalled some £1,500 million,
reaching £230 million in 1961, due mainly to the strip mill expansion pro¬
gramme. Expenditure in 1971 amounted to £237 million, the largest single
project being the major new steelmaking and finishing complex at Scunthorpe,
which will cost some £230 million by 1973. Between i960 and 1971, steel
production by the converter processes increased from 8 per cent of output to
almost 40 per cent; by electric furnaces from 7 per cent to 18 per cent; while
the share from older open hearth processes fell from 84 per cent to 42 per cent.
The emphasis in recent years has been on improving efficiency rather than
raising total capacity and Britain has some of the most modern plant in Europe.
Outstanding development projects completed in the last few years include
a new large-scale basic-oxygen steelmaking plant at Port Talbot with two
converters linked with a deep-water harbour, and a basic-oxygen plant at
Lackenby on Teesside.
Output per blast furnace has risen markedly in recent years, reflecting
increased average size and improvements in efficiency, such as better prepara¬
tion of raw materials, the injection of fuel and oxygen, and the use of higher
blast temperatures. Industry-wide research and development is carried out by
the Corporate Laboratories of the BSC. Total annual expenditure by the
industry is about £12-5 million.
Some 850 foundries are engaged in the production of iron castings. Output
of castings in 1971—3-29 million tons—was 11 per cent less than in 1970-
The main users of iron castings are the motor vehicle industry, accounting for
nearly one-third of the total tonnage sold and about one-half of the industry’s
turnover, the general engineering industry, the manufacturers of pressure
pipes and fittings, the building and associated industries and the steel industry.
Exports are included in the total for iron and steel in the previous section.
The non-ferrous metals industry is the largest in Europe and as a consumer
of aluminium, copper and lead Britain is second only to the United States
among Western countries. Output in 1971 included: aluminium, 118,000 metric
tons of virgin metal and 181,200 metric tons of unwrought alloys; refined cop-

per, 49,200 tons of virgin copper and 138,000 tons of secondary metal; lead,
142,600 tons of secondary metal refined from scrap and 150,400 tons of virgin
lead refined from imported lead bullion; zinc, 116,400 tons of slab metal; and
tin, 21,500 tons. Mining in Britain is confined to the small-scale working of
tin; three mines are operating in Cornwall, and the possibility of reopening
several more is being evaluated. Selective grants to encourage exploration for
a range of minerals in Britain have been introduced by the Government.
In 1971 exports of non-ferrous base metals were valued at £298 million.
The main products exported, including alloys and semi-finished products,
were copper (£93-5 million), nickel (^57-i million), aluminium (£27-1
million) and lead (^18-9 million). The Federal Republic of Germany (£39'8
million), the United States (£32-2 million), and Switzerland (£22-4 million)
were the largest purchasing countries. Indirect exports are also substantial.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres in¬
clude south Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth, where one of the
world’s largest zinc smelters (capacity 120,000 tons a year) was opened in
1968. Firms are engaged in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling,
extrusion and drawing and the techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure
diecasting are also employed.
Two of the three major aluminium smelters whose construction was
approved by the Government in 1968 are now operational. When the three
smelters are in full production by 1974 they will provide over half of Britain’s
requirements for aluminium.
Britain is also a major producer of the newer specialised metals including
uranium, zirconium and beryllium for the nuclear energy industry; niobium
for aircraft production; and selenium, silicon, germanium and tantalum for
electronic apparatus. Scientific and technological research for the industry as a
whole is conducted by the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association.
Mechanical engineering, employing some 1 -2 million people, comprises a
family of industries including all types of machinery, machine tools, industrial
engines, mechanical handling equipment, construction equipment, industrial
plant, and ordnance and small arms. Vehicle engines are included in the section
on vehicles (p. 295). The volume of production from these industries rose by
35 per cent between 1963 and 1971. The aggregate value of the main products
of all sections other than small arms was about £3,450 million in 1971.
Exports of non-electric machinery were valued at £1,945 million in 1971,
18-5 per cent up on the previous year.
There are some 400 firms, employing 30,000 people, in the agricultural
machinery industry, including six large firms employing well over 1,500
workers. In 1971 deliveries were valued at £66-5 million and exports were
worth £38-8 million; the main overseas markets were the Republic of Ireland,
France, the Netherlands, the United States and Denmark.
The number of self-propelled combine harvesters, forage harvesters, pick¬
up balers and grain driers in use has increased in Britain in recent years.
Deliveries in 1971 included 3,905 combine harvesters, 3,912 milking machines,
9,600 pick-up balers and 786 grain and grass driers.
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry. The industry’s
output today ranges from watchmakers’ lathes weighing a few pounds to
machines weighing hundreds of tons, and to electronically controlled machine
tools giving accuracies of one-ten-thousandth part of an inch. Almost 4,000
290 BRITAIN I973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
numerically controlled machine tools have been installed in Britain. The
Government, through the Department of Trade and Industry, is assisting the
industry in various ways, including a pre-production order scheme, numerical
control advisory services and the placing of research and development
contracts.
The pattern of machine tool production is highly cyclical; deliveries in 1971
were valued at £190 million, including numerically controlled tools worth
^18-8 million. Exports of complete machines in 1971 had a value of £97‘3
million, 10-8 per cent up on 1970, and of the orders on hand at the end of 1971
(£96 million), 56 per cent were for export; Australia (£9-4 million), the
Federal Republic of Germany (£8-5 million), France (£7-8 million) and Italy
(£6-3 million) were the main overseas markets in 1971. Seven of the industry’s
200 or so companies provide over half of total deliveries, although because of
the high degree of specialisation small firms are numerically predominant.
Centred mainly in London, the Midlands, Yorkshire and Lancashire, the
industry employs about 90,000 people.
The Machine Tool Trades Association is the representative body of most
manufacturers and importers, and is responsible for the International Machine
Tool Exhibition held in Britain every four years, the next being due in 1976.
The industry is served by its own research body, the Machine Tool Industry
Research Association.
Pumps, Valves
and
Compressors
Industrial pumps and valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are
vital components in many industrial processes particularly in the chemicals,
oil and electric power industries. The total work force is some 80,000 and
there are 450 companies of which ten employ more than 1,000 people. In 1971
deliveries of pumps and valves were valued at £213-6 million and those of air
and gas compressors and fluid power equipment at £60 million and £55
million respectively. Exports of all types of equipment were worth £133-6
million.
Industrial
Engines
Textile
Machinery and
Accessories
Britain manufactures a wide range of industrial engines. Deliveries of internal
combustion engines (including parts) had a value of £146 million in 1971
and exports (including parts and marine engines) were worth £85-j million.
The total brake horse-power of the 263,000 internal combustion engines
delivered was 12-5 million, ranging in size from under 3 b.h.p. to over 4,000
b.h.p. Production is concentrated among the large firms in the industry, and a
total of 30,000 people are employed.
The textile machinery industry, one of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical
engineering trades, produces machines and accessories for the manufacture
and processing of yarns and fabrics from all types of natural and man-made
fibres. In 1971, the industry’s exports (,£129-7 million) accounted for roughly
two-thirds of total deliveries. Principal markets were the United States (£16-3
million), the Federal Republic of Germany (£8-3 million), South Africa and
France (£5-6 million each). Comprising about 500 firms—four of which
account for more than one-quarter of total output—the industry has some
47,000 employees and is situated mainly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern
Ireland, Dundee, Leicester and Nottingham.
Construction and Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is
Earth-moving produced, including crawler tractors, motor graders, scrapers, trenchers, dozer
Equipment equipment, dumpers, excavators and loading shovels, and crushing, pulveris¬
ing and screening plant. The labour force numbers 44,600.

The value of deliveries from the industry was £250 million in 1971 of which
£161 million was for export; earth-moving machinery accounted for 80 per
cent of total deliveries. France, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany
and South Africa are important markets.
Almost every industry makes use of mechanical handling equipment, which
extends from individual units and accessories to complete operating systems.
The value of deliveries in 1971 was some £250 million, the main products
being cranes and bridge transporters, lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators,
hoists and powered industrial trucks. Exports of mechanical handling equip¬
ment (including industrial and works trucks) in 1971 were valued at j£ioi-i
million, 31 per cent more than in 1970. There are some 500 firms in the industry,
four-fifths of which have fewer than 100 employees; the labour force totals
68,500.
The office machinery industry comprises some 70 firms, 11 of which account
for about three-quarters of total output. Deliveries have been expanding
rapidly and in 1971 were valued at ^108-8 million (excluding computers and
copiers). Deliveries in 1971 included 393,000 standard and portable typewriters.
Deliveries of accounting and similar machinery were valued at ^S1’1 m^on
and other office machinery at £26-3 million. Exports of all office machinery
(including electronic computers and data processing equipment) were valued
at £179-6 million. The most important overseas purchasers were France
(£24-4 million), the Federal Republic of Germany (£24 million) and the United
States (£16-1 million). British subsidiaries or associates of overseas firms are
prominent in some sectors of the industry. There are 56,800 persons employed.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial plant and
steelwork and in 1971 the aggregate value of equipment deliveries was £780
million, of which £216 million was for overseas markets. Of particular impor¬
tance are chemical and oil refining (process) plant, steam-raising boilers,
sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, lime and cement kilns,
nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant, and fabricated steelwork
for bridges, buildings, and industrial installations, The industry, comprising
both equipment manufacturers and plant contractors, has many large-scale
enterprises, including nine with over 2,000 workers, and in all employs 196,400
people.
British companies delivered shell boilers and other boilerhouse plant to the
value of £46-7 million in 1971. Water tube boilers of advanced design and of
large steam-raising capacity are produced for power stations, whereas shell
boilers are used for steam-raising and heating in factories and buildings.
Exports of steam generating boilers in 1971 amounted to £12-9 million, and of
boilerhouse plant to £10-2 million.
The steelworks plant industry, in association with firms producing rolling
mills, provides almost all Britain’s requirements as well as plant for export.
The value of deliveries in 1971 was £30-6 million. This industry consists of a
small number of firms, which often collaborate or form temporary consortia
to carry out particular projects. Finland, South Africa, Canada and Brazil
are a few of the countries in which British firms have undertaken major plant
projects.

The design, engineering, construction and commissioning of complete process
plants for the chemical, petrochemical, oil refining and gas industries has
expanded rapidly in recent years. There are now 30 process plant contracting
groups in Britain, half of which are United States subsidiaries. In 1971
expenditure on plant in Britain by the process industries amounted to ^178
million and export contracts were worth an additional £100 million.
Two major consortia, consisting of leading firms in the heavy electrical
engineering, civil engineering, boiler, instrument, and associated industries,
were formed in 1968 to build nuclear power stations for the United Kingdom
electricity authorities (see p. 276). These replaced the three groups formed
in 1959. The Atomic Energy Authority grants them non-exclusive manu¬
facturing licences and is working in close collaboration with them in research
and development.
A wide range of specialised equipment for industrial plant is produced.
Deliveries in 1971, valued at some 3^119-4 million, included distillation
columns, heat exchangers, lime and cement kilns, refuse disposal equipment
and water treatment plant. Exports amounted to £29-i million in 1971.
In addition to the mechanical engineering firms described in the preceding
section there are about 2,200 enterprises whose principal product is a type
of machinery not so far mentioned. The main products include: mining
machinery (deliveries worth £95-3 million in 1971); printing, bookbinding
and paper goods machinery (£59-2 million); non-domestic refrigerating
machinery (^41-7 million); space-heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
equipment (£95-8 million); food and drink machinery (^54-7 million); and
miscellaneous machinery (some ^400 million). There are some 274,000
workers employed in these industries.
Behind the firms manufacturing the major products outlined in this section
are about 5,000 enterprises, employing 241,000 people, whose main functions
are to supply parts and components, to conduct research and development
work, and to undertake general sub-contracting, fabricating and repair work.
(Some enterprises are included because the mixed character of their work pre¬
cludes their classification under any single industry.) The sector includes
ten large undertakings with more than 2,000 employees. Ball and roller bear¬
ings, and chains, are important products; exports of the former were valued
at j£27-i million in 1971 and exporters of chains at ^9-3 million.
With a product range extending from scientific instruments to photographic
equipment and timepieces, instrument engineering is the fastest growing
sector of the engineering industry. Aggregate output was valued in 1971 at
some £385 million and has increased, in volume terms, by 60 per cent since
1963. In all, some 157,000 people are employed in this sector.
The scientific and industrial instruments industry has a labour force number-
ing 97,500. Deliveries of scientific instruments in 1971—some £247 million
—comprised: optical instruments, ^14 million; electronic instruments £132
million; and non-electronic instruments (3^101 million).
Exports of scientific instruments have risen from ^27-9 million in i960 to
3^78-8 million in 1971. The Sira Institute conducts research on behalf of the
industry.

INDUSTRY ^
Deliveries of photographic, cinematographic and document copying equip¬
ment in 1971 totalled ^7i'2 million, including ^5°'7 million for export.
The present industry has largely developed since the 1940s. It employs 13,900
people, the majority skilled craftsmen, and many of its factories are located on
new industrial estates in the older industrial areas, particularly in Scotland.
Output in 1971 included watches (^6-6 million), clocks million) and
time recorders and parking meters (^i'4 million); export sales, including paits,
were valued at £ i4'4 million.
The electrical engineering industry, with a labour force of 880,500, is engaged
in the manufacture and installation of a wide variety of electrical equipment,
including all types of generating, transmission and distribution equipment;
motors; telecommunications and broadcasting apparatus; specialised labora¬
tory and electronic equipment; and domestic appliances. The volume of output
rose by 55 per cent between 1963 and I971’ an^ total value of production
in 1971 was estimated at over £2,goo million.
Exports of electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances in 1971 were
valued at £648 million, 12 per cent more than in 1970. Products are exported
to all parts of the world; in 1971 South Africa (£48 million), the United States
(£39 million), the Federal Republic of Germany (^37-1 million), Australia
(^33-8 million) and the Netherlands (^28-1 million) were the main markets.
The industry’s leading representative organisation is the British Electrical
and Allied Manufacturers’ Association; industry-wide scientific and techno¬
logical research is carried out by the Electrical Research Association.
British scientists and engineers have been responsible for many of the basic
advances in the generation and transmission of electric power. The experi¬
ments of Michael Faraday pointed the way to the production of electricity
as a source of cheap and abundant power. Sir Charles Parsons produced and
patented the first turbo-dynamo, the forerunner of the giant turbo-generating
sets of today.
In 1971 deliveries of electrical machinery were valued at ^477 rnillion,
comprising £98 million worth of generating equipment, £55 million worth
of transformers, 3^191 million worth of switchgear and control gear and
£132 million worth of other electrical machinery, including electric motors.
Exporters of electric power machinery (generators, motors, converters, trans¬
formers and rectifiers) amounted to ^92‘4 milh°n in I97I> ma^n purchasers
being Canada (£8-9 million), South Africa (£8-3 million) and Australia (£7-9
million). Switchgear, starting and control gear exports were valued at £69-4
million.
Almost 600 firms manufacture electrical machinery, but recent mergers
have led to the creation of one of the leading electrical engineering groups in
Europe, while a number of smaller firms have been reorganised into larger
units. The total labour force numbers 169,500. Manufacture takes place in
many areas, including Birmingham, Manchester, Rugby, Tyneside, Stafford
and Larne (Northern Ireland).
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
for telegraph and telephone networks and for many other purposes; its products
include submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of materials.
It is supplying the high voltage cable to carry the expanding output of electric

power in Britain (see p. 274). The value of deliveries in 1971 was £338 million.
Exports of electric cables, wires, and similar products, were worth £51'7
million; the main purchasers were Hong Kong and South Africa. Most of the
industry’s labour force of 50,000 are employed in five major groups.
Electrical Goods
and Domestic
Electrical
Appliances
Deliveries of other electrical goods in 1971 included domestic electrical
appliances, ^250 million; electrical equipment for motor vehicles and air¬
craft, ^126 million; batteries and accumulators, £90 million; electric lamps,
^55 million; and miscellaneous electrical goods, £153 million. In terms of
volume, deliveries included: 1-4 million electric blankets, 2-2 million vacuum
cleaners, 1 - i million domestic washing machines and 2-2 million electric irons.
In 1971 exports of domestic electrical equipment were valued at £50-3 million,
including washing machines and parts (^13'7 million), space heating equip¬
ment (^12-7 million) and vacuum cleaners (£7-5 million); the main markets
were the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany. Exports of
batteries and accumulators in 1971 were valued at £20-3 million. The industry
has a labour force of 209,000.
Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding of
British industries. United Kingdom scientists and inventors have made many
basic contributions to electronics—the thermionic valve, which made amplifica¬
tion possible, the development of radar, the first public transmission television
service, and the ‘printed circuit’, which has led to far-reaching changes in the
radio industry. Total deliveries in 1971, valued at £1,380 million, were 12-6 per
cent up on 1970; export deliveries totalled £330 million. The industry employs
447,000 people.
Capital Equipment Deliveries of electronic capital equipment in 1971 were valued at £629 million
(40 per cent of total output), including £234 million for export. (Indirect exports
incorporated in ships, aircraft and machinery are considerable.) Computers
are the most important item of capital equipment; Britain has the largest
indigenous computer industry outside the United States and has supplied over
one-half of domestic computer installations. A single British group is respon¬
sible for most domestic output. Total deliveries, which have more than doubled
in the last three years, were valued at £193 million in 1971 and exports at £90
million.
Deliveries of radar and navigational aids were valued at £112 million in
1971, over six times the i960 level, and almost half of total output was
exported. Three-quarters of the world’s radar-fitted merchant ships use
British equipment, as do most of the world’s civil airports outside the American
continent. All-weather landing systems, inertial (automatic) navigation systems
and marine radar based on solid-state electronics are among recent develop¬
ments. Other important items of capital equipment include electronic control
equipment (£89 million), radio communications equipment (£68 million) and
electronic measuring and testing equipment (£49 million).
Components Deliveries of components (£264 million in 1971) comprised active components
at £122 million and passive components at £142 million. The industry’s
increasing emphasis on miniaturisation has led to the replacement of conven¬
tional valves by transistors, and, more recently, to the evolution of solid-state
and microcircuit technology.
Consumer Goods The consumer goods sector of the industry manufactures radio and television
sets, radiograms and tape recorders. The industry is dominated by several

large firms. Output of television sets in 1971 rose to 2-4 million (including
852,000 colour television sets); the total sales value of .£180 million was almost
all in the home market. Production of radios and radiograms numbered 1 -6
million in 1971 and total sales were worth £20 million. Deliveries of tape
recorders amounted to over 250,000 worth nearly £5 million.
Only a part of the telecommunications industry is concerned with electronic
equipment, but it is normally considered as a sector of the electronics industry.
Britain is a major exporter of telegraph and telephone equipment with overseas
sales valued in 1971 at £56 million. Research and development work is done
by firms in the industry in co-operation with the Post Office. The industry
employs 92,700 people, and three firms are responsible for almost all the out¬
put.
The industries which manufacture vehicles and aircraft are an important
source of overseas earnings; exports of transport equipment in 1971, valued
at £1,273 million, formed almost 14 per cent of total exports. The labour force
numbers 993,000 and includes: 498,000 in motor vehicle manufacture,
213,000 in aerospace construction and repairing, 190,000 in shipbuilding and
marine engineering, 50,000 in the manufacture of locomotives and railway
wagons and carriages, 20,000 in wheeled tractor manufacturing and 22,000 in
the making of cycles and motor cycles.
In both size and value the largest section of the vehicle industry comprises the
manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles.
At one time located mainly in the Midlands and the London area, the in¬
dustry, during the last decade, has built manufacturing and assembly plants on
Merseyside, in Wales and in Scotland.
Car and commercial vehicle output is dominated by the four largest firms—
British Leyland Motor Corporation, Ford, Chrysler United Kingdom and
Vauxhall—which account for over 99 per cent of complete vehicle production;
the balance is in the hands of smaller, specialist producers of heavy commercial
vehicles, omnibuses, coaches, limousines and sports cars. The principal trade
association is the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT),
which holds a motor show annually in London and a Commercial Motor
Exhibition every two years. The Motor Industry Research Association carries
out collective research on vehicles and components.
Output of passenger cars in 1971 totalled 1-74 million units, compared with
1-64 million units in 1970. Exports in 1971 amounted to 725,000 cars valued
at £373 million. The United States (£87 million) was again the largest single
purchaser, followed by Belgium (£25-3 million), New Zealand and Canada.
About one-fifth (by value) of all exports went to EFT A member countries
and one-seventh to the EEC.
Production of commercial vehicles, including chassis (146,000 in 1946), totalled
456,000 in 1971, marginally less than in 1970. Exports in 1971 of new com¬
mercial vehicles (including chassis) numbered 206,000 worth £241 million.
South Africa (£33 million), Australia (£16 million), Nigeria and New Zealand
were the main markets. Since 1961 Britain has been one of the world’s largest
exporters of commercial vehicles. The prototype of a gas-turbine-powered
commercial vehicle is being evaluated.
Exports of parts and accessories for cars and commercial vehicles, including
bodies, chassis and engines, had a value of some £365 million in 1971;
caravan and trailer exports totalled £26 million.

The bulk of British tractor output and exports consists of agricultural tractors.
Some 150,000 agricultural and industrial wheeled tractors were delivered in
1971, 117,000 (77 per cent) for export. In addition, some 12,000 small market
garden tractors were delivered. Exports of new agricultural and track-laying
tractors were valued at £136-8 million in 19715 South Africa (£i3‘3 miUior0>
Finland (£7-5 million) and the United States (£7-1 million) were the main
buyers. Production is dominated by two large organisations. Britain has one of
the heaviest tractor densities in the world (see p. 320).
Sales of bicycles amounted in 19711° 1 ‘8 million. Most of British manufactui-
ing capacity is in the hands of a single group of companies concentrated in the
Nottingham area. About 1 million cycles worth £14-1 million were sent over¬
seas in 1971; the United States (£6-4 million) was the largest single market.
Sales of motor cycles in 1971 amounted to 82,500. Manufacture is dominated by
one large group. Exports of motor cycles and parts totalled £ 19 ‘2 million in 1971 >
with the United States (£11-4 million) much the biggest market.
The British Railways Board has its own workshops which supply British
Railways and certain other users in Britain; private firms build locomotives,
carriages and wagons for British Railways, for industrial users and for export.
The total value of exports of railway vehicles and parts in 1971 was £17-2
million; South Africa, Canada and India were the largest purchasers.
In terms of sales to final buyers, the output of the aerospace industry in 1971
was valued at some £700 million; about one-half of this was accounted for by
complete aircraft and airframe parts, about 36 per cent by engines and parts
and some 11 per cent by guided weapons and space activities. The most notable
turbo-prop aircraft in current production and operation is the Hawker Siddeley
748, of which over 265 have been sold or are on order. A second generation of
jet airliners, the medium-haul Trident, the longer-haul Vickers VC10, and the
B AC One-Eleven, the world’s first jet transport designed to operate economically
on short-haul routes, have been in service for over seven years. Other civil
aircraft in production include the HS125 executive jet, the Skyvan all-purpose
light transport and the Islander, an economical feeder-line aircraft. Flight
trials of the Concorde, the world’s first supersonic airliner, developed jointly
by Britain and France, are in progress. _
The industry produces a wide range of military aircraft, including the
Jaguar, in collaboration with France, and the Harrier vertical take-off strike
aircraft, 60 of which have been ordered for the United States Marine Corps.
Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy are jointly developing a
supersonic multi-role combat aircraft (MRCA) to meet the needs of their air
forces during the late 1970s and 1980s. The industry is producing or has under
development about 17 types of guided missile for use by the armed services
of Britain and several overseas countries. Its space activities include sounding
rockets, scientific and communications satellites and work on the United States
programme to develop a space shuttle craft.
Hovercraft, a new type of transport vehicle invented in Britain, are being
increasingly used throughout the world. Almost 500 had been built in Britain
up to 1971 and a number of types, including a 170-ton version, the SRN 4, are
in production or under development. Designs for craft of 300-500 tons are
being considered.
In 1971 exports of the aerospace industry totalled £324 million, 21 per cent

more than in 1970. Exports of new aircraft and parts in 1971 (excluding
electrical equipment) had a value of ^158-3 million. Leading buyers included
the United States (^27-5 million) and France. In addition, exports of instru¬
ments were worth £11-5 million, and tyres ^1-4 million.
The construction of aircraft is dominated by two large airframe manufac¬
turers and one helicopter concern; outside these groups are a few important
smaller companies. Besides extensive research work by the industry, research
on a substantial scale on problems of aircraft and their engines is carried out
by the Government, chiefly at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the
National Gas Turbine Establishment, both at Farnborough, and the Royal
Aircraft Establishment at Bedford. The industry has over 50 collaborative
agreements with overseas governments and companies.
Exports of aero-engines and parts have provided well over £1,100 million in
overseas earnings since 1946, and in 1971 were valued at £135-8 million: major
customers were the United States (£44 million), France (£20-7 million) and
the Federal Republic of Germany (£10-2 million). Thirteen different types of
British jet engines power over 30 types of aircraft currently in production
overseas. Famous engines include the economical Dart turbo-prop, the Spey
turbo-jet, the revolutionary Pegasus lift-thrust engine for vertical take-off and
landing (VTOL) aircraft, and the Olympus, the power plant for the Concorde.
Almost all of Britain’s aero-engine manufacture is in the hands of Rolls-
Royce (1971) Ltd., a publicly owned company, to which the essential assets of
Rolls-Royce Ltd. were transferred in May 1971. The latter had encountered
severe financial difficulties in its contract to supply RB211 advanced technology
engines to the United States Lockheed Lion airbus. Development and pro¬
duction of the engines is proceeding under a revised contract negotiated
between Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd. and Lockheed.
The building of large ocean-going vessels is concentrated in four main areas:
the river Clyde in Scotland, the north-east and north-west coasts of England
and Belfast in Northern Ireland. Numerous yards around the coast build
smaller vessels such as fishing vessels, yachts and harbour craft.
Co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is under¬
taken by the British Ship Research Association with its headquarters on the
river Tyne.
Since the publication in 1966 of the report of the Shipbuilding Enquiry
Committee, many British shipyards have embarked on programmes of
modernisation and reorganisation. In many cases this has been facilitated by
assistance from the Shipbuilding Industry Board (SIB) which was in operation
from 1967 to 1971. Shipyard modernisation has been paralleled by major
structural changes. A series of mergers has led to the creation of two major
groups on Clydeside (one of which has been reorganised following its liquida¬
tion), three in north-east England, one in eastern Scotland and one in southern
England. Together with one group in Belfast—where the world’s largest
building dock is now operational—they accounted in 1971 for almost nine-
tenths by gross tonnage of the industry’s new orders for merchant vessels.
A gradual fall in tonnage launched from the 1955 peak of 1-5 million gross tons
was halted in 1964, and launchings in 1971 totalled 1-24 million gross tons,
1,560 tons above the 1970 level. British launchings were the fourth largest in
the world in 1971 accounting for 4-7 per cent of the world total. Fourteen oil
tankers, totalling 368,600 gross tons, were launched in 1971. Launchings also
included 15 bulk carriers totalling 467,100 gross tons and 32 cargo ships

amounting to 296,000 gross tons. At the end of 197* orders on hand for mer¬
chant vessels of over 100 gross tons were 256 (336 in 1970) totalling 4-4 million
gross tons with a value of £678 million. Of these vessels, 59 (17 million gross
tons) were for export.
There are many specialist ship-repairing establishments and most of the larger
shipbuilding firms also carry out repair work; about one-fifth of ship-repairing
activity is concentrated on the north-east coast of England. Repair yards and
dry docks are situated in all the large ports.
Many of the larger shipbuilding yards maintain or have closely associated
engine building works, constructing various types of marine slow-speed diesel
engines, usually under licence. One firm designs large low-speed diesel engines
and there are two independent builders of these engines. Steam turbines of the
highest powers are also built.
The group of industries manufacturing metal products not already described
consists of a large number of companies with a total labour force of 604,200
in 1971; the main groups were engineers’ small tools and gauges (71,100
persons), bolts, nuts and screws (43,800), wire and wire manufactures
(41,400), cans and metal boxes (34,100), jewellery, plate, and the refining of
precious metals (16,900), hand tools and implements (20,400), cutlery (17,100),
and other metal industries (359,400). The total value of exports in 1971 was
about £110 million.
The manufacture of engineers’ small tools and gauges is an expanding
industry, deliveries having doubled in value since i960. Totalling ^130
million in 1971, they included jigs and fixtures (£24 million), press tools,
moulds, etc. (£23 million), hard metal-tipped tools (£18 million) and other
metal cutting tools (£58 million). Export deliveries in 1971 totalled ^27
million.
The production of cutlery and flatware is centred mainly in the city of
Sheffield and the industry’s reputation has been built on the skill of its
craftsmen. Mass-production methods are, however, extensively used except
in the case of some of the highest quality wares, although firms are mainly
small. The value of sales of cutlery and flatware in 1971 was million,
including export sales of ^4-5 million.
This industry, located mainly in the Midlands, Lancashire, Yorkshire, south
Wales and London, produces a wide range of domestic utensils, such as
saucepans, buckets and dustbins, mainly from aluminium and wrought steel.
The value of sales in 1971 was £27 million, of which £3 million were sales for
export.
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest British industries, covering
the manufacture of such tools as files, saws, hammers, axes and spades,
Sheffield, Birmingham and other Midland towns are the most important
centres. The value of sales of implements and tools, other than machine tools
and portable power tools, was ^52'^ million in i97I> which ^17 million
worth were exported; the totals included sales of hand tools, at home and for
export, valued at ^49 million and ^16 million respectively.
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious
metals is an industry in which British craftsmen are heirs to a long tradition.

Most of the firms in the industry are small. The law requires that gold and
silver plate shall not be sold until it has been hall-marked at one of the Assay
Offices situated in London, Birmingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh. The
Birmingham office, located in the main centre of the jewellery industry, is by
far the most important. The total value of sales of jewellery, goldsmiths’ and
silversmiths’ wares and electro-plated nickel silver wares in 1971 was ^38-4
million, of which £7-9 million was for export.
The chemicals industry, with a labour force of 458,000, comprises the manu¬
facture of: general chemicals (132,000 employees), pharmaceutical chemicals
and preparations (77,000), toilet preparations (24,000), paint (32,000), soap
and detergents (20,000), synthetic resins, plastics materials and synthetic
rubber (58,000), dyestuffs and pigments (27,000), fertilisers (13,000), and other
chemical products (79,000). The industry is capital intensive, its fixed capital
expenditure, excluding mineral oil refining, amounting to almost £ 1,880
million during the eight years 1963-70, and totalling £365 million in 1971. A
significant proportion of this investment has been devoted to sectors with the
fastest changing technologies, notably petrochemicals and plastics. The value
of exports in 1971 was £885 million, or 9-6 per cent of total British exports.
Production in the general chemicals industries rose by 53 per cent between
1963 and 1971.
Over half the output of the inorganic chemicals industry consists of a limited
number of relatively simple chemicals, such as sulphuric acid, caustic soda,
chlorine and ammonia, produced in very large quantities and serving as basic
materials for industry. Sulphuric acid has the largest production of any
chemical and 3 -4 million tons were produced in 1971. The remaining output of
this sector consists of a very wide range of chemicals of varying complexity.
Substantial quantities of inorganic chemicals are used in the manufacture
of such products as fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass and metals. About one-
sixth of output is estimated to be exported directly.
Production of organic chemicals (which include coal-tar chemicals) rose
by 67 per cent between 1963 and 1971. To an increasing extent petroleum is
the raw material used and it is estimated that in 1971 petroleum-based
chemicals accounted for over four-fifths of the total output of organic chemicals;
deliveries of feedstock for the petroleum chemical plants totalled 6 million
tons in 1971 compared with 0-3 million tons in 1959. The most important
products (by weight) in 1971 were ethylene (1-04 million metric tons) and
propylene (506,000 metric tons). The main outlets for organic chemicals are
plastics materials, solvents, synthetic rubber, man-made fibres and detergents.
Production of dyestuffs is geared primarily to demand by the textile industry;
about 28,600 tons of synthetic dyestuffs were produced in 1971.
Exports of chemical elements and compounds amounted to .£231 - 6 million in
1971. Major purchasers were: the Netherlands (^34 million), the United
States (£21-2 million), the Federal Republic of Germany (£12-5 million) and
France (j£n 7 million).
The whole range of drugs is produced in the United Kingdom, including
antibiotics, sulphonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products,
anaesthetics, vaccines, sera and naturally occurring drugs. Research expendi¬
ture totalled some £12 million in 1971.
Notable British contributions to the development of new products include:
the discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming and its evaluation by Sir
3 00

Howard Florey and E. B. Chain; the evaluation of sulphapyridine (M & B 693)
by Sir Lionel Whitby; the discovery of griseofulvin; and, more recently, the
isolation of the penicillin nucleus and the development of several semi¬
synthetic penicillins and the cephalosporin antibiotics. Several of the larger
pharmaceutical companies in Britain are subsidiaries of overseas films.
In 1971 exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products and goods rose
by 20 per cent to ^168 ’4 million, of which ^ 17 ■ 1 million worth were antibiotics.
The largest purchasers were Nigeria (£io-$ million), and the Republic of
Ireland (£9-5 million).
The first plastic, Parkesine (later called Celluloid), was produced and patented
in Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes; other British discoveries include
polyethylene. Plastics manufacture is one of the fastest growing sections of the
economy. Output of synthetic resins has doubled since 1963 and total produc¬
tion in 1971 was 1-4 million tons including i-i million tons of thermoplastic
resins.
Expansion in recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of
which the most important are polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—
notably for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for a wide
range of industrial purposes and consumer goods) and polystyrene (a cheap
non-inflammable material used for toys, light mouldings and many consumer
goods). One of the newer thermoplastic materials is polypropylene, which can
be fabricated as mouldings, films and fibres. A new family of plastics materials
reinforced with carbon fibres is now in commercial production in Britain, they
are up to three times the strength but only half the weight of steel. Rapid
expansion of capacity for all the main types of plastics materials is planned.
Exports in 1971 amounted to about 575,000 tons, valued at ^160 million.
The main purchasers were Australia (£13 million), South Africa (£12-6
million), Sweden (£10-8 million) and the United States (£8-g million).
The first general purpose synthetic rubber to be manufactured on a com¬
mercial scale in the United Kingdom was marketed in 195^’ High styrene
rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use where oil
resistance is required, are in large-scale production, and neoprene rubber is
manufactured in Northern Ireland. Production in 1971 amounted to 272,500
tons, most of which came from the styrene-butadiene plant at Hythe, near
Southampton. Exports of synthetic rubber and latex were worth £22-2
million in 1971.
The development of artificial fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
the British scientists Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert. Production is
dominated by three firms and there are a number of firms marketing compound
fertilisers from the principal constituents—nitrogen, phosphorus and potas¬
sium. To encourage use, home sales are assisted by government subsidies to
farmers (see p. 322). Output of nitrogenous fertilisers (in terms of nitrogen
content) has been increasing and in 1970-71 totalled 736,000 tons, while
531,000 tons (in terms of phosphate content) of phosphatic fertilisers were
produced; production of compound fertilisers amounted to 3 million tons in
1970-71. The use of ammonium nitrate (35 per cent nitrogen), ammonium
phosphate, and, to a limited extent, urea (mostly 45 Per cen^ nitrogen) is
resulting in more concentrated fertilisers. The value of exports of manufactured
fertilisers, mainly nitrogenous, was £3‘6 million in 1971.

Notable discoveries by the British crop protection industry include the
insecticidal activity of BHC (benzene hexachloride), the first selective weed¬
killer, MCPA, and more recently Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide
based on paraquat. Sales of pesticides and allied products were provisionally
valued at £43 million in 1971, 10 per cent higher than in 1970; herbicides (£26
million) were the largest single category. Exports of insecticides, fungicides
and disinfectants in 1971 totalled £327 million.
Manufacturers’ sales of paint and varnish during 1971 amounted to some 116
million gallons (including 26 million gallons of emulsion paint) valued at £187
million. Britain is one of the largest exporters of paints in the world; exports of
pigments, paints, varnishes and related materials in 1971 amounted to ^46-6
million. Indirect exports in the form of surface coatings for finished goods are
considerable.
In recent years many improved techniques have been introduced, including
new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments, quick-drying paints and paints
needing only one application.
Sales of toilet preparations were valued at £154 million in 1971, including
export sales of j£23'9 million; home market sales of hair preparations totalled
about £37 million. Petroleum is the source of the principal raw materials
used in the manufacture of organic surface-active agents in detergents; the
other main constituent, polyphosphates, is derived from inorganic sources.
Sales of synthetic detergents amounted to 468,000 tons in 1971, including
75,000 tons for export. Deliveries of soap totalled some 260,000 tons. Sales
of polishes in 1971 were valued at ^19 million, including floor and furniture
polishes worth £10 million. Exports of perfumery and toilet preparations, soap
and associated products were valued at £72-2 million.
Radioisotopes are processed and marketed by the Radiochemical Centre at
Amersham, now part of the Atomic Energy Authority (see p. 399). In the year
ended March 1971 sales of radioisotopes totalled ^4-5 million, of which over a
half was exported.
In recent years, the boundaries between the various fibre based sectors of the
textile industry have become indistinct and considerable vertical integration
has taken place, connected with the rapidly developing technology of man¬
made fibres. Large multi-fibre, multi-process groups have been formed, four
of which now control the bulk of spinning and warp knitting.
The industry has a labour force of 612,000, half of whom are women;
42,000 are engaged in the production of man-made fibres, 76,000 in the spin¬
ning and doubling of cotton, flax and man-made fibres, 57,000 in the weaving
of cotton, linen and man-made fibres, 123,000 in the woollen and worsted
trades, 123,000 in hosiery and knitted goods, 54,000 in textile finishing and
42,000 in carpets. The total value of textile exports in 1971 was £426 million.
Production of textiles rose by 0-3 per cent in 1971 and was 25 per cent higher
than in 1963. The industry’s main research body is the Cotton, Silk and Man¬
made Fibres Research Association.
Cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods industry and cotton piece-goods
its largest export during the nineteenth century. Increasing low-cost competi¬
tion has cut progressively into British markets and a global limit was placed
on imports of cotton goods from most countries during 1966-70 and in 1972.

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Output in 1971 consisted of: 234 million lb. of single cotton yarn, 184
million lb. of spun man-made fibre and mixture single yarn, 187 million lb. of
doubled yarn, 213 million lb. of textured yarn, 611 million linear yards of
woven cotton cloth, and 525 million linear yards of man-made fibre and
mixture cloth. In 1971 exports of cotton yarn (excluding man-made fibres)
were worth ^io-i million, exports of woven cotton fabrics were valued at £25-i
million, with Zaire and the Republic of Ireland the most important markets.
Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the county
being mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning.
Manchester is the commercial centre and Liverpool the chief port of entry for
raw cotton.
The wool textile industry, one of the largest in the world, is the most ancient of
Britain’s staple industries and has been important since medieval times. There
are two main branches—woollen and worsted. The small or medium-sized
business predominates, with only a few large firms. While the West Riding of
Yorkshire is by far the most important producing area, Scotland and the west
of England remain famous as specialised producers of high-quality woollen
cloth. In recent years an increasing amount of man-made fibre has been
blended with wool.
In 1971 output included 146 million lb. of wool and hair tops and 288
million lb. of woollen yarn. Deliveries of worsted and semi-worsted yarn
amounted to 205 million lb. and of woven fabrics to 222 million square yards.
In addition, large, but declining, quantities of raw wool are scoured and
cleaned in Britain. Consumption of raw wool in 1971 was 311 million lb.
Exports in 1971 included wool yarns (£23-3 million), woollen fabrics (£37-8
million) and wool worsted fabrics (^21 -8 million). The main buyers of woollen
and worsted fabrics were Japan (j£n-6 million), the Federal Republic of
Germany and Hong Kong. Raw wool (cleaned or scoured in Britain) and other
animal hair and tops exported had a value of ^34‘3 million. Research is carried
on mainly by the Wool Industries Research Association.
Much of the early development of viscose rayon and acetate took place in
Britain. Production is spread throughout the country with Northern Ireland
of growing importance. Large firms predominate in the industry. There has
been a rapid expansion of output in recent years, the 1971 total of 1,352
million lb. being 88 per cent more than in 1963. Output consisted of 742
million lb. of staple fibre and 609 million lb. of filament yarn in I971- Of
staple fibre, 366 million lb., and of the continuous filament, 422 million lb.,
were of fully synthetic materials.
Two main types of man-made fibres are manufactured: those made from
cellulose (such as rayon) and those produced by fully synthetic processes from
chemical substances (such as nylon). Viscose rayon is still the most widely
used of all man-made fibres and output in 1971 totalled 455 million lb. The
world’s largest rayon staple factory is at Greenfield (north Wales), with an
annual output of over 250 million lb., while other large rayon plants are at
Grimsby and Preston. Almost all the rayon produced in Britain is made by a
single company and its subsidiaries.
Production of nylon, the first fully synthetic fibre, in the form of nylon 66,
started in Britain in 1941; another type of nylon (nylon 6) has been manu¬
factured since 1963. Total productive capacity for nylon in Britain has increased
from 160 million lb. a year in 1964’ almost 325 milli°n lb- at the end of
1971.

Terylene, a polyester fibre, was invented in Britain during the second world
war. It is resistant to fading and is particularly suited to blending with wool.
Annual manufacturing capacity totals over 200 million lb. A group of fibres
of growing importance are the acrylic fibres: Courtelle (a British discovery)
and Acrilan are examples. Synthetic elastomerics or spandex fibres, which are
man-made textile fibres having inherent properties of stretch and recovery,
are now produced commercially.
Exports of man-made fibre yarns had a value of £75-y million in 1971, and
woven fabrics £21 million. The United States, Switzerland, Sweden and
Portugal were the most important purchasers of yarns.
The hosiery and knitwear industry is predominantly one of small-scale
enterprises. Although widely distributed, the industry is centred in the east
Midlands, the north-west of England and in Scotland. Sales of knitted goods
were valued at £421 million in 1971 including ^152 million worth of outer¬
wear and £99 million worth of socks and stockings. Sales of knitted fabrics
were worth £113 million in 1971. Exports of knitted or crocheted clothing
and accessories were valued at £51-2 million in 1971; the largest buyers were
the United States, Switzerland and the Republic of Ireland. Exports of knitted
and crocheted fabrics amounted to £54-4 million. The Hosiery and Allied
Trades Research Association, with laboratories at Nottingham, undertakes
collective research.
The linen industry is concentrated in Northern Ireland (the greatest linen¬
manufacturing region in the world), with most of the remainder in Scotland.
Broadly, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on yarns and the lighter
types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely of coarse linens and
canvas, although household types are also produced. Northern Ireland manu¬
facturers produced 22-2 million linear yards of cloth in 1971, while weavers in
Great Britain delivered 20-7 million square yards, including 12-3 million square
yards of sailcloth and canvas. Exports in 1971 included £6-4 million worth of
linen fabrics and ^4-2 million worth of flax yarns and linen thread.
Jute is manufactured on a large scale in the Dundee area—the centre of the
world’s oldest jute industry—and some 10,500 people are employed in all. Jute
is used in the manufacture of carpets, cordage, ropes and woven into fabrics for
a wide range of applications in the packaging, carpet, upholstery, building and
motor car industries.
New uses for jute, as a plastics reinforcement for example, have been deve¬
loped. In 1971, 76,400 tons of raw jute were used, and exports of jute fabric and
yarn totalled £i‘j million.
Sales of finished lace goods amounted to £11-2 million in 1971. The most
important lace product is from the warp knitting machines, with sales valued
at j£6-i million. Exports were worth £3-4 million in 1971.
In addition to the products mentioned above, British textile firms manufacture
a wide range of other goods, including many special yarns and fabrics, net,
household textiles such as blankets, tablecloths and curtains, and floor cover¬
ings other than carpets. Sales of floor coverings of linoleum, vinyl and other
synthetic materials were valued at £36-6 million in 1971; just under one-sixth
was for export. The cordage industry is one of the largest in Europe. Exports
of ropes, cordage, nets and netting in 1971 were valued at £47 million.

Almost 150 enterprises are engaged in the manufacture of carpets and rugs,
including several large groups. Total sales in 1971 amounted to some 145
million square yards worth about £200 million. Almost half of the volume of
sales is accounted for by tufted carpets, in the production of which the pile,
usually with a high man-made fibre content, is inserted into a per-woven
backing; woven carpets, such as Axminster and Wilton make up most of the
remainder of sales, and form about one-third of the value of exports ^43'5
million in 1971. The principal manufacturing centres include Kidderminster
(in Worcestershire), Halifax and Dewsbury (in the West Riding of Yorkshire),
Glasgow and Kilmarnock (in Scotland) and several towns in Northern Ireland.
About one-quarter of the carpets produced (by quantity) are made pre¬
dominantly of wool and a growing proportion of traditional woven carpets
contain some man-made fibre.
There are 513,000 employees in the clothing, leather and footwear industries.
Some 366,000 are in the clothing industry, 96,000 in the footwear trade and
51,000 in leather, leather goods and fur manufacture. The aggregate value of
their exports in 1971 was £200 million.
The British clothing industry is the largest in Europe and total deliveries
of made-up clothing have increased by 17 per cent since 1963. Exports in 1971,
excluding knitted goods, were valued at £57 million; Switzerland (£7-2
million) was the main purchaser. Substantial quantities of clothing are also
sent by parcel post. _ .
Although there are some large firms employing mass-production methods
on an increasing scale, the typical firm is small. The principal manufacturing
centres are London, Leeds and Manchester, but several firms are also situated
on industrial trading estates throughout the country. Fashion is important in
the production of haute couture models and throughout the ready-to-wear
industry. The Clothing Export Council, representing some 300 companies,
organises promotions for various sectors of the industry.
Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. In 1970 some 11,300 tons
of sole and other heavy leather and in 1971 about 415 million square feet of
upper, lining and other light leathers were produced. Exports in 1971 were
valued at £34-2 million. The United States (£77 million) is the largest single
market, followed by Canada (^4-5 million) and the Federal Republic of Germany.
Tanneries are situated in most parts of Britain, but there are important
concentrations in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, the north Midlands an
the London area. Many different types of leather are produced, ranging from
the heavy types for industrial uses, such as machinery belting, to high quality
leather for footwear, leather goods, gloves and clothing. Collective research is
carried out by the British Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association.
The British footwear industry is among the largest in the world. In 1971
manufacturers’ sales of footwear totalled 186 million pairs. Exports of a
types had a value of ^36-3 million; the United States (£67 million), the
Soviet Union and Canada were the largest markets.
Factories are located throughout Britain. Some areas concentrate on pro¬
duction of particular types; for example, the Rossendale Valley region of
Lancashire on slippers, and Leicester and Norwich on womens and girls
shoes. The Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association enjoys a world-wide
reputation in all matters connected with shoemaking.

The food, drink and tobacco industries employ 828,000 people in the pro¬
duction of a great variety of goods. The value of their combined exports in
1971 was £550 million. Exports of alcoholic and other beverages accounted
for ^262 million; sugar, sugar preparations and honey for £37-4 million; cereal
and cereal preparations for £38-5 million; fruit and vegetables for ^25-5
million; and coffee, cocoa, tea and spices for ^48-9 million.
Many of the industry’s leading firms have been involved in mergers in
recent years.
The household consumption of bread, which has been falling, averaged about
2 lb. 4 oz. (1-02 kg) per head per week in 1971. The trend is heavily towards
concentrating production in large mechanical bakeries; well over two-thirds
of the bread is made in these bakeries, which specialise in sliced and wrapped
loaves; four groups have a dominant position. In the smaller bakeries produc¬
tion of cakes and other flour confectionery is usually allied to bread production.
There are 145,000 employees in the bread and flour confectionery industry
and a further 33,000 in grain-milling.
There are 47,000 employees producing biscuits, and annual output has been
over 590,000 tons in recent years. Weekly consumption of cakes and biscuits
per head in Britain was 11-3 oz. (0-32 kg.) in 1971. British biscuits have
gained a world-wide reputation, and, despite the problem of import restric¬
tions in several overseas markets, exports in 1971 were valued at ^13-7 million.
The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which has 81,000
employees, is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and
many medium-sized and small firms. The main ingredients used by the
industry are sugar, cocoa beans, glucose, milk, nuts and fats. Production of
chocolate and sugar confectionery was 698,000 tons in 1971. Consumption of
chocolate and sugar confectionery in the United Kingdom is among the
highest in the world, being equivalent to 7-7 oz. (0-22 kg.) per head per week.
The value of exports in 1971 of cocoa preparations (including chocolate)
was ^24-2 million and of sugar confectionery, £21 -4 million. The United States
and Canada were the main markets for sugar preparations. An estimated 30
per cent of total world exports of chocolate and sugar confectionery come from
Britain, the world’s largest exporter of these products.
Fruit and vegetable products include canned, frozen and dried fruit and vege¬
tables, jam, marmalade and pickles. The labour force numbers 65,000. Output
of jams and marmalade, which fell from 329,000 tons in 1949 to about 215,000
tons in 1956, has since remained little changed, totalling 172,000 tons in 1971.
Strawberry, raspberry, apricot and blackcurrant jams are the most popular.
Exports of jams and marmalade in 1971 were valued at ^2-7 million.
In 1971, 777,000 tons of canned vegetables were produced. The British
Navy was using canned foods in 1813, but rapid development in the industry
did not take place until after 1935. Beans in tomato sauce (262,000 tons) and
processed and fresh peas (225,000 tons) are the vegetables most in demand as
canned products. In addition, output in 1971 included 78,000 tons of canned
and bottled fruit. Strawberries, plums and rhubarb are the most important
fruits used for canning, followed by fruit salad, prunes and gooseberries. Sales
of prepared fruit pie fillings are increasing.
Nearly 207,000 tons of vegetables (of which peas accounted for 38 per cent)
and 1,000 tons of fruit were processed by quick freezing in 1971.

The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and pre¬
serving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the pre¬
paration of extracts and pastes. The labour force numbers 113,000. Output of
canned meat and canned meat products in 1971 totalled 132,000 tons, and the
quantity of bacon and ham cured was 287,000 tons. Quick-frozen fish output
amounted to some 101,000 tons in 1971; small quantities (10,000 tons in 1971)
are also canned. Exports of fish and fish preparations had a value of £26-8
million in 1971 and those of meat and meat products were worth £23-4
million.
The industries producing beer, spirits, wines, cider and soft drinks have a
labour force of 155,000.
Exports of whisky (almost all of it Scotch whisky) totalled 70 million proof
gallons with a value of £227 million in 1971; almost half went to the United
States (^112 million). Scotch whisky was first distilled in the fifteenth century.
It is blended from 20 or more different types, some from malted barley and
some from other grains. Whisky requires several years to mature, and the
148 million proof gallons of Scotch whisky produced in the 1971 distilling
year will not be on sale for some years. Stocks of whisky amount to more than
800 million proof gallons, representing 10 years’ consumption. About four-
fifths of annual sales are to overseas buyers.
Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since the early 1950s. The main
distillers are in London and one company accounts for a large proportion of
total output. Although the larger manufacturers also own distilleries abroad,
exports had a value of 3^i2,6 million in ip?1.
There are 90,000 employees in the brewing and malting industry. Recent
mergers have led to the creation of a few major brewery groups, marketing
their products throughout the country. In 1971, 34'7 million bulk barrels of
beer were produced, the highest since 1920, and consumers’ expenditure on
beer amounted to £1,416 million. Exports in 1971 of malt beer were 446,000
bulk barrels, worth £6 million. Firms have introduced new production
methods, including continuous brewing processes, and automated batch pro¬
duction plants are well established.
The main raw materials used in brewing are malt, hops and some sugar.
Malt is made almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some brewers make all
or part of their own malt, others purchase it from independent maltsters who
also supply distillers, vinegar brewers and malt extract manufacturers. British
malt is used by brewers throughout the world, and exports in 1971 amounted
to 93,000 tons, worth £5-7 million.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade although
sales are liable to be seasonal. Output in 1971 included 70 million gallons of
concentrated liquid, and 274 million gallons of unconcentrated drinks. Though
there has been some amalgamation in recent years, there are still several
hundred firms supplying regional markets. There are two very large firms
among about 20 producing widely advertised brands which are marketed on a
national scale. There is also some degree of specialisation by firms in the pro¬
duction of various types, such as carbonated drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes
and cordials, tonic waters and ‘mixers’, and comminuted drinks (in which the
whole fruit is used).
The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and other tobacco
goods sold in Britain. In 1971 consumers’ expenditure on these goods

amounted to £1,692 million (of which about two-thirds was tax revenue) and,
in addition, exports worth £41 -4 million (of which cigarettes accounted for
86 per cent) were shipped to a large number of overseas markets; Saudi Arabia,
the Netherlands and Belgium were the most important. The main centres of
production are in and around Bristol, Liverpool, London, Manchester,
Newcastle, Nottingham, Glasgow and Belfast. The two biggest manufacturing
groups account for over 90 per cent of total output. The industry has 38,000
employees.
The tobacco industry used 288-5 million lb. (130-8 million kg.) of un¬
manufactured tobacco in 1971, all of which was imported. In 1971 the main
sources were the United States, Canada and India. Total consumption of
tobacco in Britain in 1971 amounted to 236-8 million lb. (107-4 million kilos),
including 204-1 million lb. (92-5 million kg.) consumed in cigarettes, 26-3
million lb. (11-9 million kg.) in pipe and hand rolling tobacco and 6 million
lb. (2-7 million kg.) in cigars. In 1971 122,400 million cigarettes were con¬
sumed, 5,500 million less than in the previous year; 80 per cent of the total
were tipped compared with 16 per cent in i960.
This group comprises the manufacture of bricks, fireclay, refractory goods,
pottery, glass, cement, abrasives, asbestos and other building materials. The
industries have a combined labour force of 324,000 which includes 56,000 in
the bricks, fireclay and refractory goods trades, 80,000 in the glass industry
and 57,000 in the pottery industry.
Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking, one of Britain’s oldest industries, was introduced by
the Romans, and manufacturing methods vary from traditional hand fabrica¬
tion to highly mechanised systems. In 1971 about 6,540 million building
bricks were produced in Great Britain, 40 per cent of which were of the
Fletton type, made mainly in the Bedford and Peterborough areas. Refractory
goods (firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks and chrome-magnesite bricks)
are manufactured mainly for home use.
The pottery industry, supplying almost all home needs for domestic and
industrial pottery, is a long-established and complex industry, largely located
in the Stoke-on-Trent area of Staffordshire. Much of its raw material is
indigenous, such as china clay, ball clay and china stone from Devon and
Cornwall.
Domestic pottery, including china, earthenware, stoneware, jet and Rock¬
ingham, accounts for about half of the industry’s output; the other main
divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical ware, and such specialised
industrial products as acid-proof stoneware, porous ceramics and laboratory
porcelain are also manufactured. Among famous makes of British pottery are
Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Minton, Coalport and
Royal Crown Derby. Total sales of domestic pottery were £68-7 million in 1971
including record export sales of £32-4 million; the United States and Canada
are the leading markets.
There has been considerable re-equipment; gas or electrically fired kilns
have replaced almost all the coal-fired kilns, and new decorating techniques
and automatic and semi-automatic machinery have been introduced.
Glass
Britain’s glass industry is one of the largest in the world. The section of the
3°8
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in their various
forms is organised for quantity production, much of it in the form of the
‘float’ glass process, which was developed in Britain and has been licensed
to glass makers throughout the world. Its use for internal decoration and as
a finish for internal and external walls has greatly increased in recent years.
Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor industry. Other
products include glass bricks, tubular glass (produced on a large scale),
mirrors, lamp and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware, glass fibres,
and all types of glass containers (often made by fully automatic machinery).
A traditional product is hand-made lead crystal glassware of very high quality.
Direct exports of glass and glassware reached the record value of £48'6
million in 1971. Those of glass were worth ^27-5 million, the most important
markets being Australia, the United States and South Africa. The figure
included ^97 million of float glass.
Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research
Association, and much research work is also carried out by the Department
of Glass Technology of Sheffield University.
Cement The cement industry of the United Kingdom, with 16,000 employees, is chiefly
concerned with the manufacture of Portland cement. Invented by Joseph
Aspdin and patented in 1824, this material and the methods of its production
have been the subject of continuous technical improvement and intensive
research. The capacity of the industry has expanded substantially in recent
years. The Dartford-Gravesend district of Kent is an important producing
area. Output totalled 17-9 million tons in 1971.
PAPER, PRINTING The paper, printing and publishing industries have 630,700 employees,
AND PUBLISHING inciucpng 82,400 in the manufacture of paper and board, 81,600 in the
production of packaging materials, 101,600 in the printing and publishing of
newspapers and periodicals, and 258,000 in other types of printing and
publishing.
Paper and The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until
Board 1678, but records show that some paper was produced as long ago as 1492.
The British paper and board industry is the second largest in Europe. Total
production in 1971 of all types of paper and board amounted to 4-2 million
tons. Of this, newsprint accounted for 581,000 tons and other printing and
writing papers for almost 900,00 tons; 1-08 million tons was board and the
remainder was made up chiefly of wrapping papers, industrial and special
purpose papers and tissues. Exports of paper and board reached a new iccord
level of over £60 million in 1971 and exports of manufactured paper items
were valued at £36 million. The main purchasers were the Republic of Ire¬
land, Australia, South Africa and Sweden.
Total sales of household paper products, including facial tissues, have risen
sharply to £64 million. In 1971, sales of cardboard boxes and cartons were
valued at £153 million while those of fibreboard packing cases totalled ^159
million; sales of manufactured stationery amounted to £182 million in 1971.
Wallpaper manufacturing is dominated by two firms; a recent development
has been the introduction of plastics and plastics-coated wall coverings.
The main raw materials are woodpulp and waste paper. Woodpulp pro¬
duced in the UK is of increasing importance although it still represents only
a small percentage of total supplies (almost 600,000 tons per annum of home¬
grown pulpwood are used in its manufacture). The amount of waste paper

consumed by paper and board mills in 1971 was 1-7 million tons, most of it
collected as salvage in this country.
There are a few very large groups in the industry and many medium-sized
and small firms. The large groups hold considerable interests abroad, includ¬
ing pulp and paper producing mills in the United States, Canada, other parts
of the Commonwealth and Europe.
Research is undertaken by The Research Association for the Paper and
Board, Printing and Packaging Industries.
The printing industry produces an immense range of goods, from national
newspapers and periodicals to books, catalogues and greetings cards. The
industry includes many very small enterprises. Mergers in recent years have
led to the formation of large groups in the newspaper, magazine and book
publishing sections. Three large firms each employ more than 20,000 persons.
General printing, publishing, engraving and bookbinding remains essentially
an industry of small firms.
Book publishers’ turnover in 1970 is estimated at ^154 million, of which
export sales accounted for £68 million. Consumers’ expenditure on books,
newspapers and magazines totalled almost ^460 million in 1970. Book titles
published in 1971 totalled nearly 33,500, over 9,000 of them new ones.
Popularity of paper-backed books has increased rapidly in recent years.
Exports of printed matter, manuscripts and typescripts were valued at
^104-3 million in 1971, including books and pamphlets (£,S9'5 million), and
newspapers and periodicals million), but these figures do not include
parcel post shipments, which are possibly as large again as the recorded totals.
The United States, Australia and Canada are the most important overseas
markets. The Book Development Council, formed in 1965, promotes the
supply and use of British books overseas. Firms have introduced the latest
developments in high-speed printing equipment, including electronic engrav¬
ing machines and advanced processes of photographic reproduction, and
several newspapers are now set by computer.
Other manufacturing industries include the timber and furniture group, with
290,000 employees, rubber manufacture, with 120,000 employees, and a group
of miscellaneous manufactures employs some 218,000 including 103,000 in
plastics moulding and fabricating.
Britain’s rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world, dating
from 1819. Macintosh invented waterproof garments, and Dunlop in 1888
devised the pneumatic tyre. Tyres and tubes represent more than half the
output of the industry but firms also make a variety of goods, the most
important being rubber footwear, conveyor belting, cables, hose, latex foam
products and other vehicle components and accessories.
In 1971 the industry’s consumption of rubber totalled 452,400 tons, com¬
prising 174,000 tons of natural rubber, 258,000 tons of synthetic rubber and
20,400 tons of reclaimed rubber; the proportion of synthetic rubber used is
increasing. In 1971, 250,000 tons of rubber were used in the production of
tyres and tyre products. Tyre manufacturers include several subsidiaries of
United States and other overseas companies. The largest tyre group in Europe
came into being in January 1971, following the merger of Britain’s leading
tyre producing company and its Italian equivalent. Direct export of rubber
and rubber manufactures in 1971 were worth £103-6 million, with Sweden,
the United States and Australia as the main markets. This figure included

tyres and tubes valued at £60-8 million, but excluded large indirect exports on
vehicles. In addition, the industry exported about £4-9 million worth of
rubber footwear and ^3'7 million of rubber gloves and other miscellaneous
products.
London is the largest centre for furniture manufacturing, but High Wycombe,
in Buckinghamshire, is important for domestic furniture.
Deliveries of domestic furniture rose by 30 per cent in volume between 1963
and 1971, and in the latter year their value was £224 million. Exports of all
furniture were worth ^30-2 million in 1971. Numerous enterprises manu¬
facture furniture in Britain (including domestic, upholstered, office, school
and other furniture) and the labour force numbers 89,000. The bedding indus¬
try employs 22,000 people; sales of new bedding in 1971 were valued at ^4^'7
million. Many firms are small but in recent years there has been a tendency
towards concentration.
Scientific research and technical information services are provided by the
Furniture Development Council and the Furniture Industry Research Associa¬
tion. The Council is concerned with the management problems of the industry
and produces an annual statistical and economic review.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain, and embraces highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft units. The value of sales in
1971 was £28’9 million, of which ^3 '6 million was for export.
The timber industry employs 103,000 people. Britain is mainly dependent
on imported supplies of timber (valued at £245 million in 1971) but sawmill
output of home-grown timber together with the output of home-grown pit-
wood totalled about 75 million cubic feet in 1971. Other products include
plywood and chipboard.
The number of people engaged in manufacturing toys and sports equipment
and children’s carriages in Britain is 46,000. Sales of toys and children s
carriages in 1971 were worth j£ioo million and exports had a value of £45
million. The Federal Republic of Germany and the United States were the
main overseas markets. Current trends are towards increased production of
dolls and soft toys, including those linked to television characters.
The value of manufacturers’ sales of games was £8-3 million and that of
sports equipment ^28 million.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for nearly half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest
and most important industries. It occupies 651,000 people or 2-5 per cent of the
total working population, provides about 2-8 per cent of the gross national
product, and uses 47 million of the 60 million acres (19 million of the 24
million hectares) of land.
In 1973 Britain will adopt the Common Agricultural Policy of the European
Economic Community (EEC) subject to agreed modifications and transitional
arrangements (see p. 463).
The soils of the country are very varied (see p. 5). Land used for farming is
conventionally divided into land suitable for cultivation (crops and grass) and
rough grazing. In hill country the area of cultivated land is often small, but is
usually supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
In the United Kingdom as a whole there are 30 million acres (12-2 million
hectares) under crops and grass. Cultivated land, rough grazing, woodlands
(ancillary to farming) and other land used for agriculture together represent
79 per cent of the land area. The rest is mountain and forest, or put to urban
and kindred uses. The area available for farming is gradually decreasing to
meet the needs of housing and industry; so far, the loss has been offset by the
increase in output from what remains. The ratio of rough grazing—used for
stock, mainly sheep—to better quality agricultural land varies considerably
throughout Britain. In the southern half of England, for example, it constitutes
only about one-sixth of the total acreage but is as high as three-quarters in hill
areas such as Wales and Scotland.
There are about 303,000 significant farming units in Britain. Some 45 per cent
are very small units, mostly farmed part-time, and accounting for less than a
tenth of the industry’s total output. About half of the total output comes from
the 12 per cent of holdings classified as large farm businesses, capable of employ¬
ing four or more full-time men. There are estimated to be some 168,000 full¬
time farm businesses in Britain including about 5 5,000 medium-sized (two-three
men) and 76,000 small businesses. The number is falling by about 2 per cent
a year.
The average size of full-time holdings in Great Britain is 250 acres (100
hectares) of crops and grass. In Northern Ireland the land is divided into about
62,000 holdings, almost all of which are owner-occupied. About 40 per cent of
these holdings are either very small or let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops
or grazing), so that the number of effective farm businesses is about 36,000 of
which about half provide a full-time occupation for the owner. The typical farm
size is between 40 and 70 acres (16 and 28 hectares).

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Since the second world war the old concept of a general or mixed farm has
largely disappeared. There has been an increasing use of intensive methods of
production both in crops and animal husbandry and a tendency towards
greater specialisation as a means of maximising production. In England the
farms devoted primarily to arable crops are in the eastern part of the country—
in East Anglia, Kent, Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire. In
Scotland the rich lowlands of the east coast are also primarily arable. Potato
and vegetable growing on a substantial scale marks the farming of the Fens
(south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire), the alluvial areas around the rivers
Thames and Humber and the peaty lands in south Lancashire. Elsewhere,
horticultural crops are widely dispersed amongst agricultural crops.
Dairying and the rearing and fattening of beef cattle are widely followed,
predominantly in Scotland and western districts of England where the wetter
climate encourages the growth of good grass. The parts of England bordering
the Pennine hills and most of Wales are also sheep-rearing areas, though a good
deal of dairying, based on purchased feedingstuffs, is also done there.
In Northern Ireland mixed farming is practised, the most important being
milk, fat and store cattle, pigs and eggs, with sheep and stock raising in the hill
areas. Oats and barley are widely grown, mainly for livestock feeding, and the
only important cash crop is potatoes.
The increase in production which has occurred over the past decades is a
result of the effort of individual farmers, of farmers’ organisations, of research
workers and advisers and of government action. The role of the Government
is described on pp. 320-23.
The steady expansion in production and in yield per acre of arable land which
has taken place since 1936 is summarised in Table 30. Apart from a slight
decline between 1961 and 1964 and another in 1968 total cattle stocks have
risen steadily each year since 1953. The milk-producing herd has been fairly
constant in size since i960. The beef herd is expanding steadily. Numbers of
sheep and lambs reached their highest level in 1966. They have since declined
appreciably but some expansion is now evident again. Numbers of pigs have
increased by over two-fifths during the past decade and those of poultry by
nearly one-third. Arable production has shown a greater diversification since
the second world war. Total cereals production has increased considerably
since i960 reaching a record of nearly 15 million tons in 1971-72- Potato pro¬
duction is very susceptible to weather conditions but on average adequate
supplies are being maintained from a steadily declining area. Between i960
and 1971 output of pigmeat increased by nearly two-fifths and eggs by about
one-twentieth and these, together with the increase in beef and milk output,
resulted in higher consumption of feedingstuffs, mostly from home resources.
Between 5 and 6 million tons of concentrated feeds are imported each year
depending on the size of the home crop of cereals.
The index of agricultural net product (all holdings) at constant prices has
risen steadily. Based on the average of 1954-55 to 1956-57=100, it was an
average of 136 in 1964—65 to 1966—67. On a re-based index (all commercially
significant holdings), 1964-65 to 1966-67=100, 116 is forecast for 1971-72.
The British climate suits grassland farming, especially in the moister west and
north. Even in the regions devoted largely to arable cropping, grassland forms
an important section of the economy of most farms, whether as permanent
grass mostly occupying land less suitable for cultivation, or as sown grassland

(leys), often part of the arable rotation. A wide range of herbage species and
varieties are used.
Grassland production has been greatly enhanced over recent years by the
development and application of new techniques, notably the use of fertilisers
(especially nitrogenous), methods of grazing control, systems of herbage con¬
servation for winter feed and, on some farms, irrigation.
Rough grazings remain as semi-natural grassland used for extensively grazed
flocks and herds, producing young animals for fattening elsewhere.
Crops
Cereals
Fodder Crops
Sugar Beet
Potatoes
Wheat is grown mainly in the eastern half of the country. About 47 million
tons were harvested in 1971, with average yields estimated at 35 cwt. per acre
(4-4 tonnes per hectare). Between one-third and one-half of the wheat crop
is used for flour milling, the remainder going mainly for animal feed.
Since 1961 the area under barley has increased by nearly 50 per cent and
in general production has risen faster due to improved yields. The malting
and distilling market currently absorbs about one-fifth of the crop.
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also often
used on a co-operative basis.
In Great Britain the total area of fodder crops has fallen because in many
cases farmers can provide winter feed more economically by increased grass
production and improved methods of conservation. The principal fodder crops
are beans and kale in England and turnips and swedes in Scotland.
Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire under contract to the
British Sugar Corporation, which takes the entire output at guaranteed prices
and also provides technical advice and assistance. More than three-quarters
of the crop is mechanically harvested.
Potatoes are grown in most parts of Britain. First supplies of early potatoes
normally come from Pembrokeshire, Cornwall and Kent at the end of May.
The lifting of main crop potatoes usually starts in September; the mam area
being the eastern side of the country. Seed potato production for Britain and
for export is chiefly centred in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Britain is normally self-sufficient in main-crop potatoes. As yields are
gradually increasing, requirements can be met from a steadily declining acre¬
age. The area planted with potatoes has declined from 829,000 acres (335,000
hectares) in i960 to 634,000 acres (257,000 hectares) in 1971. A record yield of
11-i tons an acre for the 1971 crop resulted in a substantial surplus of supplies.
The growth of convenience foods has led to an increased demand for processed
potato; home production is expanding to meet the demand but some 18 ir^“
ported. Although potato production is becoming increasingly mechanised,
much hand labour is still needed.
Dairy Farming
Milk is much more valuable when sold on the liquid milk market than when
converted into cheese, butter or other milk products. In Great Britain milk
is produced primarily for liquid consumption, but in Northern Ireland the
greater part of the milk is used for manufactured products. Average consump¬
tion of liquid milk per head is 4-5 pints per week.
Average yields per dairy cow have increased during the last decade by
about 11 per cent and now average some 853 gallons a year. Freedom from
tuberculosis has reduced herd wastage, and a campaign to eradicate brucellosis
is under way. It is estimated that about two-thirds of Britain s total cattle are

bred by artificial insemination (AI) through AI centres operated by the Milk
Marketing Boards and other organisations. The Friesian breed is dominant in
the dairy herds of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but in Scotland the
Ayrshire breed is the most numerous. Av erage herd size is 31 cows. Milk
production has been stimulated by advances in grassland management,
intensive grazing techniques and new methods of making high quality hay
and silage. Most dairy farmers practise some degree of intensive grass manage¬
ment, but hay or silage of the traditional type supplemented with purchased
concentrates remain the basic winter feeds.
Clean dairy farming methods and hygienic standards are prescribed by
regulations made by the appropriate ministers.
Livestock A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. Substantial sales of animals and semen are made to
overseas buyers seeking to replenish and improve their herds and flocks.
British breeds have recently been joined by continental breeds, such as the
Charolais, Limousin, Simmental, Maine Anjou and Blonde d’Aquitaine, in the
hope that these will, in due course, make a useful contribution to the British
livestock industry.
Beef Cattle In the hill regions hardy herds of beef cattle are kept, especially of the Galloway
and Welsh Black breeds and their crosses; in marginal land and lower areas
the sires used are predominantly of the Aberdeen Angus and Hereford breeds.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the dairy herds,
some females being mated to beef sires. There is a large and complex trade
in store cattle (increased by animals imported from the Republic of Ireland),
a typical movement being from the upland west to grazing areas in the
Midlands. The demand for lean tender beef at an economic price has stimu¬
lated the development of intensive and semi-intensive systems of production.
Sheep Britain has a long tradition of sheep production. More than 30 breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated
within a particular area. Research has provided vaccine and sera protection
against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually
severe. Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn
to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages; first, to farms at inter¬
mediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a larger and more
rapidly maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on in due course
to the more genial lowland conditions and especially to the Midlands and the
south and east of England, where they become crossed again with Down
rams for fat lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the
lowland sires fecundity and early maturity. Fat lamb production provides the
main source of income for sheep farmers but wool is also of considerable
importance, especially to farmers in hill areas.
Pigs Pig production is carried on in most parts of Britain but is particularly
important in the eastern and southern counties of England and in Northern
Ireland. There is an increasing concentration into specialist units and larger
herds. The most frequently used breeds are the Large White and the Landrace
though considerable cross-breeding takes place. Pig improvements are fostered
through research by the Meat and Livestock Commission and by leading
commercial firms. Attention is focused on the size and weight of litters, and
on food consumed per pound of liveweight gain. AI is available nationally.

In terms of pig meat, about 30 per cent is used for bacon and 70 per cent for
pork and manufacturing into sausages and other processed forms.
The British poultry industry has expanded rapidly in recent years, largely
owing to the application of improved husbandry and management techniques
in intensive production units and to genetic improvements in stock. There are
about 80 flocks of over 100,000 birds and only a small proportion of total
production is in the hands of the smallest producers. About 85 per cent of the
laying birds on farms are in flocks of 1,000 or more. The average yield of eggs
per bird is well over 220 a year and nearly all eggs consumed in Britain are
home-produced. About 320 million broilers and other special table chickens
were produced in I971-
The horticultural industry produces a wide variety of fruit, vegetables and
flower crops which are together worth about ten per cent of the total from
agriculture as a whole—an estimated £282 million in 1971-72 out of a total of
£2,790 million.
At the June 1971 census the land on which these crops were grown amounted
to nearly 690,000 acres (280,000 hectares), some 2^ per cent of the land used
for crops and grass in Britain. Of crops in the open, fruit accounted for 197,000
acres (80,000 hectares), vegetables, excluding potatoes, for 451,000 acres
(182,000 hectares), and flowers, bulbs and nursery stock for 35,000 acres
(14,000 hectares). Crops under glass, including mushrooms, occupied 5,000
acres (2,000 hectares).
Horticultural crops are largely grown on specialised holdings where soil,
climate, skilled labour and water can produce maximum yields of high quality
crops and where access to markets or good roads enable them to be sold at
economic prices. With the exception of small growers producing crops for
direct local sales most horticultural enterprises are getting larger with the help
of improved planting material, new techniques of cultivation and environ¬
mental control and the widespread use of machinery. Some horticultural crops
form parts of general farm rotations but the returns from increasing specialisa¬
tion favour separate horticultural enterprises. Traditional market gardening
which once flourished around the large centres of population has declined over
the years, mainly due to the growth in the field-scale production of vegetables
which has accelerated to meet the demands of the processing industries.
Of the dozen or so kinds of fruit grown for sale in Britain dessert apples are
the most important. These are grown in Kent and neighbouring counties in
south-east England, in East Anglia and to the north and south of Bristol.
Recent plantings are largely of the autumn and winter variety of Cox’s Orange
Pippin; many of the new orchards consist of closely planted dwarf trees which
can be efficiently pruned, sprayed and picked. England and Northern Ireland
are among the few countries which grow varieties of apples which are used
especially for cooking, the best-known of which is Bramley s Seedling.
Varieties of cider apples are grown mainly in Devon, Herefordshire and
Somerset. # . .
Although pears thrive best in the warmer Continental climate, in the east
and south-east of England where somewhat similar conditions prevail the
Conference pear and a few high quality varieties are produced. Cherries and
plums are grown in Kent, and plums also in the Vale of Evesham and parts of
East Anglia. . . ,
Of the small fruit, blackcurrants are widely grown in Britain, mainly tor

the preparation of juice for the manufacture of soft drinks and flavours for
confectionery. There is a larger concentration of raspberry plantations around
Perth in Scotland than anywhere else in the world. The pattern of strawberry
production is of early cropping in May and June in the areas of south Hamp¬
shire and the Cheddar and Tamar Valleys. There are large areas of main crop
strawberries in Kent and East Anglia. Other fruits include gooseberries, red
and white currants, loganberries and blackberries. Almost all the nuts con¬
sumed in Britain are imported but a few cob nuts and filberts are still grown
in parts of Kent.
Hops for flavouring the beer which is a national drink in Britain are grown in
Kent and three counties to the west, and in Herefordshire and Worcestershire.
Much of the glasshouse sector of the horticultural industry has been re¬
equipped since the mid-1960s with the aid of grants under the Horticultural
Improvement Scheme and there are now, in many parts of the country, large
units with automatic control of light, heat, ventilation, water and the carbon
dioxide content of the atmosphere. The tomato is the most important glass¬
house crop and is either grown as a single crop or in rotation with others.
There is an increasing demand for lettuce at all times of the year, and for
sweet peppers and aubergines, two crops which were formerly hardly grown
or consumed in Britain. Cucumbers are extensively grown in the traditional
glasshouse area in the Lee Valley to the north of London. Mushrooms, with
an estimated farm-gate value of over £15 million in 1970-71, are grown in
specially constructed sheds in several parts of the country.
A wide range of trees, shrubs, herbaceous and alpine plants, once produced for
local sale only, are now sent long distances through the postal services. Many
nurseries concentrate on the production of popular plants in containers for
sale through the garden centres which have been established on the outskirts
of many towns.
The bulb fields of Holland in Lincolnshire are very popular with visitors by
coach and car. Britain now produces more daffodils than any other country,
on some 6,500 acres (2,630 hectares) in Lincolnshire and Norfolk, and in the
east of Scotland, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly where more than 50 per cent
of the cultivable land is devoted to bulbs which flower there from November
to May.
Vegetables and outdoor salad crops are still grown in the traditional areas of
the Thames Valley, north Kent, Vale of Evesham, south Lancashire and the
West Riding of Yorkshire, but many are also grown on soils and in climates
most suited to their production. West Cornwall, south Devon, Pembrokeshire
and Kent send winter cauliflowers and spring cabbage to most urban markets
while much of the summer and autumn cauliflower comes from the intensive
horticultural holdings in Lincolnshire. Most of the carrots are grown on light
soils in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. Brussels sprouts are grown extensively
in Bedfordshire; their production has also extended from the Vale of Evesham
into Gloucestershire and well up the east coast of England wherever freezing
factories are sited for the processing of fish as well as vegetables. Peas and
dwarf beans are now largely sold frozen, canned or dried and are also therefore
grown close to factories in the east of England and further north in Scotland.
Celery is mainly grown on the deep soils of south east Lancashire and the fens
of Cambridgeshire and neighbouring counties. Watercress, a salad crop
demanding a supply of pure water of uniform year-round temperature is grown

have led to increased consumption of high protein foods. More recently the
pattern of food consumption has tended to stabilise but with a more pronounced
trend towards partly prepared and ‘convenience’ foods.
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agri¬
cultural producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments
(see Table 33). In June 1970 the scope of the agricultural census was widened
to cover holdings producing commercially significant quantities of agricultural
produce on one acre or less of agricultural land, previously excluded in Great
Britain. On the old basis the aggregate net income of farmers rose from ^392
million in 1960-61 to £561-5 million in 1969-70. Net income on the new basis
for 1970-71 is £611 million, rising to 3^668 million in 1971-72. The figures
given in Table 33 show that Britain’s farming is predominantly based on live¬
stock enterprises. Over two-thirds of total farm output is in the form of live¬
stock or livestock products.

Of farm expenses, purchased feedingstuffs amount to about one-third,
wages to about one-fifth and machinery (including depreciation) and equip¬
ment to about one-sixth. Since i960 male agricultural earnings have risen by
about 90 per cent, offsetting the manpower economies made possible by
mechanisation and increasing farm size, while labour productivity has risen
by about 6 per cent a year since 1964-65.
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer,
if he is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant.

THE ROLE
OF THE
GOVERNMENT
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In 1971 ‘fixed capital’ totalling £139 million was added to the value of land
and buildings and £118 million was invested in new plant, machinery and
vehicles. The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the farms is pro¬
vided by the occupiers. Bank advances are an important source of outside
capital, both fixed and working; about two-thirds of the total bank advances
to agriculture are believed to be for short-term purposes. Agricultural mer¬
chants are also an important source of short-term credit. Mortgage loans form
the chief source of long-term credit and are provided by specialised financial
institutions (see p. 323) and private sources.
Accounts of some 3,500 farms in Britain, collected by agricultural economists
in 1971, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital ranging from about £2
per acre (£7-4 per hectare) on hill farms with extensive rough grazings to over
£So per acre (^197-7 per hectare) on some lowland farms. On all types of
farms investment in machinery is a heavy item: on dairy and arable farms it
averages nearly £20 per acre (^50 per hectare); on stock-rearing farms it may
amount to £7 per acre (£18 per hectare).
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with 500,000
tractors in 1971 or one to every 35 acres (14-2 hectares) of arable land. Power-
take-off implements now characterise arable farming; and some 66,000
combine harvesters were in use in 1971. A wide variety of machines for
harvesting and preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are
installed on all except the smallest farms.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply
and accompanying equipment. There are about 1,700 farmers’ machinery
syndicates through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment with¬
out tying up their own capital.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out by
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering.
The range of net incomes between individual farms is very wide, varying
with the type and size of farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the
occupier. The average net income for farms of different types is mostly within
the range of £5 to £20 per acre (£12 to £50 per hectare) with the exception
of pig and poultry farms and horticultural holdings, which are more intensive
in their use of land. Net income per acre on dairy and arable farms has nearly
always been higher than on stock-rearing farms, which are generally larger
than the other types and are situated on poorer land.
The functions of government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
by the agricultural ministers, that is to say, for England and Wales the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for
Wales, for Scotland the Secretary of State for Scotland, and for Northern
Ireland the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, local aspects being the
responsibility of the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture. In England
and Wales, the Agricultural Advisory Council and the Horticultural Advisory
Council advise the Minister on the experimental, development and advisory
functions of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food operates through func¬
tional divisions. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly
through its local offices, grouped in England in regions, with regional man¬
agers. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh Secretary with similar
functions and with special responsibility for Welsh affairs.

Government
Policy
Annual Review
In 1966 an Economic Development Committee for agriculture was estab¬
lished, comprising representatives of farmers, workers and landowners, as well
as official and independent members.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The
Secretary of State for Scotland also appoints the members of the Crofters
Commission (see p. 324) and the Red Deer Commission, which deals with the
conservation and control of red deer.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy. It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for which it acts as agent in the administra¬
tion in Northern Ireland of United Kingdom agricultural schemes.
In 1973 the main task of the agricultural departments will be to introduce
the EEC system of price support for the different commodities. An Inter¬
vention Board for Agricultural Produce will be set up to administer the
arrangements under the control of the agricultural ministers who will retain
responsibility for agricultural policy.
The main objective of government policy is to maintain a stable and efficient
agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the nation’s food and
other agricultural produce as in the national interest it is desirable to produce
in the United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum prices consistent with
proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agricul¬
ture and an adequate return on capital invested in the industry. To this end,
the Government is empowered to provide, for the main agricultural products,
guaranteed prices determined in the light of annual reviews (see below).
The Agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964 gave the Government powers to
introduce minimum import prices and levy arrangements for agricultural and
horticultural products. Before 1971 these powers were used in the case of
cereals and for eggs and certain egg products. The basic method of agricultural
support is, however, being changed from a guaranteed price to an import levy
system with the aim of reducing the cost to the Exchequer of agricultural
support by transferring more of it to the consumer. In July 1971 import levy
schemes were introduced for beef, veal and milk products other than butter
and cheese. At the same time import duties were imposed on mutton and lamb
and the existing scheme for cereals was modified. On 1st February 1973, when
Britain adopts the common agricultural policy of the EEC which is based on
variable import levies together with support buying, production subsidies and
export refunds, Britain’s import levy schemes will end, but the system of
guaranteed prices and deficiency payments will continue for the time being.
In February each year, the agricultural ministers review the economic con¬
dition and prospects of the industry.
The ministers are required to consult with representatives of agricultural
producers—in practice, the three farmers’ unions in Britain—and they consider
such factors as production trends and market requirements, world market
prospects, the cost of subsidies, income trend in the industry as a whole, the
increasing efficiency of the industry and changes in production costs. The
ministers then determine guaranteed prices for the coming year for fat cattle,
fat sheep, fat pigs, eggs, wool, milk, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet.
The cost of government support to the industry in 1971-72 was about
£339 million; the estimate for 1972-73, including the 1972 review decisions,
forecast an increase to about £389 million.
322
Price
Guarantees
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In general, the present support system operates by means of deficiency pay¬
ments to stabilise prices to farmers at appropriate levels. These payments make
up the deficit between the open market price of a commodity and the price
guaranteed by the Government. To encourage orderly marketing of home
supplies the deficiency payments are in certain cases limited to the difference
between the guarantee and a target indicator price set by the Government.
The deficiency payments scheme for cereals is administered directly by the
agricultural departments, and payment is made on the acreage harvested or
available for harvesting as grain. It is proposed to introduce target indicator
prices in 1972-73. Deficiency payments for fatstock are made weekly to pro¬
ducers on certified sales on a liveweight or deadweight basis. For eggs, a sub¬
sidy, based on the difference between the guaranteed price and the estimated
producer price, is paid to producers through registered packing stations. The
Government intends to phase out the subsidy and remove eggs from the
guarantee by the end of March 1974.
For most of the remaining commodities and for fat pigs in Northern Ireland,
the Government operates the guarantee through the appropriate marketing
board, which takes account of any payments from or to the Government in
deciding what to pay producers for their produce. In the case of milk there
are five boards, and the full guaranteed price is paid only on a ‘standard
quantity’. Milk produced in excess of the standard quantity is sold for manu¬
facturing below the full guaranteed price. The retail price of liquid milk is
determined by the Government so as to cover the full cost of the guarantee and,
taking one year with another, there is no Exchequer subsidy. Support is pro¬
vided for main-crop potatoes (excluding new potatoes) through a system of
acreage limitation and the purchase of surplus potatoes, as many as possible of
which are then sold for stockfeed. The Potato Marketing Board undertakes
support activities in Great Britain and the Ministry of Agriculture in Northern
Ireland in order to bring the average market price for the season up to the
guaranteed price. The Government pays the greater part of the cost. If the
average price is less than the guarantee the Government makes a collective
deficiency payment to the Potato Marketing Board in Great Britain and the
Ministry of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board
for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to fix in
advance a schedule of producers’ prices, based on types and quality, after
making allowance for the board’s marketing costs.
The British Sugar Corporation contracts to buy the whole of the sugar beet
crop produced from a specified acreage—at present 443,000 acres (179,000
hectares)—at a scale of fixed prices, determined at the annual review and rela¬
ted to sugar content. Refined sugar produced by the corporation is sold, under
market-sharing agreements with the refiners, at a price based on the world
P The Sugar Board buys Commonwealth sugar under the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement (CSA) and sells it commercially. The deficits or surpluses
which result from the transactions of both the corporation and the board are
ultimately reflected in the board’s accounts which it balances, taking one year
with another, by making surcharges or distribution payments respectively
on all sugar entering the British market. Special arrangements have been made
with the EEC both to safeguard the sugar-exporting interests of developing
Commonwealth countries which are members of the CSA and to allow the
effective marketing of their sugar in Britain without prejudicing the marketing
of Community sugar, until the end of 1974 (see P* 4^4)-

The price supports outlined above relate only to current production. To
increase productivity the Government offers to farmers a wide range of induce¬
ments, known as production grants. In 1971-72 production grants amounted to
£115 million of which ^62 million was provided as an inducement to maintain
breeding herds of cattle and flocks of sheep (particularly in upland areas). It
included a calf subsidy on animals suitable for beef production and incentives
for brucellosis eradication.
Grants are available under the Farm Capital Grant Scheme towards capital
expenditure incurred on a wide range of work and facilities for agricultural
businesses such as farm buildings, farm waste disposal systems, facilities for
the supply of gas and electricity, and field drainage. The standard rate of grant
is 30 per cent but higher rates are payable towards the approved cost of some
works; for field drainage the rate is 60 per cent with an extra 10 per cent for
drainage works benefiting hill land. In 1971-72 grants under this scheme and
earlier schemes which it replaced amounted to ^61 million.
Grants are available to encourage the voluntary amalgamation of small un¬
commercial farms with other land to form commercial units. They are given
to those who carry out approved amalgamations and lump sums or annuities
are paid to farmers who give up uncommercial holdings for amalgamations.
Horticultural produce, because it is perishable and liable to seasonal variation
in quantity and quality, does not lend itself to a system of guaranteed prices.
Prior to the 1964 Act the principal means of support was tariffs on imports,
but greater emphasis has since been placed on the need to strengthen the com¬
petitive efficiency of the industry so as to reduce its dependence upon tariffs.
To this end grants of 40 per cent are available to meet the capital cost of a wide
range of buildings, plant and equipment used in the production, storage, pre¬
paration for market and transport of horticultural produce. Additionally, small-
scale horticulturists who are prepared to undertake a three-year programme for
improving the efficiency of their businesses may qualify for a grant of up to
£500. The cost to the Exchequer of these schemes together with horticultural
co-operation and credit is nearly £10 million a year.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agricultural
land and buildings is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Ltd. whose funds are derived mainly from public issues of stock, with some
government support. Loans for agricultural purposes secured on agricultural
land in Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corpora¬
tion Ltd. which works on a similar financial basis to the Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation Ltd.
Loans for carrying out improvements to agricultural land and buildings are
also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement Company, whose
funds are provided privately.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and financed out of
public funds. Half of the loans issued are short-term for agricultural machinery
and the remainder are medium- or long-term loans for such purposes as the
purchase of livestock, the erection and improvement of farm buildings and
farm dwellings, and the purchase of land for amalgamation and subsequent
restructuring.
324 BRITAIN I973i AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government can make loans in Great Britain to help finance the pur¬
chase of land acquired for approved amalgamations of small farms and appro¬
ved remodelling expenditure. These loans may be granted up to 90 per cent
(100 per cent for certain small amalgamations) of the valuation of the com¬
bined unit determined by the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Ltd. in
England and Wales and the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd.
in Scotland, which acts as the Government’s agents.
Smallholdings In England and Wales, about 12,250 smallholdings are provided by local
authorities and about 800 lettable holdings by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food. For financial assistance in improving smallholdings,
authorities can obtain the amalgamations and capital grants available to
farmers generally and these are supplemented for certain smallholdings. The
Minister and local authorities may make loans for working capital to their
smallholding tenants. In this way the tenants can be helped to obtain livestock,
machinery, implements and other necessary items; tenants must, however,
have available at least 25 per cent of the capital required.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 420,000 acres (170,000
hectares) of land settlement estates, comprising some 3,190 crofts and holdings.
Crofting In the seven Scottish crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness, Inverness, Orkney,
Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland and Shetland—much of the land is held by
crofters or tenants whose holdings are generally either rented at a cost of not
more than £50 a year or have an area not exceeding 75 acres (30 hectares).
The Crofters Commission, with headquarters in Inverness, is responsible
for the administration and regulation of crofting. The commission’s functions
are to reorganise, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting counties, to
promote the interests of crofters and to keep under review matters relating to
crofting. The commission’s statutory powers include supervising the letting
of crofts and collaborating with other organisations whose activities affect
crofting interests. It also acts as the Secretary of State’s agent in administering
grants to crofters for cropping and land improvement.
Arterial Land drainage (including flood protection) in England and Wales is currently
Drainage and the responsibility of 27 river authorities (see p. 282), two catchment boards
Sea Defence (which exercise the functions of river authorities) and about 350 internal
drainage boards. Local authorities also have general land drainage powers.
There are no comparable authorities in Scotland, where arterial drainage of
agricultural land is the owners’ responsibility. The work of river authorities is
concerned with the improvement of land drainage, the prevention of inland
flooding and the construction and maintenance of defences to protect low-
lying areas from tidal flooding, for example, a barrier is to be built across the
Thames at Woolwich to protect London from the effects of tidal flooding.
River authorities also have powers relating to water resources generally,
freshwater fisheries and river pollution.
Internal drainage boards are concerned with very much smaller areas and
their work is chiefly in low-lying agricultural districts.
River authorities and catchment boards obtain most of the funds needed for
drainage purposes from local authorities. The Government pays grants to¬
wards the cost of improvement schemes carried out by these authorities. The
grants vary from 10 per cent to 80 per cent according to the financial position

of the authority, with an additional premium for sea defence works. Internal
drainage boards levy drainage rates on owners and occupiers and also receive
government grants at a flat rate of 50 per cent. Local authorities receive grants
ranging from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. In Scotland 60 per cent grants (70 per
cent if for the benefit of hill land) are available to owners or occupiers of
agricultural land.
In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Agriculture is the drainage authority in
respect of watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or minor
watercourses.
In Great Britain more than half, and in Northern Ireland almost all, farms are
owner-occupied. In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and
tenants and to eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of
landlord and tenant relationships has been written into legislation.
Legislation provides for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings, to continue in force from year to year until
terminated by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions the tenant can
contest it by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes in¬
operative unless the landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and
Wales the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land
Court) that his claim for possession is in the interests of sound estate manage¬
ment or good husbandry or that the land is required for certain specified
purposes.
There is a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled on termina¬
tion of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and
tenant and may be varied by agreement at any time or, failing agreement, by
arbitration.
Agricultural products are marketed mainly through private trade channels or
through producers’ co-operative organisations. A fairly recent development
has been the growth of contract farming. For certain commodities marketing
arrangements are influenced by boards operating under the Agricultural
Marketing Act 1958. These boards are producers’ organisations with statutory
powers to regulate the marketing of particular products. The schemes under
which they are constituted and operate must be approved by Parliament and
confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most of the members of the boards are
elected by the producers but a minority are appointed by the minister or
ministers concerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and other
interests affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which are sole
buyers of the regulated product from all producers not specially exempted
or, alternatively, those exercising a comparable influence by controlling all
contracts between producers and first buyers; and, secondly, boards which
maintain only a broad control over marketing conditions, leaving producers
free otherwise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for hops, milk and
wool fall into the first category and the potato board into the second. Northern
Ireland has its own marketing boards, based on local legislation, for milk, pigs
and seed potatoes. For certain other commodities there are broadly based
organisations representing producer, distributor and independent interests.
The Home-Grown Cereals Authority aims to improve the marketing of
home-grown cereals. It operates a scheme of bonuses to growers who make
forward contracts for the delivery of grain, provides market intelligence and
promotes research and development of value to the cereals market.

BRITAIN 1973' AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Meat and Livestock Commission is charged with improving the pro¬
duction, marketing and distribution of livestock and meat in Great Britain. It
has a range of executive functions extending from breeding to retail distribu¬
tion, one of the most important of which is to evolve a general scheme of car¬
case classification. It is not empowered to trade in either livestock or meat.
Since April 1971 eggs have been covered by a broadly based Eggs Authority
which has the general duty of improving the marketing of eggs. It provides
market intelligence, carries out promotional work and operates support buying
on a limited scale.
Grants of up to one-third are available for the modernisation of major
wholesale horticultural markets; Covent Garden is being moved to a new site,
which is under construction, in south London.
National statutory grades have been introduced for apples, pears, tomatoes,
cucumbers and cauliflowers to improve the competitive position of home¬
grown horticultural produce as against imported supplies and to speed its
transit through distributive channels.

The Central Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation was
established to promote and develop co-operation in agriculture and horticulture
and to administer a scheme of grants. The Agricultural and Horticultural
Co-operation Scheme 1971 provides grants for co-operative production and
marketing of agricultural and horticultural produce, including capital grants on
the same terms as are available to individual producers under the Horticulture
Improvement and Farm Capital Grant Scheme.
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
practising veterinary surgeon. Control of animal disease nationally in accord¬
ance with the Government’s policy is the responsibility of the State Veterinary
Service centred on London and Edinburgh, which is incorporated in the uni¬
fied Agricultural Development and Advisory Service.
For many years Britain has been free from many serious animal diseases
including rinderpest, contagious bovine pleura pneumonia, sheep pox, sheep
scab, glanders and rabies, except for two isolated cases of rabies in imported
dogs in 1969-70. The campaign to eradicate swine fever was successfully
completed in 1966 and although three cases of the disease occurred in 1971 the
infection was quickly eliminated. A major epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease
was experienced in 1967—68 but was eradicated successfully by a stringent
slaughter policy supported by other vigorous control measures. In i960 the
whole of the United Kingdom became a bovine tuberculosis attested area. The
incidence of bovine tuberculosis is now very low; cattle (except for certain
categories) are tuberculin tested at regular intervals and reactors to the test are
slaughtered, compensation being paid to the owners. Voluntary schemes for
the eradication of brucellosis have been in operation since 1967 and these now
cover about half the testable cattle in Great Britain. Compulsory eradication
started in three areas in 1971 and is being extended to further areas during
1972 and 1973. Fowl pest, which had declined considerably since 1963,
reappeared in epidemic proportions in a series of outbreaks in 1970 and early
1971 after which outbreaks declined.
The work of the service is backed by the extensive facilities of the Central
Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, and those of its subsidiary
laboratory at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. In addition, there are 24 investiga¬
tion centres with well-equipped laboratories in England and Wales. These
centres perform work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on disease

problems to private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is provided by
the investigation centres of the three Scottish agricultural colleges.
In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are organised similarly to those
in Great Britain but are administered separately by the Ministry of Agriculture.
Animal health control policies and the geographical situation have kept the
country free from nearly all the major epizootic diseases. A Brucellosis Eradica¬
tion Scheme has been successfully carried out and in December 1971 Northern
Ireland was declared a brucellosis-free country. The full-time veterinary service
is supplemented by the central veterinary laboratory at Stormont, Belfast.
The plant health services, operated by the agricultural departments, are
responsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones from
abroad. They also issue the health certificates required by other countries to
accompany plant material imported from Britain. Voluntary certification
schemes are operated to encourage the development of healthy vigorous and
true-to-type planting stocks. It is expected that a statutory scheme for seed
potatoes will operate from the 1974 growing season. The Plant Pathology
Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and the Agricultural Scientific
Services Station, East Craigs, Edinburgh, provide scientific and technical
advice on which statutory controls and certification schemes are based.
The Ministry of Agriculture’s Pest Infestation Control Laboratory provides
scientific and technical advice on harmful mammals and birds and on insects,
mites and moulds associated with grain and other stored food products. The
laboratory’s headquarters is at Slough, Buckinghamshire, where storage
problems are studied; vertebrate pests are studied at Tolworth, Surrey, and
Worplesdon, Surrey. The laboratory works closely with Regional Pest Officers
who advise farmers, local authorities and others on control techniques.
Safeguards against the dangers which could arise from uncontrolled use of
pesticides have been devised and are operating successfully. Regulations pro¬
vide protection for workers using the more toxic chemicals. The voluntary
Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme ensures that new pesticides intended for
use in agriculture and the home garden, forestry and food storage, or new
methods of using existing pesticides, are not introduced until enough experi¬
mental work has been done on their possible hazards (including those to users,
consumers of treated produce, livestock or domestic animals and wild life) to
allow the Government to make recommendations for their safe use. Products
cleared for safety under the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme may then be
submitted through the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme for efficiency
approval. The purpose of this scheme is to enable users and advisers to choose
efficient proprietary brands of agricultural chemicals.
A key role in the administration of the safety scheme is played by the
Government’s Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals
which also reports on topics of current concern. In 1969 it concluded that there
was no evidence that the use of certain persistent organochlorine pesticides
(including DDT, aldrin and dieldrin) had any adverse effects on human beings,
but it is recommended that certain uses of these chemicals for which adequate,
less persistent alternatives were available should cease in order to reduce
amounts of them in the environment. This recommendation was implemented
during 1971.

In 1971 controls were introduced to restrict the use of certain antibiotics in
animal husbandry and veterinary medicines. As a result the retail sale or supply
of feedingstuffs containing these antibiotics was prohibited except in accord¬
ance with a prescription or written direction of a veterinarian.
The Medicines Act 1968 provides for the control of both human and veterin¬
ary medicinal products (including those used in animal feedingstuffs) through
a licensing and certification system which is being brought into operation in
stages. When the Act is fully operative it will not be lawful for the products to
be manufactured, sold or supplied in, or imported into, Britain except in
accordance with the appropriate licences or exemptions. The licensing authority,
which consists of the British health and agricultural ministers, is advised by a
Medicines Commission and by expert licensing committees.
The Ministry’s Safety Inspectors advise farmers and workers about safety,
including their obligations under the Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare
Provisions) Act 1956 and regulations made under it; these cover such matters
as the guarding of field and stationary machinery, the safeguarding of work¬
places, and the fitting of safety cabs to tractors.
In England and Wales technical advice on all agricultural and horticultural
matters is available through the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) which operates mainly from the Ministry’s regional and
divisional offices. The Service provides free and impartial advice to landowners,
farmers and growers, but charges are made for certain laboratory and other
services, such as drainage design work. When possible the ADAS concentrates
more on group than individual advice.
In Scotland the agricultural advisory service is provided by the three
regional independent colleges which are financed almost entirely by public
funds. The nature of service is similar to that provided by the ADAS and covers
all branches of advice.
In Northern Ireland advisory work is organised by the Ministry of Agri¬
culture on a county and district basis.
Agricultural research in Britain carried out by the Agricultural Research
Council and the universities is mentioned on p. 398. The Ministry of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food also carries out research and development on
agriculture, fisheries and food at its own laboratories and on the 22 experimen¬
tal farms and horticulture stations operated by the ADAS, and makes grants
to outside research organisations. In England and Wales, research in agricul¬
tural economics is undertaken by 12 university departments of agricultural
economics. Ten of these conduct work on farm incomes and the economics of
particular products for the ministry (see p. 320)- Scotland, agricultural
economists are on the staff of the three agricultural colleges.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture has an Economics and Statis¬
tics Division and eight other research divisions.
In England and Wales full-time education in agricultural subjects is provided
at universities, non-maintained agricultural colleges and county agricultural
colleges and institutes. Some 11 universities provide degree and postgraduate
courses in agriculture or agricultural sciences. The National College of Agri¬
cultural Engineering at Silsoe, Bedfordshire, offers degree and postgraduate
courses. Seven agricultural colleges provide sandwich courses leading to a
Higher National Diploma and there are nearly 50 local authority and other
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
329
agricultural colleges providing full-time courses on different aspects of agricul¬
ture, horticulture, forestry and farm management. In Scotland the three
agricultural colleges which provide the advisory services are also teaching
establishments, associated with the agricultural departments of the neigh¬
bouring universities. They provide diploma and post-diploma courses, and
certain short courses; there are also national sandwich-type courses at both
higher and ordinary level. The only national diploma centre in dairy technology
in Great Britain is at the West College. In Northern Ireland degree courses in
agriculture and food science are provided at Queen’s University, Belfast.
Courses below this level are provided at three residential colleges run by the
Ministry of Agriculture.
Local education authorities in Britain also provide short courses, block-
release, day-release and other part-time classes for farmers, farm workers and
horticulturists, as well as an advisory service for domestic producers.
The Agricultural, Horticultural and Forestry Industry Training Board
provides a training advisory service and a system of grant payments to em¬
ployers providing training in agriculture and horticulture. The principal
grants are made for training new entrants to the industry, for attendance at
approved courses and for approved schemes of training at places of work.
Research and education on home-grown sugar beet is financed by the indus¬
try. A levy on each ton of sugar beet grown is paid into a special fund under
the control of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who draws up
annual programmes in consultation with the Sugar Beet Research and Educa¬
tion Committee.
FISHERIES
The industry falls into three main divisions, concerned respectively with white
fish, herring and shellfish. The major element of the catch (about 80 per cent
by weight) is white fish: the catches of herring and shellfish comprise about 15
per cent and 5 per cent respectively of the total catch. The principal white
fish (in terms of value) are demersal species which live near the sea bed, such
as cod, haddock, plaice, coalfish (saithe), whiting, soles and skate. Herring is a
pelagic species which lives mainly in midwater or near the surface and which
constitutes a separate fishery. Shellfish include Crustacea (such as lobsters,
nephrops and crabs) and molluscs (such as escallops, mussels, cockles, clams
and oysters).
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three main groups: the
distant water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The distant
waters are those round Iceland, Greenland, Bear Island, the north coast of
Norway, the Barents Sea and in the west Atlantic; the middle water grounds
lie around the Faroe Islands; and the near water grounds are those in the
North Sea, the Irish Sea and in the coastal areas around Britain. The herring
fishing grounds are almost entirely in Scottish waters. The inshore waters also
yield considerable quantities of shellfish.
The Common Fisheries Policy of the EEC aims to promote the balanced
development of the fishing industry and the rational exploitation of resources.
Provision is also made for a system of market organisation, carried out largely
by the industry itself, to assist in the adaptation of supplies to market require¬
ments while ensuring a reasonable return to producers.
The negotiations on Britain’s entry to the Community resulted in a dero¬
gation for ten years (but subject to review before the end of 1982) from those
provisions of the policy which at present permit free access for the fishing
230 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
vessels of member states to the coastal waters of other member states. This
derogation enables Britain’s coastal waters out to the six-mile (9-7 km) limit
to be reserved exclusively to British vessels, and certain specified waters be¬
tween the six- and 12-mile (i9'3 km) limits to be reserved to British vessels and
those with existing rights to fish there for certain species of fish. Britain will
retain full fisheries jurisdiction out to the 12-mile limit.
Fishing Ports The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, North Shields, Lowestoft and Milford Haven. In Scotland the chief
centres for white fish are Aberdeen, Granton, Peterhead, the Moray Firth, the
west coast and Shetland Islands; herring landings are made mainly at the east
coast port of Fraserburgh, the west coast ports of Ullapool, Mallaig, Oban and
Ayr and in the Shetland Islands. In Northern Ireland the main fishing ports
are Kilkeel, Portavogie and Ardglass.
Methods of The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining and ring
Sea Fishing netting. Trawling is carried out throughout the year in the distant and near
waters for all species of demersal fish. Seining is also used for catching demersal
fish all the year round, mainly in the North Sea, the Minches, the Firth of
Clyde and the Irish Sea. There are about 450 Scottish seiners, and about 175
operating from English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring based
on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland and the north-east coast ports
of England. Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of Scotland, in
the Isle of Man area and off southern Ireland.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and
methods of capture; in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs,
lobsters, shrimps, mussels, escallops, cockles and oysters, and, off Scotland,
north-east England and in the Irish Sea there are valuable catches of nephrops
(‘Norway lobsters’ or Dublin Bay prawns).
Distant water vessels, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleet-
wood, number about 160. They are over 140 feet (42-5 metres) in length and
most of them make voyages of 17 to 23 days to fishing grounds off Iceland, in
the Arctic Circle, Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland and the Norway coast.
Freezer trawlers and factory ships, which spend from one to three months at
sea and freeze much or all of their catch, in some cases as fillets, have become an
important part of the distant water fleet in recent years and number about 37.
There are about 325 near and middle water vessels of between 80 and 140 feet
(24*5 and 42-5 metres) long and most of them work nearer home, making
voyages of from a few days up to more than two weeks, although some of the
larger vessels fish regularly off the Faroes and seasonally as far afield as Iceland.
Included in the near water group are vessels engaged in fishing for herring
which normally make daily landings. The inshore group consists of some 1,700
vessels of over 40 feet (12-3 metres) and over 3,500 smaller vessels, many of
which do not fish regularly. The majority are seldom at sea for longer than
two or three days and more usually make daily landings, often fishing within
sight of land although some seiners operate for eight days or more.
In the British fishing industry in 1971 there were about 17,000 fishermen
in regular employment and some 4,100 occasionally employed; about two-
fifths of the former and one-third of the latter were from Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 550 regular fishermen and 200 part-time.
The Fishing

AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY 331
In 1971 landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels totalled 961,000 tons (704,000 tons of demersal fish, 203,000
tons of pelagic and 54,000 tons of shellfish), valued at £92-6 million. Cod
accounted for 47 per cent of the total value of demersal and pelagic fish landed
by British vessels; haddock (20 per cent) and plaice (9 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Imports of all fresh, frozen and cured fish and shellfish totalled 107,000 tons
valued at nearly ^36 million. Imports of canned and preserved fish and shell¬
fish amounted to 66,000 tons valued at nearly £47 million making total fish
imports 173,000 tons worth just over ^82 million. Imports of fish meal
amounted to 297,000 tons worth £25-5 million and those of fish oils to 238,000
tons worth j£22-8 million. Exports of fish and fish products totalled 136,000
tons worth ^28-6 million.
Weekly disposals of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish and
imported canned fish) in Britain averaged about 16,000 tons landed weight
in 1970. Consumption has been declining slightly, on an edible (fillet) weight
basis; it was 147 lb. (6-6 kg.) per head in 1971 (see Table 32) in comparison
with a peak total of 287 lb. (13 kg.) in 1948.
Processing and packaging of fish are the subject of continuing research and
development. The growth of quick-frozen fish production has altered radically
the structure of the industry. With the increase in quick-freezing (which now
processes just over a quarter of all white fish landings), new export outlets have
opened up for white fish, which account for almost half the total exports of
fish and fish preparations.
A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food and, to a much lesser extent, for fertilisers. Home production of
white fish meal and herring meal in 1971 was 90,000 tons.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout, especially when
caught by rod and line. Sea fishing for salmon is prohibited in a wide area
around the British Isles outside national fishery limits. Within the limits drift
netting and certain other methods are prohibited off the coast of Scotland but
are permitted under licence off England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In
Scotland, where salmon fishing is a private right, the main commercial methods
are fixed nets on the coast outside estuaries and sweep netting within estuaries
and in rivers. River authority licences are required for the limited amount of
estuary and river netting carried out in England and Wales. In England and
Wales the landed value of the salmon catch is approximately £275,000 a year,
in Scotland it amounts to about £i-5 million, and in Northern Ireland to some
£230,000. In Northern Ireland, eels worth about £400,000 a year are captured
by long lines and by eel nets placed in river weirs.
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate
Market in London, which handles about 250 tons a day, but other large cities
also have central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is through
wholesalers, located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell to inland
wholesalers as well as directly to retail outlets; the port wholesalers prepare the
fish for onward shipment. Fish lorries, including insulated and refrigerated
vehicles, transport the catch daily from the ports to inland centres, although
rail transport is still used from some ports. Retail sales are handled by some
18,000 to 22,000 fishmongers and fish friers; the latter use about a third of the
landings of white fish.

Trawler-owning companies have entered into the marketing and distribu¬
tive system. This process has been encouraged by the growing popularity of
quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold mainly by other retail outlets,
such as grocers.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland. The safety and welfare
of crews of fishing vessels and other matters common to shipping generally
are provided for under the Merchant Shipping Acts administered by the
Department of Trade and Industry.
The Herring Industry Board was set up to reorganise, develop and regulate
the herring industry and consists of a chairman and two other members, all
part-time and independent of the industry, who are appointed jointly by the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the Secretaries of State for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The board, whose activities are
financed partly by levies and licence fees and partly by government grants
and loans, is advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council, consisting
of 32 members representing all sections of the industry and consumers.
The functions of the board include the promotion of sales of herring, both
at home and abroad, and the application of the benefits of technical progress
to the industry, including the adoption of new methods of catching, processing
and distributing herring. The board administers the government grant and
loan schemes which provide for assistance towards the purchase of new fishing
vessels, and the improvement of existing vessels. Fishermen may also obtain
loans from the board towards the purchase of second-hand vessels under
80 feet in length and towards the cost of new nets and gear. Up to 31st March
I972 jC2’? million in loans and ^,’2-7 million in grants had been advanced.
The function of the White Fish Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate
the white fish industry, and that of its Committees for Scotland and Northern
Ireland is to advise the authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The authority is composed of a
chairman and six members, and the Scottish and Northern Ireland Committees
of five members and a chairman who is a member of the authority; member¬
ship is by appropriate ministerial appointment. The White Fish Industry
Advisory Council advises the authority about the exercise and performance of
its functions. It normally consists of 53 members representing the various
interests of the fishing industry.
The White Fish Authority administers government grant and loan schemes
for the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and the improvement of
existing vessels. It also administers loans for the purchase of nets and gear and
processing plants. Up to 31st March 1972, about £36 million in loans and £37
million in grants were approved. Its other activities are financed by levies on
first-hand sales of most white fish, and a government grant towards research
and development.
Subsidies are paid to the inshore fishing industry under the provisions of the
Sea Fish Industry Act 1970 at the rate of so much per day at sea according
to the length of the vessel or at so much per stone (6-35 kg.) of fish landed,
which varies according to the kind of fish, from certain vessels under 60 feet

(18-5 metres) in length. No subsidy is paid for shellfish. Subsidies for white
fish cost £1-26 million in 1971-72 and those for herring £226,000.
The White Fish Subsidy (Deep Sea Vessels) (United Kingdom) Scheme
came into operation on 1st April 1968 for a period of three years. Subsidies
payable up to 31st July 1971 were at a basic £2 million a year and were adjusted
by reference to the level of profitability of the industry. Payment was related
to the operating efficiency of vessels and not to their classification. These
arrangements replaced the previous policy of progressively decreasing operat¬
ing subsidies to deep-sea vessels. Subsidies cost £1-53 million in 1970-71 and
j£o-5 million in 1971-72. In August 1971 the scheme was renewed for two
years with a small increase in the amount which could become payable subject
to the total maximum in the scheme.
FORESTRY
The estimated total area of productive woodland in Great Britain is 3-76
million acres (1-53 million hectares), or nearly 7 per cent of the total land area;
nearly half of the area is in England, two-fifths in Scotland, the remainder in
Wales.
The area of productive forest managed by the Forestry Commission, at
1-85 million acres (075 million hectares) represents 50 per cent of the total.
The annual rate of productive forest expansion is currently about 54,000 acres
(22,000 hectares) by the commission mainly in Scotland, and about 49,000
acres (20,000 hectares) by private woodland owners. The commission’s
programme includes considerable planting in upland areas, and consists mainly
of conifers because of the difficult site conditions encountered and because
over 90 per cent of industrial demand which the commission is primarily
charged with supplying is for softwoods. The major species used are Sitka
spruce, Lodgepole pine, Scots pine and Norway spruce. In the older wood¬
lands and taking the country as a whole, the most common coniferous trees
are Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and the larches, while, among the
broadleaved, beech and oak occur widely.
Total employment in state and private forests was 25,000 in 1971 and a
further 11,000 were engaged in the transport and milling.
Except for the period of the two world wars, when much over-felling took
place, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s total requirements of wood and wood products—now some
10 per cent of national demand. Some 25 per cent of the commission’s wood¬
lands are now in production. Britain imports 92 per cent of its needs by volume
and a higher proportion still by value, the total import cost of wood and wood
products including pulp and paper being over ^777 million in 1971, of which
£245 million was accounted for by timber imports.
The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority charged with
promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the
production and supply of timber in Great Britain. As more and more of its
coniferous woods reach the production stage the commission, as managers
of the National Forestry Enterprise, has assumed an increasingly important
role as a timber seller and has encouraged the setting up of some 20 major
new timber-using industries since the mid-1960s. The commission consists of
a part-time chairman, a full-time director general, three full-time executive
commissioners and five part-time commissioners. The commissioners comply
with directions given by the forestry ministers, who are the Minister of

Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and
Wales. Northern Ireland has its own separate organisation (see p. 335).
Following a review of forestry policy the Government published, in June 1972,
a consultative document and supporting cost-benefit analysis as a basis for
discussion and formulation of new policies for public and private forestry.
The commission’s total estate covers some 3 million acres (1-2 million
hectares) and includes 2,2 million acres (o-88 million hectares) of forest land,
of which nearly 1-9 million (075 million hectares) are under trees in 380
forests distributed throughout England, Scotland and Wales. All these forests
are covered by management plans, which provide for such work as planting,
road construction, thinning, fire protection and timber production, facilities
for public recreation, wildlife conservation and the landscaping of plantations.
As already stated, a substantial amount of the Forestry Commission’s new
planting is carried out in Scotland, much of it in the Highland counties, where
poorer types of land, such as sour, peaty soil which is unsuitable for agricultural
purposes, are used, having become suitable for forestry as a result of advances
in the technique of deep ploughing.
Production of felled and thinned timber from commission woodlands
amounted to 1-59 million cubic metres in 1971-72. Some of this produce is
meeting traditional requirements of the coal mines but much is taken by the
paper pulp industry and by factories established to make chipboard, fibreboard
and wood wool.
The Forestry Fund was constituted under the i9I9 Forestry Act; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid
amounts voted annually by Parliament, together with the commission s
receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources. In the period ending
31st March 1971, drawings from funds voted by Parliament amounted to
^14-5 million, and receipts were ^9-1 million.
Privately owned woods comprise nearly 60 per cent of the total forest area in
Great Britain and contain most of the mature and semi-mature timber. The
size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few acres to several
thousand acres, and a high proportion of the private woodland area is in small
ownership—that is, owners of up to about 250 acres (100 hectares).
The effective management of private woodlands is encouraged under the
Dedication of Woodlands Scheme under which owners are invited to put
their land permanently to timber production and to manage their woods in
accordance with a plan agreed with the Forestry Commission, in return for
the provision of planting and management grants and technical advice. By
March 1972 the total area dedicated was i-i million acres (443,000 hectares).
In addition, there are the Approved Woodlands Scheme and the Small Woods
Scheme under which a planting grant, but no management grant, is paid.
More than 1-3 million acres (512,000 hectares) are managed under the first
two schemes. Woodland owners are represented, in their relations with the
Forestry Commission, by the Forestry Committee of Great Britain, which
co-ordinates the work of two associations of woodland owners: the Timber
Growers’ Organisation (for owners in England and Wales) and the Scottish
Woodland Owners’ Association.
The Trees Act 1970 allowed for tree preservation orders to be imposed,
with the consent of the commission, on dedicated and other grant-aided
woodlands.
There are a number of forestry co-operative societies providing for land-

owners and farmers the services of skilled staff, centralised purchasing facilities,
and a central agency for the disposal of forest produce. The Forestry Com¬
mission also co-operates with the principal forestry societies, such as the
Royal Forestry Society of England and Wales and the Royal Scottish Forestry
Society, in disseminating technical knowledge.
The Forestry Commissioners maintain national committees for England,
Scotland and Wales which act in an advisory capacity, particularly on the
social, recreational and amenity aspects of the commissioners’ activities and
relationships with other land users. The commissioners also maintain a
regional advisory committee for each conservancy.
Other bodies have been set up to provide for consultation on the marketing
and utilisation of home-grown timber. The Home Grown Timber Advisory
Committee (HGTAC) is a statutory body and includes representatives of
associations of landowners, timber merchants and processors and the trade
unions under an independent chairman. The Advisory Committee on Utilisa¬
tion of Home Grown Timber, a sub-committee of the HGTAC advises on
measures designed to promote utilisation of produce from British woodlands.
Forestry training is the responsibility of the Department of Education and
Science. Degree courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at four
universities and supervisory level courses are run at Newton Rigg, near
Penrith. A number of centres provide craft courses.
The Forestry Training Council advises the commission, private growers’
organisations and the forestry societies on training in forestry for private
woodland owners and the Furniture and Timber Industry Training Board
provides training in forestry for employees in the home-grown timber trade.
The commission’s Forest Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge in Surrey
was opened in 1946 and a new Northern Research Station near Edinburgh in
1970. Expenditure on research work in Great Britain amounted to ^i-i million
in 1970-71. This sum included grants for special forestry research work to
various institutions and to university departments including the Common¬
wealth Forestry Institute at Oxford, which is also financed by the university,
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and overseas governments. Research
into the qualities of home-grown timber is carried out by Princes Risborough
Laboratory (formerly the Forest Products Research Laboratory), and also by
grant-aided research associations.
The Ministry of Agriculture is the forest authority for Northern Ireland. It
can acquire and manage land, and give financial and technical assistance to
private planting. It has introduced measures for the protection of all woodlands
against destruction by over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
The state forest area has grown steadily since the end of the second world
war. By 1972 over 155,000 acres (64,000 hectares) had been acquired, of which
almost 110,000 acres (46,000 hectares) had been planted. A target of 300,000
acres (120,000 hectares) of state and private forest has been set for the end of
the century.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and from
receipts from forest produce and other sources. Nearly 1,400 people are
employed in the state forests. There are also about 36,000 acres (15,000 hec¬
tares) of privately owned forests, and private planting is assisted by schemes
for the supply of young trees from the Ministry’s nurseries at a low cost, by
grants towards the cost of the establishment of new plantations, and by free
technical advice.
15 TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
SHIPPING
Relations with
the Government
Inland and overseas transport and communications employed 7 per cent of the
total labour force in Great Britain in June I971- 1‘^ million persons
so occupied, 31 per cent were engaged in road passenger transport and road
haulage contracting, 17 per cent in railways and 30 per cent in postal services
and telecommunications; sea and air transport each absorbed 5 per cent; port
and inland water transport and miscellaneous transport services and storage
absorbed 12 per cent. Transport and communications contribute about 9 per
cent of the gross national product and are responsible for a rather higher
proportion of the nation’s gross fixed capital formation.
SEA TRANSPORT
Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of 100 gross tons1 and over, some 11
per cent is registered in Britain, making the British merchant fleet, at 27-3
million gross tons, the third largest in active employment after those of Liberia
and Japan. The oil tanker fleet, at 13-4 million gross tons, is the world’s second
largest, and the ore and bulk carrier fleet at 4-3 million gross tons, the fourth
largest.
The British fleet has grown steadily, particularly over the last two or three
years; since 1968 it has increased by 25 per cent, much of the new tonnage
consisting of purpose-built container, tanker and bulk carrier vessels. British
shipping meets severe international competition and, with the fleets of other
traditional maritime nations, encounters difficulties from practices such as flag
discrimination and the use of ‘flags of convenience’.
The Department of Trade and Industry is the government department respon¬
sible for most matters connected with merchant shipping. Under the Merchant
Shipping Acts, it administers many regulations for marine safety and welfare,
for instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll line) that shows that a ship is
not overloaded; ensuring that standards of safety are observed in ship con¬
struction; ensuring the provision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and
radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline, professional standards,
health and accommodation of seamen. Most of the work which these respon¬
sibilities entail is carried out by the staff of the Marine Survey and Mercantile
Marine Offices at the ports. There is also a Registrar-General of Shipping and
Seamen, in whose office at Cardiff a complete record of all British ships is kept.
The Merchant Navy Establishment Administration records information on
British seafarers actively employed at sea. Abroad, certain parts of the Mer¬
chant Shipping Acts are administered by British Consuls and by officers of
Commonwealth Governments.
1 One gross ton (g.t.) =100 cubic feet (2-83 cubic metres). One deadweight ton (d.w.t.)
= 1 long ton (2,240 lb. or 1,016 kilogrammes). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity
of the enclosed space on a ship. Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which
a vessel can carry before submerging the load-line.

EMPLOYMENT OF
SEAFARERS
Qualifications
Much of the law relating to employment at sea is being revised under the
Merchant Shipping Act 1970; in particular some disciplinary provisions are to
be relaxed and arrangements for welfare and safety of seamen improved.
In June 1971, 24 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons and
over were both owned and registered in Britain.1 These ships are usually
employed as follows: 6-4 million gross tons as foreign-going passenger and
cargo liners; 4-8 million gross tons as foreign-going tramps; 12 million gross
tons as foreign-going tankers; and o-8 million gross tons in coasting and trade
with ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades). Over half of the fleet is
diesel driven. Gross tonnage of ships delivered to British owners in 1971 is
estimated at 3-2 million, about a third of which was built in British yards. The
largest and most advanced of Britain’s passenger liners is the Queen Elizabeth 2
(66,000 g.t.), designed for the transatlantic route and for cruising, which went
into service in 1969. Rapid technological change in the merchant fleet is
reflected in the current composition. Vessels are becoming obsolete over a
shorter period and as they do so are being replaced by larger ships, with
generally lower building costs per ton; labour-saving devices, greater speeds
and faster turn-round facilities are reducing operating costs. The tendency to
greater average size has been the most marked in tankers and dry bulk cargo
ships. Vessels are specially built to carry ore, cement, wine and various kinds of
chemicals. Many ships have been designed to carry fully loaded road vehicles,
pallets and containers. In particular the use of containers on door-to-door
journeys can result in speedier, safer and cheaper carriage of a wide range of
goods. Two consortia of British shipping companies are operating specially
designed deep-sea cellular container ship services; several British companies
are involved in international container consortia, and a few are operating
services of their own. Similar arrangements exist in bulk carrier services.
About 96,000 seafarers are employed by the merchant fleet, over half of whom
are United Kingdom nationals, and most of the remainder Commonwealth
nationals.
The Department of Trade and Industry holds examinations for, and issues
certificates of competency to, ship’s officers as master, first mate and second
mate of foreign-going ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as
first-class engineer and second-class engineer. Officers may not normally
serve on board ships in these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a
higher, certificate.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio¬
telegraphy issued by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications on the
results of an open examination.
A seaman may not be rated as A B (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom
registered ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A B granted by
the Department of Trade and Industry, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain
this certificate a seaman must, among other qualifications, have served three
years at sea on deck, have obtained a certificate of efficiency as lifeboatman and
have passed a qualifying examination. Seamen qualify by seniority for promo¬
tion to the rating of petty officer. Service as a deck rating qualifies for the pur¬
pose of admission to the examination for a second mate’s certificate.
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft, Ministry
of Defence vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries
(including over 1 million gross tons of tankers).

The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies
of apprentices, cadets and ratings who are preparing for their examinations for
the various certificates of competency.
Wages and conditions of employment of the majority of seafarers are negotiated
by the National Maritime Board. Minimum wages and holidays with pay are
guaranteed for both officers and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy
Established Service Scheme, introduced by the board in 1947, has removed a
great deal of the uncertainty formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers
and men can now take contracts of at least one year’s duration, either with
individual shipping companies or with the Merchant Navy Establishment
Administration, and get special benefits between voyages in addition to the
normal unemployment insurance benefit.
About one-third of British-owned shipping registered in the United Kingdom
consists of foreign-going passenger-cargo and cargo liners, mostly the latter.
Practically all these ships are owned by large liner companies. Many operate
wide networks of scheduled cargo and passenger services which, between them,
cover every ocean. The 4-8 million gross tons of foreign-going tramp ships are
operated by a large number of private owners, some having only a small number
of ships and some only one ship.
Examples of major British liner shipping companies operating scheduled
services from the United Kingdom are: Cunard, to North America; Blue
Funnel, to Australia and the Far East; Peninsular and Oriental (P. & O.) and
the British India lines, to India, Australia and the Far East; Union Castle, to
South and East Africa; Elder Dempster, to West Africa; Furness Withy, to
North America and the West Indies; the New Zealand line, to Australia and
New Zealand; and Shaw Savill and Albion, to Australia and New Zealand.
These and the other major liner companies have for the most part amalga¬
mated to form a small number of major groups, of which the largest and best
known are the P. & O., the Furness Withy, the Ocean S.S., and the British and
Commonwealth groups.
Over two-thirds of the total tanker fleet belong to the oil companies,
although there are a few important independent United Kingdom tanker¬
owning companies.
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s, see
p. 219) which surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their
safety and operational efficiency. It will accept responsibility for surveying
and giving technical advice on vessels of all flags from the initial stages of
building, at regular intervals during their service, and after casualties. A
satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an underwriter that he may
accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between the Register and
the Society of Lloyd’s.
The representative body speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for
the most part, owners of fishing vessels) is the Chamber of Shipping of the
United Kingdom. There are a number of local associations of shipowners
centred around the main port areas. Other organisations represent companies
specialising in a particular trade or type of cargo.

The British Shippers’ Council, formed in 1955, represents the shipping
interests of exporters and importers in matters of both national and inter¬
national concern.
The British Shipping Federation Limited is the employers’ organisation
concerned with labour relations and the regulation of employment. It is
responsible for the administration of the Merchant Navy Established Service
Scheme, under which shipowners engaging crews for ships of 200 gross tons
and above engage them through the Merchant Navy Establishment Administra¬
tion unless they are prepared to offer company service contracts.
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representa¬
tives of the shipowners and seafarers’ unions and is responsible for negotiation
of wages and conditions of service.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in a
series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of rates,
and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential principle
of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates or
passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets from
time to time to review and revise existing rates, or to compile new ones. Some
of the conferences are connected by rate agreements, or have joined together
to form wider groupings. There are over 60 conferences dealing with trade to
and from the United Kingdom. The governments of 12 European countries
and of Japan have asked conferences serving their countries’ trade to adhere to
a code of conference practice; the eventual aim is the adoption of a world code.
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market
for the chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’
representatives meet there to arrange the chartering of dry-cargo tramp ships
for the carriage of goods to and from all parts of the world. In addition sale
and purchase of ships, chartering of aircraft and trade in certain commodities
are carried on there.
The Department of Trade and Industry’s responsibilities for safety include
administration of the Coastguard Service, and certain administrative functions
concerning lighthouses and pilotage. The department makes regulations to
ensure safety of navigation and to prevent oil pollution, and conducts en¬
quiries into shipping casualties and accidents.
The Coastguard Service co-ordinates search and rescue measures for vessels in
distress off the coasts of Britain, and gives direct assistance where appropriate.
There are some 550 regular coastguards and about 7,000 part-time auxiliary
coastguards. Constant watch is maintained all the year round at certain main
stations and where necessary at a number of others. During the year ended
31st March 1972 life-saving action was taken on 3,518 occasions.
A Coastguard School was opened at Brixham, Devon, in October 1971.
The Coastguard calls upon shipping, the lifeboats of the Royal National
Life-boat Institution, and Service aircraft to assist as necessary. It has at its
disposal a civilian rescue helicopter based at Manston in Kent and may call
upon the services of long-range civilian helicopters based at Aberdeen in
Scotland. The Royal National Life-boat Institution is supported entirely by

voluntary contributions, and depends for its operation on voluntary workers.
From its foundation in 1824 to the end of 1971 it saved 94,923 lives. Lifeboats
were launched 2,676 times in 1971 and rescued 1,439 people.
Lighthouses The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its first
Royal Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board of ten
Elder Brethren, elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively
of the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses and the Commissioners of
Irish Lights. These authorities control about 180 lighthouses, many minor
lights and buoys, and a number of lightships, some of which are being replaced
by unattended sea marks or by light towers.
Pilotage Trinity House is the chief pilotage authority, licensing some 700 pilots in
41 districts in England and Wales, including London, Southampton and
Milford Haven. In some cases the harbour authority or local council is the
pilotage authority. In Britain there are 48 pilotage authorities for the 92
pilotage districts and over 1,700 licensed pilots.
Traffic Every year some 150,000 vessels pass through the Dover Strait, one of the
Control most congested stretches of water in the world. The first traffic separation
scheme adopted by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisa¬
tion (IMCO—a United Nations agency with headquarters in London) was
introduced in the Dover Strait on a voluntary basis in 1967. It was revised and
extended as from 3rd April 1972, and now stretches from the Greenwich
meridian in the Channel as far as other separation schemes operating in the
southern North Sea. It consists of inshore traffic zones on each side of the
Channel for coastal shipping, and main traffic lanes in the centre. On the
initiative of Britain IMCO recommended all states to enforce observation of
IMCO’s traffic separation schemes on their own ships. An Order in Council
enforces observation on British ships as from 1st September I972-
POLLUTION OF The discharge of oil into British territorial waters was first restricted in 1922.
THE SEA Britain is a party to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of
the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which came into force in 1958. Under amend¬
ments made in 1962 and put into force in 1967 the nations ratifying this con¬
vention (now numbering over 40) agreed to prohibit their national fleets from
discharging persistent oil or oily mixtures within 100 miles (161 kilometres) of
any coast, or in some cases more; ships of 20,000 gross tons and over, built
after 18th May 1967, were prohibited from discharging persistent oil or oily
mixtures anywhere at sea. Amendments agreed upon in 1969 prohibit the
discharge of persistent oil or mixtures containing any oil anywhere at sea
except at a rate which has been shown not to cause harmful pollution; no oil
whatever may be discharged from cargo spaces of tankers within 50 miles (80
kilometres) of land. Britain enforces these restrictions on British ships through
the Oil in Navigable Waters Acts of 1955, 1963 and 1971, now consolidated
within the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act I971- -^n Britain signed the
International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases
of Oil Pollution Casualties, clarifying the rights of a state to take action on the
high seas to prevent pollution of its coastline by oil from a damaged tanker, and
the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage,
facilitating the obtaining of compensation for damage by oil pollution. Britain

is giving effect to the latter convention under the Merchant Shipping (Oil
Pollution) Act 1971. In December 1971 Britain also signed the International
Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation
for Oil Pollution Damage (designed to provide additional compensation).
In February 1972 Britain signed and is now implementing a convention
aimed at preventing dumping of piosonous wastes from ships and aircraft in
the North-East Atlantic, including the North Sea.
There are some 250 port authorities or public wharf operators in Britain, and
about 1,400 other undertakings engaged in various harbour operations, such as
stevedoring, towage, warehousing and lighterage. Port authorities are of four
main types: nationalised bodies, public trusts, local authorities and private
companies.
Since 1948 over a quarter of total port capacity has been owned by the
Government; the majority of these ports, including Southampton, PIull,
Immingham, Cardiff and Swansea, are owned by the British Transport Docks
Board. In 1971 shipping arrivals and departures at the board’s docks totalled
nearly 114-8 million net registered tons (including fishing vessels) and total
cargo handled was 79-4 million tons. The British Railways Board controls cer¬
tain ports, which are largely used for the cross-Channel services of the railways
(for example, Folkestone, Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Parkeston Quay
at Harwich) while the British Waterways Board owns Sharpness (Gloucester)
and Weston Point (Manchester).
The constitutions of public trust port authorities vary considerably. Many
consist of representatives of shippers, importers, exporters, shipping com¬
panies, local authorities and trade unions. Examples of such public trusts
are the Port of London Authority, the Tees and Hartlepools Ports Authority,
and the Belfast Harbour Commissioners. Local authorities own about one-
third of Britain’s ports, including the major port of Bristol, and Preston and
Sunderland. Ports owned by private and limited liability companies include
Manchester, the Mersey (Liverpool) and Felixstowe. Many private ports deal
with the traffic of individual industrial firms in commodities such as petroleum,
china clay and paper pulp.
Port authorities, in the main, operate with statutory powers and responsibili¬
ties set out in private Acts of Parliament. Most are members of the Docks and
Harbour Authorities Association, formed in 1917 to further the common
interests of port authorities in their relations with the Government, ship¬
owners and traders.
The National Ports Council, set up as a statutory body under the Harbours
Act 1964, is financed by a levy on port authorities. It advises the Government
on major port developments and has various responsibilities in relation to
research, training, statistics and charges. It has encouraged the amalgamation
of harbour authorities in certain estuaries into single port authorities, as on the
Forth, Clyde and Tees, and is at present engaged in drawing up, in co¬
operation with the port authorities, a programme of financial, commercial and
management improvements.
Large-scale modernisation of the port transport industry has been taking place
in recent years, as a result both of the increase in Britain’s trade, especially
with other European countries, and of technological changes affecting sea¬
going traffic. The growing size of tankers and bulk carriers has necessitated
more deep-water berths, while development of mechanical handling methods.
342 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
packaging of general cargo, containers and ‘roll-on, roll-off’ services has created
a demand for new types of port facilities. Capital investment in ports has risen
from about £18 million a year in the early 1960s to some ^38 million in 1971.
A major development at Tilbury, port of London, costing £30 million over
a number of years, has provided 12 deep-water berths, including a riverside
grain terminal, four of them for container traffic. Another major scheme
has been the construction of the new Seaforth docks at Liverpool, costing £50
million; the first stage, on completion, will provide ten deep-water berths,
four to handle containers, two to handle bulk grain and meat carriers, and
others to handle computer-controlled general cargo and packaged timber.
Container facilities are being expanded at a cost of some ^14 million for the
Far East traffic at Southampton, where a computer-linked harbour surveillance
and shipping information system is being installed to provide radar and VHF
radio coverage over 20 miles (32 kilometres) of port area. Deep-sea container
facilities have also been constructed at Felixstowe, the Clyde, and Manchester.
In addition over 40 specialised container roll-on berths have been constructed
for the short-sea trades with continental Europe, including Scandinavia and
Ireland. A ^20 million deep-water harbour at Port Talbot, south Wales, serves
as an ore terminal for the British Steel Corporation. Other ore terminals are
to be built at Redcar, Yorkshire, and possibly at Hunterston on the Clyde.
Labour About 90,000 people are employed in the port transport industry of the
United Kingdom. At the end of 1971 43,000 dock workers were registered
with the National Dock Labour Board. They were responsible for the physical
and mechanical handling of cargo. The remainder included administrative,
technical, clerical and commercial staff.
The system of casual labour common among dock workers in the past has
gradually been superseded. A start on ‘decasualisation’ was made in 1941 when
war-time controls were imposed. In 1947 the National Dock Labour Board
was established, with members appointed by the then Minister of Labour and
representing both employers and employed, to administer a scheme under
which registered dock workers received a minimum wage for attendance even
when no work was available. In September 1967 each registered dock worker
was placed in employment on a permanent basis with an employer licensed by
the port authority, under the provisions of the Docks and Harbours Act 1966.
Port Traffic Some 350 million tons of cargo a year pass through the ports of Great Britain.
Of this total coastal traffic of over 100 million tons consists mainly of petroleum
and coal. Of over 190 million tons of imports from overseas some 120 million
tons consists of petroleum and petroleum products. Manufactured goods form
about two-fifths of exports.
A large proportion of the general cargo traffic through British ports is
handled by unitised transport methods in containers and roll-on goods
vehicles, which carried i6’6 million tons of goods in I970, British ports handle
more containers than the rest of northern European ports together and account
for the largest share of the container traffic across the North Atlantic. London,
with traffic rising by over 50 per cent to over 2 million tons, was the leading
port for this type of traffic in 1971; Liverpool, Preston and Felixstowe also
handled large amounts.
Principal Ports Britain’s largest port is that of London. In 1971 some 57 million tons of goods
were handled, including 28 million tons of petroleum and over 6 million tons
of coal.

Liverpool is the second largest port and Britain’s major export outlet,
especially to deep-sea trading areas. Some 30 million tons of goods are handled
annually, about one-half consisting of dry cargo—grain, chemicals, iron and
steel, and other manufactures.
Southampton is the chief port for ocean passenger traffic, and has a growing
general cargo trade. In 1971 it handled over 29 million tons of goods, including
petroleum, fruit and vegetables, cereals and manufactured goods. It has the
advantages of deep water and double tides. Bristol, with Avonmouth, has a
large traffic in grain imports, and is Britain’s main port for imports of animal
feedingstuffs. The south Wales ports import much of Britain’s requirements
of iron ore, especially through Port Talbot and Newport (Monmouthshire).
Swansea is important for the export of coal, iron and steel and tinplate and oil.
Milford Haven, handling over 40 million tons, has now become Britain’s major
oil port. The inland port of Manchester, reached from the Mersey via the 36-
mile (58-kilometre) Manchester Ship Canal, has at Eastham Britain’s largest
oil dock, covering 19 acres (8 hectares), and exports manufactured goods and
chemicals.
In Scotland the Clyde is the principal port, serving the central industrial area
and possessing a crude oil terminal at Finnart. On the Forth, Grangemouth
is associated with petroleum, petro-chemicals and timber, while Leith is the
port for Edinburgh.
Newcastle and other ports on the Tyne serve England’s industrial north¬
east, and the port of Tees and Hartlepools handles iron ore, steel and engineer¬
ing products, and chemicals, especially fertilisers. Hull and Grimsby on the
Humber handle nearly half the wet fish landed in Britain and are among the
largest white fish ports in the world. With Immingham they serve the industrial
areas of Yorkshire and the Midlands, especially in trade with Scandinavian and
Baltic ports. Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and with Larne
handles the main traffic across the Irish Sea.
Most of the oil tankers coming to Britain to discharge crude oil are berthed at
special tanker terminals owned and operated by the oil companies to serve
their own refineries.
British ports offer the deepest water access in Northern Europe for fully
laden tankers to pipe crude oil direct to refineries. Milford Haven in Wales,
after a £12 million dredging scheme, can accommodate fully laden vessels of
250,000 deadweight tons on all tides at four private oil company terminals.
Finnart on the Clyde will also accept vessels of this size and can be readily
adapted to accept the half-million-ton tankers of the future; it is frequently
used in lightening operations to allow part-laden vessels to proceed with
shallower draft to other ports in Northern Europe.
Pipelines connect Finnart with the refinery at Grangemouth on the Firth
of Forth, Angle Bay with the refinery at Llandarcy (near Swansea) and Stan-
low (Merseyside) with the refinery at Heysham (Lancashire).
The hovercraft, a vehicle which rides on a cushion of air over both land and
water surfaces, has been in regular public passenger service around the coasts
of Britain since 1965. Services are run by several privately owned firms, these
include Hoverlloyd Ltd., which has a purpose-built hoverport at Pegwell
Bay in connection with its car and passenger ferries between Ramsgate and
Calais, and Hovertravel Ltd., which operates across the Solent to the Isle of
Wight and has a subsidiary which does training and charter work. Two
publicly owned bodies, the British Railways Board and the Scottish Transport

Group, have hovercraft interests. British Railways’ subsidiary, British Rail
Hovercraft Ltd. (‘Seaspeed’), was set up in 1966, and is the world’s largest
commercial hovercraft operator. It runs regular services across the Channel
between Dover and Boulogne, and Dover and Calais, using two 165-ton
Mountbatten (SRN4) hovercraft, the largest in the world, carrying passengers
and accompanied cars. It also operates two services across the Solent, and
takes on charter work.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain is carried mainly by
road and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, pipelines and
inland waterways are important in carrying certain types of freight, particularly
bulk goods. A small proportion of freight goes by air.
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is publicly owned:
the railways, a large proportion of road passenger and some road haulage
services, most of the inland waterways and some of the vessels on them. Road
haulage is largely, and coastal shipping almost entirely, in the hands of private
enterprise.
In the third quarter of 1971 there were 15-5 million vehicles licensed for
use on the roads. Of these 12 million were motor cars, 1 million motor cycles
and i-6 million road goods vehicles; about two-thirds of the 75,000 public
road passenger vehicles (excluding taxis) were publicly owned.
In 1971 about 63 per cent of freight, in terms of ton-mileage,1 travelled by
road, 18 per cent by rail, 17 per cent by coastal shipping, and 2 per cent by
pipeline and inland waterway.
Since 1945 the rapid growth of private and commercial motor traffic, causing
congestion problems of increasing severity, especially in cities and towns, and
the changing pattern of demand for transport services have led successive
governments to undertake or commission fundamental studies of probable
trends in transport and problems which may arise therefrom. The Buchanan
report, published in 1963, was the result of a study group set up to examine the
problems of traffic in urban areas. It estimated that Britain would have 40
million vehicles on its roads by A.D. 2010 and proposed radical measures to
rebuild and adapt cities and roads to handle the growth of traffic. It is expected
that the number of vehicles on the roads will double by 1990.
Total passenger mileage is expected to grow by over 50 per cent during the
next ten years with demand for public transport diminishing and travel by
private transport still rising fast. Total freight ton-mileage is expected to
increase substantially, although fuel traffic will fall as a result of structural and
technological change.
Research is being carried out into new forms of inter-urban travel, such as
high-speed passenger trains, tracked hovercraft, and vertical take-off aircraft.
The railway network has been reduced by over a third in the past decade
but it was decided in 1967 to fix a basic network of some 11,000 route-miles
(17,700 route-kilometres) for modernisation and development.
The railways first came under centralised government direction during the
first world war, and afterwards some 130 private companies were amalgamated
into four large regional groups under the Railways Act 1921. Thereafter they
suffered from the prolonged industrial depression and growing competition

from road transport, and following the second world war the Transport Act
1947 brought the railways under public ownership as a single enterprise,
British Railways. Under the Transport Act 1962 the British Railways Board
was set up and came into existence in 1963 with sole responsibility for manag¬
ing railway affairs.
In spite of technical and operational advances the board’s financial position
remained unsatisfactory and, following a detailed review of railway policy,
the 1968 Transport Act made far-reaching changes. Capital debt was written
down from ,£1,627 million (of which ,£705 million had already been suspended
under the 1962 Act) to ,£365 million. Grants were introduced for loss-making
rail passenger services which it was considered desirable to maintain for social
or economic reasons; ,£63-1 million was so paid in 1971. Grants not exceeding
a total of ,£50 million may be paid to the board on a gradually diminishing scale
during the years 1969 to 1973 towards the cost of maintaining surplus track
and signalling equipment pending their elimination; ,£7-5 million was paid
in 1971. Deficit financing ceased and the board was then expected to pay its
way. Other provisions of the Act removed certain restrictions on the board’s
powers to manufacture and to run hotels, and reduced the size of the board.
During 1972 the board’s financial position again deteriorated following a
dispute with the railway workers, resulting in a substantial pay award, and a
miners’ strike which severely reduced carryings of coal. Passenger fares and
freight charges were raised in September, and the Government is to provide a
substantial grant.
The process of rationalisation arising from changing public transport require¬
ments is reflected in the reduction of over 6,500 miles (10,461 kilometres) to
11,643 miles (18,737 kilometres) of standard-gauge route since 1961. A total
of 816 million passenger journeys was made and 189 million tons of freight
traffic conveyed on the railways in 1971; total receipts amounted to £595-2
million. The board made a loss of £15-4 million following interest payments of
£45-6 million. At the end of 1971 it employed 264,000 people.
In 1971 a subsidiary, British Transport Hotels Ltd., owned 33 hotels of
which it managed 32. It also managed the catering facilities on trains and
station refreshment rooms.
A subsidiary, British Rail Hovercraft Ltd., runs regular hovercraft services
(see p. 344).
British Rail’s Shipping and International Services division has a fleet of
about 60 vessels, providing passenger and freight services on most of the
important routes between Britain and the Republic of Ireland and on the
short-sea routes to the continent of Europe, as well as on some domestic routes.
Ownership of domestic services in Scotland was transferred to the Scottish
Transport Group under the Transport Act 1968; its two shipping subsidiaries
own some 40 vessels between them.
The board’s second five-year corporate plan was produced in February 1972.
Plans are revised annually and provide a comprehensive analysis of the perform¬
ance and investment requirements of all sectors of the business. In recent
years the most important developments have been the replacement of steam
by diesel and electric traction completed in 1968; the improvement of inter¬
city passenger services with the emphasis on speed, reliability and comfort;
the introduction of express freight services (‘freightliners’) enabling freight
to be handled throughout transit in standard containers (the responsibility
of Freightliners Ltd., see p. 347); and increased mechanisation in the carrying

of coal and other bulk commodities. Capital expenditure in 1971 amounted to
^70-3 million.
At the end of 1971 there were 3,806 diesel and 318 electric locomotives. In
addition there were 3,591 diesel and 7,261 electric passenger-carrying multiple
unit vehicles.
The board’s current programme includes the replacement of old passenger
coaches by new stock with improved amenities, and the construction of new
electric multiple unit stock to replace old vehicles. On certain sections of the
London-Bristol-South Wales line and of the London-Edinburgh line pass¬
enger trains are permitted to run up to 100 mph (161 km/h). Similar speeds
are also in operation on the London Midland Region’s services on the electrified
line between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool. This electri¬
fication scheme, costing some £160 million and completed in i967> was the
largest individual capital investment project ever undertaken by the British
Railways Board and included station reconstruction, bridgeworks, a new
colour-light signalling system and new rolling stock. An approximate increase
°f 75 per cent in numbers of passengers has followed. Electrification is being
extended by 235 route-miles (378 route-kilometres) to Glasgow at a cost of
£25 million; a £30-4 million route rationalisation and resignalling scheme is
associated with it. A £10 million scheme, due for completion in 1974, is to
provide an extension to the Mersey underground railway in central Liverpool.
Motorail services (carrying both passengers and cars) increased their
revenue by 15 per cent in 197* a^d have a current capacity of 120,000 cars on
29 services. Turnover is now worth £i’6 million a year.
The efficiency of freight services is being improved as new vehicles come into
service and as facilities for concentrating traffic at fewer and better equipped
and sited marshalling yards and terminals are completed. The freightliner
services, the responsibility of Freightliners Ltd. (see p. 347)> serve a network
of over 20 main terminals. Services are operated throughout the country and
to the Continent. The first freightliner ran in 1965.
The London International Freight Terminal, opened in 1967, links the
British Railways Board container port of Harwich with the main freightliner
network. The first fully cellular container ships built in a British yard are
being used in the board’s container services between Harwich and Zeebrugge,
opened in 1968.
The most important freight commodities are coal and steel. The long-haul
carriage of many products in bulk is increasing. Long-term contracts are in
operation for the carriage of cars, oil, china clay, milk, grain, newspapers, steel,
chemicals and other goods. Coal is fed direct from collieries to power stations
in ‘merry-go-round’ trains, on which coal is loaded and discharged automatically
from high-capacity wagons.
British Railways Board’s subsidiary, British Rail Engineering Ltd., had in
1971 14 main workshops, employing some 35,000 people, mostly on repairs
and construction of rolling stock, locomotives and containers.
The Railway Technical Centre at Derby covers 20 acres (8 hectares) and
employs about 1,900 people. Work is proceeding on a large number of projects,
a major one being the development of a 150 mph (241 km/h) advanced
passenger train’ to run over existing tracks. Like the associated train control
system and some smaller projects, it is being given government financial help.
The National Freight Corporation was set up under the 1968 Transport
Act to provide and promote the provision of integrated road and rail freight

services, making the maximum economic use of rail. The corporation took
over all the road haulage and most of the shipping interests of the Transport
Holding Company, disposing of its shipping interests in 1971, and from the
Railways Board the depots, vehicles, warehouses, containers and other equip¬
ment, though not the actual trains used, in the freightliners and sundries
services, and also the board’s road haulage vehicles. It has a capital of about
£100 million, and employs 55,000 people; annual turnover amounts to some
5^210 million.
Freightliners Ltd., a company jointly owned by the Freight Corporation
and the Railways Board (with 51 per cent and 49 per cent of the shares
respectively), is responsible for the marketing and management of freight-
liner services. The Railways Board makes a charge for providing and hauling
the trains, and profits are divided between the board and the corporation in
proportion to their holdings. In 1971 some 500,000 containers were carried on
65 routes.
A Freight Integration Council, set up under the 1968 Act, advises the Depart¬
ment of the Environment and the Secretary of State for Scotland on the
provision of integrated freight services by publicly owned bodies. It consists
of several independent members with an independent chairman, the chair¬
men of the Freight Corporation and the Railways Board, and members
representing union interests.
The British and French Governments have chosen an international group of
banking and other interests with which to pursue the project for a rail tunnel
between Britain and France under the Channel. Final studies for the project
are in progress. The tunnel would provide ferry train services for road
vehicles in addition to through rail services.
A large and steadily expanding road-building programme has been in progress
since 1955. Public expenditure on new and improved roads in Great Britain
is estimated at over £570 million in 1972-73.
Roads are classified according to their traffic value. Trunk roads provide
a national network of routes for through traffic; other roads are divided for
grant purposes into principal and non-principal roads. Motomays are roads
specially designed for high-speed traffic only.
In June 1972 Great Britain had nearly 211,000 miles (339,000 kilometres)
of public highway. There were 9,000 miles (15,000 kilometres) of trunk roads,
of which 1,006 miles (1,619 kilometres) were motorways; 20,412 miles (32,849
kilometres) of principal roads, of which some 36 miles (58 kilometres) were
motorways, and 181,000 miles (291,600 kilometres) of other roads, including
unsurfaced roads.
At the end of June 1972 in England 904 miles (1,455 kilometres) of motorways
had been opened for traffic and construction had started on a further 159 miles
(256 kilometres). Schemes for an additional 299 miles (481 kilometres) were
being prepared. In Wales 23 miles (37 kilometres) were in use. In Scotland
about 140 miles (225 kilometres) of motorway are planned, of which 79 miles
(127 kilometres) are in use. (See map on p. 348.)
A government programme aims to complete by the early 1980s a comprehen¬
sive network of 3,500 miles (5,633 kilometres) of strategic trunk routes, including
2,000 miles (3,219 kilometres) of motorway, serving the major ports, airports
and industrial centres and linking remote regions to the motorway network.

In the interests of improvement of the environment, long-distance and in par¬
ticular heavy goods traffic is being diverted from many towns and villages.
A large programme of bridge and tunnel building has been undertaken in
recent years. The bridges include the suspension bridge across the Firth of
Forth, the Severn Bridge incorporating major advances in suspension bridge
design, the 7,000-ft (2,134-metre) bridge across the Firth of Tay and the
3,200-ft (975-metre) Weaver Viaduct in Cheshire. A £7 million bridge over
the Clyde at Erskine was opened in 1971, a ten-lane bridge at Glasgow was
opened in 1970, and the new £4 million London Bridge over the river Thames
is to be completed in 1972. The Western Avenue extension in London, a
motorway viaduct 2^ miles (4 kilometres) long, was opened in 1970. A .£10
million bridge and trunk road scheme is in progress at Teesside.
Among several major tunnel schemes is a second Mersey crossing of which
the first of the twin tunnels was opened in 1971; the second is due for comple¬
tion in 1974. A second crossing of the Thames at Dartford, Kent, is also under
construction.
The Government has central responsibility for roads. Since its inception in
1970 the Department of the Environment (see p. 51) has exercised this
responsibility.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is the highway authority for
trunk roads in England and on these roads he administers expenditure, which
is provided wholly from central government sources, although for many pur¬
poses he employs local authorities as his agents. The Secretary of State for
Scotland has corresponding responsibilities for roads in Scotland and the
Secretary of State for Wales for roads in Wales. Work on major trunk road
schemes in England, including motorways, is controlled by regional road con¬
struction units, manned jointly by Department of the Environment and county
council staff. The highway authority for principal roads is, in general, the
council of the county or county borough in whose area the roads lie. The
Secretary of State makes specific grants towards approved expenditure on con¬
struction and major improvement of these roads and contributions from public
funds towards maintenance and other expenditure is made through grants to
local authorities. Roads other than trunk and principal roads are entirely the
responsibility of the local authority in whose area they lie.
Research on roads is carried out at the Transport and Road Research Labora¬
tory (see p. 389). The laboratory provides technical and scientific advice and
information to help in formulating, developing and implementing government
policies relating to roads and transport, including their interaction with urban
and regional planning. Work is concerned with planning, design, construction
and maintenance of roads and structures such as bridges and tunnels; safe,
efficient and convenient movement of people and goods, including road layout
and transport networks, control of traffic flow, study of road accidents and
methods of reducing their frequency and severity; assessment of existing and
projected passenger or freight transport systems and investigation of technical
developments and their environmental effects.
In 1971 there were 15-5 million motor vehicles licensed to use Great Britain’s
roads. Of these, i-6 million were goods vehicles and 106,000 were public road
passenger vehicles (that is, buses and taxicabs).

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Road Traffic Act 19301 ended the licensing of public service vehicles
(that is, buses and coaches) by local authorities and set up instead traffic areas
each under the control of three traffic commissioners. The commissioners are
responsible for ensuring the fitness of vehicles used in public road passenger
transport, and for licensing services in order to secure proper co-ordination
and to eliminate unnecessary competition; to this end they may fix routes,
timetables and fares.
The Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933 established a system of licensing for
road haulage vehicles designed to restrict vehicle operations to proved needs.
A new goods vehicle licensing system, aimed solely at improving safety, has
been introduced as provided under the Transport Act 1968. Those operating
vehicles of over 3-^- tons gross weight now require an operator’s licence,
obtained on showing ability to maintain vehicles properly and control loading
and hours worked by drivers. It may also be necessary to demonstrate adequate
financial resources for compliance with these conditions. Licences are granted
by independent, quasi-judicial licensing authorities, and may be revoked,
suspended or curtailed if necessary. Regulations concerning the fitness and
loading of vehicles have become more stringent under recent legislation.
Holders of operators’ licences may carry their own or other people’s goods and
are free of statutory control over their charges. Over 900,000 goods vehicles
not exceeding 3^ tons gross laden weight are exempt from operators’ licensing.
The statutory limit on hours which may be worked by drivers of goods and
public service passenger vehicles were reduced in i970- They are to be reduced
further following Britain’s entry into the European Economic Community; a
mileage limit is to be imposed on drivers of certain large goods vehicles.
Changes in the system of written records to be kept by drivers of goods
vehicles subject to operators’ licensing will also be necessary.
From 1956 to 1963 the nationalised road haulage services were controlled by
British Road Services (BRS), a division of the British I ransport Commission,
and operated through five companies, which together owned about 16,000
vehicles. Under the Transport Act 1962, these organisations operated com¬
panies incorporated under the Companies Act, with their own boards, and
were grouped together under the Transport Holding Company, responsible
to the then Minister of Transport. The road haulage interests of the Holding
Company have been transferred to the National Freight Corporation (see p.
346), which operates some 26,000 vehicles.
The 1968 Transport Act enables Passenger Transport Authorities (PTAs) to
be set up to control and co-ordinate the different forms of transport in any
particular area. The first PTAs were set up in 1969 in south-east Lancashire-
north-east Cheshire, Merseyside, the west Midlands and Tyneside. The
constituent local authorities appoint most of the members, but up to one-
seventh may be appointed by the Secretary of State for the Environment (or
by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales). Each appoints its own
chairman, with the relevant Secretary of State’s approval. The P TAs control
policy and finance, and appoint professional executives Passenger Transport
Executives—to be responsible to them for day-to-day operations. The execu¬
tives may operate services themselves and enter into agreements with other
bodies, such as the British Railways Board or the National Bus Company, to
operate others; they have taken over all the former municipal bus undertakings
in their areas.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 351
The National Bus Company was formed to take over the former bus
operating and manufacturing subsidiaries of the Transport Holding Company
in England and Wales, and operates through locally based subsidiaries.
A separate Scottish Transport Group has been set up to control bus and
some shipping services in Scotland, and has taken over the relevant interests
of the Transport Holding Company, operating through subsidiaries.
The National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group operate
about 21,000 and 4,500 vehicles respectively. The PTAs control 6,100 vehicles.
The remainder of the industry, excluding London Transport, comprises 4,800
operators owning 35,000 vehicles; 69 of these operators are local authorities
outside PTA areas operating 11,000 vehicles, and 3,500 are small concerns
operating not more than five vehicles.
Capital grants may be made by the Government towards the cost of invest¬
ment in public transport, at rates of up to 75 per cent of approved cost. Eligible
schemes include improvements or extensions of railway lines, new fixed track
rail and bus systems, interchanges, stations, car parks, urban and suburban
railway rolling-stock, resignalling, train control systems and automatic fare
collection. Grants at the rate of 50 per cent are available towards the cost of
new buses complying with specifications approved by the Department of the
Environment. Local authorities may assist unremunerative bus services in
rural areas.
Britain has one of the highest densities of road traffic in the world. Road
accident statistics are compiled and published by the Department of the
Environment, the Scottish Development Department and the Welsh Office
from reports made by the police. In 1971, 7,700 people were killed on the
roads and about 90,000 seriously injured. The fatal accident rate per vehicle
is lower than that in most other European countries.
Modern roads, designed for present-day traffic and segregating pedestrians
from vehicles, are safer than the roads they replace and surveys have shown
they result in a marked fall in casualties. The more important measures
directed primarily towards road safety include speed limits of 30 and 40 mph
(48 and 64 km/h) in built-up areas and 50 mph (80 km/h) on certain trunk
and important classified roads in rural areas; a 70 mph (113 km/h) speed limit
on all motorways and on all other roads where no lower limit applies; the
provision of pedestrian crossings; and the system of road markings and traffic
signs which are being replaced by improved signs in accordance with general
European practice. A new centrally controlled, computerised signalling system
is being installed on motorways to warn motorists of advisory speed limits in
certain conditions and of lane closures. The Road Safety Act 1967 made it an
offence to drive with more than a prescribed level of alcohol in the blood, at
present 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.
The design of vehicles, their use on the roads, and the maintenance of their
mechanical condition are controlled by regulations. The regulations are kept
under constant review, and amended whenever necessary in the interests of
safety or for control of pollution and noise. Private cars and light vans which
are three or more years old must be tested annually at private garages author¬
ised as test stations. Heavy goods vehicles are tested annually at government
test stations. Public service vehicles must be specially approved before being
licensed to carry passengers, and are tested at regular intervals. Any vehicle
may be stopped on the road at any time by the police and examined.
All drivers of motor vehicles, unless they have either held a full British
licence or passed the driving test in the last ten years, are required to pass the

test before being granted a full licence to drive. Until they pass the test they
must obtain a ‘provisional’ licence which necessitates their displaying ‘L’
(Learner) plates on their vehicle. With the exception of solo motor-cycles and
motor-cycle combinations, where vehicles are constructed to carry passengers,
learner drivers must be accompanied by a qualified driver. (Newly arrived
residents of Britain may drive under their overseas driving licences for three
months before becoming subject to these rules.) A learner driver of a solo
motor-cycle is restricted, until he passes the driving test, to a machine not
exceeding 250 cc. Professional driving instructors must be approved by the
Department of the Environment. A scheme for special licensing and testing of
drivers of heavy goods vehicles, which lapsed in i939> was reintroduced in
February 1970.
The Road Traffic Acts, which embody the law relating to road users, are
enforced by the police and the courts. A person convicted of any of the 26
most serious offences is liable to be disqualified from driving for a period. The
standard of conduct for all road users and a summary of the requirements of
the law is set out in easily understandable form in the Highway Code. A failure
to observe the code does not of itself render a person liable to criminal pro¬
ceedings but may be taken into account in any such proceedings.
National campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads are
conducted by the Department of the Environment and the Royal Society for
the Prevention of Accidents with assistance from the local authorities, which
also help by arranging courses of instruction, especially courses for children.
The Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967 empowers traffic authorities to make
orders regulating traffic and imposing parking control. With the exception of
trunk roads, which are the concern of the central Government, traffic is the
responsibility of local authorities. Extensive schemes are being undertaken
for the improvement of road safety and the relief of traffic congestion. These
include: ‘fly-overs’ at road junctions; new outlet roads from cities; and traffic
management measures, including comprehensive control of street parking,
‘one-way’ systems, peak hour ‘clearways’ prohibiting waiting on busy roads,
and ‘tidal flow’ arrangements. A Traffic Advisory Unit within the Department
of the Environment advises local authorities. In most town centres street
parking is permitted for limited periods only; in London and many other towns
schemes for payment at parking meters or residents’ parking spaces are undei
the supervision of traffic wardens. Disc schemes providing free but limited
parking facilities are in operation in some towns, including Cheltenham,
Devizes, Harrogate and Ripon. Off-street facilities are being increased, includ¬
ing multi-storey car parks. The Government has embarked on a scheme to buy
sites, for leasing to commercial operators, to provide a network of lorry parks
in England. A computer-controlled system to regulate traffic was installed in
west London in 1968. Similar systems are operating in Glasgow and Liverpool.
London is one of the world’s largest cities. The area known as Greater London,
within a radius of about 15 miles (24 kilometres) from Charing Cross, contains
7-4 million people.
Under the Transport (London) Act 1969, which came into effect on 1st
January 1970, the Greater London Council (GLC) became the overall
transport planning authority for London and assumed responsibility for the
central bus and Underground rail services formerly operated by the London
Transport Board (LTB). These services are managed and operated by the
London Transport Executive, appointed by and responsible to the GLC.

The LTB’s country bus and Green Line coach services were transferred to
London Country Bus Services Ltd., a subsidiary of the National Bus Company
(see p. 351). Under a financial reorganisation the Government wrote off the
entire capital debt of the former LTB, some £270 million.
The London Transport undertaking operates all road and rail passenger
transport services in the London area with the exception of the London lines
of the British Railways Board, the Green Line coach services and the taxicabs.
Some 8,250 taxicabs that ply for hire in the streets are privately operated by
companies or owner-drivers and are licensed annually by the Metropolitan
Police. There are about 13,300 licensed cab drivers.
London Transport’s railway network stretches over 20 miles (32 kilo¬
metres) from north to south and 35 miles (56 kilometres) from east to west. In
March 1972 the total length of the railway over which London Transport
trains operated was 257 miles (414 kilometres), of which 104 miles (167 kilo¬
metres) were underground. London Transport trains serve 278 stations and its
buses travel over 1,705 miles (2,744 kilometres) of roads. To carry traffic over
all this area London Transport owns 4,350 railway cars and 6,273 buses. The
total staff employed is over 59,000.
Improvements being carried out by London Transport have included
extension and modernisation of parts of the Underground system, and the
introduction of automatic fare collection and automatic trains. One-man
operation of buses is being steadily extended over a period of years. The
first one-man-operated double decker buses were introduced at the beginning
of 1971; there are to be some 2,000 of these by 1975.
Work on a new 14-mile (23-kilometre) underground railway—the Victoria
Line—between Walthamstow in north-east London and Brixton in south
London was completed in 1971 and work begun on a scheme to link Heathrow
airport with the Underground railway system. Construction of the first stage
of a new Fleet Line began early in 1972.
London Transport set up an international advisory service for city transport
in 1969.
Since 1963 control of inland waterways has been vested in the British Water¬
ways Board. Under the Transport Act 1968 a grant-in-aid is being paid pri¬
marily to enable the board to maintain an extensive network of amenity
waterways; in 1971-72 £2-5 million was paid and a further X°'7 million for
improving bridges. It is proposed as part of the reorganisation of water services
in England and Wales (see p. 282) that in 1974 control of the waterways should
pass to the new Regional Water Authorities and that the board should be
abolished.
There are about 2,500 miles (4,023 kilometres) of navigable inland waterways
in Great Britain, some 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometres) of which belong to
the British Waterways Board; the remainder are mainly in the hands of
local authorities or private companies. Many of the board’s canals are narrow
waterways which can generally be used only by boats not exceeding 7 ft
(2-13 metres) in width; the remainder are broad waterways and canalised rivers,
some of which can be used by craft of up to about 750 tons capacity. The
Caledonian and Crinan Canals in Scotland are broad waterways. Of the
inland waterways under the control of the British Waterways Board some
340 miles (547 kilometres) are commercial waterways. A substantial additional
mileage (1,100 miles—1,770 kilometres—known as cruising waterways) is being

maintained for recreational purposes; a statutory Inland Waterways Amenity
Advisory Council advises the Secretary of State for the Environment and the
British Waterways Board.
Engineering, commercial and estate work is directed from the board’s
headquarters in London and Watford, and through regional offices at Leeds
and Gloucester. In Scotland the canals (other than the Caledonian, which is
run by a manager) are, for engineering purposes, under the control of the
engineer-in-charge at Glasgow; estates work is supervised from London.
In 1971 traffic on the board’s waterways amounted to just over 5-4 million
tons, of which 2 million tons were coal, 1 -3 million tons liquids in bulk and
2-1 million tons general cargo. Some 95 per cent of the traffic is carried on
340 miles (547 kilometres) of commercial waterways, which are mainly
canalised river navigations.
Although the British Waterways Board is the largest single carrying operator,
most of the traffic is handled by independent carriers or by traders in their
own craft. The board at the end of 1971 owned 499 freight-carrying craft
(including tugs) with a carrying capacity of 22,555 tons. It operates 2 docks
and 25 warehouses.
In Northern Ireland, the only inland waterway which is still used for com¬
mercial transport purposes is the Lower Bann Navigation.
The British Waterways Board is developing its cruising waterways for purposes
of recreation and amenity. These include the Llangollen branch of the Shrop¬
shire Union Canal, the Oxford Canal, and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal.
The principal commercial waterways are the river navigations and broad
canals in the Yorkshire-Humberside area, the Trent Navigation, and the
Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. Freight traffic is declining, but some im¬
provements to facilities are being carried out. The board has devised and is
already operating on some of its commercial waterways a specially designed
interlocking modular barge system. A European consortium is building a
mother-ship to carry the barges between Britain and the rest of Europe.
The total turnover of the British Waterways Board in 1971 amounted to
£5-4 million, of which £0-2 million arose from the board’s own freight¬
carrying activities, j£i'3 million from warehousing and terminal services, and
j£i million from the docks. The sale of water for industrial and agricultural
purposes brought in j£o'9 million. Receipts from pleasure boating were
£194,617. The number of pleasure craft licensed in 1971 was 13,948.
Reorganisation of public transport in Northern Ireland was completed in
1968. Under the Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 the Ulster Transport
Authority was wound up and its assets and liabilities transferred to a new
company, the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Responsibility
for operating services on the 200 miles (322 kilometres) of railway track was
given to the Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd., a subsidiary of the
Holding Company. The Act also provides for a licensing system for road
passenger operators.
Ulsterbus Ltd., another subsidiary of the Holding Company, has taken over
the road passenger operations of the authority, which formerly provided
all public road passenger services, apart from those of the City of Belfast. A
number of privately owned bus companies now operate in addition.
In 1966 the authority’s monopoly of road carriage of freight was replaced
by a licensing system. About 1,9°° operators and 4>I5° vehicles have been
licensed, the biggest single operator being Northern Ireland Carriers Ltd.,

owned jointly by the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company and the
British National Freight Corporation.
On 31st March 1972 there were 14,168 miles (22,800 kilometres) of public
roads in Northern Ireland, comprising 381 miles (613 kilometres) of trunk
roads, 1,018 miles (1,638 kilometres) of Class I roads, 1,736 miles (2,794
kilometres) of Class II roads, 2,883 miles (4,640 kilometres) of Class III roads
and 8,144 miles (13,107 kilometres) of unclassified roads.
The Ministry of Development is directly responsible for the trunk road
system and bears the entire cost of maintenance and construction work on
these roads. In addition to major construction schemes on trunk roads, an
extensive system of motorways is planned including an urban motorway system
in Belfast. About 58 miles (93 kilometres) of motorway were in use by the
middle of 1972.
The Ministry of Development administers the Road Fund (the proceeds of
motor vehicle taxation, driving licence fees and other statutory payments),
from which grants are made to the local authorities (county, county borough,
borough and urban district councils) which are responsible for the other roads.
The rates of grant range from 90 per cent for major improvement works on
Class I roads to 25 per cent for maintenance work on the unclassified roads.
Gross capital expenditure on all roads in the financial year to 31st March
1971 was ^21 million, and expenditure on maintenance and minor improve¬
ments was about ^8 million. Gross capital expenditure in the five-year period
1970-74 is expected to be about £100 million, compared with about £62
million in the five-year period to 31st March 1969. Expenditure on main¬
tenance and minor improvements in the five-year period to 31st March 1971
was ^35 million.
CIVIL AVIATION
In April 1924 four small British companies merged to form Imperial Airways
Limited and this company pioneered the commercial development of inter¬
continental air routes. By 1929 there was a through service from England to
India. The first passenger service to Australia started in 1935.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), a public corporation,
took over the undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways
Limited in 1940. British European Airways (BEA) was established under the
Civil Aviation Act 1946 as a separate public corporation to cover the United
Kingdom and Europe. In addition to the two nationalised corporations, 46
independent air transport operators hold Air Operators’ Certificates.
Under the Civil Aviation Act 1971, a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and
British Airways Board (BAB) have been set up involving a major reorganisation
of the control of British civil aviation. The new bodies became fully operative
on 1st April 1972.
Following the establishment of the Civil Aviation Authority the Secretary
of State for Trade and Industry remains responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with other countries, the
licensing and control of public transport operations into Britain by overseas
operators and British participation in the activities of the International Civil
Aviation Organisation and other international aviation bodies), amenity
matters such as aircraft noise, and investigation of accidents. The Secretary
of State appoints the chairman and other members of the CAA, and is
356
Civil Aviation
Authority
Licensing
Safety
BRITAIN 1973' AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
empowered to give written guidances on the general policies to be followed. The
guidances must be approved by both Houses of Parliament, and the CAA is
then bound by them. The first of these guidances was issued in a report in
February 1972 (see Bibliography p. 482).
The Secretary of State may also give directions, after consultations, to the
CAA, concerning Britain’s relations with other countries, membership of
international organisations or adherence to international agreements, or to
deal with problems of noise, vibration, pollution or other disturbances arising
from the activities of civil aviation. He may also give directions, after consulta¬
tion, to the British Airways Board (BAB) concerning matters affecting the
public interest. The BAB may in turn give directions to the air corporations.
He has powers to make loans to the BAB, with the approval of the Treasury
and within limits laid down by Parliament (see p. 358).
The Civil Aviation Authority has taken over functions previously performed
by the Air Transport Licensing Board and the Air Registration Board (which no
longer exist) as well as a wide range of functions previously performed by the
Department of Trade and Industry. It is separate from and largely independent
of the Government, and responsible for the economic, technical and operational
regulation of the industry, the provision of air navigation services and the
operation of Aberdeen Airport and the Scottish Highlands and Islands aero¬
dromes. It issues licences and certificates to airlines, aircraft, aerodromes and
personnel, including pilots, air traffic controllers and maintenance engineers.
The CAA has been given the objective of recovering, by 1977-78, the whole
of its costs and a reasonable return on capital from the users of its services.
Because it does not itself fix charges for navigation services and because inter¬
national agreement is necessary on charges for navigation services made during
the course of a journey it will take some time to reach this objective; meanwhile
the Government is to pay a progressively reducing grant to meet its deficit on
revenue account, to be assessed annually in advance, and expected to amount
to some £24 million in the first year.
The Civil Aviation Authority operates an air services licensing system, within
which British operators, both state-owned and independent, apply on an equal
footing for licences for scheduled and charter services, or for revocation or
variation of existing licences. It determines categories of licence, content of
applications, and conditions and tariff provisions of licences. It also has power
to exempt particular flights or categories of flights from licence requirements.
In issuing licences the CAA must consider the applicants’ financial resources,
staffing and organisation, the need for the proposed services, their adequacy
and possible effect on existing services, and any representations made by
interested parties. Appeals may be made to the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry.
The CAA is responsible for ensuring the safe operation of civil aircraft, and
initiating relevant preventive measures and research. To this end it has absorbed
the former Air Registration Board, now known as the Airworthiness Division
of the CAA, which is responsible for the code, British Civil Airworthiness
Requirements, with which all aircraft built in Britain must comply. Continued
airworthiness is ensured by regular inspection and by requiring aircraft to
be maintained in accordance with a schedule approved by the CAA. The
authority is advised by an Airworthiness Requirements Board representing
the users.

Every operator of aircraft above a certain weight used for public transport
must possess an Air Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the CAA when
it is satisfied that the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of his
aircraft. It is advised by the flight operations inspectors (who are experienced
airline pilots).
Each member of a flight crew must hold the appropriate official licence. Flight
operations inspectors check the standards maintained by the operators, which
must be adequate for purposes of the Air Operator’s Certificate.
In order to supplement the diminishing supply of well-trained pilots for civil
airlines from the Royal Air Force, the College of Air Training was set up at
Hamble in i960. It is sponsored by the Government and the two airways
corporations. Commercial pilots must attend a course of training approved by
the Civil Aviation Authority. Such courses have been approved at the training
schools at Carlisle, Oxford and Perth, in addition to Hamble. The corporations
set up a new engineering apprentice school at Cranebank, near Heathrow, in
I97°-
An Air Transport and Travel Industry Training Board has been established
under the Industrial Training Act 1964.
Responsibility for policy planning and execution of both civil and military
air traffic control over the United Kingdom and the surrounding seas rests
with the National Air Traffic Services, under the joint control of the Civil
Aviation Authority and the Secretary of State for Defence
In 1950 a system of airways covering the main traffic routes with control zones
around the major airports was introduced. Subsequently, the airway system
has been revised and extended to meet traffic requirements. There are three
main air traffic control centres: at London for southern England, at Preston
for the north of England and Wales, and at Prestwick for Scotland and the
Atlantic Ocean to 30°W.
A variety of radar installations and other equipment provide the means by
which the system can accept the increasingly heavy load of air traffic. Britain
was the first country to use radar for the control of civil air traffic. During
the next few years, under a scheme (Mediator) which will eventually cost some
£50 million, virtually the whole of the airspace over Britain above 5,000 feet
(1,524 metres) will be brought under surveillance by the latest types of primary
and secondary radar equipment, which will provide data to be used in two air
traffic control centres, located at West Drayton (near London) and Prestwick.
The first stage was introduced in February 1971. A subsidiary centre will be
located at Manchester to deal with traffic in the Manchester terminal control
area. Extensive use will be made in these centres of automatic data processing
and other advanced electronic techniques. The Civil Aviation Authority
provides radio navigational aids to help pilots to navigate in all weather con¬
ditions, and has installed the Instrument Landing System (ILS) at all its
major airports.
Britain has pioneered in the development of all-weather landing systems.
The Blind Landing Experimental Unit of the Royal Aircraft Establishment
at Bedford and private industry have worked towards fully automatic land¬
ing. Both BOAC VCios and BEA Tridents now make regular automatic
landings on scheduled flights.

high-flying, high-speed jet aircraft. Set up in 1963 it provides control at the
higher flight levels for civil aircraft and for military aircraft operating accor¬
ding to civil procedures.
From 1st January 1971 all new types of subsonic aircraft using British airports
are required to hold a ‘certificate of quietness’. The noise standards laid down
in the certificate follow the recommendations of the special meeting held by
the International Civil Aviation Organisation in Montreal in 1969.
Noise abatement measures in force at various airports include limitations
on noise levels at take-off, route restrictions, procedures designed to lessen
noise on the ground, and limits on the number of jet movements during
summer nights.
The chairman and members of the British Airways Board are appointed by the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. The BAB controls all the activities
of the two publicly owned air corporations, BOAC and BEA, and their sub¬
sidiaries, as a group in the interests of efficiency. The BAB appoints the chairmen
(with the approval of the Secretary of State) and members of the corporations
(formerly appointed by the Secretary of State). It has powers to provide
air transport services anywhere in the world, and to form and acquire sub¬
sidiaries.
The liabilities of the two corporations in respect of Exchequer loans and
Public Dividend capital were extinguished on the creation of the BAB. Loans
and capital issues equal to the amounts then issued to the corporations were
made to the BAB on 1st April 1972. The overall borrowing and investment
limit has been fixed at £560 million; it may be increased up to £joo million by
an order approved by the House of Commons.
The constitution and functions of BOAC and BEA are laid down in the Air
Corporations Act i967> which consolidates, with certain exceptions, the
provisions of the Air Corporations Acts 1949 1966, and in the Air Cor¬
poration Act 1969, modified by the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1971
setting up the British Airways Board. This Act requires the BAB to review the
affairs of the corporations, and to report to the Government on its findings. A
report published in July 1972 recommended reorganisation with a view to
closer integration of the group’s activities. Reorganisation is expected to
involve several of the subsidiaries of the corporations becoming instead sub¬
sidiaries of BAB.
Total capacity-ton-miles offered on all services by British airlines has more
than trebled since 1959, and had risen to 4>77^ million capacity-ton-miles in
1971. In 1955, 2-5 million passengers entered or left Britain by air, compared
with 5’7 million who arrived or departed by sea; in 1962 there were for the
first time more air than sea passengers, and by 1971 figures had risen to
24-9 million by air and 11-7 million by sea.
BOAC is engaged on long-haul operations. Its scheduled services link Britain
with continental Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia, Africa and
North and South America, and it also provides complete round-the-world
services. It co-operates closely with airlines of several other Commonwealth
countries; it also has financial interests in seven companies operating local and
regional services in the various parts of the world adjacent to BOAC s main
routes, and in a number of hotel companies in areas attractive to business and
holiday travellers.

The capacity offered on BOAC’s own scheduled services reached 2,325
million capacity-ton-miles in the year ended March 1972 having risen by
17-8 per cent over the previous year. Nearly half of this capacity was on the
western routes to North and South America. The overall load factor in
1971-72 was 47-8 per cent; the break-even load factor (the figure at which
operating costs are covered) was 47-4 per cent. The corporation’s fleet, made
up entirely of pure jets, consists (June 1972) of Super VC 10s (16), VC 10s
(11), Boeing 707-436S (16), Boeing 707-336$ (11); and 12 Boeing 747s with
another one on order. Five Concordes are to be ordered, for service from 1975.
The Boeing 747, introduced into service in 1971, and the VC 10, introduced
into service in 1964, operate alongside Boeing 707s on world-wide routes.
Cargo versions of the Boeing 707 took over transatlantic all-freighter operations
in 1966.
The corporation is making a substantial investment over a period of ten
years in one of the most advanced airline computer systems in the world
(BOADICEA). Applications include seat reservations, departure, cargo, and
stock control, message switching, payroll and costing.
In 1971-72 BOAC earned an operating surplus of ^2 million and a net loss of
£1-4 million after interest on borrowings and taxation. Of its gross traffic
revenue (£212 million), £140 million was earned in foreign currencies.
BEA and its associates operate services to some 100 destinations in 35 countries
in Britain and the rest of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Its
services in Britain include a number which cannot be operated on a commercial
basis but which meet a vital social need, mainly the services to the Highlands
and Islands of Scotland. BEA also co-operates with other airlines in order to
create ‘through travel’ facilities. It has a financial interest in several associated
companies, most of which collaborate with BEA in providing a network of
services. Two major subsidiaries are British Air Services, operating secondary
domestic services, and BEA Airtours Ltd.
For the year ended 31st March 1972 the increases in capacity offered and
passenger-miles flown on scheduled services were 11 per cent and 7 per cent
respectively over the previous year; freight-ton-miles flown rose by 6-2 per
cent. In the same year some 9-1 million passengers were carried.
BEA’s fleet consists (March 1972) of BAC One-Elevens (18), Trident Threes
(17 with 9 on order); Trident Twos (15), Trident Ones (21), Viscounts (20),
Vanguard 951s (4), Vanguard 933s (6) and Herons (2). BEA is converting the
Vanguard aircraft into the Merchantman used solely for freight, of which 8 are
now in service. The first Merchantman service opened in February 1970.
In 1971-72 the corporation earned over £178 million in revenue and made a
net profit of ,£181,000.
Although the two State corporations had a statutory monopoly up to 1961
there has been a significant expansion in recent years not only of the number
of passengers and volume of freight carried but also in the diversity of services
operated by the independent operators. As well as domestic and international
services they provide vehicle ferry services; specialised cargo facilities; and
enable travel agents to offer low-cost all-in holidays abroad. The independent
companies compete with BEA over several domestic routes, including the
busiest internal route in Europe, from London to Glasgow. In 1971 they
carried some 2-4 million passengers on scheduled services. British Caledonian
Airways, the ‘second force’ airline, has a fleet of some 30 aircraft, used on
360 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
chartered and scheduled passenger and freight services, and carries some
780,000 scheduled service passengers a year. It was formed in 1970 by a merger
of British United Airways and Caledonian Airways. The Government intends
British Caledonian to continue as the principal independent scheduled airline,
and the CAA is required in exercising its licensing functions to provide it with
adequate opportunities to build up its route networks.
In addition to the public transport operators there are a large number of
companies engaged in miscellaneous aviation activities such as crop-spraying,
aerial survey and photography, and flying instruction. About 30 companies
carry out air-taxi operations.
The proportion of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air is increasing steadily.
In 1956, 17 per cent of imports and 2-9 per cent of exports (by value) were
carried by air. In 1971 the corresponding percentages were 14 in both, and
the total value of exports, imports and re-exports by air was £2,646 million.
The chief export items are expensive machinery and parts, aircraft and vehicle
parts, and electrical and electronic products; furs and skins account for a large
proportion of the total value of re-exports.
Air Freight Recent rapid growth in freight traffic, especially at Heathrow airport, London,
was checked in 1971, due to unfavourable economic conditions, but the total
still amounted to over 530,000 metric tons, 329,000 tons of it at Heathrow.
Scheduled services of British airlines handled some 238,000 tons in I971-
Overseas
Trade by Air
Private Flying The estimated number of aircraft on the United Kingdom register used for
business and private purposes is over 1,000, while approximately 860 are
owned by clubs, groups and training schools. About 15,000 private pilots hold
licences. About 130 companies use private aircraft and some 80 companies are
members of the Business Aircraft Users’ Association. There are some 4,000
glider pilots.
Aerodromes The Civil Aviation Authority has a general responsibility for licensing civil
aerodromes. It controls directly Aberdeen and eight small aerodromes in the
Highlands and Islands of Scotland. Aerodromes which are municipally or
privately owned and which are used for the public transport of passengers and/
or flying instruction are subject to licensing, inspection and regulation by the
authority, which is also responsible for navigation facilities at a number of
main municipal airports.
The British Airports Authority (BAA), an independent statutory body
operating on a commercial basis, took over on 1st April 1966 the ownership and
management of London’s two major airports (Heathrow and Gatwick),
Prestwick in Scotland and Stansted in Essex. In April 1971 ^ t0°k over
Edinburgh airport. At these airports the Civil Aviation Authority is responsible
for the provision of navigation services; the Department of Trade and Industry
directs the BAA to take measures to control noise and vibration.
There are approximately 140 civil aerodromes in Britain; in addition, 50
Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under civil control include
9 directly controlled by the Civil Aviation Authority, 3 Channel
Islands and 1 in the Isle of Man administered by the local island governments,
and 41 aerodromes licensed for public use, of which 22 are owned by munici¬
palities. Most of the remainder are owned privately. Two of the CAA’s aero¬
dromes and 32 others are designated customs airports; limited customs facili¬
ties are available at a further 36 aerodromes.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 361
A third London airport is to be built at Maplin, on the Essex coast; the first
runway should be in use by 1980.
Aircraft and passenger movements at the principal airports have risen very
markedly in recent years, and in 1971 United Kingdom civil airports handled
36 million passengers. The number of movements of aircraft engaged on
commercial transport operations was 630,000.
For international scheduled services Heathrow and Gatwick are the main
airports, and Heathrow is the busiest centre of international travel in the
world. The number of passengers handled at Heathrow, 14 miles (22 kilo¬
metres) west of central London, has increased from 5-4 million in i960 to
16-4 million in 1971 of which most were international passengers. The
shorter of the two main Heathrow runways was extended to 12,800 feet (3,900
metres) in 1971. An £11 million passenger terminal primarily for British
short-haul airlines and Aer Lingus was completed in 1969, and extensions
have been made to several other buildings. To accommodate the rapid
expansion expected in freight movements, £25 million has been invested in
a new cargo terminal and associated developments, which came into use in
1969. New facilities costing some ^13 million have been provided for handling
Boeing J4J (jumbo jet) aircraft, which began to use the airport early in 1970.
Work is proceeding on the extension of London’s Underground railway to
Heathrow. The London Airport Cargo Electronic-data-processing scheme
(LACES) came into full operation at Heathrow in 1971, making Britain the
first country to control incoming cargo by computer.
The airport at Gatwick, 28 miles (45 kilometres) south of London, was
opened in June 1958 as the second airport for the London area. Built along¬
side the main London to Brighton railway and the A23 road, Gatwick airport
was the first in the world to contain road, rail and air transport in one unit.
In 1971 it handled 4-7 million passengers. The existing runway has been
extended; a further extension is under consideration.
A privately owned helicopter terminal (or ‘heliport’) is in operation at
Battersea on the south bank of the Thames.
Prestwick airport in Scotland has been developed to accommodate large
jet aircraft. Already one of the best equipped freight airports in the world, a
new cargo terminal is being built there. The airport at Abbotsinch, owned and
run by the Glasgow Corporation, handled i-8 million passengers in 1971.
A new main runway and other improvements are planned for Edinburgh.
Luton airport handled 2-7 million and Manchester airport handled 2-2 million
passengers in 1971; while Belfast handled over a million passengers. Birming¬
ham, Edinburgh, Prestwick, Stansted and Liverpool each handled over
500,000.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides postal, public telecommunications,
data processing and Giro services. It was set up as a public authority under the
Post Office Act 1969, having previously been a government department.
The Post Office is headed by a chairman and board, appointed by and respon¬
sible to the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications. It has some 420,000
employees and approaching 25,000 post offices.
The Post Office has authority to borrow up to £2,800 million. At 31st March
1972 it had borrowed £2,460 million. Over 90 per cent of total expenditure

on fixed assets is accounted for by telecommunications. The postal, tele¬
communications and data processing services are now managed separately.
Approaching 10,550 million items of correspondence and 189 million parcels
are carried annually by the inland postal services. An increasing amount of
correspondence is sent by air, reaching 418 million items in 1971-72; 2-6
million parcels were sent by air in that year.
New highly mechanised sorting office buildings are being opened in Britain.
Letter segregating and facing machines have been installed at over 30 centres.
Postal address coding (Postcode) has been introduced. Some £50 million is
being invested in an improved parcels service.
A ‘Datapost’ special delivery service for computer data and important
packages was started in 1970; it has been expanded to provide some 5,000
services each week.
The British Postal Consultancy Service offers professional advice on all
aspects of postal business to overseas administrators and to business organisa¬
tions. Subjects covered include management methods and systems, postal
circulation systems, containerisation, planning of buildings and mechanisation.
Work was done in 1971-72 for ten overseas postal administrations.
At the post office counter, besides making use of its postal and telegraph
facilities, a person can draw a pension or a family allowance, buy a licence for
his dog, a licence for his television receiving set, renew a car licence, buy
national insurance stamps, use the savings and investments facilities (see p.
214) and the money transmission services of the National Giro. In much of its
counter service the Post Office acts as agent for government departments and
local authorities.
Britain has one of the most up-to-date telegraph systems in the world and gives
direct connection between any of the 320 or so larger telegraph offices. The
international telegraph services were shared until 1950 between the Post
Office and Cable and Wireless Ltd. This company was brought into public
ownership in 1947. The Post Office operates all telegraph services from Britain
except those offered by foreign telegraph companies. Cable and Wireless Ltd.
continues to operate its cable and wireless services in many dependencies and
foreign countries.
Telegraph services to countries overseas are operated from Electra House in
London, the world’s largest overseas telegraph office, and from eleven other
London and provincial area telegraph offices. Direct connection via the Centex
system between these British offices and the larger towns in Belgium, France,
Federal Republic of Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Italy and Norway
minimises delivery delay. In addition, the Post Office is well to the fore in the
development of telegraph message relay techniques for services beyond Europe.
The Telex Service combines the speed of the telephone with the accuracy of
the printed word. Calls may be made direct between the rapidly increasing
number of telex users in Britain (about 38,000 by the end of 1971) and als0 to
well over 400,000 subscribers throughout the world. Britain is linked to over
170 countries by telex. The United Kingdom telex service is fully automatic
and immediate connection is made by direct dialling to any subscriber within
the country, and to many subscribers in Europe, New Zealand, the United
States, Canada, Australia and South Africa. Calls to countries without an auto¬
matic service are connected through the International Telex Exchange in

London. International telex traffic is growing annually by about 20 per cent;
the Post Office is planning for a system of about 100,000 United Kingdom
subscribers by 1980. A radioteleprinter service extends the use of telex to ships
at sea (see p. 365).
The demand for facilities enabling digital data for computers to be transmitted
over telephone and telegraph lines has greatly increased; to meet it the Post
Office has developed a range of datel services providing for transmission at
speeds of up to no bits per second over telegraph-type circuits and up to
2,400 bits per second over speech-type circuits. Speeds of 48,000 bits per
second can be accommodated by special arrangement. Most of the datel
facilities are available internationally and over telegraph or speech-type
circuits. In the year ending March 1972 the number of British Post Office datel
terminals amounted to some 19,000.
At the end of March 1972 there were 6,167 l°cal telephone exchanges and
nearly 15 million telephones. During 1971-72 1-3 million new lines were in¬
stalled. All London’s exchanges are now automatic. Trunk dialling by sub¬
scribers (STD) began in Bristol in 1958; by March 1972 the facility had been
extended to 3,861 exchanges, serving 93 per cent of subscribers, all of whom
should have STD by 1974.
Hull Corporation is the only municipality to exercise its option of operating
its own service under licence from the Postmaster General; this service is
connected to the Post Office trunk network.
The first operational electronic exchange in Europe was opened at Amber-
gate, Derbyshire, in 1966. There are now over 100 such exchanges in Britain.
Large electronic exchanges with capacities of up to 40,000 lines are due to come
into service in major cities by the mid-1970s.
Pulse code modulation systems are being used to increase the circuit
capacity of lines on short-distance routes between exchanges. Over 2,640
should be installed by the end of 1972. A new time-division electronic
switching system for interconnecting routes equipped with pulse code modu¬
lation systems has been used experimentally. Research is proceeding into a
new digital transmission and waveguide system to increase capacity.
International subscriber dialling operates from London, Edinburgh,
Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester, and to most of western
Europe and the United States. Britain has two automatic international
telephone exchanges in use and a third under construction. It is expected that
by 1975 75 per cent of international calls will be dialled by the subscriber,
compared with 62 per cent in 1971.
Operator-connected calls are handled at London international exchanges,
from which almost 3,000 direct telephone circuits provide service to European
countries. Direct links via transatlantic and Commonwealth cable networks,
communications satellites and high frequency radio provide service to over 50
countries outside Europe. Almost every country can be reached from the
international exchanges, via intermediate points where necessary.
A radio tower, 620 feet (189 metres) high, in London provides microwave
radio links for carrying long-distance telephone and television circuits. There
are over 100 Post Office communications masts and towers in use, including a
tower of 500 feet (152 metres) in Birmingham.
Several specialised services are available by telephone, including the ‘999*
emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected as quickly

as possible, and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade
services. A public radiotelephone service operating in London and south
Lancashire enables users of vehicles fitted with suitable equipment to make
or receive calls to or from any telephone in the United Kingdom network.
Recorded information services include: the speaking clock, weather forecasts,
motoring information, recipes, ‘Test match’ cricket scores, Financial Times
share index and business news summary, and ‘Dial a Disc’. In London a
recorded service provides details in five languages of events taking place, and
a similar service, in English only, is provided in Edinburgh during the summer.
There are over 100,000 private circuit stations not connected with the public
exchange networks. These are associated with circuits rented for private use
for telephone conversations, teleprinter connections, photo-telegraphy, tele¬
vision, music, or for the transmission of signals which represent data for
computers or operate other devices.
There are some 385 underwater cables in the national network, totalling over
2,000 miles (3,218 kilometres). To help meet rapidly expanding demand for
communications between Britain and the continent of Europe three new
submarine cables with capacities exceeding 1,200 circuits have been brought
into service recently and six more will be added over the next four years.
Cable systems using transistors in place of thermionic valves have been
developed by British manufacturers in consultation with the Post Office
Research Station and are used in many new systems. A comprehensive
Commonwealth telephone cable plan was agreed upon in 1958 and carried out
by Cable and Wireless Ltd. in co-operation with the Post Office. The plan
covered the construction of three long-distance telephone cable systems:
CANTAT 1 (2,100 nautical miles), from Scotland to Canada, was opened in
1961; COMP AC (8,130 nautical miles), connecting Canada, Hawaii, Fiji, New
Zealand and Australia, opened in 1963; and SEACOM (7,070 nautical miles),
connecting Australia, New Guinea, Guam, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singa¬
pore, was completed in stages from 1965 to 1967. The submarine cables are
linked overland across Canada and Australia by radio microwave systems.
CANTAT 1 was the first single-cable ocean telephone system to use the new
lightweight cable and rigid two-way repeaters, both developed by the Post
Office.
Since CANTAT 1 was laid between Britain and Canada telephone calls
have risen sevenfold. CANTAT 2, for which a contract was announced in June
1971, will double telephone links across the Atlantic, with its 1,840 circuits.
It will cover 2,700 nautical miles between Cornwall and Nova Scotia.
The Goonhilly satellite communication earth station in Cornwall was brought
into operation in 1962, and took part in the first experiments in satellite
communications using the Telstar and Relay satellites. The station now
provides commercial telephone and television circuits via high-capacity, geo¬
stationary satellites positioned over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. By May
1972 Britain had satellite links with 35 countries via 29 earth stations. A third
large aerial at Goonhilly came into service in August 1972. The satellites
used in the global communications systems are provided by INTELSAT
(International Communications Satellite Consortium) of which Britain is the
second largest shareholder. The number of satellite circuits used by Britain,
30 at the end of 1965, is expected to reach 770 by the end of 1972.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Radio
Communica¬
tions with
Ships at Sea
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post
Office has 11 coast radio stations in the United Kingdom which provide
radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea at
ranges of up to some 500 miles (805 kilometres) and 250 miles (402 kilometres)
respectively. There is also the long-distance radiotelegraph and radio¬
telephone station, Portishead Radio, which communicates with ships in all
parts of the world. Traffic handling capacity is being increased under a six-
year modernisation programme due for completion in 1974.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with
safety of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radio¬
telegraph and radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or
aircraft and take immediate action to obtain assistance for any vessel in
distress. During 1971-72 the stations handled 796 urgency and distress calls.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange
radiotelegrams with ships and connect radiotelephone calls between telephone
subscribers ashore and suitably equipped ships; they also broadcast naviga¬
tional warnings and weather bulletins.
The stations operate a free medical advice service whereby the master of a
ship of any nationality may obtain advice from appropriate medical authorities
on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard ship. During
1971-72, 458 medical cases were dealt with in this service.
Data
Processing
Service
Since the Post Office in 1957 set up an installation to process payroll, pensions
and statistical work, it has become one of the largest users of automatic data
processing equipment and techniques in Britain. Its computer organisation is
divided into two parts: the Post Office Data Processing Service for its own
internal services, and the National Data Processing Service for services to
business firms and other external users.
In addition to stock control and telephone billing, computer systems are
used for large-scale document and information retrieval systems, the Giro
system, scheduling of mail vans in London, the LACES import-handling
system at Heathrow airport (see p. 361), and control of revenue collection from
television licences. In its 14 regional computer centres the Post Office Data
Processing Service operates over 30 computers and is processing over 120
projects. Techniques and equipment employed by the staff of over 3,500, of
whom some 650 are systems analysts and programmers, include optical and
magnetic ink character reader/sorters; direct keying of data on to discs and
magnetic tapes; and the direct recording of data from magnetic tapes to micro¬
film.
‘Confravision* The world’s first purpose-built system of conferences by television, ‘Confra-
vision’, was introduced by the Post Office in September 1971. Using Post
Office video circuits the service allows private communication between studios
in London, Birmingham, Bristol, Glasgow, and Manchester.
Research The Post Office is spending over £18 million a year on research and develop¬
ment, in collaboration with industry and the universities. A new £8 million
research centre is being built at Marti esham Heath, Suffolk, to replace
eventually the laboratories at Dollis Hill.
16 EMPLOYMENT
The Department of Employment is principally responsible for industrial
relations, pay policy, employment, training and related manpower questions
(see p. 51). In Northern Ireland employment matters are among the
responsibilities of the Ministry of Health and Social Services.
MANPOWER
The total working population of Great Britain at the middle of June 1971 was
24-8 million, about 46 per cent of the total population, and included some 73
per cent of people of normal working age (15 to 59 years for women, 15 to 64
years for men). About 90 per cent of the men of working age are today in or
seeking gainful work. The remaining 10 per cent consist mainly of those con¬
tinuing their education, of the severely disabled and of some people of private
means. The proportion of women of working age in or seeking gainful work
is much lower, about 54 per cent, as many housewives do not undertake paid
employment outside the home. Nearly 63 per cent of the women at work are
married. Besides those of normal working age, there are over a million older
men and women still at work. The great majority of the working population
work for a wage or salary, but about 1 -7 million are employers or self-employed.
Northern Ireland, which has 2-8 per cent of the total population of the
United Kingdom, has 2-3 per cent of its working population. The ratio of
working to total population in Northern Ireland is about 38 per cent, and
farmers and smallholders working their own holdings account for about one-
twelfth of the working population.

rising demand for higher education, the working population is unlikely to
increase much above the 1966 levels before the mid-1970s, even if the demand
for labour were as high as in 1966. The raising of the minimum school-leaving
age in 1972-73 is expected to result in a sharp fall in the working population
during the following year.
Though successful development policies in the less prosperous regions may
raise the working population above the levels forecast, any increasing demand
for labour must in general be met by better deployment of manpower, im¬
proved productivity and more training. Non-employed married women form
the only substantial reserve and the Government is studying how to overcome
the obstacles hindering the employment of married women who are willing to
work.
The industrial distribution of employees is shown in Table 35. Of all employees
about 40 per cent are employed in the manufacturing and mining industries
and only about 1 -6 per cent in agriculture and fisheries. Over 57 per cent of
those in manufacturing are in the metal, engineering, vehicles and chemicals
groups of industries.
Most industries employ women as well as men though not always for the
same types of work; for example, few women are managers and few personal
secretaries are men. It is illegal to employ women in certain jobs, such as

underground work in coal mines. Women are chiefly employed in the food,
drink and tobacco industries; the manufacture of electrical goods, textiles and
clothing; the distributive trades; the financial, professional, scientific and
miscellaneous services; and public administration.
The numbers given in Table 35 as working in an industry or service include
those engaged on administrative, technical and clerical work, so that the totals
given for the production industries are greater than the numbers on productive
processes. It is estimated that in April 1972 in manufacturing industries in
Great Britain 27 per cent were administrative, technical and clerical em¬
ployees (the ratio ranged according to industry from 13 per cent in clothing
to 40 per cent in chemicals and allied industries).
As an aid to government manpower policies the Department of Employment
maintains a continuing study of manpower resources and requirements by
occupation over a period of five to ten years ahead for both the whole economy
and for some particular industries and occupations.
The Department of Employment also co-operates with industrial training
boards (see p. 372) on technical problems of forecasting. Its forecasts are
designed to help with industrial and manpower planning, recruitment, training
and careers advice.
Unemployment The general unemployment rate in Britain as a whole was among the lowest in
the world during the 20 years prior to 1967—usually between 1 and 2 per cent
—but has been rising since then. It has been relatively low in the south-east of
England, and consistently higher in those parts of the country which have the
greatest dependence on shipbuilding, coalmining, and certain branches of the
heavy engineering and metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scot¬
land and Wales, and north-east England and Merseyside. These areas have
been the subject of a series of measures of selective assistance to stimulate
industrial expansion; and counter-measures have been taken to limit expansion
in areas of manpower shortage (see p. 262). The general unemployment rate in
Great Britain in July 1972 was 3-6 per cent; the areas with the highest rates
were Merseyside, Wales and Scotland.
Northern The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
Ireland self-employed but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was about 598,300 in
March 1972 (390,600 males and 207,700 females). The number of insured
employees was 523,700* The largest productive industries are agriculture,
engineering, textiles and clothing. Most of the agricultural work in Northern
Ireland is done without hired help.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In July 1972 ^ was ^"7 Per cent °f insuied
employees. The Northern Ireland Ministry of Commerce has wide powers
(similar to those in Great Britain) to assist the development and diversification
of industry. It is using these powers vigorously in an attempt to improve the
situation (see p. 264).
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES
The main government employment services are provided in Great Britain
through the country-wide network of local employment offices of the Depart¬
ment of Employment. The services in Northern Ireland are run on similar
lines by the Ministry of Health and Social Services but there are some varia¬
tions related to the much smaller area of administration.

The employment offices provide a comprehensive service for employers
needing staff and for people, whether or not already in employment, seeking
jobs. Information and advice on any employment problem is available to all.
Use of the service is voluntary. Employers and individuals alike remain free
to use general or specialised fee-charging private employment agencies and
direct recruitment by advertisement or personal introduction.
The employment offices handle the full range of occupations and deal with
full-time, part-time and temporary vacancies. Details of unfilled vacancies (or
of people seeking jobs) can be circulated quickly in the ‘travel to work’ area,
or more widely if necessary. Local employment committees, on which em¬
ployers, workers and other local interests are represented, are attached to the
employment office network as advisory bodies to secure the full benefit of local
knowledge and the close co-operation of employers and workers.
A commercial employment service (office and shop work) is available at all
employment offices and also at a number of commercial employment offices. In
the hotel and catering industry a specialist service is based on the Hotel and
Catering Trades Exchange in London.
The Regular Forces Resettlement Service, in which the Department of Em¬
ployment collaborates with the Ministry of Defence and the voluntary organisa¬
tions concerned with ex-regulars, helps members of the Forces to achieve a
satisfactory transition to civilian life.
In areas where there are large groups of hospitals, there are specially trained
officers in the employment service to deal with the employment problems of
nurses, midwives and those in related occupations or who wish to enter those
professions. Elsewhere nursing employment work is done as part of the general
employment service.
Special teams of Department of Employment officials plan the redeployment
of large groups of redundant workers to new jobs.
The Professional and Executive Register provides a recruiting service for pro¬
fessional occupations, general administrative, managerial and executive cate¬
gories, and for technical and scientific posts. The service is available at offices
located in the main centres of population.
The Occupational Guidance Service is available in 44 centres of population. It
is available free to anybody over the age of 18 who has left school and who
wishes to take expert advice before choosing or changing his occupation.
The Youth Employment Service in Great Britain is available to all young
people up to the age of 18, or older if they are still at school. Its main functions
are to work with careers teachers in schools in providing young people and
their parents with information on educational and employment opportunities;
to give vocational guidance to young people in their later years at school; to
help young people to find suitable employment and employers to find suitable
workers; and to follow up the progress of young people in employment and
give them any further help or advice they may need. The Secretary of State for
Employment has responsibility for the service and is advised by a National
Youth Employment Council. Central administration is the responsibility of
the Central Youth Employment Executive which consists of senior officers of
the Department of Employment and the education departments.
Local education authorities have the option of operating the service in their

own areas. Where an authority provides an approved scheme, 75 per cent of its
expenses is reimbursed from state funds. Some 143 local authorities covering
approximately 80 per cent of the school population operate the service based
on their own careers offices. In the remaining parts of the country the service
is provided from careers offices of the Department of Employment.
In Northern Ireland the functions of the Youth Employment Service are
similar to those in Great Britain but its organisation is different in that the
service is operated by a statutory board composed of representatives of local
education authorities and other educational and industrial interests.
The Disablement Resettlement Service is designed to help disabled people
to get and keep suitable work. It is available to anyone over school-leaving age
who is substantially handicapped. The Department of Employment is
responsible for the administration of the service and is assisted by the National
Advisory Council on the Employment of the Disabled.
Vocational guidance and help in finding employment is given at local offices
by specialised disablement resettlement officers (DROs) who, where necessary,
arrange for a course of industrial rehabilitation or training or both. A Register
of Disabled Persons is maintained and all employers of 20 or more persons are
required to employ a quota (at present 3 per cent for all industries, except
shipping in respect of the manning of ships) of registered disabled persons.
Industrial rehabilitation is provided at 25 units (including one combined
medical/industrial rehabilitation unit) run by the Department of Employment.
Attendance at a unit is voluntary and maintenance allowances are paid. The
Department of Employment also gives financial assistance to seven voluntary
and other organisations operating eight rehabilitation centres.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government
Training Centres (see p. 372), educational institutions and employers’ estab¬
lishments. For the more seriously disabled there are special residential training
colleges run by voluntary organisations with the help of the Department of
Employment. Grants are available to disabled people qualified to undertake
study or training for professional or comparable employment.
Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making company, partly supported by public
funds, provides sheltered employment for over 7,600 registered severely dis¬
abled people who are unlikely to obtain work except under special conditions.
The Department of Employment helps local authorities and voluntary
organisations with the cost of providing facilities for sheltered employment for
2,860 severely disabled sighted workers and for 2,650 blind workers.
Plans for reorganising and modernising the employment service were announ¬
ced in December 1971. These include the setting-up of a self-managing
departmental agency within the Department of Employment to administer the
employment service; a rapid increase in the number of ‘self-service employ¬
ment offices; a separate management for the Professional and Executive
Register; an expansion of the Occupational Guidance Service; changes in the
structure of the Youth Employment Service, so that local authorities could in
general become responsible for all those still in education outside the uni¬
versities ; the reorganisation of the service for the disabled; and the increasing
use of computers and other modern equipment and techniques, particularly as
an aid for matching the requirements of jobs and job seekers and for vacancy
circulation.
As part of the policy of assisting geographical mobility of labour within
Britain to balance resources and demands, the department also makes grants

and allowances to help with costs of fares, temporary lodging and acquisition
of and removal to a new home, in specified instances. They are available to
unemployed workers moving to new employment, and therefore settling, in
another area; to key workers transferred by a firm into a development or inter¬
mediate area to inaugurate a new plant; and to local unemployed workers
recruited to new plants in areas of high unemployment and sent to the parent
works for preliminary training.
The Government offers incentives specifically to encourage industrial expan¬
sion and thereby increase employment in the assisted areas (see p. 262). The
incentives include grants towards the cost of new building and equipment and
wage and salary costs; training grants (see p. 373); and a regional employment
subsidy. Some of this assistance is tied to the creation of more jobs.
In general, people coming to Britain for employment (including Common¬
wealth citizens who do not have the right of abode, see p. 12) need a work
permit issued by the Department of Employment. This must be obtained by
the prospective employer and issued for a specific job and for a fixed initial
period not exceeding 12 months. People admitted may change their jobs with
the approval of the department and normally their stay is extended if they
remain in approved employment. After four years’ approved employment
conditions of admission may be cancelled; a worker’s stay is then no longer
subject to a time limit and he may change employment without restriction. The
issue of work permits is controlled by the department in the light of the
availability of suitable manpower from the resident population and subject to
certain conditions regarding wages.
Nationals of the European Economic Community countries do not require
permits (see below) but for other foreign men permits are issued only for
skilled work in industry and commerce. Subject to an annual quota, unskilled
and semi-skilled may, however, be admitted for work in the hotel and catering
industry. Single men, and married men coming for joint employment with
their wives, are admitted for resident domestic work but permits are not issued
to those known to have dependants. Foreign nationals may also enter Britain
as student employees on a short-term basis to enable them to improve their
English and widen their experience.
Permits for Commonwealth citizens are generally issued only to those holding
professional or other specialised qualifications, skills or abilities, and to those
coming to do work considered valuable to the country. Commonwealth
citizens are also admitted for limited periods (fixed in advance) for in-service
training.
In Northern Ireland employment permits are required for non-Northern
Ireland workers. Legislation defines Northern Ireland workers and makes
certain occupations exempt.
Under the European Communities’ regulations regarding the free movement
of workers, which Great Britain is due to implement on 1st January 1973,
nationals of member countries may, without special permission, enter the
territory of another member state to look for or to take a job already arranged.
In Northern Ireland there will be a transitional period of about five years before
this applies.
Britain, as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, participates with 13 European countries in the arrangements for
assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain employment in other
member countries.

INDUSTRIAL TRAINING
Most industrial and commercial training has always been carried out by indivi¬
dual employers, but in recent years the Government has taken a number of
measures based on the economic need to provide trained manpower to sustain
future economic growth and the social need to offer to teach a trade to workers
who missed the chance of an apprenticeship when they left school.
Under the Industrial Training Act 1964 some 27 industrial training boards have
been appointed to be responsible for the quantity and quality of industi ial train¬
ing in the industry concerned; over 15 million employees or about 85 per cent of
those in industry and commerce to whom the Act applies are covered. Each
board raises a levy from undertakings within its scope (small undertakings are
exempted from the levy), and makes grants to those whose training programmes
it approves. Some boards also provide their own training courses, or arrange
for other organisations to provide training. The Department of Employment
meets the initial administrative costs of each board and makes grants towards
certain other expenditure: for example, for capital expenditure on new semi¬
skilled training places in development and intermediate areas. To advise the
Secretary of State on the administration of the Act and on industrial training
questions generally, there is a Central Training Council (CTC) consisting of
employer and trade union members, representatives of nationalised industries,
educationists, selected chairmen of training boards and others with a special
interest in industrial training. It also advises on the running of the Industrial
Training Service (ITS), an independent non-profit-making body sponsored
by the Department of Employment and the CTC. The ITS helps companies,
employers’ associations and industrial training boards in any industry in the
identification of training needs, the formulation of training policy, job analysis
for any occupational categories, training programme design and the assess¬
ment of training effectiveness.
The Government Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS), administered by
the Department of Employment, is intended to meet the training needs of both
employers and individuals. Training is carried out at 54 Government Training
Centres (GTCs) which are within easy reach of the main industrial areas of the
country. Courses are available in over 50 different trades. Most courses last for
six months but a few are longer. Training under the scheme is also provided in
colleges and employers’ establishments. For severely disabled people training
is provided at four residential training colleges run by voluntary organisations
with government financial assistance. Trainees are paid allowances which vary
according to the number of their dependants and their former earnings.
Allowances are substantially higher than unemployment benefit.
Over the next few years the Government plans to expand the scheme
substantially. The range of courses will be made much wider and more training
places will be provided, so that by 1975 not less than 60,000-70,000 people a
year will receive training, thereafter increasing as soon as possible to 100,000.
The Government also offers industry a wide range of training facilities outside
the scope of the TOPS. The Training Within Industry Scheme (TWI) is in¬
tended to develop the skills of supervisors in instructing and communicating,
in improving methods and in preventing accidents. Special courses are avail¬
able for supervisors employed in offices, retail distribution and hospitals, and
also an in-plant training development service to aid selection and further the

training of operatives as instructors. Training officers of the Department of
Employment either give these courses or train employers’ nominees to enable
them to run TWI courses in their own concerns. Other Department of Em¬
ployment training services for employers include courses for operators and
clerks on how to train new employees and training in export office procedures.
In addition, two-week and one-week courses in basic and advanced instruc¬
tional techniques for the training of individual instructors are available to
outside firms (as well as GTC staff) at the Department of Employment’s two
Instructor Training Colleges (one in England and one in Scotland), and at six
Instructor Training Units attached to GTCs. Where the number of instructors
to be trained warrants it, these courses may be conducted on the employer’s
premises. In 1971 about 23,000 people received training under the Department
of Employment schemes for industry.
Vocational training services at GTCs, TWI courses, and courses at In¬
structor Training Colleges are available to trainees from overseas under
approved schemes (for instance, those of the International Labour Organisa¬
tion or technical assistance provided jointly by the Department of Employment
and the Overseas Development Administration of the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office).
The Department of Employment provides additional training aid specifically
for employers in the assisted areas (see p. 262). New and expanding firms may
obtain grants towards the cost of training workers for additional jobs (in 1971
these grants assisted the training of about 50,000 workers), and free depart¬
mental courses for supervisors and industrial training instructors as well as the
loan of departmental mobile instructors to conduct in-plant training. Grants
are also available for any employers who engage and retrain for permanent
employment workers aged 45 and over who have been unemployed for at least
eight weeks. In addition, the department provides grants through the indus¬
trial training boards to promote craft and technician training and to provide
equipment needed for training to semi-skilled level.
In August 1972 the Government announced its intention of setting up a
training services agency within the Department of Employment to administer
the department’s training services, co-ordinate the work of the industrial
training boards, and provide training services in those areas of industry not
covered by the training boards.
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
Though Britain has been a pioneer in the introduction of protective legislation
for the safety, health and welfare of employees and in providing certain legal
immunities for trade unions, until recently there were relatively few legal
restrictions on the right of an employer to hire an employee on any terms which
he would accept and to dismiss him at will. The employee in general looked
to his trade union to protect him. The determination by statute of minimum
wages, holidays and holiday pay was in principle confined to those trades and
industries where the organisation of employers or workers, or both, was inade¬
quate to negotiate collective agreement and to ensure their observance (see p.
382). However, both the 1971 Industrial Relations Act (see below) and other
recent legislation provide considerable safeguards for the employee in his terms
of employment as well as working conditions. The Terms and Conditions
of Employment Act 1959, as amended under the 1971 Industrial Relations
374
Wage Rates
and Earnings
BRITAIN 1973' AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Act, provides machinery for enforcing on an employer the observance of terms
or conditions established by collective agreement in his industry. The Con¬
tracts of Employment Act 1963, also amended by the 1971 Industrial Relations
Act, requires an employer to give an employee comprehensive information on
terms and conditions of employment, including information about his right
to choose whether to belong to a trade union and the procedure available to him
where he has a grievance about his employment; it also lays down the right of
both employers and employees to minimum periods of notice when employment
is to be terminated. Under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1965 and 1969
employees with a minimum period of service of two years are entitled to lump
sum payments if their jobs cease to exist (for example, because of technological
improvements or because of a fall in demand) and their employers cannot offer
suitable alternative work, the cost being partly met from a fund subscribed to
by industry as a whole. The 1971 Industrial Relations Act gives protection
against unfair dismissal by providing machinery under which an employee may
bring an action against an employer for unfair dismissal, and seek re-engage-
ment or compensation; gives new legal support to the right to trade union
organisation by requiring an employer to recognise a trade union in certain
circumstances, and by making it an unfair industrial practice (see p. 382) to
refuse to employ, or to discriminate against, a person because he is a trade
union member; and lays down that written collective agreements between
trade unions or other organisations of workers on the one hand, and employers
or organisations of employers on the other, are to be considered legally binding
unless they contain express provisions to the contrary. The Race Relations Act
1968 (see p. 147) makes it illegal for an employer to discriminate on the grounds
of race, colour or ethnic or national origin in the engagement, dismissal or
employment of workers.
Other legislation prescribes minimum standards of safety, health and welfare
in most places of employment (see pp. 377-81). However, it is recognised that
the causes of many accidents are not amenable to statutory control. Therefore,
voluntary action taken by employer organisations, often in association with
trade unions, is encouraged.
The code of industrial relations practice, which came into effect in February
1972 (see p. 383), interprets industrial relations in the widest sense, offering
guidance not only on procedural matters such as collective agreements and
negotiating machinery but also on good human relations and policies directly
affecting the individual in the performance of his job.
Minimum or standard time rates for the lowest-rated manual workers, as
determined by agreements or by statutory orders, vary between £0-28 and
£0-58 an hour for men and between j£o-2i and ^0-50 for women, although
many employers pay higher rates. Higher rates are also usually paid for shift¬
work and overtime, and weekly earnings may be further increased by piece¬
work rates and other incentive schemes. Piecework rates are of declining
importance in a number of industries, where methods of production tend to
dictate the output of a worker.
On the basis of the latest survey in a series conducted regularly by the
Department of Employment into earnings and hours of work in manufacturing
industries and some non-manufacturing industries throughout Britain, the
average earnings of full-time male adult manual workers in October 1971 were
£0 69 an hour and £30-93 a week. Full-time women manual workers at the
same date earned an average of £0-42 an hour and £15-80 a week.
Minimum time rates for women manual workers tend to be lower than the
EMPLOYMENT
375
EARNINGS, WAGE RATES, RETAIL PRICES,
corresponding male rate, though the gap is gradually closing. Women’s
earnings are markedly lower than those of men, partly because on average they
work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at premium rates, but also because
a smaller proportion of women do skilled work. The Equal Pay Act 197°
provides that from 29th December 1975 a woman doing the same or broadly
similar work to a man will qualify for equal pay and conditions of employment.
Between October 1962 and October 1971 average weekly wage rates in¬
creased by 73 per cent and the average weekly earnings of manual workers,
before tax and national insurance deductions, by 95 per cent. Part of the in¬
crease has been offset by a rise in prices of about 54 per cent and by larger
national insurance contributions and income tax. The trends of earnings, wage
rates, retail prices, wages and salaries per unit of output from 1963 to 1971 are
shown in the diagram above.
Salaries and
Fees
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally
by annual salary, often on a scale carrying annual increases, and such careers
generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher remunera¬
tion. Starting salaries may be in the range of ^800-^1,200 (lower for trainees
376 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in their teens and higher for some graduates entering industry). The average
weekly earnings of full-time non-manual workers in April 1971 were found
by a Department of Employment survey to be about ^39-10 for men and
£19-80 for women. On average, salaries doubled between 1961 and 1971.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
are in the range of £3,000 to £12,000 a year. Ihe posts with salaries in the
range of £10,000 to £25,000 a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, top-
ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions in government depart¬
ments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily newspapers,
some persons outstanding in their professions and in the higher managerial
posts in industry, commerce and banking. A few persons in business draw
still higher salaries, while the earnings of star entertainers and certain other
very successful people exceed £50,000 a year.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices,
administrative posts and professions. As civil servants, Ministers of the Crown,
Members of Parliament, salaried magistrates and solicitors, and in journalism,
broadcasting and architecture they are paid the same salary as men for doing
the same kind of work. Women in independent professions are not expected
to charge lower fees than men. In the private sector generally, however, and
especially in manual work, the principle of equal pay is still exceptional. It will
be enforced under the Equal Pay Act 1970 in all occupations from the end of
1975-
Hours of Work The normal working week in Britain is in the range 39-40 hours for manual
work and 37-38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually worked.
Actual hours worked by men in manual occupations are usually somewhat
longer than their normal hours, on account of overtime; in October 1971 they
were 44-7, compared with 37-7 for women. Men and women in non-manual
occupations generally work little or no overtime, although senior salaried staff
may from time to time be required to work substantial (unpaid) overtime.
National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for women
and young people in a number of industries or trades the maximum, with
limited exceptions, being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day for
6-day-week workers) in premises covered by the Factories Act (see p. 377) f°r
adult women over 18 and young people between 16 and 18; young people under
16 are limited to 44 hours a week. The employment of women and young
people at night is prohibited in industrial undertakings, except for young men
over 16 working in some continuous-process industries (subject to certain
conditions). The Department of Employment can make exemptions from these
restrictions on grounds of public interest. In general the hours of work of
adult men are not restricted by statute.
Holidays with With few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in indus-
Pay and Bank tries covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays
Holidays of at least two weeks and over three-quarters have basic entitlements of at least
three weeks, in addition to public holidays. Non-manual workers generally
have higher entitlements than manual workers. Some agreements, particularly
in the non-manual sector, provide for extended holidays related to length of
service, or status, or both.
Payment is made for public holidays, which are as follows: in addition to
Good Friday and Christmas Day there are public holidays in England and
Wales on Easter Monday, the last Monday in May or first in June, the last
Monday in August or first in September and the first weekday after Christmas

(Boxing Day); and in Scotland on New Year’s Day, the last Monday in May or
first in June and the last Monday in August or first in September.1 Northern
Ireland observes all the English holidays and, in addition, has a holiday on St.
Patrick’s Day (17th March) and on 12th July; the Tuesday after Easter is also
a customary holiday for industry and trade.
A variety of additional benefits exist in varying degree. It has been estimated
that in 1970 15-7 million employees were covered by occupational sick pay
schemes, and about 11*5 million by occupational pension schemes (additional
or complementary to the State schemes, see p. 128). A smaller number are
covered by schemes for redundancy payments above the statutory minimum
(see p. 374). Such benefits are more usual among clerical and professional
employees receiving a standard salary than among manual workers with a
chance to earn overtime and other additions to their pay. Senior members of
firms may use a company car and some firms provide profit-sharing schemes.
The Office of Manpower Economics was established in 1971 as an independent
non-statutory body, with three functions: to act as secretariat for the three
review bodies set up to advise on the remuneration of certain groups in the
public sector for which negotiating machinery is not appropriate, such as
Members of Parliament, the judiciary, the armed forces, and doctors and
dentists; to service enquiries on particular pay structures and related problems;
and to carry out research on more general matters affecting pay and manpower,
either at the request or with the approval of ministers.
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their em¬
ployees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a duty of
care towards each other. In addition, minimum required standards of safety in
certain kinds of workplaces or work are laid down under a number of statutes;
some of these also deal with health and welfare.
A Committee on Safety and Health at Work, appointed by the Government
in 1970, reported in July 1972 and recommended a radical reshaping of the
nation’s occupational safety and health organisation, with streamlined legisla¬
tion to be administered by a single authority.
About 250,000 industrial premises (factories, warehouses, shipyards, docks and
construction sites) come under the Factories Act 1961 (consolidating earlier
legislation), which is administered by the Department of Employment and
enforced by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Factories, which forms part of the
Department of Employment. About 750,000 premises are subject to the Offices,
Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963, which is also administered by the
Department of Employment; enforcement is shared by Her Majesty’s In¬
spectorates of Factories and of Mines and Quarries, and local authorities.
The Acts and regulations made under them are designed to secure the
health, safety and welfare of employees, and deal with such matters as the
fencing of machinery; precautions against fire and special risks; the safe
condition of the premises; and cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventilation.
Anyone intending to employ other people in industrial or commercial premises
to which the Acts apply has to notify the enforcing authority of his intention
before he begins to employ people and every fatal accident and every accident

causing more than three days’ incapacity must be reported. The Factories Act
includes provisions for the compulsory notification and investigation of certain
dangerous occurrences, for precautions against dangerous substances and about
the employment of women and young people.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and quarries
under the Mines and Quarries Act 1954; two statutes are concerned with
agriculture—the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 and the
Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 195^ > &nd specialised
statutes and delegated legislation are concerned with transport—the Railway
Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act 1900, the Merchant Shipping
Acts, the Road Traffic Acts and the Air Navigation Order and Regulations.
As with the Factories Act these other provisions are, with some exceptions,
enforced through inspectorates—the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate (part
of the Department of Trade and Industry, which is responsible for safety
in mines and quarries), the Agricultural Inspectorate of the agricultural
departments, and, for railways, the Railway Employment Inspectorate of the
Department of the Environment. The Department of Trade and Industry is
responsible for administering the Merchant Shipping Acts and for safety in
air transport (most of the powers in respect of airworthiness are delegated to
the Civil Aviation Authority, see p. 356), and the Department of the Environ¬
ment is responsible for road and rail transport safety matters. Safety require¬
ments in hotels, places of entertainment or educational establishments are
covered by the 1971 Fire Precautions Act or (in respect of their offices and
shops) by the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act. The Department of
Employment has no statutory responsibility in regard to safety in workshops
or laboratories in educational establishments, though it keeps in touch with
university authorities and the education departments.
Transport operators and ministries concerned with road and air travel give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every effort is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities by
improving the design of vehicles, transport plant and equipment, by traffic
regulation and control of standards of maintenance and by training crews in
competency and safety awareness.
To safeguard the many interests which might be adversely affected by the
use of chemicals in agriculture and food storage, a voluntary scheme is operated
by the Government with the help of an advisory committee and with the full
co-operation of the chemical industry.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organisation—a Standing Com¬
mittee on Safety, a chief safety engineer, and safety engineers at divisions,
areas and the largest collieries.
The Department of Employment encourages the development of voluntary
central organisation within each industry at national level for the consideiation
of safety matters and the formulation of policy and accident prevention. Its
Factory Inspectorate, besides enquiring into notified accidents and safety
aspects of machine design and specification, circulates expert advice by personal
exhortation, lectures and literature, and encourages the appointment of safety
officers and the formation of works safety committees, and maintains an
industrial health and safety centre in London, at which various types of
machinery demonstrating the effectiveness of guards are displayed, as well as a
wide range of protective clothing and equipment.
Organisations in industry participate also in joint standing and advisory

Union Congress, the Confederation of British Industry, the nationalised
industries and other interests meet on the Industrial Safety Advisory Council
under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State. The Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) and the British Safety Council are two major
national bodies concerned with accident prevention. A number of local
accident prevention groups are affiliated to either RoSPA or the British Safety
Council. These groups serve as forums where questions of industrial safety
can be examined and knowledge of accident prevention exchanged.
Training is important in accident prevention and the Department of Employ¬
ment provides a safety course in its TWI scheme and the industrial training
boards include specific provisions for safety training in their general training
recommendations (see p. 372).
RoSPA provides a variety of safety courses for special needs mainly at its
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham and also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing publicity and organising conferences; its
regional industrial safety officers work to promote safety activity among top-
level managers. The British Safety Council also offers safety training courses.
Other courses are organised by local accident prevention groups and organisa¬
tions such as the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities and
other academic bodies, and government research organisations into problems
of guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards, protective
personal equipment, construction methods, fires and explosions, psychological
factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in particular sectors of
industry. A register of research into industrial health and safety matters has
been compiled by the Department of Employment to give an indication of the
scale and nature of research being undertaken. Industrial research associations
include among their more purely economic research projects the improvement
of working conditions and the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board conducts courses of safety training for workmen
and officials. Its research programme includes a number of projects with a
direct bearing on safety. In addition, the Department of Trade and Industry
has a statutory responsibility for research concerning the safety and health of
coal miners. This responsibility is largely exercised through its Safety in Mines
Research Establishment.
The University of Aston has established a Chair in Safety and Hygiene. The
new department is intended to meet the need for academically trained safety
officers and engineers whose careers will be concerned with the technical
aspects of insurance and forensic work.
Local authorities have power, under the Public Health Acts, to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation at places of work and to treat
workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded as nuisances
the abatement of which can be enforced. Factories, certain other industrial
premises, offices, shops and railway premises must comply with the health and
welfare requirements of the Factories Act or the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act. These include: the cleanliness of workrooms, adequate ventila¬
tion and suitable temperature and lighting, the avoidance of overcrowding and
the provision of sanitary accommodation, and the protection of workers against
inhaling harmful dust or fumes; and the provision of washing facilities, lockers

or other accommodation for outdoor clothing, drinking water, first aid and
seats. Appropriate measures concerning safety in other types of work, for
example, agriculture, are also prescribed.
Legislation, besides forbidding employment of children under 13 years of
age, forbids the employment of children who have not reached the statutory
minimum school-leaving age (see p. 149) in any industrial undertaking; of
women and young people underground in mines and in certain other danger¬
ous occupations (for example, certain processes connected with lead manufac¬
ture); and of women in factories and workshops within four weeks after
childbirth. It also limits and defines the permissible hours of employment for
women and young people (see p. 37b)- Local authorities, moreover, have wide
powers under the Children and Young Persons Acts 1933-63 as well as the
Education Acts 1944-48, to regulate hours and conditions of employment of
children under 15 years within their areas.
There are some 1,500 appointed factory doctors appointed for districts whose
duties include the initial and periodic medical examination of all young people
entering industry, and certain other medical examinations required under the
Factories Act for workers in particular hazardous trades. Some 800 works
medical officers, appointed to the factories in which they are employed, assist
in these duties.
The Medical Services Division of the Department of Employment is
responsible, through its medical advisers, for advising Department of Employ¬
ment employment services such as the Youth Employment Service and the
industrial rehabilitation service on the medical aspects of employment; it also
maintains close liaison with the work of the appointed factory doctors. Its
medical laboratory provides for the investigation of industrial hazards and
undertakes research and development work. The service also arranges epi¬
demiological surveys.
The Employment Medical Advisory Service Act 1972 provides for a new
Employment Medical Advisory Service to replace the appointed factory doctor
service. Its nucleus will be the Medical Services Division of the Department
of Employment, and it will have a staff of about 100 doctors specialising in
occupational medicine who will be based in the country’s main industrial
centres.
Many employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their employees over
and above the statutory requirements. It is estimated that there are about 650
factories with doctors providing full-time medical cover and about 4>300
factories with part-time medical cover. In addition several thousand nurses are
employed in industry. The big employers, including the State and the boards of
nationalised industries, have taken the lead but a number of smaller factories
also provide medical services and in a few cases have joined together in group
medical services. The Secretary of State is advised on measures to further the
development of health services in workplaces covered by the Factories Act by
the Industrial Health Advisory Committee, which includes members nomi¬
nated by the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress,
the nationalised industries, the British Medical Association, the Royal College
of Nursing and other organisations closely concerned with the promotion of
industrial health.
The Factory Inspectorate gives advice on occupational hygiene problems and
has an industrial hygiene unit, with laboratory facilities. There are some six
centres in Great Britain (including the TUC’s Institute of Occupational
Other

Health) which undertake studies of particular problems or health risks and also
carry out routine physical, chemical and biological tests for industry.
Research facilities are provided by government agencies such as the Medical
Research Council; by university faculties of industrial health and social
medicine; and by the research departments of various industries and large
industrial concerns. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory
Inspectorate, which has specialised technical branches.
An increasing number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational facili¬
ties. Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become
usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Many offices
and shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff have
adopted luncheon voucher schemes.
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been
the subject of legislation which, with some exceptions, is similar to that in
Great Britain and is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland) 1965
and the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. Many firms
voluntarily employ safety officers, and an Industrial Safety Group for the area,
supported by representatives of industry, trade unions, insurance companies
and public authorities, makes a valuable contribution in the field of industrial
accident prevention on similar lines to what is done in Great Britain.
Practically all large industrial firms and many small ones now have a personnel
department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the form of
organisation of personnel departments varies, personnel officers are generally
responsible for advising all levels of management on every aspect of labour
relations. They also have particular duties with regard to recruitment, selec¬
tion, education and training, transfer of labour, the application of wage agree¬
ments, the promotion of good communication and consultation and the
supervision of working conditions and employees’ amenities.
Recruitment and promotion policies are matters which each undertaking
decides for itself, although in some industries the decisions may be limited by
collective agreements or by trade practices. Courses are held for training
personnel officers in modern interviewing techniques, including the use of test
procedures.
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting
better human relationships in industry. The Government has sought to extend
by research the available knowledge of the factors influencing human relations
in industry and human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or conducted by
the Social Science Research Council (see p. 402) and the Medical Research
Council (see p. 397). Voluntary organisations include bodies which deal with
management problems and provide a service to subscribing firms; professional
associations, linking individuals with a common interest in particular functions
of management; and bodies providing specialist services, usually on a fee¬
paying basis.
The Conciliation and Advisory Service (formerly the Manpower and Produc¬
tivity Service) of the Department of Employment offers guidance on all
aspects of industrial relations and manpower utilisation. It also offers, where
appropriate, conciliation in industrial disputes and complaints of alleged
infringement of individuals’ rights (see p. 386).

New Legal
Framework
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The structure of labour relations in Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis, and the extensive changes enacted in 1971 are designed to
retain the voluntary principle while modernising the conditions in which it
operates. The system rests mainly on the organisation of employers and
workers into employers’ associations and trade unions. These organisations
discuss and negotiate terms and conditions of employment and other matters
affecting the workpeople at their work. In the past the emphasis has been on
detailed industry-wide agreements supplemented as necessary by local agree¬
ments in firms or factories, but a gradual change of attitudes and structure
has led to more emphasis being placed on formal agreements at firm and
factory level. In some industries, firms and factories, negotiations are con¬
ducted simply by meetings of employers’ and employees’ representatives,
which are held when necessary; in others, voluntary joint councils or com¬
mittees have been established on a permanent basis. The scope of the various
joint bodies—from the national joint industrial councils for whole industries
to the works councils and committees in individual workplaces—varies widely.
Some of them only negotiate. Others discuss a wide range of topics. But the
scope of the bodies is tending to widen and the distinction between discussion
and negotiation to become blurred. Normally these arrangements for collective
bargaining suffice to settle all questions which are raised, but provision is some¬
times made for matters not so settled to be referred for settlement to indepen¬
dent arbitration. Standing arrangements exist for consultation at national level
between the Government, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) (see
p. 383), the Trades Union Congress (TUC) (see p. 385) and the nationalised
industries through the National Economic Development Council on matters in
which employers and workers have a common interest.
In a small and decreasing number of industries and trades where the organisa¬
tion of employers or employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis
for successful voluntary arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating
bodies, known as wages councils. These are composed of equal numbers of
representatives of employers and workers in the respective sectors of industry,
with three independent members. Wages councils may submit proposals for
fixing minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Secretary of State
who must then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals, subject
only to his right to return them as a whole for further consideration by the
councils. The Department of Employment’s Wages Inspectorate helps em¬
ployers and workers to interpret the provisions of wage regulation orders and
sees that they are complied with.
Agricultural wages boards (there are separate boards for England and Wales
and for Scotland) perform similar functions in relation to employment in
agriculture.
The 1971 Industrial Relations Act provides a new legal framework for industrial
relations. The main provisions include the right of an individual to join or
not to join a trade union; protection against unfair dismissal; the presumption
that written collective agreements are legally binding unless otherwise specified,
the granting of new and existing legal privileges to those trade unions and
employers’ associations whose rules and conduct meet the standards laid down
by legislation and who voluntarily register themselves with the Registrar of
Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations; the setting-up of a new system
of expert and informal industrial relations courts to hear complaints about and
adjudicate on unfair industrial practices, with the power to award compensation

and to make restraining orders; the enlarging of the functions of the Commis¬
sion on Industrial Relations (see p. 387), particularly in disputes over procedure
agreements and bargaining agents; and the creation of new emergency powers
which enable the Government to apply to the National Industrial Relations
Court for an order to impose a cooling-off period of up to 60 days or for a
secret ballot of workers in disputes where industrial action is taken or threatened
which could cause an emergency situation. In addition, under the Act the
Government has drawn up a Code of Industrial Relations Practice which gives
guidance on the conduct of industrial relations. The Code is not enforceable,
but compliance or non-compliance with it may be taken into account in any
proceedings under the Act. The TUC (see p. 385) has declined to participate
in the operation of the Act, preferring a voluntary approach to industrial
relations problems, and in 1972 voted to suspend from membership unions
which did not follow its instructions not to register.
Many employers in Britain are members of employers’ organisations wholly
or partly concerned with labour questions. The primary aims of such organisa¬
tions are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions of employment,
including a sound wage structure and proper standards of safety, health and
welfare; to promote good relations with employees and the efficient use
of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes which may
arise.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. A few are purely local in character or deal with a section
of an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole
of a particular industry. In some of the chief industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national federations, while in others,
within which different firms are engaged in making different principal pro¬
ducts, there is a complex structure with national and regional federations for
these different sections of the industry as well as for the industry as a whole.
Although there are some 1,400 employers’ organisations dealing with labour
matters, most of these are local branches of national organisations. There are
over 100 of these, most of which are in membership of the CBI and they
negotiate the national collective agreements for their industry with the trade
unions concerned.
The final authority of a local or small national organisation may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local organisa¬
tions or through regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council or central committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect committees and to
ratify their work. A paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the
organisation’s day-to-day work. There is usually a small working group,
consisting of senior officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal
with urgent questions and co-ordinate the work of committees.
Under the Industrial Relations Act, employers’ associations may seek regis¬
tration (see p. 382).
The central body of employers is the CBI, which deals with all matters (not
only labour relations) affecting the interests of organised employers and
represents them nationally to the Government and the public and also inter¬
nationally, for instance, in the International Labour Organisation and, from
1973, in the various institutions of the European Communities. The majority of
384
Trade Unions
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
national employers’ organisations and nationalised industries and a large num¬
ber of individual companies are affiliated to the CBL Its representatives sit on
various government advisory committees, on other statutory bodies and on
voluntary bodies concerned with labour matters.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over a great many years and, consequently, their
form and organisation vary considerably as do their traditions and attitudes.
Trade unions started more than two hundred years ago among the skilled
craftsmen and spread later to the general labouring and unskilled classes. More
recently trade unionism has increased among clerical, supervisory, technical
and administrative workers. The qualification for membership of some unions
is occupational (for instance, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever
employed), while in others the qualification is industrial (that is, they seek to
recruit all employees in an industry, whatever their occupation). In a number
of unions recruitment is based on a combination of these principles.
Any organisation of workers, whether representing manual, white-collar or
professional workers in one or many companies, may apply for registration as a
trade union under the Industrial Relations Act (see p. 382) provided that: one of
its principal objects is to negotiate with management on pay and conditions of
employment; that it has full control over its own rules and funds; and that it is
not employer-dominated. In addition, an organisation of workers which does
not have as one of its principal formal objects the regulation of worker/employer
relations, and which is prevented in law from formally adopting this as one of
its principal objects because it has received a Royal Charter or is registered as a
limited company, is eligible for entry on a Special Register set up under the
Act, provided that it controls its own rules and funds and is not employer-
dominated. Most organisations on the Special Register are in practice associa¬
tions of professional workers formed primarily for the preservation and
improvement of professional standards, though organisations representing
manual workers which satisfy the above criteria are also eligible.
At the end of 1970 the total membership of British trade unions was about
11 million. There were 481 unions, but over 75 per cent of all trade unionists
were in the 23 largest unions, while more than half were in the nine unions
with a membership of over 250,000. The number of trade unionists has
increased during the last decade but the number of unions has gone down
owing to amalgamations. In Northern Ireland some 90 per cent of trade
unionists are members of unions with headquarters in Great Britain.
The central organisation of most large unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by and responsible to annual conferences of delegates
from local branches. Between conferences, councils are the highest authority
of unions, and carry out policy decisions made by conference delegates. Most
unions also have regional, district and area organisation. At the level of the
individual member there are local branches, covering one or more factories.
Members may attend branch meetings, make suggestions about terms and
conditions of employment, discuss the work of the union, and take part in the
election of the union’s officers. The branch takes action on certain matters
considered to be entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its views on
wider issues for action by the union’s national or regional bodies. The organis¬
ing of members in individual places of work, and the negotiation of local
factory/plant pay agreements with managements, may be done by full-time
district officials of the union or, increasingly, by ‘shop stewards’, who are

Investigation

usually chosen by their fellow members in the place of work to represent them.
Trade unions vary in the degree to which shop stewards are integrated into
their organisation. Where two or more unions have members in the same
workplace, shop stewards committees may be formed to discuss matters of
common concern.
Most trade unions make provision for the payment of benefits to their
members (additional to those payable under the national insurance scheme),
financed out of membership contributions. The benefits may cover sickness,
accidents, and death; superannuation; strike pay and unemployment. Many
trade unions also support the Labour Party financially.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the TUC, which
celebrated its centenary in 1968. The TUC’s objects are to promote the
interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and social
conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises 145 organisations, some
of which are themselves federations of smaller organisations. Together they
represent about 10 million workpeople. The TUC deals with all general
questions which concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and
gives assistance on questions relating to particular trades or industries.
The Congress, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for a week every
year to discuss matters of concern to trade unionists and to employees generally.
It elects annually a General Council which represents it during the remaining
51 weeks of the year. This is responsible for carrying out Congress decisions,
for watching economic and social developments, for providing educational and
advisory services to unions, and for presenting to the Government the trade
union viewpoint on economic, social and industrial issues. It is also empowered
to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain circumstances and its activities in
this sphere were enlarged following a special Congress in June 1969 and subse¬
quent agreement with the Government. The General Council undertook to use
its authority to deal with unauthorised and unconstitutional stoppages of work,
as well as the inter-union and official disputes with which it had dealt previously.
Both the TUC and many unions conduct extensive educational services for
members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade unionism and
industrial relations principles and practice. In 1969, the first ever television
training series was organised by the BBC and TUC.
Branches of various trade unions in a locality generally affiliate to a local
trades council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common
interest and as a local agent of the TUC, by which it is registered each year.
There are just under 500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped
together in 22 federations.
Affiliation to the TUC is open to all trade unions anywhere in the United
Kingdom, but Scottish trade unionists have their own national centre, the
Scottish Trades Union Congress, similar within its objects to the TUC. The
Scottish TUC, to which trade unions may affiliate in respect of their member¬
ship in Scotland (a number of unions are affiliated to both bodies), also accepts
affiliation from trades councils and has an affiliated membership of about
830,000. It holds an annual congress and has consultations with the Govern¬
ment on issues affecting Scottish trade unionists.
Under authority mainly derived from the Conciliation Act 1896 and the
Industrial Courts Act 1919 the Secretary of State has powers to provide
independent conciliation and arbitration as a means of assisting industry to
settle unresolved disputes. These powers are intended to supplement and not
386
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to supersede the industry’s own machinery, and there is no legal obligation
on the parties to an unresolved dispute to notify the dispute to the Secretary
of State for settlement by these means. However, when a dispute is reported,
the Department of Employment may assist the parties to reach a settlement
through conciliation. The Conciliation and Advisory Service (see p. 381)
keeps in constant touch with the course of relations between employers and
workers at all levels. It is also enjoined, under the Industrial Relations Act, in
certain cases, to offer assistance in promoting settlements.
Where both parties agree, disputes may be referred to voluntary arbitration,
either by a single arbitrator, by an ad hoc board of arbitration, or by the
Industrial Arbitration Board, a permanent tribunal established under the
Industrial Courts Act 1919. The board is presided over by an independent
person appointed by the Secretary of State, normally assisted by a member
representing employers and one representing workpeople.
Under the Terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, claims that a
particular employer is not observing the recognised terms or conditions of
employment in his trade or industry may be made to the Secretary of State by
trade unions or employers’ associations registered under the Industrial
Relations Act 1971 which are parties to the relevant agreement or award. If
a claim is not otherwise settled, the Secretary of State must refer it to the
Industrial Arbitration Board which, after hearing the case, may make an
award requiring the employer to observe the recognised terms or conditions.
Such an award becomes an implied term of the contract of employment of
individual employees.
The Secretary of State is also empowered to appoint a court of inquiry or
committee of investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended.
These procedures are primarily means of informing public opinion of the
facts of a dispute (the report of a court of inquiry has to be laid before Parlia¬
ment). Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such bodies
are not binding on the parties, they often provide the basis for further negotia¬
tions leading to a settlement.
Labour While industrial relations in government service and in the nationalised indus-
Relations of tries are, in general, organised on the same principle as in private industry,
Public Authorities there are some special features.
Central and Local Non-industrial employees in central Government service, where salaries and
Government conditions of service are dealt with by the Civil Service Department (see p.
49), are permitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service trade
unions and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and joint consul¬
tation by means of the National and Departmental Whitley Councils (see p. 65).
If there is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a department or association
may, subject to certain limitations, report the dispute to the Secretary of State
for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an independent body
appointed by the Secretary of State by powers under the Industrial Courts Act
1919. Government industrial employers are similarly encouraged to belong to
trade unions and machinery exists for joint consultation. There are four Trades
Joint Councils on which representatives of the Government and the trade
unions sit to consider pay and conditions of employment affecting individual
grades and certain other limited matters. A Joint Co-ordinating Committee,
on which the Government and Trades Joint Councils are represented, deals
with national pay negotiations, conditions of service and other matters of
general application. In the main employing departments there are departmental

Industries

Relations

Disputes

joint councils for the discussion of domestic matters. Disputes on wages or
conditions of employment that cannot be resolved by the existing machinery
can be referred to the Industrial Arbitration Board (see p. 386).
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils for
the main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical em¬
ployees) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other
matters. There are corresponding regional and district councils.
The major nationalised industries have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint con¬
sultation with their employees; in carrying out these duties they are free to
choose suitable arrangements. The main difference from private industry is
that the corporations are not usually members of employers’ associations
(although the majority are ‘public sector members’ of the CBI). In some
industries they are sole or main employers, but even where part of the industry
is in private hands, as for example in road transport, the corporations are
separately and directly represented on wage-negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of management and trade
unions at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local
bodies, similarly representative, to deal with local implications but not nor¬
mally to negotiate separate local agreements. Most of the industries use the
facilities for arbitration offered to industry generally by the Department of
Employment (see p. 385), but coalmining and rail transport have their own
special arrangements. Consultations at all levels, including the workplace level,
have been arranged in all the nationalised industries.
The Commission on Industrial Relations (CIR) was set up as a Royal Com¬
mission in 1969 to examine and make recommendations on questions of
industrial relations referred to it by the Secretary of State for Employment.
Under the 1971 Industrial Relations Act the CIR became a statutory body and
its functions were extended (see p. 383).
Over the past 10 years the number of working days lost each year through
stoppages of work arising from industrial disputes has been on an average
about 5*4 million which, taking the employed population as a whole, works out
at less than a quarter of the working day per worker a year. The time lost
through industrial stoppages is very much less than that lost on account of
sickness, accidents and absenteeism and Britain’s strike record over the past ten
years compares reasonably well with that of most other industrial countries.
Nevertheless Government, industry and trade unions have expressed con¬
cern both at the number of strikes which take place without the backing of
trade union headquarters or without exhausting the agreed or customary
procedures in the industry or workplace, and at the concentration of a high
proportion of these strikes in a limited number of important industries. The
Government hopes that one of the effects of the Industrial Relations Act will be
to help to improve the conduct of industrial relations generally and thereby
reduce the number of strikes.
Northern Ireland has its own system of industrial relations under which
certain powers and responsibilities devolve upon the Labour Affairs Depart¬
ment of the Ministry of Health and Social Services.
17 PROMOTION OF THE
SCIENCES
The Government is the main source of funds for scientific research and
development as a whole though private industry contributes a larger propor¬
tion of funds for civil research and development. Considerable sums are also
provided by public corporations, independent trusts and foundations, and
learned societies. The Government keeps under review facilities for training
scientists and ensures that adequate research is directed to matters of national
interest.

MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
The Pattern of
Expenditure
Total expenditure in Britain on scientific research and development has risen
from £657-7 million in 1961-62, to £1,080 million in 1969-70, while remain¬
ing at about 2-7 per cent of the gross national product at factor cost. The pro¬
portions of total research and development carried out in the various sectors
have not changed appreciably since 1964-65 with the Government (including
the research councils) carrying out 25 per cent and universities and establish¬
ments of further education between 7 and 8 per cent. The proportion of
research and development financed by the Government remained at about 50
per cent in 1967-68, a decline in defence research and development being
balanced by the rise in civil research and development. The total grant-in-aid
to the research councils for 1971-72 is estimated in Public Expenditure to
as about £125 million; an increase to £14! million by I975~7^ was
also provided for (but see below). This represents an annual rate of growth of
3-1 per cent.
Central Advisory
Council for
Science and
Technology
The Central Advisory Council for Science and Technology was established in
January 1967, under the chairmanship of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the
Government, to advise the Government on the most effective national strategy
for the use and development of the country’s scientific and technological
resources. Its membership includes representatives of the Royal Society (see
p. 392), and independent members.
Under the Science and Technology Act 1965 central responsibility for
basic and applied civil science rests with the Secretary of State for Education
and Science, who is advised by the Advisory Board for the Research Councils
(see p. 389). Responsibility for technology rests mainly with the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry. Other government departments are responsible
for research and development related to their executive responsibilities.
New Framework for In July 197^ the Government announced its decision (published in Cmnd 504^ •
Government see Bibliography, p. 483) to extend the customer-contractor approach to all its
Research and applied research and development, as recommended in a report by Lord
Development Rothschild, head of the Central Policy Review Staff (see p. 48). This approach
means that government departments, as customers, define their requirements;
contractors (the research councils or others) advise on the feasibility of meeting
the requirements and undertake the work; and the arrangements between them
must ensure that the objectives remain attainable within reasonable costs. This
decision involves organisational and financial changes affecting departments and

the research councils (see below). Departments concerned have appointed, or
will appoint, Chief Scientific Advisers to co-ordinate their research needs.
Three of the research councils (Agricultural, Medical, and Natural Environ¬
ment Research Councils) will, as from the financial year 1973-74, have part of
the financial provision they receive through the science budget of the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science transferred to the votes of the customer
departments. The total so transferred will rise from fio million in 1973-74
(about a fifth of the total for these three research councils) to £20 million by
r975-76 (just under half).
The Government announced at the same time a new programme of training
and career development to equip scientists and other specialists for posts
primarily concerned with general policy and management.
The following account describes the organisation of science during the
current financial year, with references to the new arrangements to be introduced.
The Department of Education and Science (see also p. 50) is responsible,
among other things, for Government policy regarding the universities and for
promoting civil science throughout Great Britain. The department’s relations
with the universities are conducted through the University Grants Committee
(see p. 158); and its responsibilities for basic and applied civil science are
discharged mainly through the five research councils: the Science Research
Council (see p. 395), the Medical Research Council (see p. 397), the Agricul¬
tural Research Council (see p. 398), the Natural Environment Research
Council (see p. 402), and the Social Science Research Council (see p. 402).
This remains the broad pattern despite the changes described above. Others
may be established under the terms of the Science and Technology Act. The
department also has, in consultation with other departments, general govern¬
mental responsibility for Britain’s scientific space research programme, which
is co-ordinated by the Science Research Council. The department is responsible
for some aspects of international scientific relations (see p. 405), and for
government policy regarding libraries and information systems, including the
Office for Scientific and Technical Information.
The Council for Scientific Policy set up in 1965 was replaced in 1972 by a new
body known as the Advisory Board for the Research Counsils to advise the
Secretary of State on responsibilities for civil science with special reference to
the research council system, the support of post-graduate students and the
proper balance between international and national scientific activities; and on
the allocation of the science budget between research councils and other
bodies; and to promote close liaison between the councils and users of their
research. Its membership includes the chairman or secretary of each of the
five research councils, the chairman of the University Grants Committee,
senior scientists from departments with a major interest in the work of the
research councils, a representative of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the
Government, and independent members drawn from the universities, industry
and the Royal Society of London. One of the independent members is
appointed part-time chairman.
The Department of the Environment (see p. 51) is concerned with research
and development relating to inland transport and ports. Research into road
construction, traffic flow, safety, transport systems and new transport tech¬
nology is carried out mainly at the department’s Transport and Road Research
Laboratory (see p. 349) at Crowthorne, Berkshire. There are also collaborative

arrangements for research in inland transport with the Department of Trade
and Industry. Economic, technical and operational research studies are carried
out also in the headquarters of the department and some are commissioned
from consultants and universities. The department’s Directorate General of
Research and Development (see p. 286) is responsible for the Building Re¬
search Establishment into which were amalgamated in January 1972 the
Building Research Station, the Fire Research Station and the Princes Ris-
borough Laboratory (formerly the Forest Products Research Laboratory). The
building research alone is concerned with the techniques of building design and
construction, and the organisation, productivity and economics of building
work.
The Department of the Environment sponsors certain geographical, geolo¬
gical, economic and sociological research relating to the use and development
of land in England. (Similar arrangements are made in Scotland by the Scottish
Home and Health Department, in Wales by the Welsh Office, and in Northern
Ireland by the Ministry of Development.) The Department of the Environ¬
ment makes grants to the Centre for Environmental Studies, an independent
educational trust which carries out research into the problems of urban plan¬
ning and dealing with the effects of a fast-growing mobile population. The
centre focuses attention on the economic and social aspects of environmental
subjects.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) (see also p. 56), is responsible
for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (AEA) (see p. 399) and
the National Research Development Corporation (see p. 404) and most of the
non-aviation functions of the former Ministry of Technology. The responsi¬
bilities of the DTI include that for civil aviation and the sponsorship of most
industries (excluding aircraft) in both the public and private sectors.
The DTI, among other things, has responsibility for engineering standards
and weights and measures, for the British Standards Institution (see p. 260)
and for the Metrication Board set up in 1969 to facilitate the transition to the
metric system of weights and measures in Britain by 1975 (see P- 457)- ^ ^as
direct control of a number of research establishments (see p. 395); it also aids
with grants autonomous industrial research associations.
The Procurement Executive, Ministry of Defence, undertakes research for
defence purposes at its research and development establishments and through
contracts placed with industry and universities.
Branches of research for which government departments are responsible
include:
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (founded in 1759), together with its 400-
acre estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, Sussex, is administered by the
Ministrv of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and has the largest collection
of living plants in the world. Its research departments are: the herbarium,
concerned primarily with the classification and accurate determination of
plants; and the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study of plant anatomy and plant
physiology, cytology and genetics. There is a seed bank and seed testing unit,
a biochemistry unit under the Agricultural Research Council and a cell
physiology laboratory which has a transmission-electron microscope for
investigating reproductive physiology and the behaviour of certain glandular
cells. Three museums are concerned with public exhibitions and the care of

reference collections of economic plant products. The library, attached to the
herbarium, was founded in 1852; it consists of more than 100,000 botanical
books, about 140,000 reprints and separately issued items and a collection of
over 160,000 drawings and paintings of plants. The Oxford Botanic Garden,
founded in 1621, is the oldest in Britain. The second oldest is the Royal
Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, founded about 1670, and, since 1969, administered
by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland. Besides the
finest rock garden in Britain and tropical floras in novel greenhouses, the
Scottish Gallery of Modern Art is situated within the Garden, which contains
a fine herbarium and library and is a leading centre of taxonomic research.
The Post Office undertakes research and development on many aspects of the
science and engineering of communications, both in its own laboratories and
in close association with industry, the universities and government depart¬
ments. The main research station is at Dollis Plill, London, and there are
laboratories at Backwell, near Bristol, at Castleton, near Cardiff, and also at
Martlesham, near Ipswich, where a new research station is being built.
A permanent Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, was set up in
1970 to advise on national and international matters concerning the pollution
of the environment; on the adequacy of research; and future possibilities of
danger to the environment. The commission has so far published two reports
(see Bibliography, p. 483). Research on pollution problems is carried out in
many different institutions, both public and private. Government departments
mainly concerned are the Department of the Environment (responsible,
among other things, for the Water Pollution Research Laboratory and the
Transport and Road Research Laboratory), the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland (fisheries laboratories), the DTI (Warren Spring Laboratory which
works on air pollution, clearance of oil and recycling of waste) and the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science (research councils, of which the Medical and
Natural Environment Research Councils are those mainly concerned). The
Department of the Environment has a small central unit on environmental
pollution to co-ordinate the work of all government departments on the control
of environmental pollution, and to co-ordinate the British contribution to
international discussion on the subject.
A Clean Air Council was set up in 1956 and an Advisory Council on Noise
in 1970.
A National Radiological Protection Board was established under the Radio¬
logical Protection Act 1970 to provide an authoritative point of reference for
the United Kingdom on radiological protection. The board, which carries out
research, makes public and occupational health assessments and provides
services, has assumed the functions of the former Radioactive Substances
Advisory Committee, the Radiological Protection Service—hitherto provided
jointly by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Health Departments
—and part of the activities carried on by the central Health and Safety Branch
of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (AEA). The board is
financed by Parliament through the Secretary of State for Social Services and
by the AEA, MRC and income from services.
The Department of Trade and Industry is responsible for research into safety
and health of mineworkers. The coal, electricity and gas industries are required
to settle their general programmes of research in consultation with the Secretary
of State, who is assisted by an Advisory Council on Research and Develop-

The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is respon¬
sible for research in meteorology and geophysics, mainly for civil purposes.
The headquarters of the Office and most of its research sections are at
Bracknell, Berkshire. The Ministry of Defence also makes grants for funda¬
mental meteorological research carried out under the auspices of the Royal
Society (see below) or in university departments.
The Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence undertakes research
on civil aircraft, engines and equipment on behalf of the Department of Trade
and Industry. Research on marine nuclear propulsion is undertaken by the
Atomic Energy Authority. The Civil Aviation Research and Development
Board is responsible to the Department of Trade and Industry for co-ordinat¬
ing research and development work for civil aviation equipment other than
aircraft and engines.
A Select Committee of the House of Commons on Science and Technology
was set up in December 1966 and has been re-appointed in each subsequent
Parliamentary session. It is one of the specialist committees established to give
back-bench members the opportunity to investigate the policies and adminis¬
tration of the Government and to participate in the formation of policy. The
members of the committee (not more than 15 in number) are nominated by
the House. The committee has power to call witnesses, generally takes
evidence in public, and reports its findings to the House from time to time.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee, founded in 1939, provides for a
regular exchange of information between members of Parliament and scientists.
Membership is open to members of Parliament of any party in both Houses,
and also to nominated representatives of such non-profit-making scientific
and technological organisations as may be affiliated under its constitution.
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies have retained their traditional function of facilitating the spread of
knowledge. The most eminent of those concerned with science in its broadest
aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests and activities)
are the Royal Society, Royal Society of Arts, Royal Institution and British
Association.
The Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique
place in the country’s scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies
of sciences in other countries. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high
honour. The Queen is Patron. There are today three main categories of
Fellowship: Royal Fellows, comprising the Queen Mother and three Royal
Dukes; Foreign Members, of whom there are about 70; and the main body of
Fellows numbering about 760. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life,
was for many years restricted to 25 persons a year and the foreign membership
to four a year but in 1965 the former was increased to 32 with the intention of
awarding some of the new places to applied scientists in both the physical and
biological sciences. The society is governed by a council of 21 members.
Its activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication of
research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings,

the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson and Sir Henry Dale Research Professorships and ten
other research professorships supported by parliamentary grant-in-aid. The
highest medal awarded is the Copley Medal, for which scientists from all
countries are eligible; there are also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford,
Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester, Hughes, Leverhulme and Mullard Medals.
There are six lectureships: the Croonian (biology); the Bakerian (physical
sciences); the Ferrier (nervous system); the Wilkins (history of science); the
Leeuwenhoek (microbiology); and the Bernal (social functions of science).
The society has set up committees, some of them jointly with other bodies, to
promote improvements in education in science and to emphasise the import¬
ance of applied sciences, especially engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which makes grants for certain of
its activities. The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appoint¬
ments to research councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory
councils and committees concerned with research.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. It represents
the United Kingdom in the international unions comprising the International
Council of Scientific Unions and appoints national committees for each of
them. It also plays a leading part in international scientific programmes such
as the International Biological Programme (1965-70), and promotes exchange
visits of scientists with many academies throughout the world. Its Inter¬
national Fellowship Scheme to foster relations with scientists of western
European and many other countries receives financial support from the Govern¬
ment and other sources.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific,
artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in 1754, one
of the society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress and
application to useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils this
purpose chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The society
regularly holds lectures, and publishes a monthly Journal, thus providing
effective media for the exposition and assessment by leading authorities of
developments which have a public as well as a specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’.
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are
given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge. Its
library includes many early scientific works and manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the annual meeting, attended by many young students as well as
by eminent scientists. In addition the association plans special lectures,
2Q4 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the Press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The association has area committees and three lectureships for
young scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences—to en¬
courage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific
bodies and learned societies. It has also made an important contribution to the
development of science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles
to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.
Professional There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
Institutions of which are playing a distinguished part in promoting their own disciplines
or are interested in the education and professional well-being of their members.
The Council of Engineering Institutions, the federal body for the chartered
engineering institutions established in 1965, promotes the co-ordination of the
engineering profession. The Council of Science and Technology Institutes—
a federal body with five member institutes representing biologists, chemists,
mathematicians, metallurgists and physicists—was formed in 1969.
New Inter- Major international prizes for science were endowed in 1972 by the late Lord
national Prizes Rank, founder of the Rank Organisation. The fund of £1 million will be used
to reward outstanding contributions to nutrition and crop husbandry; and
to opto-electronics. The first award is expected in 1973.
THE UNIVER¬
SITIES AND
INSTITUTIONS
OF UNIVERSITY
STATUS
Of total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the academic
year 1970-71 (over ^110 million), the largest government contribution (£71-i
million) was through the University Grants Committee (see p. 158).
Scientific research in the universities is also supported through the research
councils. This support takes two forms. First, about half the postgraduate
students in science and technology in the universities receive maintenance
awards from the research councils, through postgraduate scholarships,
studentships or fellowships. These awards are in some cases for periods of up
to three years of training in research work and in others for shorter periods
for advanced studies. The cost of these awards is currently about £10-1 million
a year. Second, grants are given to the universities by the research councils
for specific projects, particularly in new or developing fields of research. In
recent years the research councils, in addition to making grants of this kind,
have made funds available for expensive items of university equipment
required for specific programmes of research. The research councils’ support
for research in the universities, excluding expenditure by the Medical Research
Council and the Agricultural Research Council on their own research units
within the universities (which remain under the control of, and are wholly
financed by, the councils), amounted in 1971-72 to £34-2 million.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations. The contributions from sources other than the
University Grants Committee amount to about a third of the total university
expenditure on research.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale
close relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the

Government in numerous joint projects. The DTI’s industrial liaison officers
(see p. 404) are based on universities or technical colleges. Seven industrial
units (six at universities and one at the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield)
initiated under a government scheme offer consultancy and research and
development resources.
According to estimates in a survey published in 1971 (see Bibliography, p. 483)
there were in 1968 just over 400,000 persons with qualifications in engineering,
technology and science in Great Britain, of whom one-half were qualified
in science and one-half in engineering. Of those economically active (350,000),
53 per cent (185,000) held engineering qualifications, 12 per cent (4,140) were
out of employment, and 35 per cent employed in manufacturing. Education
employed over 20 per cent and over the years 1959 to 1968 there was a rapid
increase in the service sectors (commerce and consultancy). Within manu¬
facturing the largest increase was in electrical and electronics industries (6 per
cent a year). Over the period 1959 to 1968 there was a net gain of scientists
from migration and a net loss of engineers and technologists.
The Science Research Council (SRC), which came into formal existence in
1965 and consists of a chairman and up to 15 other members, covers all
branches of fundamental science other than those for which the other research
councils are responsible. Provision is made for it to carry out research and
development in science and technology through its own establishments; to
encourage and support similar research by any other person or body; to
provide and operate equipment for common use by universities, polytechnics,
technical colleges and similar institutions; to make grants for postgraduate
studies; and to disseminate knowledge of science and technology. Its establish¬
ments are the Royal Greenwich Observatory, Herstmonceux, the Royal
Observatory, Edinburgh, the Radio and Space Research Station, the Ruther¬
ford High Energy Laboratory, the Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory, the
Atlas Computer Laboratory, and the Astrophysics Research Unit. The SRC
also co-ordinates the British scientific space research programme (see p. 400)
and provides the United Kingdom contribution to the European Organisation
for Nuclear Research (CERN), the civil science programme of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and part of the UK contribution to the
European Space Research Organisation (ESRO).
The greater part of industrial research in Britain is undertaken in the research
organisations of the larger firms and in government research establishments.
Other main agencies are universities and technical colleges, industrial research
associations, independent institutes for sponsored research and consultant
laboratories.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has direct control of five
industrial research establishments. These are the National Engineering
Laboratory (which includes the Birniehill Institute), the National Physical
Laboratory, Warren Spring Laboratory, the Laboratory of the Government
Chemist and the Safety in Mines Research Establishment. The total net
expenditure of the DTI for 1971-72 on these establishments was about ^'12
million.
Besides research and development for industry the industrial research
establishments are engaged on the application of techniques and discoveries

to design, production, quality control and distribution. The DTI also sponsors
research by grants-in-aid to research associations and by extra-mural contracts
with industry and universities.
The Department of the Environment is responsible for the Transport and
Road Research Laboratory, the Water Pollution Research Laboratory, the
Hydraulics Research Station, and the Building Research Establishment (see
p. 390).
The scheme by which the Government gives financial help to firms with
similar interests to form organisations known as research associations, to carry
out industrial research co-operatively, was started in 1917. There are now 32
such associations whose grants are administered by the DTI. In addition there
are four (Water; Construction; Heating and Ventilating; and Timber) whose
grants since 1st January 1971 have been administered by the Department of
the Environment, and four (Flour Milling and Baking; Fruit and Vegetable
Preservation; British Food Manufacturing Industries; and British Industrial
Biological Research) whose grants since 1st April 1971 have been administered
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Suitably specialised
associations are now available for about 50 per cent of British industry. They
accounted in 1970 for about 1-5 per cent of national research and development
expenditure. The largest are those dealing with production engineering, ships,
welding, electrical manufacturing, cotton and man-made fibres, non-ferrous
metals and scientific instruments. (Particulars of these and other associations
are given in Chapter 13, Industry.) The amounts of the government grants
are related to the contributions made by the industries concerned; the grants
are now being reduced, each industry bearing an increasing proportion of the
cost of its associations. A Conference of Industrial Research Associations was
set up in 1969.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations (see Chapter 13), in particular those con¬
cerned with fuel and power, steel and transport. They also give support to
organisations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
According to Economic Trends, November 1970 prepared by the Central
Statistical Office), expenditure on research and development carried out within
private industry (excluding enterprises of less than 25 employees) in 1968-69
was £601-9 minion—an increase of 6 per cent compared with the previous
year. Expenditure in individual industries was as follows (in £ million): aero¬
space 164-7; electronics 120-7; other electrical engineering 32; petroleum
products 11-9; other chemical products 79; mechanical engineering 52-4;
motor vehicles 43-7; scientific instruments 14-8; food, drink and tobacco 18-8;
textiles 11 -7. For these groups the increase since 1966-67 was 3 per cent. These
figures include funds from government sources. Firms in science-based in¬
dustries commit large private funds to research and development in the course
of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
In these institutes research for private firms is carried out confidentially, the
results remaining the property of the sponsor.

397
A Medical Research Committee was appointed in 1913 to administer the
research funds provided under the National Health Insurance Act 1911. In
1920 the committee was superseded by the Medical Research Council
(MRC), established under Royal Charter and supported by a grant-in-aid
provided by Parliament, now through the Secretary of State for Education and
Science. The MRC was granted a new charter in 1966.
In addition to financing the MRC, the Government gives substantial sup¬
port to medical research through block grants to universities distributed
through the Department of Education and Science and the University Grants
Committee; and to clinical research through the Department of Health and
Social Security and the National Health Service. Certain government-financed
research for defence purposes, for example, at the Microbiological Establish¬
ment at Porton, Wiltshire, has civil applications related to medical science.
Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, and by private
charities or voluntary organisations, such as the Nuffield Foundation and the
Cancer Research Campaign.
The Medical Research Council is responsible to the Secretary of State for
Education and Science and consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman, and
from 10 to 14 other members. Not less than three-quarters must be scientific¬
ally qualified, representative of the different branches of medical knowledge
and actively engaged in research. All members are appointed by the Secretary
of State, the scientific members after consultation with the President of the
Royal Society and the existing council; and the chairman and deputy chair¬
man after consultation with the council.
The MRC’s chief function is to promote research into all aspects of health
and disease. In planning and carrying out its research programme the council
is assisted by bodies specially appointed to advise on particular subjects. Three
of the more important of these are the Clinical Research Board, set up in con¬
sultation with the health departments to assist the development of clinical
research; the Tropical Medicine Research Board, appointed in consultation
with the Overseas Development Administration to advise on the promotion
and co-ordination of research in this field; and the Biological Research Board,
which advises on the promotion of research in the non-clinical field. In
addition, the MRC is advised by committees concerned with particular aspects
of its work and with the award of research grants. The MRC’s arrangements
for the support of research fall under four main headings: (1) investigations by
members of its scientific staff, mostly working in its own establishments;
(2) short-term grants to workers in universities and elsewhere; (3) long-term
grants in support of specific research programmes in university medical depart¬
ments (‘programme grants’ and ‘research groups’); and (4) fellowships and
scholarships tenable both at home and abroad. The research undertaken ranges
from basic biological research at the molecular level and the extensive laboratory
work that forms the scientific basis of the practice of medicine to the study of
patients and epidemiological and population surveys carried out in the field.
The MRC’s main research establishments are the National Institute for
Medical Research, at Mill Hill and Hampstead, London, and the Clinical
Research Centre at Northwick Park in north-west London which forms an
integral part of the new district hospital for the North West Metropolitan
Regional Hospital Board. In addition the council has over 70 smaller establish¬
ments, known as research units, which are in most cases located in university
departments, medical schools and hospitals in Britain.

The MRC also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support from
the Overseas Development Administration (see p. 405), maintains laboratories
in The Gambia and units in Uganda and Jamaica.
Agricultural research is carried out by the Agricultural Research Council, the
government agricultural departments and by private industry. Fisheries re¬
search is carried out by the Natural Environment Research Council, the govern¬
ment fisheries departments and the Freshwater Biological Association.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), established in 1931, consists of not
less than 15 and not more than 18 members, including the Chief Veterinary
Officer and certain appointments made by the Ministers of the agricultural
departments. In addition to distinguished scientists, the membership includes
people with practical farming experience. The ARC is under the general over¬
sight of the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
The ARC is responsible for 14 independent state-aided agricultural research
institutes and also has eight institutes under its direct control and 11 units
which it has established under distinguished scientists associated with
universities. Also there are eight independent institutes in Scotland financed
by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland with advice
from the ARC on their scientific programmes, staffing and equipment.
The ARC makes special research grants to support promising new lines of
work in university departments. It makes a limited number of postgraduate
training awards.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does both applied and basic
research. At' its Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, research and
laboratory investigations are carried out into the causes, pathology, epi-
zootiology and control of diseases of farm livestock, including poultry, the
diagnosis of animal and poultry diseases (other than foot-and-mouth disease);
and the making and supplying of certain biological products. The laboratory
is, by appointment of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the third
international laboratory for biological standards. There is a related Ministry
Veterinarv Laboratory at Lasswade, Midlothian. The Plant Pathology
Laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is concerned with plant quarantine
matters, the standards for improved crop planting material, pest and disease
assessment work, the clearance of pesticides for safety and their official
approval for biological efficiency. The Pest Infestation Control Laboratory at
Slough, Buckinghamshire (with stations at Tolworth and Worplesdon, Surrey),
engages in research work on insect pests affecting food storage and on harmful
mammals and birds. It provides the scientific basis for advisory work on their
detection and control and acts as an instruction and liaison centre for home and
overseas work. .
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science
Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible for
formulating the ministry’s general policy on the acquisition and dissemina¬
tion of scientific and technical information about food and the food handling
and processing industry; for furnishing scientific advice to the other divisions
of the ministry; and for sponsoring or carrying out experimental work. The
division has its own experimental laboratories in London and Norwich: in
addition, four food industrial research associations are grant-aided by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

Scientific Services of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries is mainly
concerned with the problems of cultivar taxonomy, seed testing, healthy seed
potato production, plant pathology, and the ecology of birds, mammals and
insects harmful to agriculture and stored products. In Northern Ireland the
Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for the promotion of agricultural
research and has research divisions dealing with all aspects of food production,
improving efficiency of production, improving marketability, and improving
the health of plants and animals. Special laboratory facilities are also provided
for the study of fish ecology in inland and coastal waters and for the study of
freshwater biology in relation to major water resources.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains five laboratories
for marine fisheries and shellfish research and two for salmon and freshwater
fisheries research. There are four marine research ships and several smaller
vessels for inshore and estuarine work. The Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries for Scotland maintains a marine research laboratory and six research
ships at Aberdeen, and a freshwater fisheries research laboratory at Pitlochry.
A Fisheries Research and Development Board representing government
departments concerned was set up in April 1972 to advise fisheries ministers
on research programmes. A Controller of Fisheries Research and Develop¬
ment, responsible jointly to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and
the Secretary of State for Scotland, was appointed to supervise the programmes
of the research laboratories and stations. Responsibility for the Torry Research
Station (which is concerned with the handling and preservation of the fish
catch and with studies of fish as food) was transferred from the DTI to the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in April 1972.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to silvi¬
cultural and allied problems (see p. 335). By means of grants, it also aids forest
research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford.
The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), set up under the
Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954, is responsible for research and develop¬
ment in nuclear energy. It is answerable to the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry, who is responsible under the Atomic Energy Acts 1946 and
1949 for promoting and controlling the development of nuclear energy and
ensuring that the proper degrees of importance are attached to its various
applications. As an essential part of the British Government’s nuclear power
programme, the AEA has carried out research and developed new types of
nuclear power stations for the generation of electric power on a commercial
scale and for this purpose it builds and operates experimental and prototype
nuclear reactors. Construction of commercial nuclear power stations is carried
out by industry to the order of the electricity generating boards which operate
them. Two new design and construction companies, with AEA participation,
were formed in 1968 and 1969 to design and construct nuclear power stations.
Under the Science and Technology Act 1965 the functions of the AEA have
been extended so that the Government may, after consultation, require it to
undertake research and development outside nuclear energy. Non-nuclear
work is absorbing a rising proportion of the AEA’s research and development
resources.

new companies (British Nuclear Fuels Limited and The Radiochemical Centre
Limited) of the assets and liabilities of the AEA’s trading fund. The establish¬
ments transferred to British Nuclear Fuels Limited include those at Spring-
fields, Capenhurst, Chapelcross and the Windscale and Calder Works. Those
transferred to The Radiochemical Centre Limited include the Radio¬
chemical Centre, Amersham, and its facilities at Harwell. The Reactor Group
Laboratories at Springfields and Windscale and the Advanced Gas-cooled
Reactor (AGR) at Windscale remain with the AEA.
The Secretary of State for Defence became responsible for the development
and production of nuclear weapons for the Services in 1966; in practice,
however, the AEA produces the explosive nuclear material and assemblies for
nuclear weapons under contract and carries out weapons research.
The Department of Trade and Industry and the AEA are jointly responsible
for co-operation with other countries in nuclear energy, partly through the
medium of bilateral agreements with a large number of individual countries
and partly through British membership of bodies such as the International
Atomic Energy Agency and the European Nuclear Energy Agency.
The provision of facilities for research in high energy physics is the function
of the Science Research Council (SRC) (see p. 395). The SRC establishments
concerned are the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory, Chilton, with a
7 GeV (thousand million electron volt) proton synchrotron (particle acclera-
tor), completed in 1963, and the Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory,
Cheshire, with a 5 GeV electron synchrotron, completed in 1966. Experiments
at higher energies are carried out at the European Organisation for Nuclear
Research (CERN) to which Britain contributes through the SRC.
Government responsibility for space activities is divided between the Secretary
of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for Defence, the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications, while the Secretary of State for Foreign and Common¬
wealth Affairs is concerned with international aspects. Total expenditure on
space activities in 1970-71 was about £24-5 million; of this, over £8-5 million
represented contributions to international bodies.
Britain was a founder member of the European Space Vehicle Launcher
Development Organisation (ELDO), which builds large satellite launchers, and
the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), which was originally con¬
cerned with scientific space research but which has now been charged addition¬
ally with the development of applications satellites. The cost of building large
launchers in Europe is high and in 1968 Britain decided to limit its commit¬
ment to ELDO and at the end of 1971 announced its intention to withdraw
from the Organisation. Britain supports fully the ESRO programme of
scientific satellites and ESRO’s applications satellite programmes which
include aeronautical, meteorological and telecommunications satellites.
Financial responsibility for the scientific programme rests with the SRC and
for the applications programmes rests with DTI.
The execution of the civil scientific space research programme is the res¬
ponsibility of the Secretary of State for Education and Science, through the
SRC. Opportunities are provided for research workers to carry out experiments
in Britain’s national satellite and sounding rocket programme, in the ESRO
scientific satellite programme and in various collaborative sounding rocket
programmes through bilateral and multilateral arrangements with other
countries, including the Commonwealth collaborative programme. Britain is

co-operating with the United States in a programme which includes American
launching of the British Ariel series of scientific satellites, the incorporation of
British experiments in American satellites and the analyses of lunar surface
samples.
Responsibility for the National Space Technology Programme (NSTP)
rests with the Department of Trade and Industry which calls upon the re¬
sources of the Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence for advice
and for the technical oversight of the programme. The DTPs NSTP (designed
to help build up industry’s capability) includes the development of technology¬
proving satellites, of which the first, Prospero, w^as launched in October 1971.
The DTI and the Civil Aviation Authority (see p. 356) are jointly planning an
international civil aviation developmental satellite programme (Aerosat) for
experiments and evaluation over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The DTI
leads the U K Delegation to the European Space Conference—the forum in
which the broad policies of European space programmes are discussed. The
Ministry^ of Defence is responsible for defence communications satellites.
The Ministry" of Posts and Telecommunications, through the Post Office, is
responsible for the use of satellites for civil communications purposes and
undertakes research wrork in connection with communications systems using
satellites. Britain and 82 other countries participate in Intelsat (the Inter¬
national Telecommunications Satellite Consortium), set up under two
inter-related international agreements reached in 1964 in Washington. New
definitive arrangements for Intelsat, reached in May 1971, were opened for
signature in August 1971 and will come into force when they have been signed
and ratified by two-thirds of the members. The Post Office ground stations
at Goonhilly in Cornwall are among the most successful in the world, and
British firms have built and are building such stations overseas.
Scientific space experiments are undertaken by scientists in universities and
in government research establishments; the British national programmes are
under the general supervision of the Radio and Space Research Station (RSRS)
of the SRC. RSRS provides support and services for the space research pro¬
grammes and also operates the United States National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) Satellite Tracking and Data Acquisition Network
(STAD AN) station at Winkfield. Telemetry facilities for the DTI’s technology
satellites are situated at Lasham, Hampshire, with data processing and analysis
being provided by Space Department, Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farn-
borough. Optical tracking of satellites is undertaken by many individual
observers in Britain and by the Royal Edinburgh Observatory’s outstation (see
below); the prediction and co-ordination centre is at the RSRS, Slough, which
is also the home of one of the three World Data Centres for space research.
The Royal Society represents Britain in non-governmental international
scientific groups such as the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the
International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).
Optical astronomy is carried out in several university departments and in the
Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh,
under the Science Research Council (SRC). SRC has set out to increase the
facilities available to university and observatory astronomers. The 98-in
(245 cm) Isaac Newton Telescope at RGO was commissioned in 1967 and is
operated as a national facility; the 74-in (185 cm) Radcliffe Telescope at
Pretoria is available to British astronomers under an agreement between the
SRC and the Radcliffe Trustees. A 150-in (375 cm) telescope is under construc¬
tion at Siding Spring Mountain in Australia as a joint Anglo-Australian

project, while a British 48-in (120 cm) Schmidt Telescope, also under con¬
struction, will be installed on the same site.
Cambridge and Manchester Universities are the main centres for research
in radio astronomy with substantial support from SRC. The fully steerable
250-ft (76-2 m) telescope at Jodrell Bank (University of Manchester) has been
modernised. The Cambridge University group at Lord’s Bridge has developed
and made substantial use of the aperture synthesis technique; two telescopes
with 1 mile (1-609 km) and i mile (0-804 km) arrays have been complemented
by a third telescope array 5 km (3-1 miles) long. Both university groups have
other smaller facilities in regular use.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) was established by
Royal Charter in 1965 under the Science and Technology Act 1965 to en¬
courage, plan and conduct research in those sciences, both physical and
biological, that relate to man’s natural environment. The work of the NERC
falls into five main groups: the solid earth, its physical properties and mineral
resources (geology, geophysics and geochemistry); the inland waters and their
living resources (hydrology, freshwater biology, and ecology); the terrestrial
communities, their resources and amenities (terrestrial ecology, forestry and
conservation); the seas and oceans, their behaviour and their living and mineral
resources (oceanography, marine biology and ecology); and the atmosphere
(some aspects of meteorology). NERC is responsible for the British Antarctic
Survey, the Institute of Geological Sciences, the Institute of Hydrology
(which may later be financed partly by customer departments), the Insti¬
tute of Tree Biology, the Institute for Marine Environmental Research,
the National Institute of Oceanography, the Institute of Coastal Oceanography
and Tides, the Institute for Marine Biochemistry, the Unit of Invertebrate
Virology, the Unit of Coastal Sedimentation, the Culture Centre of Algae and
Protozoa and the Research Vessel Base. It is also responsible for supporting
the Marine Biological Association, the Scottish Marine Biological Association,
the Freshwater Biological Association, the Marine Invertebrate Biology Unit
and the Marine Biological Station, Port Erin. The Nature Conservancy is at
present part of the NERC but funds for managing nature reserves and re¬
search connected with this function are to be transferred from the science vote
of the Department of Education and Science to that of the Department of the
Environment from 1973-74. The Nature Conservancy Committee of the
NERC will be abolished and a new Nature Conservancy Council established
by the Secretary of State for the Environment to be appointed in consultation
with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
Many of the activities of the NERC are related to university research in the
environmental sciences, which it supports by postgraduate training awards,
research grants and fellowships.
A Marine Technology Requirements Board to identify customer requirements
for research and development in exploiting the resources of the sea and seabed
and in formulating government programmes was set up in 1972 to replace the
Advisory Committee on Marine Technology. It is responsible to the Secretary
of State for Trade and Industry and includes representatives from industry,
official and non-official bodies.
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) was set up in 1965 to encourage,
support and to carry out research in, and to disseminate knowledge about, the
social sciences. It provides grants for research projects at universities and other
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
403
institutions, and makes training awards to postgraduate students. It has also
set up three research units: the Industrial Relations RU, the Ethnic Relations
RU, and the Survey Unit. The SSRC’s fields of interest include economics;
political science; psychology; social anthropology; social and economic
statistics; sociology and social administration; social science and government;
education; management and industrial relations; human geography; planning
and various aspects of a wide range of other disciplines.
Several government departments have funds allocated for social research
related to their responsibilities, including the Home Office, which has a large
research unit carrying out a wide variety of sociological studies. The Social
Survey conducts sample survey enquiries at the request of government depart¬
ments and from time to time also carries out studies in collaboration with
universities and other independent research organisations.
Zoological research is among the activities of the world-famous Zoological
Gardens, extending over 34 acres in Regent’s Park, London, which were
opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1828. A natural zoo of 500
acres was opened in 1931 at Whipsnade, in Bedfordshire, by the Society.
Among other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester,
Dudley, and Chessington, Surrey. There is also a number of ‘safari parks’
containing reservations of wild animals through which the public can pass in
closed motor cars.
The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the Common¬
wealth for the general study of natural history; it has extensive collections of
extant and fossil animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The
Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all
countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held a leading place in
engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the develop¬
ment of industrial machinery and processes. The geology of Britain is probably
known in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and
the Geological Survey has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological
Museum. These three museums are in South Kensington, London. Other
important collections are those of the Museum of Science and Industry, in
Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at Oxford.
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume of
information has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication, in
which results are written up into papers and published in journals, is still
the main means of communication among scientists. The leading learned
societies have for long been important agencies for communicating scientific
information.
A description of general library services which also cater for scientific needs is
given on p.419.
The National Lending Library for Science and Technology (NLL) at
Boston Spa, Yorkshire, within the Department of Education and Science,
collects for loan purposes all literature which is likely to be of interest to the
practising scientist and technologist, covering all branches of science and
technology (including agriculture and medicine) and, since 1967, the periodical
literature of the social sciences.
The National Reference Library of Science and Invention (NRLSI),
.04 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
administered by the British Museum, is divided between the Holborn Division,
formerly the Patent Office Library, and the Bayswater Division which has
substantial collections, especially in the life sciences. The NLL and the NRLSI
with other libraries are to become the British Library (see p. 420).
Aslib, representing special libraries and information units in industry,
government departments, universities, colleges and other institutions, carries
out research into the collection, utilisation and dissemination of information,
provides consultancy and advisory services and training courses and offers
members an enquiry and reference service covering all subjects.
The Office for Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) was set up in
the Department of Education and Science in 1965 to promote research;
develop new techniques and systems; improve existing services and experi¬
ment with new ones; to stimulate training of scientists for information work
and in the use of information sources; and help to co-ordinate information
activities at home and overseas.
An Advisory Committee for Scientific and Technical Information was set
up in October 1965 to advise the Secretary of State for Education and Science
particularly in relation to the work of OSTI and the co-ordination of this work
with other government departments and independent organisations.
The Department of Trade and Industry and the AEA devote considerable
sums to advisory information services. The former has nine regional offices
and sponsors over 70 industrial liaison centres, based on universities or
technical colleges which make contacts with local industries to promote greater
use of existing scientific and technical knowledge. A Production Engineering
Advisory Service equipped with mobile demonstration units brings knowledge
of new techniques directly to the workshop floor. The grant-aided industrial
research associations circulate research reports and provide information
services to members. Besides information services provided by its various
groups, which include the Ceramics Centre and the Non-destructive Testing
Centre at Harwell, the AEA has an information centre at its London head¬
quarters, and a network of regional advisers on the use of radioisotopes.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux (see
p. 405) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches of
agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of A-gticultutcil Reseatch
in Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual reports.
The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research results
directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.
National The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) is an independent
Research public corporation financed by government loans through the DTI. Set up
Development under the Development of Inventions Act 1948 its borrowing power, originally
Corporation £5 million, has been progressively increased to £50 million.
The NRDC’s functions are to promote the adoption by industry of new
products and processes invented in government laboratories, universities, and
elsewhere, advancing money where necessary to bring them to a commercially
viable stage; and to speed up technological advance by investing money with
industrial firms for the development of their own inventions and projects.
Projects so far sponsored include the Cephalosporin C antibiotic, hovercraft,
computers, advanced types of electric motor, diesel engines, insecticides,
microelectronics and fuel cells.

Organisation (UNESCO), the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Food
and Agriculture Organisation (FAO); nuclear energy, for example, the Inter¬
national Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the European Nuclear Energy
Agency (ENEA) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop¬
ment (OECD), and the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN);
space research, for example, ESRO; and the International Agency for Research
on Cancer (IARC). There are agreements between the United Kingdom AEA
and other atomic energy authorities, including that of the Soviet Union; and
there are permanent representatives of the United States Atomic Energy
Commission in London and of the United Kingdom AEA in Washington.
Also, there are inter-governmental agreements with the European Atomic
Energy Community (Euratom), of which Britain is due to become a full mem¬
ber on 1 st January 1973, and bilateral agreements with other countries. Britain
is also represented on the two scientific committees of the OECD. In areas of
non-governmental collaboration, the primary representative of the United
Kingdom is the Royal Society.
The Commonwealth Scientific Committee (CSC) consisting of the heads of
the national research organisations of Commonwealth countries, formed in
1958 from the previous Standing Committee set up in 1946, meets biennially.
Operating under the CSC is a consultative sub-committee, membership of
which consists of officials responsible for scientific matters in the Common¬
wealth Missions in London, and representatives from British government
departments, and the Royal Society. There are various specialist committees.
The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, financed by contributions from
all Commonwealth countries, comprise three Institutes and eleven Bureaux, all
of which except one Institute are in Britain and each of which is concerned
with a particular branch of agricultural science. They act as clearing houses
for the interchange of information of value to research workers in agricultural
science throughout the Commonwealth and increasingly throughout the world.
Seventeen Abstract Journals, one Primary Journal and an Index are published
periodically and have a combined annual circulation of about 29,000 copies.
The Institutes and Bureaux also issue monographs on their own particular
subjects and deal with enquiries received from research workers in all parts of
the Commonwealth.
1 he promotion by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the
Foreign and Commomvealth Office of scientific activities in the interests of
developing countries comprises research covering a wide range of disciplines,
specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, conferences for exchange of
information, training scientists from overseas in universities and research
institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from Britain, and providing
support for existing research services and research projects overseas, for
example, in East Africa and the Caribbean. Some equipment is also given to
enable research problems to be solved and to encourage scientific training and
applied research. The Centre for Overseas Pest Research was established in
London in June 1971 and includes what was formerly the Anti-Locust
Research Centre, internationally recognised as a world centre for locust re¬
search since 1931. The Centre is part of the ODA as are the Tropical Products
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Institute in London, which aims at improving the economic viability of the less-
developed tropical countries, especially those within the Commonwealth, by
research into new uses for tropical plant and animal products, and the Land
Resources Division which is concerned with all aspects of land resource
appraisal. The ODA provides over £5 million a year for scientific activities
including research for the benefit of developing countries.
The principal aims of the British Council (see p. 162) in the sciences (including
agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to assist in curriculum reform
at school level and in the training of teachers of science and mathematics.
Overseas, 50 staff with science or science teaching qualifications assist in
scientific and educational development and in scientific collaboration. Empha¬
sis is placed on facilitating the interchange of scientists and teachers and on the
provision of library and information services related to advances in science and
science education in Britain. Overseas tours are arranged for British specialists
to advise, run courses or discuss matters of common interest, and scientists
are recruited or seconded to posts in overseas universities, teacher-training
colleges, education authorities, schools or curriculum reform centres. The
council invites senior overseas specialists to Britain, and makes awards to
postgraduate students; it also administers the programmes of a large number
of senior specialists and students who travel to Britain under the auspices of
the UN specialised agencies, or under various bilateral technical assistance
schemes, or as private individuals. The council is also responsible for ad¬
ministering travel grants awarded under the Foreign and Commonwealth
University Interchange Schemes.
In Britain, advisory and information facilities are provided by specialist
departments (and libraries) for education, medicine and science including
science education. Publications include Higher Education in the United King¬
dom, British Medical Bulletin, British Medical Book List, British Medical Index,
Science Education Newsletter (see also Bibliography, p. 482), which list
facilities for education and training in Britain, and Scholarships Abroad which
lists awards available to postgraduate students anxious to study overseas.
18 THE ARTS
Government
Support
Arts Councils
During the past 25 years there has been a steady growth in popular interest,
both active and passive, in the arts in Britain. This development—reflected,
for example, in the profusion of amateur dramatic and musical societies, the
growth in sales of books and gramophone records, and the large attendance
figures at major art exhibitions—is largely the result of increased leisure time
and improved education in the arts. Another major factor has been the growth
in television ownership which has made the best in the arts available to people
in their own homes.
Artistic activities in Britain receive financial and other support from many
sources. Though some of the arts—for example, painting and literature—
continue to flourish with little outside help, others, notably drama and classical
music, have become more and more reliant on it. Valuable assistance comes
from such private sources as voluntary trusts and commercial concerns, but
since 1945 the Government and local authorities have played an increasingly
important part in encouraging the arts.
The Government is concerned with the preservation of the country’s cultural
heritage, the promotion of education in the arts, the dissemination of the arts to
a wider public and the encouragement of high standards in the performing and
creative arts. In Great Britain special responsibility for the arts is borne by the
Paymaster General (see p. 51) who works in close co-operation with the
Department of Education and Science and the Welsh and Scottish Offices, and
in Northern Ireland it lies largely writh the Minister responsible for Finance.
Estimated government expenditure on the arts in Great Britain in 1972-73—
excluding education, public libraries and preservation—amounts to ^34-9
million; in Northern Ireland it represents some £671,000.
The Government aids the preservation of Britain’s cultural heritage by
means of grants (£18-5 million in 1972-73) which largely finance most of the
national museums, galleries and libraries. It is also responsible through the
Department of the Environment, Scottish and Welsh Offices for the upkeep of
ancient monuments and historic buildings and offers financial help to indepen¬
dent bodies concerned with preservation, such as the National Trust (see p.
169).
In Britain the main educational functions concerning the arts are carried out
through the education departments. They are concerned, in partnership with
local education authorities and voluntary bodies, with art education in schools,
colleges of further education, evening institutes and community centres, and
with the public library service.
Most government support for the creative arts takes the form of grants to
independent promotional bodies. These include the British Film Institute (see
p. 415) and the Design Council (see p. 260), but the most important is the Arts
Council of Great Britain, established by Royal Charter in 1946, whose main
objects are to develop and improve the knowledge, understanding and prac¬
tice of the arts, to increase their accessibility to the public, and to advise and
co-operate with government departments, local authorities and other organisa¬
tions. The council promotes music and drama through grants to professional
BRITAIN I973t AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
orchestras and opera, ballet and theatre companies, and arranges art exhibi¬
tions in London and the regions. A limited amount of assistance is also given
to individual artists, including painters, sculptors, writers and composers, for
particular projects; and the construction of new theatres, concert halls and
other arts buildings is encouraged by grants provided under the council’s
‘Housing the Arts’ scheme.
Members of the council are appointed by the minister responsible for the
arts and in 1972-73 the council received a grant of nearly ^13'7 million from
the Department of Education and Science. Advised by panels responsible for
different aspects of the arts, the council itself allocates grants to the main
artistic bodies in England, though a small but growing proportion of its funds
is now channelled to regional arts associations (see p. 409) which determine
final allocation. Organisations in Scotland and Wales receive their grants from
the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils, which are appointed by the main Arts
Council which allocates to them a part of its funds.
In Northern Ireland there is an independent Arts Council with similar aims
and functions to that of Great Britain. It receives an annual grant from the
Northern Ireland Exchequer (£290,000 in 1972-73).
The Government promotes knowledge of English literature and culture over¬
seas mainly through the British Council (see footnote, p. 162), which maintains
over 120 libraries of books and records in over 60 countries, and shares res¬
ponsibility for a further 80. The Council also sponsors overseas tours by
leading British actors, producers, theatre companies, musicians, orchestras and
opera and ballet companies; it promotes exhibitions and lectures overseas on
the fine arts in Britain and organises British participation in international
exhibitions; and it distributes overseas a wide range of specialised films, many
of them on the arts.
A major contribution to the arts (particularly music and drama) is made by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and, to a lesser extent, by the inde¬
pendent television programme companies through the Independent Broad¬
casting Authority. The BBC spends some £3 million each year in copyright
payments to authors and composers and has orchestras employing about a third
of the country’s full-time professional musicians. Each week it broadcasts
nearly too hours of serious music—both live and recorded—on its Radio 3
channel. It regularly commissions new music, particularly by British composers,
and sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals. On both radio and tele¬
vision, the BBC broadcasts a wide range of new drama together with adapta¬
tions of novels and stage plays. Independent television broadcasts some 2 hours
of plays in an average week together with another 12 hours of drama series and
serials. Both broadcasting organisations screen a wide range of feature films
including selections of the best British and overseas productions.
Local authorities support the arts in many ways. In addition to their responsi¬
bilities for education (including specialised art education) and the public
library service, many provide and maintain local museums and art galleries. In
Great Britain the authorities may levy up to a 2%p rate for expenditure on
entertainment in all its forms (including cultural activities). According to
estimates local authority net expenditure on entertainment and the arts amounts
to more than £5-5 million annually, of which the greater part is used to support
professional orchestras and drama companies. Many authorities contribute
towards the capital cost of new arts buildings, in particular, theatres, the

Greater London Council, for example, is contributing towards the cost of the
new National Theatre (see p. 410), while the Edinburgh Corporation has
agreed to meet half the cost of the city’s proposed new opera house.
Valuable support for the arts comes from many voluntary sources including
charitable trusts and foundations, and supporters’ organisations for the major
national institutions. Industrial and commercial concerns provide a certain
amount of patronage, in particular for regional arts associations and local arts
festivals, but the government is concerned to encourage further private support
for the arts.
The arts benefit most when the patrons—central and local government,
voluntary bodies, industry, the universities and individuals—combine.
Over the past ten years the government has encouraged regional co-opera¬
tion in arts patronage through the formation of regional arts associations
whose aim it is to ensure that the whole range of the arts is more widely avail¬
able to people throughout their areas. Thirteen such associations, on which
local authorities and a wide range of other interests are represented, now cover
the whole of England and Wales with the exception of south Wales, the
Home Counties and south-east England. Financed by a combination of local
authority, Arts Council and private funds, the associations channel financial
assistance to local arts organisations and offer an advisory and promotional
service for all sorts of local arts activities.
Similar examples of co-operative patronage are the societies formed to
present some of the many arts festivals in Britain. The outstanding example
is the Edinburgh Festival Society, but other festivals organised on a similar
basis include those held in the City of London, Brighton, King’s Lynn,
Norwich and York.
Britain is one of the world’s major centres of theatrical activity. In London
during the summer season, theatres are packed with foreign visitors, while
in the provinces there is enthusiastic support for the work of local repertory
companies. A recent development in the theatre—particularly in London—
has been the emergence of ‘fringe’ theatre groups presenting short plays in an
informal atmosphere which are attracting growing interest.
A large part of this development of British drama stems from the growing
government support provided through the Arts Councils of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland which grant subsidies to drama companies registered
as charities (that is, are non-profit making), provided that such companies
have given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high standards of
practical competence. The Arts Council of Great Britain operates a scheme
to promote new drama: guarantees may be offered to managements giving
the first professional production of selected new plays; and promising authors
may be awarded bursaries. Schemes are also in operation to train stage
designers, producers and those wishing to take up theatre administration.
There are some 140 professional theatres in full-time use in Britain. Of these
about half are owned or rented by non-profit-making companies receiving Arts
Council subsidies, while the remainder are operated commercially. In 1971-72
Arts Council support for the theatre in Great Britain amounted to some £3-1
million.
The centre of theatrical activity is in London where there are over 30
410 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
principal theatres in or near the West End and several more in the suburbs.
Most of the theatres are let to producing managements on a commercial basis
for each production, but four are occupied by important subsidised companies,
including the National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare companies. The former,
which will move into its new building on the South Bank during 1974, stages
classical and modern plays from all countries; the latter presents Shakespearean
plays in Stratford-upon-Avon and international plays in London.
Outside London there are some 40 large commercial theatres in the main
cities and about 60 theatres occupied by subsidised ‘repertory companies’.
The commercial theatres, which accommodate pre- and post-West End tours
by the major London productions and performances by companies specially
formed for touring, have been declining in numbers, and several have now
been purchased by local authorities. Compensating for this decline, there has
been a growth in the activities of the repertory companies, which receive
financial support from the Arts Council and also from the local authorities.
The repertory companies employ many leading dramatists, producers, de¬
signers and actors, and standards are high. Some companies have the use of
their own theatres, while others rent from local authorities. Over a dozen new
repertory theatres have been built since 1958*
All plays produced in Great Britain are subject to the provisions of the
Theatres Act 1968. There is no censorship, but the Act makes it a criminal
offence to present or direct an obscene performance of a play in public or in
private (including theatre clubs), an obscene performance being defined as
one which tends to ‘deprave and corrupt persons who are likely ... to attend
it’. Provision is made in the Act for a defence against a charge of obscenity on
the grounds that the performance is for the public good in the interests of,
for example, drama, opera or literature.
Amateur There are thousands of amateur dramatic societies in Britain; they are en-
Theatre couraged by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four
special organisations—the British Drama League, the Standing Conference
of Drama Associations, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the
Association of Ulster Drama Festivals. Most universities have active amateur
drama clubs and societies; an International Festival of University Theatre is
held annually.
Dramatic Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the most
Training important are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the Central School of
Speech and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and
the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, all of which are in London; and the
Old Vic School in Bristol. In Scotland there is the Royal Scottish Academy of
Music and Drama in Glasgow which is grant-aided by the Scottish Education
Department. An increasing number of universities offer courses in drama.
Theatre for Young people’s theatre has been developing in recent years. In i97°> uncler
Young People the aegis of the National Theatre, the Young Vic was opened as a theatre for the
young. The National Youth Theatre has a permanent home in London. There
are a number of companies, including the Unicorn Theatre for Young People,
Theatre Centre and the Polka Company, which are concerned exclusively
with the production of plays for young people; seven of these are supported
by the Arts Council. In the provinces some repertory companies provide
programmes and engage in other types of theatre activity for young people.
Nottingham has its own Youth Theatre Workshop and Birmingham has the

Midlands Arts Centre for Young People. In Northern Ireland a subsidised
company called Interplay Theatre works mainly in schools.
The Arts Council estimates that annual audience attendances for young
people’s theatre performances are about 3 million.
Many schools and youth clubs put on plays and provide some education in
drama. Drama centres for the London education service are provided at the
Cockpit Youth Arts Centre and at the Curtain Theatre; there are youth
theatres in the London boroughs of Camden and Hillingdon.
In 1971-72 the Arts Council’s grants totalled £267,874 in support of young
people’s theatre activities. The National Council of Theatre for Young People
represents all those actively concerned.
Music in all its forms plays an important role in British cultural life. ‘Pop’
music has achieved very great popularity particularly with young people and
concerts of folk music also attract large audiences, while jazz, light music and
brass bands maintain substantial followings. However, a widespread interest
in ‘serious’ music is reflected in the size of attendances at orchestral concerts
and at performances of opera, ballet and chamber music.
Through the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Government encourages
interest in the various forms of ‘serious’ music. The Council makes grants to a
number of orchestras, soloists, opera and ballet companies, music societies
and festivals. It also provides bursaries and commissions for British composers
and musicians.
In Britain many libraries have collections of records and musical scores
which are available on loan to the public. The City of Westminster houses the
Central Music Library which lends to other libraries and to individuals.
Another well-known music collection is the Henry Watson Music Library at
the Manchester Central Library.
The National Music Council, representative of many aspects of British
musical activity, is affiliated to the International Music Council, which is
associated with UNESCO.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities of Britain. In London the principal concert halls are the
Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, adjacent to which are
the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room which accommodate smaller-
scale performances; the Royal Albert Hall, Kensington, where the annual
summer season of Promenade Concerts is given; and the Wigmore Hall,
an important recital centre.
The leading British symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the
London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the New
Philharmonia, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester),
the City of Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony and the
Scottish National orchestras. The BBC runs a number of orchestras pro¬
viding broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There are also
specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the English Chamber
Orchestra, the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, the London Mozart
Players, the Philomusica of London and the Northern Sinfonia of Newcastle
upon Tyne. Most orchestras (other than those of the BBC) receive financial
aid from the Arts Council of Great Britain and local authorities and some also
receive assistance from commercial television and other business organisations.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Orchestra receives financial aid from the Arts
Council of Northern Ireland.

Among the principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral Society,
the Bach Choir, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, the New Philhar-
monia Chorus, the Edinburgh Royal Choral Union and the Belfast Philhar¬
monic Society. Certain of these are closely associated with famous orchestras
while others combine with them in major choral works; most of them,
together with hundreds of similar choral and orchestral societies and music
clubs, are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies, through
which they are supported with funds provided by the Arts Council.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in
existence for over 200 years. The famous Edinburgh International Festival
lasts three weeks; other festivals, such as that at King’s Lynn, last a week or
less. Among the better known are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales;
the National Gaelic Mod, held at a different place in Scotland each year; the
Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted to contemporary British music; and the
Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. An annual international festival of folk song
and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees (some of which are voluntary and some sub-committees
of local education authorities), which are aided by the Carnegie United
Kingdom Trust and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music.
The National Federation of Music Societies, which receives an annual grant
from the Arts Council, assists amateur groups with the cost of engaging pro¬
fessional soloists.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden, London, which receives financial assistance from the Arts
Council. The Royal Opera House has its own company—The Royal Opera—
and a ballet company—The Royal Ballet. The opera company numbers about
200 (including guest artists) and has a permanent orchestra. The Royal Ballet
has a high international reputation and has made many overseas tours. It has
a regular London season, tours abroad and performs in the provinces for 12
weeks each year.
Seasons of opera and operetta in English are given by the Sadler’s Wells
Company which plays in modernised premises at the London Coliseum,
besides making provincial tours. Its former home, the Sadler’s Wells Theatre,
provides a London stage for visiting opera and dance companies from the
provinces and from abroad.
The Scottish Opera Company presents annual seasons in several Scottish
towns; it will eventually be based on a new ^4*5 million opera house in Edin¬
burgh which is being financed by grants from the Edinburgh Corporation and
the Scottish Education Department.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international cast
is specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies include
the English Opera Group, noted for its performances of chamber operas by
Benjamin Britten and other composers, the New Opera Company, formed by
members of the Cambridge Opera Group to produce new operas in London,
and the Welsh National Opera Company. Opera in Northern Ireland is
promoted by the Northern Ireland Opera Trust and the Studio Opera Group
with financial support from the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
THE ARTS
413
Britain’s other ballet companies include London’s Festival Ballet, the Ballet
Rambert (Britain’s oldest ballet company) and the Scottish Theatre Ballet
which specialises in contemporary works. The Contemporary Dance Theatre
provides regular seasons of modern dance at the Place in London besides
touring extensively. The work of the Patricia Mulholland Irish Ballet Company
in Northern Ireland, which is sponsored by the Arts Council of Northern
Ireland, combines traditional music, dancing and mime.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the Royal
Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music in London, and the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow are grant-aided. Other
leading colleges include the Trinity College of Music and the Guildhall School
of Music and Drama, both in London, the Royal Manchester College of
Music and the Birmingham School of Music. The London Opera Centre for
Advanced Training and Development provides some rehearsal and other
facilities for the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. The leading ballet
schools are the Royal Ballet School, the Rambert Ballet School and the Royal
Academy of Dancing which, with many private schools, have played an impor¬
tant part in raising British ballet to its present high standard.
Young people are encouraged to take an interest in music, opera and ballet.
There are frequent concerts for children and the National Youth Orchestra of
Great Britain, the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and the London
Schools’ Symphony Orchestra are noted for their high standard of perfor¬
mance. A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to the international
Jeunesses Musicales, encourages opera, ballet and other performances for
young people. The Royal Ballet sponsors a small group, Ballet for All, to give
lecture-demonstrations to the public and to schools.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and
over 180,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the exami¬
nations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. The most
popular instrument with candidates is the piano (some 57 per cent) followed
by the violin, the clarinet and the cello.
Although cinema attendance has been steadily declining in Great Britain from
a peak of 1,635 million in 1946 to about 176 million in 1971, and the number
of licensed cinemas has declined from 4,709 to 1,510 over the same period,
British films, actors and creative and technical talent are appreciated both at
home and abroad and frequently achieve success at international film events.
Television offers very large potential audiences for films and provides oppor¬
tunities of employment for technicians and actors.
London is one of the most important centres for the making of films for
international markets and export earnings are an important part of total
earnings. The Film Production Association of Great Britain is the trade
association to which the majority of feature film producers belong.
Although much of British main feature production is supported by United
States interests, EMI Film and Theatre Corporation Ltd. (formerly Associ¬
ated British Picture Corporation) and the Rank Organisation maintain a
substantial interest in production, distribution and exhibition. Most British
film producers are independent but make films in association with these major
interests. There are numerous companies, many of them small, which produce
short films.

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There is no state-owned film production unit in Britain, but the National
Film Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production through a
consortium formed by the corporation and private interests in 1972. The
consortium will operate with a capital of ^ 1 million advanced by the Depart¬
ment of Trade and Industry, and £750,000 provided by private interests. The
consortium is expected to achieve eventual independence from government
support.
There is a levy on cinema admissions which provides a fund to benefit the
makers of eligible British films. The money so raised is distributed by a
public body—the British Film Fund Agency—in proportion to a film’s takings,
so that the more successful a film is at the box-office, the more it receives from
the fund.
To help British films to meet the keen American competition, legislation
passed in 1927 introduced the quota system under which a certain proportion
of British films must be shown in British cinemas each year. The proportion
is considered annually by the Department of Trade and Industry after con¬
sultation with the Cinematograph Films Council. For main feature films it has
stood at 30 per cent since 1950 and for supporting programmes it has remained
at 25 per cent since 1948.
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but before it can
be shown a film must be licensed by a local authority or, in some areas, a
magistrate. In considering the suitability of films the authorities normally rely
on the judgment of an independent body, the British Board of Film Censors, to
which most films for public showing are submitted (other than newsreels).
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative of
the cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in the
films offered to the public. The Board, which does not use any written code of
censorship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a
film; very rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the Board are placed
into one of four categories: ‘U’ (suitable to be seen by any person not less than
five years of age); ‘A’ (for persons of not less than five years of age but con¬
taining material that some parents might prefer their children not to see); ‘AA’
(for persons of not less than 14 years of age); and ‘X’ (for persons of not less
than 18 years of age).
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back to
1929, when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive
and imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then,
British documentary technicians have continued to produce high quality
factual films which have won numerous international awards. The British
Industrial and Scientific Film Association promotes the use of films in
industry, science and commerce. The Federation of Specialised Film Associa¬
tions, the trade association of documentary, short, industrial, advertising and
cartoon film makers, has about 75 members.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films to inform audiences over¬
seas about British life and achievements, including documentary films, tele¬
vision programmes and newsreels; they are produced through the Central
Office of Information (COI), which commissions their production by private
companies.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other

organisations, such as the British Tourist Authority and the British Pro¬
ductivity Council. The best of these and industrial films from other countries
are available through the COFs Central Film Library and other agencies.
The Films of Scotland Committee promotes the production of Scottish films
covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film
Institute, founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant
and by the Scottish Film Council which also receives a government grant.
The Institute encourages the making and showing of good films. It also
administers the National Film Theatre in London and the National Film
Archive, runs an annual summer school, and maintains a film library from
which films may be hired, a library of books on the film and an information
service. It makes grants to the Federation of Film Societies, the British
Universities Film Council and the Society for Education in Film and Tele¬
vision.
The National Film Archive contains about 20,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and about
700,000 photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the art of the
film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre, on the south bank of the Thames in London,
has two cinemas showing films of outstanding historical, artistic or technical
interest; it holds a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes
unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the
films shown. Each year it organises a London Film Festival. The British Film
Institute has promoted the development of 44 regional film theatres on the lines
of the National Film Theatre and may make grants towards their recurrent
and capital costs. Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the Arts Council of
Northern Ireland.
An independent national film school offering three-year courses for writers,
directors, producers and cameramen began operating in 1971. The school,
which is financed by government grant (£153,000 in 1971-72) had 23 students
in its first year. Training in film production is also given at the London Film
School which has 250 students and provides two-year courses.
The Cinematograph Act 1952 provided for the making of regulations by the
Home Secretary to protect the health and welfare of children attending film
shows. Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from the
licensing authority, which may impose conditions. There are about 800
children’s cinema clubs which provide special programmes on Saturday
mornings. An important contribution to these programmes is made by the
Children’s Film Foundation, which, with the aid of grants from the British
Film Fund Agency, produces and distributes entertainment films specially
designed for children.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, winning many international prizes and commissions for major
works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at home has
been stimulated by an increasingly lively attitude towards display on the part
of museums and galleries, and by the activities of many institutions, societies,
private galleries and the growing number of local art centres.

State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of mainten¬
ance and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase
grants for municipal museums and galleries, and grants towards the cost of
local education authority art education. The Government is advised on grants
and policy towards museums by the Standing Commission on Museums and
Galleries.
The Government also encourages high standards of industrial design and
craftsmanship through grants to the Design Council and craft organisations.
In addition to direct state assistance, the Arts Council runs the Hayward
Gallery in London, where major loan exhibitions are shown, maintains its own
collection of contemporary British art, and organises or offers grants or guaran¬
tees towards a variety of touring and other exhibitions. It also supports art
societies and independent galleries, and provides commissions and awards for
artists.
London is a major centre for the international art market. Exports and imports
of works of art in 1970-71 were estimated at £53 million and £56 million
respectively. Objects which are less than 100 years old or which have been
imported within the last 50 years can always be exported, but permission to
export works over 100 years old worth over £2,000 which have been in Britain
for more than 50 years, may be refused if they are regarded by the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art to be of national importance. This
is normally done only if a public museum or art gallery can offer to purchase
the object at a fair price.
Over 900 museums and art galleries are open to the public in Britain. These
include the major national collections together with a wide variety of munici¬
pally and independently owned institutions.
Of the national museums and art galleries, those in London probably contain
between them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within
one city. They are the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum,
the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the
Imperial War Museum, the National Army Museum, the National Maritime
Museum, the London Museum (to be amalgamated with the Guildhall Museum
into the Museum of London), the Wallace Collection, the British Museum
(Natural History), the Geological Museum and the Science Museum (see
p. 403).
There are three national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the
National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum
(including the Scottish United Services Museum), and the National Galleries
of Scotland (comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the National
Portrait Gallery of Scotland, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern
Art). The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St. Fagan’s
Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed-, and in Northern Ireland
there is the national Ulster Museum in Belfast.
Most of the national museums and galleries are administered by trustee
bodies, but the Victoria and Albert and Science Museums are the direct
responsibility of the Department of Education and Science, while the Royal
Scottish Museum is run by the Scottish Education Department.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (Power of
London), the Public Record Office (see p. 420) and the Sir John Soane’s

Museum. In Buckingham Palace there is a small gallery for exhibition of
pictures from the extensive royal collections. Most cities and large towns and
many other towns have a museum devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes by a local
learned society or privately by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and
Cambridge are rich in museums, many of them, as in other towns, associated
with the universities—for example, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford,
founded in 1683, the oldest in the country, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in
Cambridge. There are important museums and art galleries in Birmingham,
Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich, Read¬
ing, Southampton and York. In Northern Ireland there are notable museums
and galleries in or near Belfast (the Ulster Folk Museum and the Northern
Ireland Arts Council Gallery), in Armagh City and in Londonderry. Many
private art collections housed in historic family mansions, including those in
the ownership of the National Trust (see p. 169), are open to the public.
A function of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries is to
advise the Government on the relationship between national and provincial
institutions. Close relations are fostered by the eight area museum councils
which cover the whole of Great Britain. They are grant-aided by the Govern¬
ment and help to improve technical facilities.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. The Association serves as a central
body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating
to museum administration, and as a training and examining body for profes¬
sional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions organised and sent on tour by the Arts Councils, the
Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science
Museum and the Art Exhibitions Bureau are a regular feature of many
museums. The Hayward Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the British Museum, the
Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal Academy are the main centres for
loan exhibitions; these are also held at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, the
Camden Arts Centre and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. The Greater
London Council exhibits modern sculpture in its parks periodically. Com¬
mercial exhibitions of works by old masters and living artists are held through¬
out the year in the galleries of the art dealers of London (largely in the Bond
Street area).
There are a number of national art exhibiting societies, some of which,
notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in
London. An increasing number of amateur art societies throughout Britain
hold local exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts. There are
also exhibitions of children’s art, including the National Exhibition of Chil¬
dren’s Art sponsored annually by the Sunday Mirror.
All national collections are financed chiefly from government funds. Besides
meeting the administrative and maintenance costs, the government makes
provision for annual purchase grants which totalled £2-25 million in 1972-73.
It also provides special ad hoc purchase grants, and collections may receive
works of art acquired by the Treasury in lieu of estate duty. Under the 1972
Finance Bill, the Government is proposing that property going to public
collections should be exempt from estate duty without limit and that gifts
to these collections should be exempt from capital gains tax.

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government proposes to introduce admission charges to museums and
galleries. The rate will be lop for adults (zop in July and August) and 5p
(throughout the year) for children aged 3-16 and retirement pensioners. The
proceeds, expected to amount to about £ 1 million a year, will be used by the
institutions towards meeting their running expenses, so reducing the amount
of grant needed for this purpose.
Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or endow¬
ments, can be helped in building up their collections through the annual
government grant (£162,000 in 1972-73) administered by the Victoria and
Albert and Royal Scottish Museums. Financial help and pictures are also
given to museums and galleries by certain trusts and voluntary bodies, particu¬
larly the National Art-Collections Fund and the Contemporary Art Society.
Art and design education is provided in maintained colleges of art, colleges of
further education and polytechnics, which are administered by local education
authorities. Other institutions offering art and design courses include univer¬
sities, the Royal Academy Schools and some private art schools. At post¬
graduate level there is the Royal College of Art which awards its own degrees.
Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central (Art)
Institutions administered by the Scottish Education Department. University
art schools include the Slade School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths’ College
(London), the Ruskin Drawing School (Oxford), the Reading School of Art,
the Department of Fine Art of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, and
the School of Art of University College, Aberystwyth.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history
of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Depart¬
ment of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and
the Warburg Institute, also a part of London University.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland three-year full-time courses lead¬
ing to a Diploma in Art and Design are available to students who have success¬
fully completed a foundation course. The Diploma is broadly comparable to a
university pass degree, and is administered by the National Council for
Diplomas in Art and Design (an independent body set up by the Government
in 1961). The Council also administers a scheme of post-diploma studies in a
small number of colleges. In Scotland each of the four schools of art awards
a diploma which is roughly equivalent to the pass degree of a university and
three award associateships, which are comparable with an honours degree. The
Ulster College of Art and Design is the regional college for Northern Ireland.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society
for Education through Art, among other activities, encourages the purchase
by schools of original works of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools
exhibition. Pictures may also be borrowed from an increasing number of public
libraries (see p. 421).
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with
encouraging the best in new building and preserving the best that has been
inherited from the past (for preservation, see p. 173).
Several government departments are concerned with architecture and help
to promote good design. The Department of the Environment is responsible
for the design, building and maintenance work of government departments
and has a research directorate which co-ordinates building research groups
throughout the government service. It also provides advice to local authorities
in England and Wales on the best standards of housing design through a series

Associations

AND LIBRARIES

of Design Bulletins, and offers annual awards for the best housing designs in
both public and private sectors. Other government departments, such as the
Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and
Social Security, provide design advice and exercise design control over
buildings—such as schools and hospitals—falling within their field of responsi¬
bility.
Government departments are assisted in an advisory capacity by the Royal
Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland, which also
advise planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance, including new building developments.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions
exist to further the interests of architecture, and the Civic Trust (see p. 169)
seeks to promote high standards in architecture and civic planning and to
encourage interest in the appearance and protection of town and countryside.
In Britain it is illegal for a person to practise under the title of ‘architect’
unless registered with the Architects’ Registration Council of the United
Kingdom. Most students train at a full-time school of architecture; there are
33 schools recognised for exemption from the examination in architecture of
the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). In addition to these schools,
four of which also have part-time courses, there are five other schools which
have courses leading to the RIBA external examination.
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional archi¬
tectural institution with a membership of over 20,000 in Britain and 5,000
overseas and over 6,500 students. Allied to it are 124 architectural societies
covering the whole of the United Kingdom and countries overseas. The
RIBA has one of the largest and most important architectural libraries in
the world. It is concerned with a wide range of activities covering professional
practice, science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions, and pro¬
fessional and public relations; arranges lectures and discussions on a variety
of subjects; presents exhibitions; and, through its Board of Education,
exercises control over standards of architectural education. Among other
associations are the Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors,
the Institute of Registered Architects and the Faculty of Architects and
Surveyors. Societies include the Architectural Association, the Architecture
Club, and several which cover particular aspects of architecture, such as the
Modular Society.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges
and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country, private
libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews are
featured in the press and on radio and television and there are numerous
periodicals concerned with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary merit
is given in the form of literary prizes, a number of which are awarded annually,
for instance, the Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry, the Hawthornden prize for
imaginative writing, and the Somerset Maugham award for young writers.
Government help is given through the Arts Council of Great Britain
which supports literature in a number of ways, including grants for writers,
a fund to aid literary projects, and subsidies to festivals of literature and poetry.
Similar provision is made through the Arts Council of Northern Ireland for
bursaries, poetry readings, and aid for publications.
The British Museum Library in London (with an estimated 8 million-9
million volumes) is the largest in Britain. The National Libraries of Scotland
420
Libraries in
Education
Public Libraries
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(in Edinburgh) and Wales (in Aberystwyth) both have over 2 million volumes.
Together with the Bodleian Library of Oxford University (3-5 million volumes)
and the Cambridge University Library (4 million volumes) these comprise the
‘copyright’ libraries of the country and are entitled to receive a copy of each
new book published in Britain: the British Museum Library must receive a
copy, the other libraries may claim one.
Together with the British Museum Library and its associated department,
the National Reference Library of Science and Invention (see p. 403), the
principal national libraries are the National Central Library (see p. 421) and the
National Lending Library for Science and Technology (see p. 403). Under
government proposals all four libraries are to be amalgamated (along with the
British National Bibliography) into a new organisation to be known as the
British Library. The reference facilities of the British Library will be concen¬
trated eventually on a site in Bloomsbury, London (near to the British
Museum), while lending facilities will be situated in Yorkshire.
The Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum (Natural History)
in South Kensington also have large libraries and many government depart¬
ments have old-established libraries of considerable size and importance. The
Public Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of law and of
most government departments, as well as such famous historical documents
as Domesday Book. The National Register of Archives (maintained by the
Historical Manuscripts Commission) contains particulars of local and private
records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the Signet Library,
Edinburgh, and the London Library, there are the rich resources of the
learned societies and institutions (for scientific societies and institutions, see
p. 392). Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International
Affairs, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society,
the British Drama League (see p. 410), the Royal Academy of Music, the
National Library for the Blind and the National Book League.
The great expansion in education in recent years has increased the strain on
library resources at all levels of education. The ancient university libraries of
Oxford and Cambridge are not matched by any of the more recent foundations,
although the combined library resources of the colleges and institutions of the
university of London total about 5 million volumes, the John Rylands Uni¬
versity Library in Manchester contains more than 2 million volumes, and the
university libraries of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Birmingham each have over
three-quarters of a million volumes. Many universities have succeeded in
building up large and important research collections in special subjects; for
example, the Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham and the Brotherton
Library of English Literature at Leeds. The new universities, including the
new technological universities, are also rapidly building collections and sub¬
stantial collections are being assembled in the libraries of polytechnics and
colleges of education.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, often receive co-operation from the public library service, includ¬
ing loans of books. Schoolchildren are regularly introduced to the public
library system, which they can use in addition to the school library.
Britain is served by a complete network of public libraries, administered by
472 public library authorities (county councils, county borough councils,
London borough councils, municipal borough councils and urban district
THE ARTS
421
Library
Co-operation
Library
Associations
councils). The authorities, which provide nearly 11,000 service points, have a
total stock of nearly 113 million books. (The figures do not include the libraries
in the publicly maintained schools.) Qualified and specialist staff are available
for consultation in all but the smallest service points. Nearly one-third of the
total population are members of public libraries.
Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 the Secretary of State
for Education and Science is charged with the supervision of the public library
service in England and in Wales, acting on the advice of two Library Advisory
Councils. Under the Act, public library authorities are designated and have a
duty to provide an efficient and (with some limitations) free lending and refer¬
ence library service for books and periodicals. Outlying areas may be served
by mobile libraries, of which over 560 are in service, and facilities exist for
people who are unable to visit a library.
In addition to lending books, about a third of the library authorities now
lend gramophone records of various kinds and a growing number are adding
loan collections of works of art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all
library authorities provide children’s departments, and reference sections and
art, music, commercial and technical departments meet the growing and more
specific demands in these fields. Most library authorities possess a significant
collection of books and documents on the history of their localities.
The public library is often a local cultural centre. Film shows, lectures,
adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramophone
recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities.
A voluntary system of library co-operation in England and Wales has grown
up since the first quarter of this century. The eight regional library bureaux
in England and Wales (consisting mainly of public libraries in each area) aim
to be largely self-sufficient in the interlending of current British books by
means of a system of co-operative subject specialisation. They organise co¬
operation among themselves and through the National Central Library, which
is responsible for interlending at national and international level and has a
bookstock of its own of about 650,000 volumes, including United States
academic books in the humanities and social services. The combined resources
of libraries available to the National Central Library, which include university,
industrial and other non-public libraries, amount to many million books and
many thousand sets of periodicals. A major contribution to inter-library lend¬
ing is made by the National Lending Library for Science and Technology
(see p. 403).
There is a growing number of schemes for the exchange of specialist books
and periodicals as well as information. These involve industrial, commercial
and sometimes university libraries and are normally centred on a major public
or technical college library.
The Scottish Central Library carries out functions similar to those of the
regional bureaux and the National Central Library. Both Central Libraries
are financed mainly by Exchequer grants. In Northern Ireland access to the
stocks of all co-operating libraries is available on application to the Belfast
public libraries, Queen’s University Library and the county libraries.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association, which,
among other functions, holds examinations in librarianship and issues certificates
of efficiency. The Association in May 1972 had a membership of over 20,645 of
whom more than 1,718 were from overseas countries. It maintains a Register
of Chartered Librarians, publishes books, pamphlets and official journals, and
holds regular conferences. There are also associations of libraries of which
422

Societies
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (see p. 404)
and the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries are of
major importance.
In 1971 British publishers issued 31,598 separate titles, of which 22,961 were
new books and the rest reprints or new editions. The above figures include
only a small selection of government publications by Her Majesty’s Stationery
Office, which is the largest publishing organisation in Britain. An increasing
proportion of books—including a wide range of specialised non-fiction—is
now sold in paper-back form; Penguin Books are the best known publishers
of paper-backs.
Using copies deposited under copyright law, the British National Biblio¬
graphy is published weekly, with three, six, nine and twelve monthly cumula¬
tions, listing in a classified order, with indexes, all new books and new editions,
excluding reprints, of books published in Britain.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers’ Association; the Book Development Council promotes British
books overseas. (For sales and exports of books in 1971, see p. 309). The
National Book League has a membership covering all who are interested in
books; authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and readers. It encourages
an interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain and overseas.
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and
the Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of
Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies, generally known as the
British Academy, is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives a
grant from the Treasury.
A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals; the Poetry
Society and the Apollo Society are among the best known. Poetry also plays
an important part in various annual festivals, including the National
Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales—the Stratford-upon-Avon
Festival of Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, and the annual
poetry festival organised by the Poetry Book Society in London.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. There are a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new
books to their members.
19 THE PRESS
Ownership
The British press caters for all political views, different levels of education and
a wide range of interests. It is not subject to State control or censorship.
A large number of newspapers are sold in Britain every day, and although
there are relatively few national newspapers, some of them have circulations
comparable with the greatest in any other part of the world: average daily
sales amount to about million copies per newspaper; individual audited
circulation figures range from about 188,000 to nearly 4^ million.
The national newspapers (daily and Sunday) fall into two categories: popu¬
lar and quality. The tabloid format is more commonly used by the former and
the broadsheet format by the latter. Prices range from £0-03 to £0-06 for
dailies and from £0-05 to ^0-09 for Sundays. Separate sections or pages on
finance, business or industry are common, and some papers carry special
supplements on particular subjects, with related advertising. The quality
Sunday newspapers have separate sections for literature and the arts, business
and industry, as well as colour magazine supplements. Free colour magazine
supplements are published by one morning and two Sunday newspapers: the
Daily Telegraph, the Sunday Times and The Observer.
According to The Newspaper Press Directory1 142 daily and Sunday news¬
papers and some 1,200 weekly newspapers are published in Britain. These
figures include certain specialised papers, the circulation of which is limited
not by region, but by interest; for instance, business newspapers, sporting
newspapers, newspapers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other
lands resident in Britain and religious newspapers.
Britain imports just over half its newsprint requirements, nearly million
tons annually, while the rest is made from imported raw materials.
Newspaper ownership in Britain, as it affects the national daily and Sunday,
London evening and regional daily newspapers, is concentrated mainly in the
hands of a comparatively small number of large press groups. Although most
enterprises are organised as limited liability companies, individual and
partner proprietorship survives. The seven major newspaper and periodical
publishers are: International Publishing Corporation Limited; Associated
Newspapers Limited; Beaverbrook Newspapers Limited; the Thomson
Organisation Limited; News of the World Organisation; United Newspapers
Limited; and Pearson-Longman Limited.
The large national newspaper and periodical publishers are major corpora¬
tions with diversified interests over the whole field of publishing and com¬
munications, and some have shares in the independent television contracting
companies.
Although pronounced views may be expressed in newspapers and their
political leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any
1 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the
1972 edition of The Nezvspaper Press Directory.
424 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
political party and not obliged to follow any specific party line.1 In order to
preserve their character and traditions, a few newspapers and periodicals are
governed by arrangements which vest ownership of the undertaking in trustees,
or operate it in accordance with a deed of trust, or provide that the transfer
of shares be in the hands of trustees. Others have management arrangements
intended to ensure the authority and independence of the editors.
Safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentration of the means
of communication are provided in certain Acts of Parliament, for instance, in
the Television Act 1963 which stipulates that, if it appears to the Independent
Television Authority at any time that newspaper shareholdings in television
programme companies have led or are leading to results which are contrary to
the public interest, the Authority may, with the consent of the Minister of
Posts and Telecommunications, notify the companies that their programmes
may cease to be transmitted; and in the Sound Broadcasting Act i972> which
makes a similar stipulation for radio and provides that if a local newspaper has
a monopoly in the area, it should not be allowed to have a controlling interest
in the local radio station. In addition the Monopolies and Mergers Act 19652
empowers the Department of Trade and Industry to control the transfer of a
newspaper or newspaper assets to a newspaper proprietor whose newspapers
have an average daily circulation amounting, with that of the newspaper to be
taken over, to 500,000 or more copies—the department, in some cases, referring
the matter to the Monopolies Commission for enquiry and report.
The ‘National* Nine morning papers are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout the
Press British Isles, and there are seven national Sunday papers (see Table 36). All
the national dailies are produced in London, but those with big circulations
also print northern editions in Manchester, and the Daily Express has a
Scottish edition printed in Glasgow. The leading Scottish papers {The
Scotsman and The Glasgow Herald) have a considerable circulation outside
Scotland. Each of the (two) London evening papers has ownership affiliations
with a national daily, but both have their distinctive style, drawing their
readership very largely from people living in and around London.
English The regional newspapers of England (86 morning or evening dailies and
Regional Sundays and about 750 newspapers appearing once or twice a week) provide
Newspapers mainly regional and local news. Some of the daily newspapers also give ex¬
tensive coverage to national affairs, and a number co-operate to provide their
own foreign news service. The leading regional newspapers have wide regional
circulations; a few have nation-wide reputations.
Generally speaking, regional evening newspapers are non-political, while
the morning newspapers are independent or conservative in outlook.
The total circulation of the regional morning and evening papers is estimated
at about 8 million. Of the morning papers the Liverpool Daily Post, the I ork-
shire Post (Leeds) and the Northern Echo (Darlington) have circulations of over
100,000 and two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon
Tyne) and the Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)—have circulations of over
200,000. Individual circulation figures of regional evening papers start at
about 20,000; most are in the 50,000-100,000 range; a few have circulations of
between 200,000 and 420,000. Weekly papers are mainly of local appeal, they

are also a valuable medium for local advertising. Most have circulations in the
8,000-35,000 range.
In recent years there has been a growth of free distribution newspapers
(without cover price), some of which are published by orthodox newspaper
publishers.
The London local weeklies (158) include papers for every district in Greater
London. They are assembled mainly in groups of six to eight, affiliated in some
cases to larger groups.
A number of new evening newspapers, using the latest production tech¬
nology, have recently been started in the outer metropolitan area on the fringe
of the circulation areas of the two London evening newspapers.
Scotland
Northern
Ireland
Scotland has five morning, seven evening and two Sunday newspapers, in
addition to the Scottish editions of the Daily Express and Sunday Express. The
leading morning papers are The Scotsman, published in Edinburgh, and The
Glasgow Herald. Others are: the Daily Record, published in Glasgow; the
Courier and Advertiser, published in Dundee; and the Press and Journal of
Aberdeen. Evening papers include the Evening News of Edinburgh, Glasgow s
Evening Times and Evening Citizen, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and Post,
Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock
Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Post both
of which are published in Glasgow.
Weekly and local newspapers published in Scotland number about 135- The
most widely known are the People’s Journal, which has several local editions,
and the Weekly News.
Northern Ireland has two morning newspapers, one evening paper and one
Sunday paper, all published in Belfast: they are The News-Letter (Unionist)
and the Irish News (Nationalist), the evening Belfast Telegraph and the Sunday
News. There are 40 weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland, with circulations
ranging from about 5,000 to over 25,000. The majority are published by
individual companies.
Wales
Channel

Isle of Man
The
Periodical
Press
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in
Cardiff; it circulates mainly in southern Wales. In North Wales the Liverpool
Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening papers pub¬
lished in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South Wales Argus,
Newport, and the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea. North Wales is served
by the Liverpool Echo and to a smaller extent by the Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (some 50 papers) includes English language papers, some
of which carry articles in Welsh; and ten papers in Welsh, of which five are
denominational.
The Channel Islands have two daily (evening) papers (one in Guernsey and
one in Jersey) and two weeklies, which also circulate in Alderney and Sark.
In the Isle of Man there are five weekly newspapers of which the Isle of
Man Examiner has the largest circulation.
There are over 4,250 periodical publications in Britain, classified as general,
‘specialised’, ‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’. There are also some 540
‘house magazines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or
public services for the benefit of their employees and/or clients.
News Agencies
THE PRESS 427
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all
denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,
hobbies and humour; journals specialising in various subjects such as politics,
finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts; and the
publications of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and
other associations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales in Britain are: Woman;
Woman’s Weekly; Woman’s Own; Weekend; and Woman’s Realm; together
with the Radio Times and TV Times. The leading journals of opinion are
The Economist, a politically independent publication covering topics from a
wider angle than its title implies; the New Statesman, which is a review of
politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist political tendency;
the Spectator, which covers much the same subjects from an independent
conservative standpoint; Tribune, which has a strongly left-wing but anti¬
communist bias; New Society, which covers the sociological aspects of current
affairs; and New Scientist, which reports on the progress of science and tech¬
nology in terms which the non-specialist can understand. Punch, traditionally
the leading humorous periodical, has in recent years devoted increasing
attention to public affairs.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, appeal generally
speaking to the more serious type of reader.
The publication of trade, technical, and professional journals (covering
some 500 subjects, many of them in considerable depth) has become one of the
more important aspects of the British publishing industry. In addition to
circulating in Britain, these journals have a considerable circulation outside
the United Kingdom and are an important medium for selling British goods
overseas. Their publication ranges in frequency from weekly to quarterly.
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout the United Kingdom.
Weekly papers are also published in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland:
in Wales several monthly and quarterly journals in both Welsh and English;
in Scotland four monthly illustrated periodicals (Scottish Field, Scotland’s
Magazine, Scots Magazine and Scotland), a weekly paper devoted to farming

famous is probably Blackwood’s, and numerous popular magazines; and in
Northern Ireland weekly, monthly and quarterly publications covering farm¬
ing, the linen industry, building, motoring, politics and social work.
There are three principal British news agencies: Reuters Ltd.; the Press
Association Ltd.; and the Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd.
Reuters Ltd. is a world news agency owned by the newspapers of the United
Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand through the Newspaper Publishers
Association, the Press Association, the Australian Associated Press and the
New Zealand Press Association, which are parties to a trust agreement to
safeguard the independence and integrity of the news service. Founded in
Aix-la-Chapelle in 1850 and transferred to London in 1851, Reuters now has
about 1,000 correspondents in 180 countries and territories, and links with 77
national or private news agencies, which give it access to coverage by many
thousands of local reporters. Between 600,000 and 700,000 words of general
news, sports, and economic services reports are received in London every day
over a global network of leased cable and radio circuits. From these messages
regionalised news services, specially tailored to the needs of recipients in the

United Kingdom and eight main overseas regions, are transmitted to 120
countries for distribution to information media, either direct or through
national news agencies. Reuters Economic Services supply up-to-the-minute
information to business houses throughout the world. Its computerised sys¬
tems, including Stockmaster, Videoscan and Videomaster, offer virtually in¬
stant coverage of the important stock and commodity markets by computer
interrogation or video display. A computerised message-handling system,
known as the Automatic Data Exchange, is used to speed up the handling and
distribution of news.
The Press Association Ltd., the British national news agency founded in
1868, is co-operatively owned by the principal newspapers of the United
Kingdom outside London, and the Republic of Ireland. It provides news¬
papers, the broadcasting organisations, Reuters (of which it is a major joint
owner) and other international agencies with a complete service of home news,
including general and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all branches of
financial, commercial and sports news; and includes in its services to regional
papers the world news of Reuters and the Associated Press. News is tele-
printed 24 hours a day from head office in Fleet Street over a network of lines
leased from the Post Office—certain items being available in teletypesetting
form.
Through its Photographic Department the Press Association serves London
and regional newspapers with a daily picture service, including its own world
photos and those of the Associated Press. Its Special Reporting Service
supplies reports of local or special interest to daily and weekly papers and
periodicals. All profits are used to develop the service.
The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel), an independent news
agency founded in 1872, is a public company with over 1,000 shareholders,
which supplies financial and sporting news to newspapers and broadcasting
organisations. Racing services are also supplied by teleprinter and telephone
to subscribers in London and the provinces from offices in all important
cities and towns.
The British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by
Associated Press Ltd., which is the British operating company of the Associa¬
ted Press of America, and by United Press International, an international
news agency with a headquarters in London.
A number of other United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign agencies
and news services have offices in London, and there are agencies in othei
cities, specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical require¬
ments. Syndication of features is not as common in the United Kingdom as
in some countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
The Printing and Publishing Industry Training Board (PPITB) is responsible
for training in the printing, publishing and professional photography indus¬
tries. The responsibilities of the board (which has a chairman, a deputy
chairman and 22 members, representing employer, employee and educational
interests) include the formulation of training schemes, the establishment of
standards, ensuring that adequate facilities exist, and the provision of a
regional advisory service.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), composed of
the major representative organisations in journalism and the pi ess, works in
partnership with the Board. Its functions include superintending activities
concerning entry into journalism, setting and conducting examinations; and
organising short training courses and seminars for journalists.

There are two normal methods of entry to newspaper journalism: (1) by
selection for a place on a full-time course lasting for one academic year and
(2) by direct recruitment to a regional or local newspaper. Students selected
for a pre-entry course must have gained two passes at the Advanced level of the
General Certificate of Education (GCE) and be under the age of 20 at the
beginning of a course. Some pre-entry students are sponsored by newspapers;
the others are assisted by the NCTJ to find employment on completion of the
course. The minimum educational requirement for direct entry is five GCE
passes at Ordinary level.
Under collective agreements between the employers’ associations in pub¬
lishing and the National Union of Journalists, systematic training under
NCTJ arrangements is obligatory for all entrants to the regional and local
newspaper publishing sector under the age of 31. The scheme consists of
on-the-job training, and block-release courses for those who have not attended
a pre-entry course. A similar syllabus covering practical journalism, shorthand,
use of language, law, government and current affairs is used at both kinds of
course. Seven centres (five in England, one in Wales, and one in Scotland)
provide courses for reporters and there is one centre for newspaper photo¬
graphers.
All entrants to regional and local newspapers who are under the age of 24
serve an apprenticeship of three years (two years in the case of graduates).
For direct entrants apprenticeship follows six months’ probation. Entrants
from pre-entry courses serve three months’ probation, after which apprentice¬
ship is back-dated to the start of the probation period. At the end of their
apprenticeship trainees take a proficiency test which carries a salary bonus.
Both the PPITB and the NCTJ have given attention to the development of
comparable arrangements for entrants to periodical publishing. NCTJ
accredited courses are available in central London (where the greater part of
the periodical publishing sector is situated) and the PPITB has drawn up a
recommendation on systematic training for the editorial staff of periodicals to
facilitate the preparation of in-company schemes.
Whilst most training in journalism in Britain takes place at below university
level and there are no courses offering degrees in journalism, the University
College, Cardiff, Centre for Journalism Studies has a one-year postgraduate
diploma course in journalism which is available to any holder of a degree from
a British university or a recognised equivalent. The University of Warwick
provides a management course for newspaper executives in conjunction with
the Newspaper Publishers Association. In addition a wide range of training
courses, covering circulation, advertising, industrial relations and supervisory
management are provided for the regional newspaper industry by the News¬
paper Society Training Service and for the national newspapers by the News¬
paper Publishers Association. Short general management courses are also run
in conjunction with the University of Aston in Birmingham.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Travelling Fellowship Scheme for
the training and education of young journalists throughout the Common¬
wealth, about eight journalists from overseas spend five months in the United
Kingdom each year, two months in the offices of newspapers or periodicals
and three months acquiring a general idea of life in Britain. A limited number
of travelling scholarships are also awarded to British journalists to enable
them to visit Commonwealth countries overseas.
The Thomson Foundation offers scholarships and organises training
courses for journalists from all parts of the world at its Centre in Cardiff,
and provides consultants and tutors for courses for journalists overseas.

The Commonwealth Secretariat is developing a plan for inter-Common-
wealth training arrangements in journalism and communications, based on a
combination of indigenous schemes and training exchanges.
The most important organisations to which employers in the industry belong
are the Newspaper Publishers Association, whose members publish national
newspapers in London and Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which
represents the regional, local and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily
Newspaper Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday news¬
papers in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which
represents the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern
Ireland Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines. On the journalists side there are the
Institute of Journalists (loj), founded in 1884 as the National Association
of Journalists, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in 1907.
All practising journalists (including those engaged in radio, television, public
relations and freelance journalism) are eligible for membership of either of
these organisations. Total membership is about 28,000 (NUJ about 26,000,
loj about 2,000).
The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of
editors, to protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the
education and training of journalists: the Guild has about 40° members. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong.
The Printing and Kindred Trades Federation is the federation of the print¬
ing trade unions which include the National Graphical Association, the
National Society of Operative Printers, Graphical and Media Personnel
(NATSOPA), the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT), the
Scottish Typographical Association, the Society of Lithographic Artists,
Designers and Engravers (SLADE) and the National Union of Journalists.
The Press Council, established in 1953 and reconstituted in 1963, has a lay
chairman and 25 members. Its aims are: to preserve the established freedom
of the British press; to maintain the character of the British press in ac¬
cordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct
of the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press, to
report on developments in the British press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly; to make representation on appropriate occasions
to the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodical reports recording its work,
and to review from time to time developments in the British Press and the
factors affecting them. In fulfilment of these aims, the council carries out the
main centralised research work into the press and the communications industry
generally, and publishes annual reports, which include statistics of the news¬
paper and periodical press and a series of articles examining the structure of
the leading press groups.
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say
what it likes provided it does not transgress the law; in general, it is at liberty

to comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments relating
directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers for postal purposes,
there are no specific press laws but certain statutes include clauses which
apply, in particular or incidentally, to the press. These relate to such matters
as the extent of newspaper ownership in television and radio companies; the
transfer of newspaper assets; restrictions on reporting of preliminary hear¬
ings of indictable offences (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland); the
right of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local authorities;
restrictions on the publication of {a) divorce and domestic proceedings in
courts of law, {b) advertisement and investment circulars, which are governed
by Acts dealing with the publication of false or misleading descriptions of
goods and services and with fraud and (c) advertisements of remedies for
certain diseases, which are covered by public health legislation; agreements
between the Post Office and newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communica¬
tions, which must comply with telegraphs legislation; restrictions on certain
types of prize competition; and copyrights, which come under copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the work of the press are the laws on libel,
defamation and contempt of court. A newspaper may not publish comments
on the conduct of judicial proceedings which are likely to prejudice their
reputation for fairness before or during the actual proceedings nor may it
publish before or during a trial anything which might tend to influence the
result. The obtaining and publication of information from state and official
sources of a confidential or security nature is affected by the Official Secrets
Acts. Newspapers are also liable to proceedings for seditious libel and incite¬
ment to disaffection.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority of actions that do take place are libel actions1 brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be
held responsible.
1 In view of public anxiety about the severity of some penal damages in libel cases, the
uncertainty about liability for contempt of court and the application of official secrets
legislation, the Government has set up three committees to enquire into these aspects of
the law.
20 BROADCASTING
Broadcasting
Authorities
Broadcasting by television and radio in Britain is regulated by the Minister of
Posts and Telecommunications under the Wireless 1 elegraphy Acts 1949-
1967, which prohibit the sending or receiving of wireless communications,
except under licence.
Two public bodies—the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the
Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)—are licensed to provide television
and radio broadcasting services. The BBC, which was established by Royal
Charter in 1927, operates two national television services, four national radio
services and 19 local radio stations 5 it also broadcasts to countries abroad
through its external services division. The IBA, originally established in 1954
as the Independent Television Authority, controls the operation of the single
independent television service and is to have similar responsibility for a net¬
work of local commercial radio stations which is being established (see p. 43).
The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications has powers to control the
hours of radio and television broadcasting. Since January 1972, however, he
has allowed the broadcasting organisations to determine the extent of broad¬
casting on each of their domestic services.
Users of television sets must obtain an annual receiving licence, which can
be bought from most post offices. Licences for sets receiving black and white
pictures cost £7 a year, and for those receiving colour pictures £12 a year.
There were some 16-8 million receiving licences current in Britain in June 1972
of which over 14*8 million were for black and white, and nearly 2 million for
colour television.
Both the BBC and the IBA are constitutionally required to provide a ‘public
service’ with the purpose of disseminating information, education and
entertainment. The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by
the new Royal Charter granted in 1964 and by the Licence and Agreement of
1969, and those of the IBA by the Television Act 1964, the Sound Broadcasting
Act 1972 and its 1969 Licence. . . . 1 j j
The BBC and the IBA are independent authorities in the day-to-day
operations of broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The
Government, however, retains ultimate control, and the Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications is answerable to Parliament on broad questions of policy
and may issue directions to the BBC and the IBA on a number of technical
and other subjects. Both organisations are expected to show balance and due
impartiality in their general presentation of programmes, particularly where
matters of public policy or controversial subjects are concerned, and in this
connection the Minister has powers to prohibit the broadcasting of any
particular item or class of item, or to revoke the licences of the BBC or IBA
at any time. These are treated as major reserve powers and no formal veto
has ever been placed on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC
and the IBA are required to prepare annual reports and accounts which are
presented to Parliament.

Authority
The Corporation consists of 12 governors (including a chairman, a vice-
chairman and separate national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland), each appointed for a period of not more than five years by the
Queen on the advice of the Government. The governors are constitutionally
responsible for the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation, including
the production and presentation of the programmes on television and radio,
and the provision and working of the necessary installations and equipment.
A number of committees advise them on such matters as the social effects of
television, religious broadcasting, music, agriculture, school broadcasting,
further education, programmes for immigrants, science and engineering and
charitable appeals. The governors appoint the chief executive officer of the
BBC—the Director General—with whom they discuss all major matters of
policy and finance. He is chairman of the Corporation’s board of management,
which also includes his chief assistant, the managing directors for television,
radio and external broadcasting, the directors of programmes for television
and radio, and the directors of personnel, finance, public affairs and engineer¬
ing.
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales control the
policy and content of television and radio programmes intended primarily
for reception in their respective countries. Local radio councils, representative
of the local community, are appointed by the BBC to help in the development
and operation of local radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally by an annual
grant voted by Parliament (£111-7 million in 1971-72) which is the income from
the sale of television receiving licences less certain deductions for collection
and other expenses. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities,
including domestic sales of magazines and other publications dealing with
BBC radio and television programmes and overseas sales of programmes.
Nearly three-quarters of the BBC’s expenditure on domestic services relates
to television. Though the BBC meets the basic cost of local radio stations,
local authorities within their catchment areas are encouraged to contribute.
The BBC’s external services are financed by a grant determined each year
by the Government; in 1971-72 this amounted to some £14 million.
The Independent Broadcasting Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and, at present, nine other members (three of whom have responsi¬
bility for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) appointed by the Minister
of Posts and Telecommunications. The IB A does not itself produce television
programmes; these are provided on a regional basis by commercial programme
companies. The authority’s four main functions are to appoint the programme
companies, to control the programme output, to control the advertising and to
build, own and operate the transmitting stations for the independent television
(ITV) network. It has been given similar functions with regard to the proposed
local commercial radio network (see p. 436).
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broad¬
casting, religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist
panel advises on medical and allied advertisements. Local advisory committees
are to provide advice on local radio services.
The chief executive officer of the IBA is the Director General. There are
also two deputy directors general, and a headquarters and regional office staff
covering all technical and administrative services.
The IBA receives no payments from licence revenue; the finance for its

operations is drawn from annual rental payments made to it by the television
programme companies which amounted to about £11 million in the year ended
March 1972. The programme companies also pay to the IB A for transfer to the
Exchequer a further sum (the levy) related to their advertising revenue; in the
year ended March 1972 this amounted to some £11 million.
Fifteen programme companies hold six-year contracts to provide television
programmes in the 14 independent television regions of Britain (two com¬
panies share the contract for London, one providing programmes during
the week and the other at the weekend). The companies operate on a commer¬
cial basis, deriving their revenue from the sale of advertising time. The financial
resources, advertising revenue, and programme production of the companies
vary considerably, depending largely on the size of population in their areas.
(There are 4-3 million homes receiving independent television in London as
against only 32,000 in the Channel Islands.)
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the pro¬
grammes to be broadcast in its area. These consist partly of material produced
by the company itself, partly of that produced by the other programme com¬
panies, and partly of that purchased from elsewhere. The five largest com¬
panies (Thames, ATV, Granada, Yorkshire and London Weekend) produce a
larger proportion of their own programmes and provide more programmes
for broadcast elsewhere on the national network than do the smaller ones.
A common news service is provided by Independent Television News
Limited, a non-profit-making-company in which all the programme com¬
panies are shareholders. The negotiations concerning the supply, exchange
and purchase of programmes and their co-ordinated transmission through
the independent television network take place largely on the Network Planning
Committee which consists of representatives of all the programme companies
and of the IBA.
When a company, on the basis of negotiations with the other companies, has
decided on a programme schedule for its area, it is required to submit this to
the IBA for approval. The authority has wide-ranging powers to control and
regulate the content and quality of programmes; for example, it ensures that a
‘proper balance’ of views is expressed and has drawn up a code on violence
stating that special precautions are to be taken when children are likely to be
viewing. There are also safeguards in the Television Act 1964 and the Sound
Broadcasting Act 1972 to prevent newspaper shareholdings in a programme
company leading to results contrary to the public interest. However, the IBA
believes that newspapers bring valuable qualities to the development of tele¬
vision and radio and is not opposed to investment by them. In certain circum¬
stances local newspapers have a right to a share in the control of local radio
companies.
Television viewing has become by far the most popular recreational activity in
Britain and some 94 per cent of the population now watch television in then
own homes. Average viewing time per head of population in 1970-71 was
over 15 hours a week. There are three television channels: BBC 1 and ITV
which broadcast on both 405 lines very high frequency (vhf) and 625 lines
ultra high frequency (uhf), and BBC 2 which broadcasts on 625 lines uhf
only. Some 99 per cent of the population live within range of vhf, and more
than 80 per cent within range of uhf transmissions. A growing number of
people—nearly half the population in 1972—own uhf receivers, and when most
of the old vhf-only receivers have been replaced the vhf broadcasts of BBC 1

and ITV will cease. Colour programmes were first introduced on BBC 2 in
1967 and were extended to BBC 1 and ITV in 1969 when they began uhf broad¬
casts. A high proportion of programmes on the three uhf services are trans¬
mitted in colour, though receivable also in black and white.
Radio attracts its largest audiences during the day-time when television is
not on the air. In 1970-71 radio listening averaged some 8£ hours a week per
head of population. Among important innovations in recent years have been
the introduction of a separate BBC radio channel providing continuous ‘pop’
music, and the development of local radio.
Apart from a break during the war years the BBC has been providing regular
television broadcasts since 1936. Since 1964 it has operated two services—
BBC 1 and BBC 2. All BBC 2 programmes and the majority of those on BBC 1
are broadcast nationally; in 1970-71 BBC 1 broadcast some 83 hours a week
over the national network and BBC 2 some 42 hours. Though the large majority
of networked programmes are produced in London a substantial minority
originate from regional studios in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and
eight regional centres in England. These studios also originate programmes
of regional news and interest which are inserted into the BBC 1 service for
regional transmission only; these vary from seven hours a week in Wales—many
of them in the Welsh language—to two hours in some of the English regions.
Through co-ordinated planning of programmes on its two services the BBC
is able to cater simultaneously for people of differing interests. While both
services cover the whole range of television output, BBC 1 presents a higher
proportion of programmes of general interest, such as light entertainment,
sports, children’s programmes and outside broadcasts, while BBC 2 places
greater emphasis on minority interests, providing a larger element of news,
documentaries, serious drama and music. Programmes successful on BBC 2
are frequently repeated on BBC 1. Both channels provide a wide range of
education programmes, including seven hours a week of schools broadcasts
on BBC 1 and transmissions of Open University lectures (see p. 158) on BBC 2.
During 1970-71 six BBC television programmes won international awards
and more than 11,000 screen hours of programmes worth more than ^2-5
million were sold to 80 countries overseas.
The first regular independent television broadcasts began in London in 1955.
ITV transmissions are provided on a regional basis by 15 programme com¬
panies. Between them they transmit over 7,500 hours of different programmes
each year, of which 6,500 are produced in the companies’ own studios. During
1970-71 a weekly average of nearly 72 hours of programmes was broadcast
in each of the 14 ITV regions. Of these rather more than half were shown
simultaneously throughout the country via the ITV network, the remainder
including programmes of regional news and interest being transmitted on a
local basis only.
ITV programmes cover the whole range of television output, but include a
high proportion of drama (often in serial form), light entertainment, music,
sport and feature films which together account for 60 per cent of output.
Other items in the weekly programme include news broadcasts and docu¬
mentaries, religious and education programmes. More than one-third of view¬
ing time is filled with ‘serious’ programmes. There are about three short
advertising intervals an hour, in and between programmes.
BBC Radio provides listeners with four alternative national channels, each of
which has a distinct character. Radio 1, broadcasting some 12 hours a day,

provides a programme of ‘pop’ music, while Radio 2, broadcasting over 18
hours a day, provides light music as well as being the principal channel for
the coverage of sport. Radio 3, broadcasting over 16 hours a day, provides
continuous, mainly classical music (much of which is in stereo) and in the
evening offers, in addition, works of artistic and intellectual interest. Radio 4?
broadcasting 17 hours a day, is the main speech programme, providing the
principal news and information service of the BBC; in addition it presents a
wide range of drama, talks and entertainment programmes as well as broad¬
casts to schools.
Local radio was started by the BBC as an experiment in eight towns in
1967 and in September 1972 there were 19 stations. Broadcasting on vhf,1
local radio stations provide between 9 and 13 hours of locally produced
programmes each day, normally during the early morning, lunch-time and
early evening periods. During the rest of the day they transmit programmes
from the BBC’s national networks. Local broadcasts provide a comprehensive
service of local news and information, besides covering local arts and sports
activities and offering residents opportunities to air their views on subjects of
local interest.
Under the terms of the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972 local broadcasting by a
network of up to 60 commercial radio stations is to be introduced. The
stations will broadcast on both vhf and medium wavebands and will operate
under the control of the IBA. Financed by advertising revenue, they will be
expected to combine popular programming with ‘fostering a greater public
awareness of local affairs and involvement in the community’. The first
stations are expected to begin broadcasting by the end of 1973.
The BBC broadcasts to most countries overseas. The main objectives of BBC,
external broadcasts are to give unbiased news, to reflect British opinion and
to project British life and culture. The BBC broadcasts in 40 languages
(including English) for a total of over 700 hours a week. News bulletins, current
affairs programmes, political commentaries and topical magazine programmes
form the main part of the output. A full service of sports commentaries and
results, all kinds of music, drama and a wide range of general entertainment
programmes are also included.
The languages in which the external services broadcast and the length of
time each language is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart
from this the BBC has full responsibility and it is completely independent in
determining the content of news and other programmes.
The BBC World Service broadcasts for 24 hours a day in English and is
supplemented at peak listening times by additional series of programmes de¬
signed to be of special interest to Africa, Europe and the Caribbean.
The foreign language services are divided into areas, namely, the African,
Arabic, Eastern, Far Eastern, Latin American, French (to Europe and Africa),
Central European, South European, German and East European Services.
Broadcasts range from 70 hours a week in Arabic to half an hour in Nepali.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive
language teaching undertaking in the world. Some 250 radio programmes of
English lessons are broadcast weekly with explanations in 26 other languages,
and recorded lessons are supplied to some 286 stations in 75 countries. English
by Television programmes are shown in more than 60 countries.

medium waveband.

BBC news bulletins and other programmes are rebroadcast by the domestic
radio services of many countries. Rebroadcasting involves direct relays from
BBC transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through
the BBC tape and disc transcription service. There are about 1,100 rebroadcasts
weekly of World Service news bulletins in some 46 countries. The Transcrip¬
tion Service offers programmes to more than 100 countries.
Another part of the external services is the Monitoring Service which listens
to and reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news
and comment from overseas to the BBC, the Press, and the Government.
Programme links are generally rented by the BBC from the Post Office, al¬
though some are provided by the BBC with Post Office agreement. The opera¬
tion and maintenance of the 230 transmitting stations from which its various
programmes are sent out are, however, solely a BBC responsibility.
For its domestic radio programmes, the BBC uses 151 studios in London
and the regions, and for its external services 47 in London and seven overseas.
In addition, there are 40 semi-automatic studios which can be operated by
programme officials without engineering staff. BBC television productions
come from main studios at the Television Centre in west London and other
studios in various parts of London, and from fully equipped regional studio
centres at Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow and Manchester.
There are also television studios at Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Hull, Leeds, New¬
castle, Norwich, Nottingham, Plymouth and Southampton. Outside broad¬
casting is covered by a number of mobile units.
The IBA now transmits programmes from 47 vhf and 60 uhf stations through¬
out Britain, programme links being provided by the Post Office. Independent
television programmes are produced at studio centres in Aberdeen, Belfast,
Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Carlisle, Dover, Glasgow, Leeds, London,
Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Plymouth, St. Helier, and Southampton.
The establishment of these studios is the direct result of the IBA’s policy of
encouraging the development of regional television, and the programmes are
designed for either local or national broadcasting. A number of new studios
have also been built for colour television.
The BBC does not give publicity to any individual firm or organised interest
except when it is necessary to provide effective and informative programmes.
Under the terms of its licence and agreement it must not broadcast sponsored
programmes or, without the consent of the Minister of Posts and Tele¬
communications, broadcast any matter for payment.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television subject to the
relevant provisions in the Television Act, in particular that there should be
no sponsoring of programmes by advertisers, that all advertisements should be
clearly distinguishable as such and recognisably separate from the pro¬
gramme, and that the amount of time given to advertising should not be so
great as to detract from the value of the programmes as a medium of information,
education and entertainment. In any one hour of broadcasting the amount of
advertising time is normally limited to seven minutes. Averaged over the day’s
programmes it must not exceed six minutes per hour. The IBA has drawn
up a code governing standards and practice in advertising giving guidance
about the types and methods of advertisement that may not be used. Certain
types of advertising are prohibited, notably that of cigarettes (under a govern-

ment ruling of 1965) and for betting. Advertisements may not be inserted in
certain types of programmes, for example, in broadcasts to schools.
Broadcasts on political issues include a daily factual and impartial account of
proceedings in Parliament, transmitted on BBC’s Radio 4 when Parliament
is in session, and there is frequent coverage of political subjects in news
bulletins and current affairs programmes on both radio and television.
Ministerial and party political broadcasts are also transmitted periodically
under rules agreed between the major political parties, the BBC and the IBA.
The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications is advised on the technical
aspects of television and vhf sound broadcasting by the Television Ad\ isor\
Committee, which consists of an independent chairman, the Directors General
of the BBC and IBA, independent members, and representatives from the
radio industry and interested government departments.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and
engineering staffs of the BBC, the IBA, the Post Office, the Ministry of Posts
and Telecommunications, and the radio industry. Recent developments b\ the
BBC include the electronic conversion of monochrome and colour television
pictures between the European and the American systems; the reproduction
of television pictures in slow motion; and the development of a sound-and-
vision system, which enables the television sound and picture to be carried
over a single 625-line vision circuit, and thus eliminates the operational com¬
plexity and expense of a separate circuit for the sound. The IBA has based its
new uhf network entirely on unmanned transmitters; it is investigating the use
of computers for the control of transmitter networks and is carrying out
pioneering work in the field of digital standards conversion.
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
union manages Eurovision, is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes over that net¬
work and for intercontinental satellite links, and maintains a technical
monitoring station, where frequency measurements and other observations
on broadcasting stations are carried out.
The BBC belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Conference whose
members extend to each other such facilities as the use of studios, recording
channels, and programme contributions. The BBC also provides a large amount
of technical aid, particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting organisa¬
tions throughout the world; members of the BBC’s staff are seconded for
service overseas.
The BBC is a partner in Visnews, which supplies a service of world news
film to some 154 television organisations in over 80 countries and is the most
widely used newsfilm agency in the world, and a member of the International
Television Federation (Intertel), which produces high-quality information
programmes which are exchanged overseas. United Press International, a
television newsfilm agency, and Independent Television News jointly provide
an international service to more than 100 overseas television organisations via
the Eurovision network and by satellite.
The Government spends a considerable amount each year on radio and
television training for overseas students in Britain and largely finances the
BROADCASTING
439
Centre for Educational Development Overseas (CEDO, see p. 165), which
includes in its activities training in educational television and radio for members
of broadcasting organisations overseas. Training in television work is also
provided for overseas trainees at the Thomson Centre in Glasgow, run by the
Thomson Foundation, a charitable trust.
The BBC and the IB A participate in the work of the International Tele¬
communications Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency re¬
sponsible for the regulation and control of all international telecommunication
services (including radio and television), for the allocation and registration of
all radio frequencies and, through its international consultative committees,
for the promotion and co-ordination of the international study of technical
problems in broadcasting. The BBC is also represented on the United King¬
dom Committee of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
21 SPORT
Interest in most sports in Britain, for both participants and spectators, is grow¬
ing, in some cases (for example, water sports of all kinds) at a very fast rate,
a recent trend has been the growth of ‘high risk sports such as mountain¬
eering and parachuting. Some of the sports most popular among participants
are: swimming, fishing, bowls, association and rugby football, lawn tennis,
squash rackets, golf, riding, cricket, sailing and skating. For spectators (includ¬
ing television audiences) the following sports are among the most popular,
association and rugby football, racing, boxing and wrestling, motor car and
motor cycle racing, athletics, cricket, show jumping, lawn tennis, swimming
and skating. Sportsmen may be professionals (paid players) or amateurs.1
Many professionals set technical standards, attract spectators, and provide
coaching and instruction, but the sporting life of Britain derives its character
principally from the amateur element—people who devote time and energy to
organising sport and to teaching and training, as well as the many thousands
of all ages who engage in sport for pleasure alone.
General
Administration
and Promotion
Sports Councils
The Government is not directly concerned with the organisation or promotion
of sport in Britain, although through a minister (of the Department of the
Environment) with special responsibility for sport its policy is to foster the
development of all aspects of physical recreation, stimulating the provision
of sports facilities and encouraging their use to the fullest capacity.
The main responsibility for the general development of sport in Great Britain
rests with three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England and the
country as a whole) and the Sports Councils for Wales and Scotland. Members
of the councils are appointed by the Government. The councils have the task,
subject only to general ministerial directives, of allocating funds made available
by the Government. They award grants and loans for sports development,
coaching and administration to the governing bodies of sport and to other
national organisations; they assist British representatives at international sports
meetings; they encourage links with international and overseas organisations;
and they administer national sports centres (see p. 442). The Sports Council
is in consultation with the Central Council of Physical Recreation, a non¬
executive body comprising a standing forum of the national governing and
representative bodies of sport and physical recreation. The Sports Council is
linked with nine regional sports councils in England on which are represented
local authorities and sports interests in each region.
Advice about sport and physical recreation in Northern Ireland is provided
by the Youth and Sports Council. Proposals for a Sports Council for Northern
Ireland similar to those in Scotland and Wales are under discussion.
In 1070-71 central government expenditure on sport in Great Britain totalled
some /'t million. The money allocated to the three Sports Councils by the
Government is to amount to some £4-4 million during their first year (1972-
73). In Northern Ireland ^453,000 in grants was given to public authorities
Some sports for example, athletics, Rugby Union football, hockey and rowing are
ntirely amateur, but in other sports the distinction between professional and amateur
tatus is becoming less strictly defined.

and voluntary organisations for sports facilities, playgrounds, overseas visits
and coaching schemes. Voluntary bodies and private concerns also make
substantial provisions for sport in Britain, but the greatest provision is made
by local authorities; expenditure by local authorities on sport amounted to
some £14 million in 1970-71.
The law requires all publicly maintained schools in Britain to provide for the
physical education (gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swimming) of
their pupils. Schools in the national systems (except those solely for infants)
must have a playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a
gymnasium and other amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and halls
designed for dance and movement: in an increasing number of areas, physical
education facilities in schools are being expanded to meet the recreational
needs of the whole community. Facilities for, and instruction in, many kinds of
sport are likewise provided at the independent preparatory and public schools
and at the universities (some of which have departments of physical education).
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities to be
used by the community for recreation—they establish, for instance, playing
fields, gymnasia, tennis courts, golf courses, boating lakes, swimming baths
and sports centres and many arrange further education classes in various
physical education subjects. Large industrial firms often provide sports facilities
for their employees and, in many cases, make them available for the public.
Among the national voluntary bodies most closely connected with the general
development of sport are the British Olympic Association, the National
Playing Fields Association and the British Sports Association for the Disabled.
The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The association’s council is composed
of members of the International Olympic Committee, representatives of the
controlling bodies of some 25 sports, representatives of the armed services’
sports organisations and of certain other affiliated bodies concerned with
sporting activities, and a few co-opted members. It determines the overall
size of the British team; raises funds; makes all the arrangements for the
team’s travel and comfort at the games; organises the provision and transport
of clothing and equipment; and provides a headquarters staff for the overall
management of the team.
The National Playing Fields Association (NPFA) aims to stimulate the provi¬
sion of playing fields, playgrounds and recreation centres by publicity and
technical and financial assistance. Since its inception in 1925 it has distributed
over £2 million in the form of grants for playing field, playground and recrea¬
tion centre schemes and over £600,000 in the form of loans. It assists more than
400 schemes a year. With a council composed of representatives of the govern¬
ing bodies of sport, a number of educational bodies, voluntary youth organisa¬
tions, physical education associations, local authorities and individuals, the
NPFA gives advice on the provision and layout of sports facilities, including
small recreation centres, on matters relating to the recreational needs of children
from their earliest years, and on the establishment of playgrounds and play
leadership schemes. The NPFA is a national charity established by royal
charter. It derives its funds mainly from voluntary contributions, but it also
receives a small Sports Council grant towards administrative costs. It has
branches in Scotland and Northern Ireland and in nearly every English and
Welsh county.
442 BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The British Sports The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, encourages
Association for the sporting activities for the physically handicapped. The association, which
Disabled receives an annual government grant, provides advice on physical recreation
for the disabled, arranges sports meetings at the Stoke Mandeville Sports
Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, and encourages the provision
of facilities (including sports clubs) for disabled people.
p0rts The policy of establishing sports centres bringing together people of all ages
lentres and different recreational interests is regarded as an important part of the
provision for physical recreation in Britain.
National centres, some of which were initially financed by funds from volun¬
tary sources, provide recreational facilities and a wide range of courses for
instructors and performers in many recreational activities. As well as making
residential courses available for enthusiasts from all over Britain, the national
sports centres are used extensively by local clubs and the local community
generally: it has been estimated that some 450,000 a year use the Crystal
Palace centre (see below) in this way. • -t
One centre has been developed as a national sailing centre, two are primarily
used as training centres for mountain activities, including climbing and rescue
techniques; and a fourth provides training for outdoor activities such as walk¬
ing, climbing, sailing and field studies. A national water sports centre is being
built. Combined facilities for ranges of sports are provided at the other centres
which include the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre in London and the
National Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff. The centre at Crystal Palace
has a main stadium seating 12,000 spectators, a sports hall seating 2,000
spectators, a swimming hall with pools meeting Olympic requirements, a
teaching pool and a gallery for 2,000 spectators, an indoor cricket school,
practice rooms for all indoor activities, a hostel for 140 residents and staff
housing: these facilities are available for international competitions as well
as for training purposes, and are supported by a grant from the Greater
London Council, in addition to the Sports Council grant. The Cardiff centre is
supported by local authorities, as well as by Sports Council grants.
As well as the national sports centres, other centres—such as the Meadow-
bank Sports Centre administered by Edinburgh Corporation cater for a wide
range of recreational activities and often attract more than purely local interest.
Some 35 indoor sports centres serve local rather than national needs; many
more are planned, some as ‘dual’ projects on school sites. There are also several
national centres catering for specialised interests and generally administered by
the sponsoring organisations; these include the National Equestrian Centre,
run by the British Equestrian Federation, and the Stoke Mandeville Sports
Stadium for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, run by the British Sports
Association for the Disabled—the first sports centre of its kind in the world.
POPULAR SPORTS Some of the most popular sports in Britain are listed below in alphabetical
order. Each has its own governing organisation to promote and protect its
interests and to prevent infringement of agreed rules and practices. Some of
the organisations cover the whole of Britain; others are concerned individually
with the different constituent countries of Britain. A number of sports also
have separate bodies governing the participation of women and girls.
Aero Sports
Aero sports—including private flying, gliding and parachuting—are becoming
increasingly popular in Britain. Private flying is promoted by the British Light
Aviation Centre, founded in 1966, to which are affiliated some 225 clubs.

There are over 18,000 pilots active in Britain (many of whom fly for business
purposes as well as for pleasure) and more than 2,000 light aircraft are registered.
Air-racing, rallying and aerobatics are controlled by the competitions depart¬
ment of the United Service and Royal Aero Club. Gliding attracts about 8,000
people to some 80 gliding clubs in Britain. The clubs organise flying activities,
including regional and national championships, and are members of the British
Gliding Association, founded in 1929. Parachuting is a popular sport, with
30 clubs affiliated to the British Parachute Association, formed in 1962. The
association, which has about 3,000 members, organises national champion¬
ships, prepares teams for international championships, and regulates the safety
aspects of the sport.
Target archery has a following in Britain of some 11,000 members from over 600
clubs and societies. The governing body is the Grand National Archery Society,
founded in 1844, to which are affiliated regional and county organisations.
Although football of a kind was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier,
as an organised game it dates from the nineteenth century; association football
was adopted at Cambridge in 1848. Nowadays, the game (often called ‘soccer’)
is controlled in England by the Football Association (FA), formed in 1863.
The FA promotes the interests of the game; prevents infringement of the
agreed rules; arranges for instruction of promising young players (some
£50,000 is spent annually on coaching); organises matches and competitions,
including the international matches played by England, the Amateur Cup
competition, the FA Sunday Cup competition, two national youth competitions,
and the competition for its own leading trophy, the FA Challenge Cup; and
chooses and manages English international teams. Over 360 clubs are registered
with the FA and some 37,000 clubs are affiliated to district or regional associa¬
tions. The FA derives its main income from subscriptions and admission
charges to international and cup matches, and ploughs back a large portion of
the money into the game. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have their
own controlling bodies: the Scottish Football Association, the Irish Football
Association and the Football Association of Wales.
The principal professional matches in England and Wales (played once or
twice weekly) are controlled by the Football League, comprising 92 professional
clubs. The league’s funds are derived largely from a levy of 4 per cent of the
net gate receipts from league matches, after allowable expenses have been
deducted; from annual payments from football pools promoters for the use of
league fixture lists; and from television rights. In Scotland the Scottish Foot¬
ball League comprises 37 clubs; Northern Ireland has its own league. Clubs
belonging to the English and Scottish Leagues are organised in divisions, the
members of which compete against one another for the respective league
championships. During the season attendances at Football League matches
total about 30 million and gate receipts amount to about £10 million. Several
million people stake small weekly sums on the results of league matches in a
form of pool betting operated by commercial companies.
The annual competitions for the FA Challenge Cup and the Scottish FA Cup
are organised on a knock-out basis, and the finals—two of the most important
football matches of the year—are played at Wembley Stadium, London
(which can accommodate some 100,000 spectators), and at Hampden Park,
Glasgow (which can accommodate about 135,000 people). International
matches, including those between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, also excite great interest.

Amateur footballers greatly outnumber the professionals (there are nearly
a million amateurs, including schoolboys and members of the armed forces,
to 7,000 or 8,000 professionals), but their teams rarely compete on equal terms,
since professional teams are more systematically and intensively trained.
Amateur teams compete against each other for the FA Amateur Challenge Cup.
In England and Wales, amateur athletics, which include running (track, road
and cross-country), relay racing, jumping, vaulting, hurdling, steeplechasing,
throwing and race-walking are governed (for men) by the Amateur Athletic
Association (AAA), founded in 1880 to encourage the sport, to establish
uniform regulations, and to promote annual championship meetings. The
AAA is now organised from club to national level by honorary officers and
managed by representative members appointed by the Northern, Midland,
Southern and Welsh areas and by affiliated clubs and associations (amateur
athletic clubs, schools and youth organisations), of which there are hundreds
throughout England and Wales. Women’s athletics in England and Wales are
promoted by the Women’s Amateur Athletic Association, founded in 1922.
Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own amateur athletic associations,
with similar functions; there are also separate women’s AAAs for each country.
Track meetings are held throughout Britain from April to October. The
main events in England and Wales are: the national championships for men
and women and international matches usually held in London; area and county
championships; and the universities, armed services, business houses and
schools championship meetings. Clubs usually compete in cross-country run¬
ning from October to March, and county, area and national cross-country
championships are held. Scottish events follow a similar pattern.
International athletics and the selection of British teams are dealt with by
the British Amateur Athletic Board (BAAB), composed of representatives of the
national associations for men and women and affiliated to the International
Amateur Athletic Federation. Teams from Britain compete in the Olympic
Games, and separate teams representing England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games, held at four-yearly
intervals between the Olympic Games. The BAAB administers a coaching
scheme under which nine full-time national coaches lecture and coach in
schools, youth clubs, evening institutes, training colleges and universities and
at special courses organised by the BAAB or by regional associations. Some o
the coaches’ work is directly concerned with coaching athletes but their mam
duties are to instruct men who wish to qualify as coaches, over 1,600 of whom
give voluntary service throughout the country.
The Highland Games, traditional gatherings of local people in the Highlands
of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the weight,
and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions take place,
are unique spectacles which attract large numbers of spectators from all oyer
the world. Among better known Highland Games are the Braemar Gathering
(traditionally attended by the Royal Family), the Argyllshire and Cowal
Gatherings and the meeting at Aboyne.
The origins of badminton are not clear, but the Badminton Association of
England—which together with the Scottish and Welsh Badminton Unions
today organises the sport in Great Britain—was formed in 1893 and the first
tournament was promoted five years later. By 1914 the game had spread to
many other Commonwealth countries and it is now played throughout the

world (the national bodies in Great Britain were among the founder members
of the International Badminton Federation).
Basket ball is played in Britain both indoors and outdoors, primarily by men
and boys. There are about 1,000 senior clubs and the game is played in many
schools. The Amateur Basket Ball Association, organises championships and
is affiliated to the Federation Internationale de Basket Ball Amateur.
Although references to billiards in England survive from the sixteenth
century, the character of the present game was acquired at the end of the
seventeenth century. The Billiards and Snooker Control Council is the game’s
controlling body (for professionals and amateurs) and holds the copyright of
the rules. In the early i93os snooker (a shorter game offering more diverse
incidents) began to acquire popularity, often at the expense of professional
billiards, and today, although both games are played widely at amateur levels,
snooker forms the essence of the professional game.
Bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century. Nowadays the
game is regulated, as far as the English Bowling Association (EBA, founded in
1903) is concerned, by the International Bowling Board (IBB). The Bowling
Associations of Ireland, Scotland and Wales also play to the IBB’s laws, but
there are other bowling associations in England—the English Bowling Federa¬
tion, the Crown Green Association and the English Women’s Bowling
Association—which are not under the IBB’s control. During the summer
bowls is played on bowling greens in the open; in winter it is played on indoor
greens, which are increasing in number. At one time regarded as a pastime for
the elderly, the game is now played by people of all ages. Over 2,640 bowling
clubs are affiliated to the EBA. International, inter-county matches and national
championship competitions of singles, pairs, triples and fours are played.
Boxing as an English sport probably originated in Saxon times. Its modern
form, which has been adopted in many overseas countries, dates from 1865
when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating much of
the brutality that had characterised prize fighting, and making skill the basis
of the sport. Nowadays, many boys learn to box at school and in boys’ clubs,
and there are various amateur boxing competitions carried out according to
the rules of the Amateur Boxing Association, which controls all amateur
boxing, including schoolboy boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing
in the armed services.
Professional boxing is covered by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The board’s strict medical regulations provide for an
examination of boxers before and after each contest, an extensive annual
medical examination and the appointment of inspectors to ensure that the
regulations are observed and to guard against over-matching and exploitation.
Championships at fixed weights have been the rule in boxing contests since
the presentation of the Championship Challenge Belts by the late Lord
Lonsdale in 1909. Amateur championships are decided at n weights: light
flyweight, flyweight, bantamweight, featherweight, lightweight, light welter¬
weight, welterweight, light middleweight, middleweight, light heavyweight
and heavyweight. In professional boxing there are no light flyweight, light
welterweight or light middleweight categories.
Canoeing, the world’s oldest type of boating, dates as a modern sport from the
mid-nineteenth century; a canoe club was founded in 1866, and in 1867 a canoe

regatta was held on the Thames. The International Canoe Federation was
formed in 1936; in Great Britain, the British Canoe Union (a member of the
federation and established in 1936) promotes canoeing in all its forms and
assists the interests of its members. There are about 400 canoe clubs in
Britain, with about 100,000 devotees.
Cricket, sometimes called the English national game, has uncertain origins,
but it is known to have been played at Guildford Grammar School in 1550,
and after the Restoration (of 1660) it became fashionable with the nobility,
who competed with each other to sponsor matches for very large sums of
money. Among the many clubs founded in the eighteenth century was the
famous Hambledon Club in Hampshire, whose members supported the most
brilliant players of the day. Towards the end of the century the Marylebone
Cricket Club (MCC) was founded in London and reframed the ‘Laws of
Cricket’. It has since had considerable influence on the development of the
game in Britain. Its headquarters, Lord’s (named after Thomas Lord, who
rented the first headquarters), were opened in 1787, and moved to the present
site in 1814. Nowadays, cricket in Britain is governed by the Cricket Council,
made up of representatives of the MCC, the Test and County Cricket Board
(representing first-class cricket) and the National Cricket Association (re¬
presenting club and junior cricket). The MCC retains its world-wide responsi¬
bility for the laws of cricket.
The game is played in schools and universities, and most towns and villages
(as well as industrial sports clubs) have teams which play at least one match a
week from late April to early September. In the London area a large number
of pitches are provided by local authorities to augment those leased or owned
by clubs. In the Midlands and the north of England there is a network of
League cricket, contested by teams of Saturday afternoon players reinforced
by professionals, often distinguished overseas players.
The focus of the season centres on a series of ‘Test matches’ played between
England and a touring team from overseas (or sometimes two teams). The
first of these matches was played in Melbourne between England and Australia
in 1877. Since then international tours have taken place regularly between
countries of Test status, which now number seven. The matches last 30 playing
hours spread over five days and arouse great popular interest.
In addition to the Test matches, a First-Class County Championship,
decided on a points system, is contested by 17 counties, each playing 24
three-day matches. The counties not deemed first-class and second elevens of
the first-class counties play in a Minor Counties Championship. The univer¬
sity teams of Oxford and Cambridge rank as first-class and play an annual
match at Lord’s. The counties also compete in a knock-out competition with
one-day matches and in a Saturday and a Sunday League. _
Cricket is also played by women and girls in Britain, the governing body
being the Women’s Cricket Association, founded in 1926.
Croquet originated in Britain in the middle of the nineteenth century and has
developed into a game played by people of all ages on the lawns of local
croquet clubs and private gardens. Some 70 clubs are registered with e
Croquet Association—formed in 1896—which promotes the sport in Britain
and maintains links with croquet associations in other countries.
In Britain the internationally recognised body for cycle racing is the British
Cycling Federation which has 727 affiliated clubs and provides third-party

insurance and a legal aid and touring service for its members. It controls
track and massed-start road racing in Britain, and is concerned with the
cycling events in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games and the annual
world championship. Time trials are organised by the Road Time Trials
Council.
The principal organisation promoting touring by bicycle is the Cyclists’
Touring Club (CTC), the oldest touring club in the world, with a membership
of some 20,000. CTC representatives in all parts of Britain offer help to touring
cyclists; its 50 district associations arrange holiday and week-end tours and
competitions, rallies and rides of all kinds; and its travel department provides
touring itineraries for members both at home and overseas, and maintains a
full travel agency service. Other benefits include a touring magazine, a members’
handbook, legal aid and third-party insurance.
Fencing as a sport has made considerable progress throughout Britain during
the past 25 years. The Amateur Fencing Association (founded in 1902) has
over 600 clubs, and many classes are organised and financed by local authori¬
ties. Fencing is also practised in most universities and an increasing number of
schools. Under the auspices of the association, national championships and
international tournaments are held every year.
The most popular field sports—hunting, game shooting and fishing—have a
long history, and still play a considerable part in the life of the countryside.
The British Field Sports Society looks after their interests.
In Britain hunting means primarily fox hunting on horseback with a pack of
hounds; but it also includes stag hunting (in Devon and Somerset), hunting
the hare, either on foot with beagles or with harriers when the followers are
mounted, and otter hunting along river banks. Hunting depends not on right
but on the goodwill of small landowners and farmers, most of whom support
their local hunt by allowing it to ride over their property.
Fox hunting became a widespread activity in the English countryside some
200 years ago. Originally a sport mainly for the landed gentry and local farmers,
it has gradually widened its appeal, in spite of the fact that it is an expensive
pastime for those who ride to hounds. The sport is not without its critics, but
an ever-larger number of people, including many townsmen, take a keen interest
in it. Most hunts meet two or three times a week and an estimated 25,000 to
30,000 people ride to hounds weekly, many others following in cars, on bicycles
or on foot. The fox hunting season starts in early November and lasts until
April; it is preceded by cub hunting (the hunting of young foxes) when young
hounds are trained. At the end of the season most hunts organise steeplechases
(point-to-points) which attract large crowds. There are over 200 packs of
hounds in England and Wales, 17 in Northern Ireland, and 10 in Scotland.
Hunts are financed mainly by the subscriptions of their members (^15 or less
to £50 or more), by ‘caps’ (contributions paid by non-subscribers), and by the
proceeds of such annual events as the point-to-points and the hunt ball.
Sometimes the Master of Fox-hounds, who is in charge of the hunt, bears a
proportion of the cost.
Game shooting as an organised country sport may be said to date from the
early part of the nineteenth century; nowadays, game consists mainly of
grouse, partridge, pheasant, snipe and woodcock. There is virtually no free
shooting in Britain. A certificate (for which a fee is payable) must be obtained
from the local police by anyone who possesses, purchases or acquires a shot

gun1; and it is necessary to have a licence to kill game. Nearly all game birds
are found on privately owned land, shot over either by the owner and his
friends or by syndicates which have leased the shooting rights. However, in
some parts of the more remote countryside, rough shooting may be enjoyed in
a less formal way. Much of the country’s wild-fowling is controlled by the
Wildfowlers’ Association of Great Britain and Ireland, through its numerous
clubs. The Game Conservancy, formed by landowners, farmers and others
interested in game conservation and research, collects information on a
national scale and studies factors controlling game population.
Grouse, partridge, pheasant and certain other birds are protected by law
during a ‘close season’ and allowed to breed in security, often under the care of
privately employed gamekeepers on numerous estates. Grouse shooting takes
place mostly in Scotland, northern England and north Wales; partridge and
pheasant shooting in nearly all regions of Great Britain, the former mainly
over farm land, and the latter in or near woodland; and wildfowling on the
marshes and fenlands of the coastal areas.
Deer stalking is mainly a sport of the Highlands of Scotland. The deer are
preserved in privately owned ‘deer forests’, covering 9,000 to over 30,000
acres (3,642 to 12,140 hectares), and are protected during close seasons.
Fishing is the most popular of the country sports, being within the reach
of everyone in some form or another (from the small boy with his hook and
line to the experienced fly-fisherman). There are some 3 million anglers
in Britain. The outstanding forms of the sport are salmon and trout fishing.
There are trout streams in most parts of the country, and in Scotland many
hundreds of lochs also provide good sport. Salmon fishing may be enjoyed in
many regions of Britain, but the best salmon rivers are in Scotland. In England
and Wales the most widely practised form of fishing is for coarse fish such as
pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench, chub and bream, and the National
Federation of Anglers (NFA) has some 450,000 members in over 3,000 clubs
comprising 170 associations. Match angling—competitive fishing for coarse
fish by weight—is a feature of the many angling clubs affiliated to the N FA,
particularly in the Midlands and north of England. A national angling cham¬
pionship, composed of teams of 12 anglers, is organised annually by the NFA,
and the NFA enters a team in the International Angling Competition. As a
rule, freshwater fishing has to be paid for and local enquiries made about any
permit or licence required. Most coarse fishing is let to angling clubs; trout
and salmon fishermen either rent a stretch of river, join a club, stay at an hotel
with its own fishing rights, or pay for the right to fish by the day, week 01
month. The cost of salmon fishing is often high. Coastal fishing and deep-sea
fishing for shark and tunny are growing in popularity and are free to all (except
for salmon and sea trout fishing, which is by licence only).
The National Anglers’ Council is a central consultative and co-ordinating
body, representative of the various national bodies concerned with angling.
Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, but it did not become really well known in other
parts of Britain until towards the end of the nineteenth century. Since then,
however, it has gained steadily in popularity (particularly since the mid-
1950s); nowadays there are golf courses in the vicinity of many towns and

villages in all parts of Britain—some owned by local authorities, but the
majority owned by golf clubs. The headquarters of the Royal and Ancient
Golf Club is St. Andrews, Scotland.
The main event of the golfing year is the British Open Golf Championship,
first played in i860; other important matches include the Walker Cup (for
amateurs) and the Ryder Cup (for professionals), both played between Britain
and the United States; the Amateur Championship; the World Amateur Team
Championship; and the Ladies Championship.
Gymnastics involving bodily exercises and disciplines were originally de¬
veloped as a sport in ancient Greece; nowadays in Britain the sport is a non-
seasonal activity for both men and women and is controlled nationally by the
British Amateur Gymnastics Association (affiliated to the Federation Inter¬
nationale de Gymnastique and the British Olympic Association). The asso¬
ciation’s activities include the promotion of international and national
programmes (including the national tournaments at the Royal Albert Hall,
London) and of proficiency award schemes for people of all ages.
Variants of hockey (as distinct from ice-hockey) have been played in Britain
for at least five centuries, and some, like hurling in Ireland and shinty in
Scotland, are still played extensively. Modern hockey, however, dates from
the formation (in 1866) of the Hockey Association of England. The Inter¬
national Hockey Rules Board controls the rules of the game. There are some
2,000 men’s hockey clubs throughout Britain with at least 30,000 male adult
players; some 600 boys’ schools also play the game. A county championship is
held annually in England; in Wales there is a cup competition; and in Scotland
there is a cup competition and six local league competitions. Regular amateur
international matches are also played. Men’s hockey is an Olympic sport, and
team arrangements are made by the Great Britain Hockey Board.
The controlling bodies of women’s hockey are: the All England Women’s
Hockey Association (founded 1895) to which are affiliated some 900 clubs and
2,200 schools, representing a membership of about 72,000 adults; the Irish
Ladies’ Hockey Union; the Scottish Women’s Hockey Association; and the
Welsh Women’s Hockey Association. The first international women’s hockey
match took place in 1896. Nowadays such a match is played annually at
Wembley Stadium (in addition to those played in other parts of the country)
and attracts over 60,000 spectators.
Judo, an Olympic sport originating in Japan, has a large and growing follow¬
ing in Britain and is governed by the British Judo Association, which is
affiliated to the International Judo Federation under the rules of which judo
competitions are conducted. There are some 580 clubs in the association,
which has coaching schemes for some 30,000 registered members.
Lacrosse, adapted from the game played by the Iroquois Indians of North
America, is played mainly by women—in girls’ schools, at lacrosse clubs, and
at universities. Women’s international and regional matches are played under
the auspices of the All England Women’s Lacrosse Association, the All Wales
Women’s Lacrosse Association and the Scottish Women’s Lacrosse Association.
The men’s game, controlled by the English Lacrosse Union, is played in ten
universities, several colleges of education and by clubs and schools, mainly in
the London, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Nottingham areas. Matches
played include county matches, an annual fixture between the North of

The forerunner of modern lawn tennis (the game known zsjeu de paume) was
introduced into England from France in the fifteenth century and a tennis
court’, built by Henry VIII, is still in use at Hampton Court. The modern
game, first played in England in 1873, quickly became very popular; in 1877
the first championships were played. The Lawn Tennis Association, the
game’s controlling body in Britain, was founded in 1888. The international
governing body of the game (the International Lawn Tennis Federation, with
headquarters in London and Paris) was founded in iQtS*
The number of tennis players has greatly increased during the present
century, particularly since the game has spread to practically every country in
the world. In Britain the game is played in almost all girls’ and in many boys’
secondary schools, on private courts, in parks and recreation grounds and at
several thousand tennis clubs.
The annual Wimbledon fortnight, held during the summer, is the main
event of the lawn tennis season in Britain, and, in fact, in the world. T. hese
championships, for players of many nationalities, draw large crowds; the
grounds at the All England Club at Wimbledon can accommodate over 30,000
spectators, including 14,000 round the Centre Court where the finals are
played. Other tournaments which attract a good deal of attention are. the
British Hard Court Championships, the British Junior Championships, and the
County Championships. There are also national competitions for boys’ and
girls’ schools. The most important international events are the Davis Cup (for
men) and the Federation Cup competition (for women). Women players from
Britain and the United States also compete for the Wightman Cup.
Motor racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in Britain; more
racing and sports cars have been built in Britain than in any other countiy,
and British drivers (including women drivers) have an international reputation
second to none. The Royal Automobile Club (RAC) is the governing body of
motor sport in Great Britain, and the 750 motor clubs registered with it
organise each year 5,500 motor sporting events, 230 of which are race meetings
held on 17 different racing tracks licensed by the RAC. The RAC also issues
yearly 24,500 competition licences covering all events from hill climbs and
autocross to full international race meetings; and it organises the British Grand
Prix which counts towards the Formula One World Motor Racing Champion¬
ship. Kart racing also comes under the RAC’s jurisdiction.
In addition to motor car racing, there is motor cycle racing the most
important contest of the year is for the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy—for
which the controlling body is the Auto-Cycle Union (founded in 1903 and
represented on the Federation Internationale de Motorcycliste), with over 700
affiliated clubs in Great Britain. Motor cycle speedway racing, introduced into
Britain in 1928, is governed by the Speedway Control Board.
The popularity of mountaineering has greatly increased in recent years. Clubs
in the British Mountaineering Council (BMC) and the Mountaineering
Council for Scotland, the representative bodies of the sport, number over 190,
ranging from national clubs, such as the Alpine Club (founded in i857> ^ e
oldest mountaineering club in the world) and the Scottish Mountaineering
Club, to small regional clubs with 20 to 30 members. A number local
education authorities, and national bodies such as the Sports Council and the

Outward Bound Trust have established mountaineering training centres.
Training courses are run jointly by the Sports Council, and BMC, the Youth
Hostels Association and other bodies, and many universities and schools have
mountaineering sections. Membership of the known clubs is about 15,000
but several times this number take part in climbing and mountaineering.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring and climbing
most of the great ranges of the world, for example, the first ascent of the
Matterhorn in 1865, of Everest in 1953, and of Kangchenjunga in 1955. In
recent years frequent expeditions have gone to Greenland, Alaska, the Andes,
Patagonia, the Caucasus and the Pamirs, as well as the Himalayas.
Netball is a popular game for girls and women. The controlling body in
England is the All England Netball Association to which clubs, colleges and
schools are affiliated through county netball committees. The women’s armed
services and national youth, university and college organisations are also
affiliated. National tournaments for counties, clubs, colleges and schools and
international matches are organised each year; and inter-Commonwealth tours
are also arranged.
Orienteering involving competitive wayfinding across country (usually on
foot) was introduced into Britain on a national basis in the early 1960s,
although similar activities had been promoted in the past (the armed forces,
for instance, often use wayfinding in training programmes). Both men and
women participate and the sport is organised for team and individual competi¬
tions by the British Orienteering Federation. Several schools have taken up
the sport, combining outdoor exercise with practical geography.
Polo, of which the earliest records are Persian, was first played by the British
in India, and brought to England in 1869. The sport’s governing body is the
Hurlingham Polo Association, to which many overseas polo associations are
affiliated. Polo players are a very small section of the community, for the cost
of keeping polo ponies is high. However, many clubs now own trained ponies
for hire to members at moderate cost. About 470 players receive handicaps
from the association, but many less expert players take part in club games.
Public interest in polo has increased in recent years and spectators attend
inter-club tournaments and matches between high-handicap teams with players
from several countries, including other Commonwealth countries, the United
States and Argentina.
Racing is a term which, in Britain, is taken to mean, first and foremost,
horse-racing. Other forms of racing include greyhound racing, coursing (a
form of hunting with greyhounds), pony racing, trotting races and pigeon
flying.
Horse-racing has been known in England since Tudor times and even earlier.
The Jockey Club (originally formed about 1750) controls all horse-racing in
England and its rules are the basis of universal turf procedure.
Flat racing is carried on from late March till the end of October and national
hunt racing from August to June. The classic flat races are: the Two Thousand
Guineas for colts and fillies, and the One Thousand Guineas for fillies only,
both run at Newmarket; the Derby for colts and fillies and the Oaks for fillies
only, both run at Epsom; and the St. Leger, for colts and fillies, run at
Doncaster. The Derby is the outstanding event in the racing calendar; it takes

place annually in late May or early June and is one of the most colourful and
exciting events of the sporting year. The most fashionable race-meeting of
the season is held at Ascot in Berkshire, in mid-June, and is known as ‘Royal
Ascot’, being traditionally attended by the Sovereign.
The most important national hunt meeting is the National Hunt Festival
Meeting at Cheltenham in March. The best-known single steeplechase is the
Grand National at Aintree, near Liverpool, run annually since 1839.
In England and Wales there are 56 racecourses (which must be licensed by
The Jockey Club) and Scotland has six racecourses. There is a total of about
900 days’ racing annually. There are some 11,000 horses in training in Great
Britain, at an average cost of about £30 a week each.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare started in Britain in 1926,
when the first modern greyhound track was opened at Belle Vue, Manchester.
There are now about 125 licensed tracks in operation, nearly all of them near
large towns, and meetings are held two or three times a week. The licensing
authorities for greyhound racing tracks are the county and county borough
councils. Some 9 million people a year watch greyhound racing, the rules
of which are drawn up by the National Greyhound Racing Club. The 51
greyhound racecourses which accept the rules of the club are the largest in
the country and account for approximately 92 per cent of the total attendance
and totalisator turnover.
Greyhound racing can be conducted only at a licensed greyhound racecourse
and only on 130 racing days in a licensing year (1st July-30th June). There
are some 10,000 greyhounds in training under the National Greyhound Racing
Club Rules, and the average cost for their upkeep including training is about
^3'75 a week each.
Betting on racing is allowed for people of at least 18 years of age, subject to a
government betting duty (see p. 209). ‘Bookmakers’ (who must hold personal
permits) provide betting facilities both on and off racecourses and greyhound
tracks (bets laid off course in Great Britain comprise about 87 per cent of the
betting turnover, mainly through some 14,000 licensed betting offices). For
horse-racing, the Horserace Totalisator Board (HTB), a statutory body, runs
totalisator betting (a form of pool betting), both on and off the courses; for
greyhound racing there is no statutory body, but some 70 tracks are allowed to
run their own totalisators under strict control by local authorities. Book¬
makers and the HTB have to contribute a ‘betting levy’ to the Horserace
Betting Levy Board which promotes the advancement of veterinary science
and education and the improvement of horse breeding (including the work of
the National Stud at Newmarket) and horse-racing in general.
The British Equestrian Federation, the authority responsible for equestrian
activities (other than racing) in Great Britain, co-ordinates the work of the
British Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association (see below),
and runs the National Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire.
The British Horse Society is responsible for promoting the interests of horse
and pony breeding, furthering the art of riding, and encouraging horse-
mastership and the welfare of horses and ponies. It provides tests, lectures,
publications, a film library, courses and examinations, and employs a national
instructor who, together with riding schools approved by the society, helps to
promote horsemastership throughout the country. With some 18,000 members,
the society is also the parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club

Movement. The Pony Club (35,000 members) runs its own national champion¬
ships, arranges conferences, instructors’ courses and efficiency tests, and pub¬
lishes information on riding techniques and horse management. The Riding
Clubs (24,000 members) also hold national championships each year and the
Riding Club Horseshoe Long Distance Ride—a test of stamina for horses and
riders, held annually in different parts of Britain.
Under the auspices of the society, horse trials are held throughout Britain
during the spring and summer. The three-day events held each year—in April
at Badminton, Gloucestershire, in May at Tidworth, Hampshire, and in
September at Burghley House, Lincolnshire—are among the outstanding
equestrian events of the year. These trials include dressage, cross-country
riding and show jumping; some 50 one-day trials on similar lines are held
annually.
Affiliated dressage competitions are held throughout the year, many of them
as qualifying rounds for championships held at the Royal International Horse
Show and the Horse of the Year Show (see below) and for dressage champion¬
ships at the National Equestrian Centre.
Showjumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association, which
is responsible for drawing up the rules for the judging of jumping competitions
and prescribing the general standards and height of obstacles for show
jumping. It encourages showjumping events and keeps a register of horses and
ponies taking part at affiliated shows. The association seeks to improve the
standard of jumping and to provide for the representation of Great Britain in
international competitions. More than 800 shows are affiliated each year to the
association, which has a membership of over 9,000. The two major show
jumping events each year are the Royal International Horse Show and the
Horse of the Year Show.
Rowing is enjoyed by participants from all sections of the community and
attracts considerable spectator interest. The art of oarsmanship is taught in
many schools, universities and rowing clubs (including women’s clubs)
throughout Britain, where the governing bodies of the sport are the Amateur
Rowing Association and the Scottish Amateur Rowing Association and the
Ulster Branch of the Irish Amateur Rowing Union. Since the late 1940s, the
number of rowing clubs has doubled. The first rowing course in Britain to
Olympic 2,000-metre standards has been opened at the National Water Sports
Centre in Nottingham.
The University Boat Race between eight-oared crews from Oxford and
Cambridge originated in 1829 anc^ has been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River Race in March (also on the Thames)
is the largest assembly of racing craft in the world—more than 350 eights row in
procession. At Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire (founded in 1839) crews from
all over the world compete each July in various kinds of races over a straight
course of 1 mile 550 yards (about 2-1 kilometres). Many other riverside resorts
arrange summer regattas. The oldest annual event in the English racing
calendar is Doggett’s Coat and Badge, founded in 1716 and organised since
by the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers; originally for professional water¬
men and limited to six entrants, the race (along the Thames in London) is now
open to amateurs (who must still be apprentice watermen).
Rugby football is played according to two different sets of rules. Rugby Union
football (‘rugger’—in which there are 15 players in a team) is played (in
England) under the auspices of the Rugby Football Union, established in

1871. International matches between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and
France are played regularly at the leading rugby football grounds of each
country, including Twickenham, London—the headquarters of the Rugby
Football Union—and there are tours by international teams. Other important
rugby matches are the county championship competitions, the annual match
between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the Hospitals’ Cup Final,
and the Inter-Services tournament. Membership of the Rugby Union is
confined to amateur clubs of which there are over 1,600 in membership, with
over 1,100 schools.
Rugby League football—a 13-a-side game for professionals as well as
amateurs—is played mostly in the north of England. The game’s governing
body, the Rugby Football League (instituted in 1895) has its headquarters
at Leeds and regularly sends touring teams to Australia and New Zealand.
Annual international games, professional and amateur, are played against
France. The major match of the season—the Rugby League Challenge Cup
Final—has attracted crowds of 100,000 at Wembley Stadium in recent years.
Sailing has always been popular on Britain’s inland and coastal waters but in
recent years the sport, and in particular small boat sailing, has greatly widened
its appeal. The Royal Yachting Association (RYA), the national governing
body for both sailing and power yachting, has over 1,500 clubs and 32,000
personal members. The RYA has approved sailing schools giving courses for
novices, a National Sailing Centre where instructors are coached and tested,
and is responsible for the selection of Great Britain’s Olympic team. One of
the world’s main regattas takes place from Cowes in the Isle of Wight annually
during the first week of August. Other major events are held at such sailing
centres as Poole, Lowestoft, Harwich, Burnham-on-Crouch, Plymouth,
Falmouth and the Clyde. Racing is subject to the rules of the International
Yacht Racing Union, founded in 1907.
The Joint Shooting Committee for Great Britain, founded in 1955, represents
its member associations—the National Rifle Association (NRA), the National
Small-Bore Rifle Association (NSRA) and the Clay Pigeon Shooting Associa¬
tion (CPSA)—in the International Shooting Union and the British Olympic
Association. The committee sponsors all entries to international competitions.
Full-bore (7-62 mm and -303 in.) rifle and pistol (high power) shooting is
organised by the NRA, founded in i860. Some 80 county rifle associations, 90
schools and more than 600 rifle clubs are affiliated to the NRA. The annual
Imperial Meeting at Bisley Camp, Surrey—attended by some 2,500 competi¬
tors from Britain and other Commonwealth countries, including cadets from
schools—comprises (for individuals and teams) competitions for members of
the armed services and for schools, and target rifle competitions at county,
national and international level, concluding with the Queen’s Prize, which
attracts about 1,000 entries. The NRA also organises postal matches for British
and overseas teams, and sends teams to other Commonwealth countries.
Small-bore (-22 in.) rifle and pistol shooting—carried out either on indoor
ranges of 15 to 25 yards (14-23 m) in length or on open ranges up to 200 yards
(183 m)—and air rifle and pistol shooting (‘177 nn) at 6 yards and 10 metres
(both indoors and outside) are also widely practised in Britain. Some 3,500
clubs are affiliated to the NSRA, which arranges inter-club and inter-county
competitions for teams and individuals. Clubs also compete in county and local
groups. The NSRA organises a National Bisley Meeting (usually attended by
more than 2,000 competitors), a Scottish meeting (some 600 competitors),

Some 300 clay pigeon shooting clubs are situated in all parts of Great Britain;
the sport is governed by the CPS A which represents Great Britain in major
international events.
The world’s first skating club was formed in Edinburgh in 1742 and the first
mechanically refrigerated ice rink was built in London in 1876. There are
now 37 artificial ice rinks in Britain, and where facilities exist many local
authorities provide skating tuition for school children. Over 70 ice clubs are
affiliated to the National Skating Association of Great Britain (which also
promotes roller skating), formed in 1879—one °f the associations which in
1892 established the International Skating Union to supervise and standardise
ice figure, ice speed and (later) ice dance skating regulations.
When there is sufficient snow, skiing takes place in several parts of Britain.
The governing bodies of the sport are the National Ski Federation of Great
Britain and the Ulster Ski Federation. Skiing in Scotland has become very
popular, especially at the winter sports centres established in the Cairngorms,
Deeside, Glencoe and Glenshee, where ski-runs equal to those in other areas
of Europe have been developed, and ski-lifts, ski-tows and professional instruc¬
tion are now available. There are some 55 artificial ski-slopes in areas other
than the Scottish centres.
Squash rackets is thought to have originated at Harrow School in the 1850s;
the Squash Rackets Association, formed in 1929 to promote and organise the
game, was a founder member of the International Squash Rackets Federation.
The game, which is both amateur and professional, is played mainly by men
and boys (it is very popular in many boys’ schools and universities), although
an increasing number of participants are women. There are national inter¬
county championships. With some 700 clubs in England alone, squash rackets
is one of the fastest growing sports.
Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during holidays at the
seaside, and swimming as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people.
The existence of indoor swimming baths (mainly provided by local authorities)
makes all-the-year swimming possible, and instruction and coaching is
provided in some places by qualified teachers who hold certificates for
elementary or advanced teaching awarded by the Amateur Swimming Associa¬
tion (ASA). The ASA’s objects are to promote the teaching and practice of
swimming, diving and water polo and to stimulate public opinion in favour of
providing proper accommodation and facilities for them; and to draw up and
enforce uniform laws for the regulation of amateur swimming, diving and
water polo and synchronised swimming (a form of water ballet) champion¬
ships and competitions in England.
Underwater swimming (sub aqua), one of the fastest growing sports in
Britain, is governed nationally by the British Sub Aqua Club, wdiich promotes
underwater exploration, science and sport. Formed in 1953, the club has
become the largest in the world, with some 15,500 active members and 500
branches in Britain and overseas. A training programme for members forms
one of the club’s main activities.

Table tennis had its origins in Britain in the late nineteenth century and was
then often referred to as ‘ping pong’ (the name is derived from the sound of the
ball hitting the bat). In 1902 the Ping Pong Association was formed to organise
championships, and in 1927 it was reconstituted as the English Table Tennis
Association—the body which today controls the game.
Types of bowling are thought to have been played in ancient Egypt and have
been known in Europe for over 700 years. Tenpin bowling was re-introduced
in its present form from North America in i960 and rapidly became a popular
sport in Great Britain where the controlling body is the British Tenpin Bowling
Association, founded in 1961.
Volleyball, introduced into Europe from the United States, is growing in
popularity in England and Scotland where it is promoted by the English
Volleyball Association and the Scottish Volleyball Association. There are some
150 clubs affiliated to the English Association, and both associations are
members of the British Olympic Association. National championships are
held annually and leagues function at national and regional levels.
The popularity of water skiing in Britain, both during the summer and at
suitable times in the winter, is increasing. The British Water Ski Federation,
formed in 1951, represents over 70,000 water skiers, several of whom have
won world and European titles. Over 100 clubs are affiliated to the federation.
The main competitive events are: figures, slalom, jumping and grand prix
racing.
Modern weightlifting with bar-bells and dumb-bells became popular towards
the end of the nineteenth century; the first championships open to the world
were held in London in 1891. The sport is regulated on a world-wide scale by
the International Weightlifting Federation, formed in 1920, and in Britain
by the British Amateur Weightlifters’ Association.
Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world. The style most commonly
used in Britain is the ‘free’ style, which evolved from the Catch-as-Catch-Can
or Lancashire style, but Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling is still
practised in the north of England and in Scotland, and Cornish style wrestling
(in which the contestants wear rough canvas jackets by which all holds must
be taken) takes place in Cornwall. Wrestling in the free and Graeco-Roman
styles features at the Olympic Games; in the Commonwealth Games only
free style is wrestled. Amateur wrestling in Britain is governed by the British
Amateur Wrestling Association, which is affiliated to the International
Amateur Wrestling Federation, under the rules of which all wrestling is
conducted. Professional wrestling is usually in the ‘all-in’ or ‘free’ style, which
is not the same as the free style used in amateur wrestling.

BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
On ist January 1973, Britain, together with the Irish Republic and Denmark
will join the original six countries—Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands—in the European Com¬
munities.1 The enlarged Community will form a trading area of over 250
million people and account for some 40 per cent of world trade, offering a basis
not only for the continued economic development of the member countries,
but also for the emergence of a wider unity, enabling Europe to play a more
effective international role in economic and political affairs.
There are three Communities in what is often known as the ‘Common
Market’. The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established
in 1952, by bringing together the coal and steel resources of the six member
countries, and formed the model for the ‘community’ approach to economic
integration. The Community is designed to ensure an orderly supply of coal
and steel to member countries, to promote the rational expansion and moderni¬
sation of production and to provide better conditions of employment and
living for the employees in the industries. The Treaty of Paris which esta¬
blished the ECSC provided for the abolition of duties and quantitative restric¬
tions (or charges having the same effect) on trade in coal and steel between
member states; of discrimination by producers in prices, delivery terms or
transport rates; of any measures which hampered free choice of supplier; and
of restrictive practices resulting in the collusive sharing or exploitation of
markets. The ECSC established common markets in coal, iron and steel
during 1953-54, although some tariffs and price controls remained operative
for a transitional period which ended in 1958. The treaty provided, moreover,
for action by the Community over a wide field of activity in the coal and steel
industries, the work of the Community being financed by a levy on production.
The Community may provide funds for capital investment, research and other
programmes, as well as loans to help create new jobs in declining coal areas or
where restructuring of the steel industry is taking place. Grants to assist
redundant coal and steel workers until they find new employment, or while
undergoing retraining, may also be made. An agreement between the ECSC
and Britain in 1954 established a Council of Association for the exchange of
information and for consultation on matters of mutual interest.
The European Economic Community (EEC) was created by the Treaty of
Rome signed by the six countries in 1957, and aimed to promote the con¬
tinued and balanced expansion of the members’ economies by their progressive
harmonisation and integration. The preamble to the treaty included among
the basic objectives of the EEC the establishment of the foundations for a
growing unity among European peoples, the improvement of their working
and living conditions, the progressive abolition of restrictions on trade, and the
1 Norway completed negotiations at the same time as the other three applicants and
signed the Treaty of Accession (see p. 462). However, in a referendum held on 24th-
25th September a majority opposed entry. Certain passages in this appendix are based
on the assumption that the enlarged Community would be a Community of Ten.

development of the prosperity of overseas countries. The initial steps towards
the attainment of these objectives were the creation of a customs union, aboli¬
tion of internal tariffs and other barriers to trade and establishment of a
common external tariff, the development of a common policy for agriculture,
and the introduction of measures to establish the free movement of labour,
capital and services. At the same time, provision was made for the overseas
countries which had special links with the member countries to have an asso¬
ciate status with the EEC, with preferential treatment in aid and the develop¬
ment of trade. The EEC is now moving from a customs union towards an
economic union, and the member countries are working gradually to align their
economic and monetary policies and to evolve a common approach to industrial,
regional, technological and social development.
The third Community, the European Atomic Energy Community (EURA-
TOM), was set up by a second treaty signed in Rome in 1957 which provided
for the co-ordinated development of members’ atomic energy industries and of
their other peaceful nuclear activities. EURATOM has worked to develop a
co-ordinated research programme (for power production, industrial and
medical purposes) and to ensure the dissemination of technical information, to
facilitate the co-ordination of investment in the nuclear field, to ensure a
proper supply of nuclear ores and fuels and wider commercial outlets. A
common market for all nuclear materials and equipment came into effect at the
beginning of 1959, with a common external tariff on imports of nuclear
materials, while the Community has established common nuclear legislation
and a common control system for nuclear materials to prevent their diversion
to purposes other than those declared. An agreement for co-operation between
EURATOM and Britain was signed in 1959.
Community institutions were established by the treaties to formulate and
administer the common policies. Originally the three Communities had
separate institutions, but in 1967 these were merged; the member countries,
however, have retained their national institutions and identities.
The Council of Ministers is the decision-making body for all major questions,
and is the only institution whose members, usually the foreign minister or other
ministers appropriate to the subject of discussion, directly represent each
member country. Although provision is made in the Treaty of Rome for
certain matters to be decided by a qualified majority, using a system of weighted
voting, in practice decisions are taken on the basis of consensus. On all matters
of major importance, affecting vital national interests, decisions are in practice
taken on the basis of unanimity.
The Commission is responsible for formulating policy proposals for sub¬
mission to the Council of Ministers, for promoting the Community interest
and attempting to reconcile national viewpoints and for implementing the pro¬
visions of the treaties and Community measures. On enlargement the number
of commissioners—each of whom is basically responsible for one or more of
the main Community activities—will be increased from nine to fourteen; they
are appointed by agreement between the member countries and will include
two members from Britain. The Commission is pledged to act in complete
independence of national or sectional interests and to formulate its proposals
and administer policy in the interests of the Communities as a whole. Its pro¬
posals are made only after extensive consultation with officials of the national
governments and with such organisations as producers, trade unions, em¬
ployers’ associations and many others.

APPENDIX 2 461
The Court of Justice interprets and adjudicates on the meaning of the
treaties and of any measures taken by the council and commission under them,
hears complaints and appeals brought by or against the Communities’ institu¬
tions, member states or individuals and gives preliminary rulings on questions
referred to it by courts in the member states. As a court of final appeal its pro¬
cedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest courts in member
states; its rulings are binding on member countries, Community institutions
and individuals. On enlargement the number of independent judges—appointed
for six-year terms by agreement of the member states—will be increased from
seven to eleven.
The Assembly or European Parliament is composed of nominated members
of the parliaments of member states, sitting according to party affiliation and
not nationality. The parliament is consulted on and debates all the major
policy issues of the Communities. It also examines and approves the Com¬
munities’ budget. Members of the parliament may question the council and
commission and have the power to dismiss the Commission by a two-thirds
majority. The Committee of Permanent Representatives consists of representa¬
tives of the member states, of ambassadorial rank, whose task is to prepare for
the meetings of the council and perform whatever additional functions it might
delegate. The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body repre¬
senting a cross-section of economic interests. Its members—representing
employers’ organisations, trade unions and other groups—are consulted by
the council and commission during the formulation of policy.
Other Community institutions include the European Agricultural Guidance
and Guarantee Fund (see p. 463), the European Social Fund (see p. 463) and
the European Investment Bank. In 1971 over 6,000 people worked for the
Communities’ institutions, largely recruited by the institutions themselves and,
like the members of the Commission, charged to act independently in the
interests of the Communities as a whole.
By the late 1950s although the desirability of close economic co-operation
between the countries of western Europe was generally accepted, a political
basis for agreement between the Communities and the other European coun¬
tries did not exist. In early i960, therefore, the signature of the Stockholm
Convention by Britain, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and
Switzerland set up the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), designed
to create an industrial free trade area and to facilitate the establishment of a
wider association between its members and the Common Market countries
(see p. 459). By late 1966 the EFTA countries, with a population of almost
100 million, had successfully eliminated protective tariffs and quotas on their
trade in industrial goods, creating the first completed free trade area in the
world. Finland became an associate member of EFTA in 1961 and Iceland
joined in 1970, by which date trade between the members had trebled.
In mid-1961, however, Britain had formally requested the opening of nego¬
tiations to determine whether it would be possible for it to join the European
Communities, as had Denmark, Norway and the Republic of Ireland; several
other EFTA members—Austria, Sweden and Switzerland—applied for asso¬
ciation. The British negotiations opened in late 1961 and continued during
1962 with some degree of success, only to be broken off in January 1963 at the
French Government’s request. The British and other applications were
renewed in early 1967; during the subsequent consideration of the applications
462

by the Council of Ministers the French Government indicated that while it
was not in principle opposed to the admission of new members, it considered
that enlargement would bring about fundamental changes in the Communities.
No negotiations followed, but the applications were not withdrawn. In mid-
1969 the Council of Ministers, at the suggestion of the new French Govern¬
ment, decided to hold a summit meeting to discuss the completion and
strengthening of the Communities, and their enlargement; the meeting, held
at The Hague on ist-2nd December 1969, agreed, among other things, to
open negotiations with the four applicant states. These formally began on
30th June 1970 and proceeded—in the form of separate meetings between the
four applicant states and the Council—during 1971, the majority of the main
questions in the context of the British application being settled by July 1971.
The decision to join the European Communities on the basis of the terms
negotiated was approved in principle by the British Parliament on 28th
October 1971 and on 22nd January 1972 Britain, the other three applicant
countries and the six original member states signed the Treaty of Accession in
Brussels.
The Treaty of Accession provides for entry into the EEC and EURATOM;
accession to the ECSC—which, since it was established by a different treaty,
involves a different procedure—is effected by a decision of the council. The
treaty documents consist of one multilateral Treaty of Accession, signed by
the original six member states and the four applicants, and the decision of the
council to which extensive documents setting out the terms of accession are
annexed as an integral part of the treaty. The documents thus incorporate the
conclusions reached during the negotiations, which include arrangements for
the progressive abolition of tariffs and the elimination of quotas between the
original six and the new member states, for a progressive adoption of the
common external tariff (GET), a progressive movement towards the Common
Agricultural Policy, provisions on fishing, the gradual liberalisation of move¬
ments of capital, the extension of the EEC’s association policy to the develop¬
ing Commonwealth countries in Africa and the Caribbean, and for the con¬
tinued import of Commonwealth sugar and New Zealand dairy produce. The
tariff and agricultural pricing arrangements will be introduced over a five-year
‘transitional’ period; the arrangements for Britain’s contribution to the Com¬
munities’ budget involve a slightly longer period of adjustment.
In the following sections a brief outline is given of the main arrangements
for entry.
Immediately upon entry Britain will have a position in each of the institutions
equal to that of France, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy. In the
enlarged Council of Ministers Britain will have a vote weighting of 10 out of a
total of 61; two members from Britain will serve in the enlarged Commission;
Britain will send 36 members to the 208-strong European Parliament; and in
the Economic and Social Committee Britain will have a representation of 24
out of 153. English will become an official language of the Communities.
Tariffs on trade in industrial products between Britain and the Community
countries will be eliminated in five equal stages over the transitional period,
with an initial 20 per cent reduction to take effect from 1st April I973’ Britain
will apply the common external tariff to all countries neither belonging to, nor
having any special arrangements with, the Communities, subject to special
arrangements for a limited number of industrial materials and to a transitional

period for adjustment, rates to be adjusted in four stages starting one year after
accession.
Britain will implement the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and its pricing
system, subject to a transitional period and special arrangements for New
Zealand dairy products and Commonwealth sugar.
The objectives of the CAP, as described in the Treaty of Rome, are to
increase agricultural productivity, to stabilise markets and to provide adequate
supplies at reasonable prices to the consumer. A structural reorganisation of
the industry is envisaged, but the more immediate objective has been to remove
tariffs and other barriers to trade in agricultural produce, to replace them by
levies to offset internal price differences, and to create common price levels
(by fixing ‘target’ prices each year) within the Community which would give
producers an adequate return. Under the policy the level of market prices for
the main agricultural products is maintained in two ways. The price of im¬
ports is kept up to a minimum or ‘threshold’ price by means of variable import
levies; and the internal market is supported by an ‘intervention’ price, slightly
below the threshold price, at which any surpluses are bought by the Com¬
munity’s agricultural fund. The fund also compensates Community exporters
when their sales to third countries are made at prices below Community levels.
Britain will adopt the Community system of support—though not Com¬
munity prices—in 1973, and introduce appropriate threshold and intervention
prices, which will gradually be increased to full Community levels by six equal
steps, subject to a 10 per cent tolerance, over the five-year transitional period
(see p. 321). There will be free trade with the Community countries (in the
products concerned) subject only, throughout the transitional period, to
arrangements to compensate for the difference in price levels—fixed levies on
Britain’s exports to the other Community countries and fixed compensatory
payments on their exports to Britain. The levies and export payments will be
gradually reduced by six steps over the five years, as prices come into line.
For those agricultural products for which the Community has a common
external tariff instead of, or in addition to, levies, the transitional arrangements
will take the form of tariff adjustments similar to those agreed for industry;
there will be a slower rate of adjustment for horticulture.
On 1 st February 1971 the EEC instituted a common fisheries policy based on
the establishment of a common market and free access for all members to
Community fishing waters. During the negotiations the applicant countries
indicated that they regarded the policy as regards access to be unacceptable,
and it was not until December 1971 that agreement was reached for suitable
access arrangements. The agreement provides that member countries of the
enlarged Community may restrict access in specified areas of their coastal
waters until 31st December 1982 (see p. 329), prior to which the Community
will review the situation and examine future arrangements. Britain will apply
the common marketing arrangements for the fisheries section and progressively
institute the common pricing system after 1st February 1973.
All member countries contribute to a common budget for certain specific
purposes, such as agricultural support (administered by the European Agri¬
cultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, often known by its French initials,
FEOGA), the European Social Fund (used for occupational re-training and
re-adaptation programmes and programmes designed to further manpower
mobility), and administrative costs. Under the direct income system, which
4<M
The
Commonwealth
Economic and
Monetary Union
BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
came into effect for the present members on 1st January 1971, the Communi¬
ties will progressively draw a greater proportion of the finance for this budget
directly from the revenue of customs duties and of levies on agricultural
imports. Except for a 10 per cent rebate to cover collection costs all levies on
agricultural imports are handed over to the Communities; in the case of
customs duties, an increasing proportion will be handed over, until from 1st
January 1975 all customs revenue, less 10 per cent for collection, will go to the
Community budget. Until 1975 the remaining proportion of the necessary
income (taking into account the new members’ contributions, which in
Britain’s case are described below) will be made up by contributions from the
(six original) member states according to a fixed scale (‘key’); after 1st January
1975 this will be replaced by a proportion (equivalent to up to a 1 per cent
rate) of the proceeds of the Value Added Tax (see p. 206).
Britain will adapt to the Community system over a series of years. A per¬
centage (or key) has been set, broadly corresponding to Britain’s present share
of the total gross national product (GNP) of the ten countries in the enlarged
Communities and representing the proportion of the budget which Britain
would nominally be expected to pay in the first year of membership. Over the
five years of the transitional period, Britain will pay a proportion of this
nominal contribution, increasing in annual steps, so that Britain will pay some
8-64 per cent of the Community budget in the first year, rising to 18-92 per
cent in the fifth year (1977), the latter being broadly comparable to Britain’s
share of the total GNP of the Ten. Arrangements have been made for the
two-year period after 1977 so that Britain’s contribution will not increase by
more than a limited amount. In 1980 and subsequently Britain will contribute
on the full basis of the direct income system.
For all British dependent territories, with the exception of Hong Kong and
Gibraltar, and for all the independent developing Commonwealth countries,
with the exception of those in Asia, arrangements have been made which
provide the opportunities of association, or in the case of the independent
developing countries the alternative of a trade agreement, with the enlarged
Community, permitting these countries access on favourable terms to the
enlarged Common Market. Provision has been made to safeguard New
Zealand exports of dairy products; the sugar-producing countries of the
developing Commonwealth have the assurance that, within the framework of
an association or trading agreement, it will be the Community’s firm purpose
to safeguard their interests. Until the end of 1974 Britain will fulfil its con¬
tractual obligations to buy agreed quantities of sugar under the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement (see p. 322). The independent Asian Commonwealth coun¬
tries will benefit from the Community’s generalised preference scheme and
have been given an undertaking that it will be the enlarged Community’s con¬
tinuing objective to expand and reinforce existing trade relations.
The Communities envisage a movement by stages towards economic and
monetary union, and as a first stage the countries which will form the enlarged
Communities have agreed on arrangements to keep the fluctuation of rates
between Community currencies within narrower margins,1 and for consultation
on short-term economic policies. After accession Britain envisages a gradual
1 When the British Government announced on 23rd June 1972 that, as a temporary
measure, sterling would be allowed to float (see p. i95)> h stated its intention of return¬
ing as soon as conditions permitted to the maintenance of normal IMF margins round
parity and participation in the special EEC currency arrangements.

and orderly run-down of official sterling balances; in the meantime, Britain
will manage its policies with a view to stabilising official sterling balances in a
way consistent with the longer-term objectives.
The Treaty of Rome provided for the progressive abolition of restrictions on
movements of capital between member countries, and subsequent directives
applied this to most of the main categories of capital movement. Britain will
make the necessary adjustments in exchange control policies by stages over the
transitional period, beginning with direct investment. Portfolio investment
will be dealt with later in the transitional period.
The Communities envisage the eventual harmonisation of indirect taxes, the
major step so far taken being the adoption of the Value Added Tax (VAT)
which Britain will introduce during 1973 (see p. 206). The members of the
Community are at present free to determine their own rates and coverage for
VAT, although it is envisaged that in due course harmonised rates and coverage
will be agreed. During the transitional period the present customs duties on
hydrocarbon oils, beer, spirits, wines and tobacco will be converted into in¬
ternal taxes to conform with the Treaty of Rome. As with VAT, members are
at present free to determine the rates of these duties.
Under the Community’s regulations nationals of member countries may freely
enter another member state to look for work or to take a job already arranged.
It has been agreed that there should be a five-year transitional period before
this system is applied to Northern Ireland.
The Community has negotiated association or preferential trade agreements
with Greece, Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Israel, Spain and Malta. Britain will
accede to these arrangements, subject to transitional provisions and any other
adaptations that may need to be made in consultation with countries concerned.
Britain has accepted the Treaty of Paris and the regulations made under it,
and will bring legislation and practices in line with these. The rules of the
treaty provide for free trade in coal and basic iron and steel products within
the Community. There is a pricing system which provides for controlled
competition by requiring producers to publish all their prices at selected basing
points; transport charges also have to be published or notified to the Com¬
mission. These pricing practices will be adopted by the National Coal Board,
the British Steel Corporation (BSC) and independent steel producers; the
Government’s powers to give directions on prices to the BSC will thus be
repealed. The present relationship between the Government and the coal and
steel industries will continue, although the Government’s powers to give
general directions will need to be modified. Community trade in coal will
be free from restrictions; tariffs for the relevant steel products will be adapted
at the same rate as has been agreed for industrial products generally (see above).
Britain has agreed to accept the treaty creating EURATOM and the rules
made under it without any transitional period, except in the case of tariffs,
where the necessary changes will be made one year after accession (1974).
Britain will play a full part in the future of the Community and its research
programmes; will accept the EURATOM control system; and in return for
the access to the stock of nuclear knowledge acquired by EURATOM will
deposit knowledge of equivalent value immediately after accession.

BRITAIN 1973: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain’s withdrawal from the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)
becomes effective on 31st December 1972. The six EFTA countries which
have not, like Britain, Denmark and Norway, applied for full membership of
the Communities have negotiated various trade agreements with the European
Economic Community, based on the principle of free trade in industrial goods.
A European Communities Bill was presented to Parliament on 26th January
1972, and was passed by the House of Commons in July 1972 and by the
House of Lords in September.1 The Bill makes the legislative changes neces¬
sary to comply with the obligations entailed by membership of the Communi¬
ties, to make provision for the application of future Community decisions and
to exercise the rights of membership.
The basic requirements of membership are dealt with in the first part of the
Bill, which gives the force of law in Britain to that present and future Com¬
munity law which, under the Community treaties, is directly applicable to
member states and provides for subordinate legislation in connection with the
implementation of Community obligations or the exercise of rights under the
treaties.
The second part of the Bill contains the detailed legislation—in part repeal¬
ing or amending existing statutes—needed on or shortly after accession to
implement Community obligations. The main purposes of this part of the Bill
are: to provide for the charging of customs duties in accordance with the
treaties; to set up an intervention board for agricultural produce to operate the
Common Agricultural Policy and to provide for the collection of levies; and to
amend the law in connection with cinematograph films, companies, restrictive
trade practices, customs procedures, coal and steel, seeds, food, horticultural
produce, fertilisers and feedingstuffs, animal health, plant health and trans¬
port, so as to comply with obligations which arise from Britain’s accession.
Other Community obligations will be met by using existing powers to make
subordinate legislation, introduced as the measures become applicable.
1 It is expected that the Bill will become an Act in October 1972.

records of the previous season and future prospects; many weekly or monthly periodicals on
sport are also published. In addition some newspapers issue annual surveys of sport.
INDEX
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain, organisa¬
tions and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter rather than under
Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. {that is. Accidents, Royal Society for the
Prevention of; Archives, National Register of). In cases where the first word is not
separable, however {for example, Royal Air Force, Royal Society), entries will be found
appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only where
they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed under the
relevant subject headings.
