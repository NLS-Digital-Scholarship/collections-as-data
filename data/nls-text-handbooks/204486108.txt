Introduction
Britain 1992 is the forty-third handbook in
the series. Prepared by the Central Office of
Information and published by HMSO, it is
widely known in Britain and overseas as an
established work of reference and is an
important element of the information service
provided by diplomatic posts. It is sold by
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office throughout
the world.
Britain 1992 describes many features in
the life of the country, including the
workings of the Government and other major
institutions. It does not attempt an analytical
approach to current events.
Care should be taken when studying
British statistics to note whether they refer
to England, to England and Wales
(considered together for many administrative
and other purposes), to Great Britain, which
comprises England, Wales and Scotland, or
to the United Kingdom (which is the same
as Britain, that is, Great Britain and
Northern Ireland) as a whole.
The factual and statistical information in
Britain 1992 is compiled with the co¬
operation of other government departments
and agencies, and of many other
organisations. Sources of more detailed and
more topical information (including statistics)
are mentioned in the text and a guide to
official sources is given in Appendix 2.
The text, generally, is based on
information available up to August/
September 1991.

Introduction
Britain comprises Great Britain (England,
Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland,
and is one of the 12 member states of the
European Community. Its full name is the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland.
Physical Features
Britain constitutes the greater part of the
British Isles. The largest of the islands is
Great Britain. The next largest comprises
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
Western Scotland is fringed by the large
archipelago known as the Hebrides and to
the north east of the Scottish mainland are
Orkney and Shetland. All these have
administrative ties with the mainland, but
the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the
Channel Islands between Great Britain and
France are largely self-governing, and are not
part of the United Kingdom.
With an area of some 242,500 sq km
(93,600 sq miles), Britain is just under 1,000
km (some 600 miles) from the south coast to
the extreme north of Scotland and just under
500 km (some 300 miles) across in the widest
part.
The climate is generally mild and
temperate. Prevailing winds are south¬
westerly and the weather from day to day is
mainly influenced by depressions moving
eastwards across the Atlantic. It is subject to
frequent changes but to few extremes of
temperature. It is rarely above 32°C (90°F)
or below -10°C (14°F). The average annual
rainfall is more than 1,600 mm (over 60
inches) in the mountainous areas of the west
and north but less than 800 mm (30 inches)
over central and eastern parts. Rain is fairly
well distributed throughout the year, but, on
average, March to June are the driest months
and September to January the wettest.
During May, June and July (the months of
longest daylight) the mean daily duration of
sunshine varies from five hours in northern
Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of Wight;
during the months of shortest daylight
(November, December and January) sunshine
is at a minimum, with an average of an hour
a day in northern Scotland and two hours a
day on the south coast of England.
Historical Outline
The word ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names probably stemming from a
Celtic original. Although in the prehistoric
time-scale the Celts were relatively late
arrivals in the British Isles (following
cultures which had produced such notable
monuments as the stone circles of Avebury
and Stonehenge), only with them does
Britain emerge into recorded history. The
term ‘Celtic’ is often used rather generally to
distinguish the early inhabitants of the
British Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon
invaders.
England and Wales
Roman rule lasted for over 300 years from
AD 43. The final Roman withdrawal in 408
followed a period of increasing disorder
during which the island began to be raided
by Angles, Saxons and Jutes from northern
Europe. It is from the Angles that the name
‘England’ derives. In the next two centuries
the raids turned into settlement and a
number of small kingdoms were established.
The Britons maintained an independent
existence in the areas now known as Wales
and Cornwall. Among these kingdoms, more
powerful ones emerged, claiming
1
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
overlordship over the whole country, first in
the north (Northumbria), then in the
midlands (Mercia) and finally in the south
(Wessex). However, further raids and
settlement by the Vikings from Scandinavia
occurred, although in the tenth century the
Wessex dynasty defeated the invading Danes
and established a wide-ranging authority in
England.
In 1066, the last successful invasion ot
England took place. Duke William of
Normandy defeated the English at the Battle
of Hastings. Normans and others from
France came to settle. French became the
language of the nobility for the next three
centuries and the legal and, to some extent,
social structure was influenced by that
prevailing across the Channel.
Wales had remained a Celtic stronghold,
although often within the English sphere of
influence. However, with the death in battle
in 1282 of Prince Llywelyn, Edward I
launched a successful campaign to bring
Wales under English rule. Continued strong
Welsh national feeling was indicated by the
rising led by Owain Glyndwr at the
beginning of the fifteenth century. The Acts
of Union of 1536 and 1542 united England
and Wales administratively, politically and
legally.
Scotland
Scotland was mainly inhabited by the Piets.
In the sixth century, the Scots from Ireland
(or ‘Scotia’) settled in what is now Argyll.
Lothian was populated by the English, while
Welsh Britons moved north to Strathclyde.
During the ninth century, the various parts
of Scotland united in defence against the
Vikings. The powerful monarchy which now
existed in England threatened Scottish
independence throughout the Middle Ages.
The eventual unification of England and
Scotland showed that religious differences
were now more important than old national
antagonisms. In England, Elizabeth I was
succeeded in 1603 by James VI of Scotland
(James I of England). Even so, England and
Scotland remained separate during the
seventeenth century, apart from an enforced
period of unification under Oliver Cromwell
In 1707, both countries, realising the benefits
of closer political and economic union,
agreed on a single parliament for Great
Britain. Scotland retained its own system of
law and church settlement. The Union
became strained during the reigns of the
Protestant Hanoverians George I and George
II, when two Jacobite risings attempted to
restore the Catholic Stuarts.
Ireland
A number of kingdoms had emerged in
Ireland before the Christian era. Ireland,
however, did not escape the incursions of the
Vikings, who dominated the country during
the tenth century.
In 1169 Henry II of England launched an
invasion of Ireland. He had been granted its
overlordship by the English Pope Adrian IV,
who was anxious to bring the Irish church
into full obedience to Rome. Although a
large part of the country came under the
control of Anglo-Norman magnates, little
direct authority was exercised from England
during the Middle Ages.
The Tudor monarchs showed a much
greater tendency to intervene in Ireland.
During the reign of Elizabeth I, a series of
campaigns was waged against Irish
insurgents. The main focus ol resistance was
the northern province of Ulster. With the
collapse of this resistance and the flight of its
leaders in 1607, Ulster became an area of
settlement by immigrants from Scotland and
England.
The English civil wars (1642-52) led to
further risings in Ireland, which were
crushed by Cromwell. There was more
fighting after the deposition of James II in
1688.
During most of the eighteenth century
there was an uneasy peace; towards its end
various efforts were made by British
governments to achieve stability. In 1782 the
Irish Parliament (dating from medieval
times) was given legislative independence,
the only constitutional tie with Great Britain
was the Crown. The Parliament represented,
however, only the privileged Anglo-Irish
minority and Catholics were excluded from
it. An abortive rebellion took place in 1798

and in 1801 Ireland was unified with Great
Britain.
The ‘Irish question’ continued as one ot
the major problems of British politics during
the nineteenth century. In 1886 the Liberal
Government introduced a Home Rule Bill
which would have given an Irish Parliament
authority over most internal matters while
reserving to Britain control over external
affairs. This led to a split in the Liberal
Party and the failure of the Bill. In 1914
Home Rule was enacted by the Government
of Ireland Act. Its implementation was
prevented by the threat of armed resistance
on the part of the Protestant majority in
Ulster and by the outbreak of the first world
war.
Although a nationalist rising in Dublin in
1916 was suppressed, a guerrilla force known
as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) began
operations against the British administration
at the end of the first world war. The
Government of Ireland Act 1920 provided
for the establishment of two Home Rule
parliaments, one in Dublin and the other in
Belfast. The Act was implemented in 1921 in
Northern Ireland, when six of the nine
counties of the province of Ulster received
their own Parliament and remained
represented in, and subject to the supreme
authority of, the British Parliament. In the
South the IRA continued to fight for
independence from the British
administration. After the signature of a truce
in June, the Anglo-Irish Treaty of December
1921 established the Irish Free State, which
became a republic in 1949.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man are not part of the United Kingdom,
they have a special relationship with it. The
Channel Islands were part of the Duchy of
Normandy in the tenth and eleventh
centuries. The Isle of Man was under the
nominal sovereignty of Norway until 1266,
and eventually came under the direct
administration of the Crown in 1765. Today
the territories have their own legislative

assemblies and systems of law. The British
Government is responsible for their defence,
their international relations and, ultimately,
their good government.
The Four Lands
In the following pages there are brief
separate descriptions of aspects of social,
economic and political life for England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with
some additional material on the political
situation in Northern Ireland.
ENGLAND
England is predominantly a lowland country,
although there are upland regions in the
north (the Pennine Chain, the Cumbrian
mountains and the Yorkshire moorlands) and
in the south west in Cornwall, Devon and
Somerset. Central southern England has the
downs—low chalk hill ranges. The greatest
concentrations of population are in London
and the south east, the West Yorkshire and
north-west industrial cities, the Midlands
conurbation around Birmingham, the north¬
east conurbations on the rivers Tyne and
Tees, and along the Channel coast.
The Church of England, which was
separated from the Roman Catholic Church
at the time of the Reformation, is the
Established Church; the Sovereign must
always be a member of the Church and
appoints its two archbishops and 42 other
diocesan bishops.
The English language is descended from
the German tongue spoken by the Anglo-
Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries. This
was subsequently influenced by Latin and
Norse vocabulary. The language was
transformed with the settlement by the
Normans from France.
Government
England has no government minister or
department exclusively responsible for its
central administration in domestic affairs, in
contrast to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Instead, there are a number of
government departments, whose
responsibilities in some cases also cover
aspects of affairs in Wales and Scotland.
There are 523 Members of Parliament for
England in the House of Commons, and
arrangements are made for the discussion of
regional affairs. Of the two major political
parties, the Conservatives find their support
chiefly in suburban and rural areas and have
a large majority of the parliamentary seats in
the southern half of England and in East
Anglia, while the Labour Party derives its
main support from urban industrialised
areas. In June 1991 England had 353
Conservative Members of Parliament, 157
Labour, 9 Liberal Democrat, 3 Social
Democrat and the Speaker of the House of
Commons.
Local government is administered through
a two-tier system of counties subdivided into
districts. There are 32 single-tier borough
authorities in London and six metropolitan
counties in other parts of England.
The English legal system comprises on
the one hand a historic body of
conventions known as ‘common law’
and ‘equity’, and, on the other,
parliamentary and European
Community legislation.
In the formulation of common law since
the Norman Conquest, great reliance was
placed on precedent. Equity law derives from
the practice of petitioning the King’s
Chancellor in cases not covered by common
law.
The Economy
In the later eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries Britain became the first
industrialised country, basing its wealth on
coalmining, on the manufacture of iron and
steel, heavy machinery and textiles, on
shipbuilding and on trade.
In the twentieth century a second period
of industrialisation changed the broad pattern
of development in England. In the 1920s and
1930s the northern industrial centres saw
their traditional manufactures weakened
owing to fluctuations in world trade and
competition from other industrialising

countries, and, in some cases, from substitute
products. The south east and the west
Midlands generally benefited from the newer
industries such as pharmaceuticals, artificial
fibres, electrical equipment, car manufacture
and a wide range of consumer goods.
In the second half of the century, jobs in
service industries have accounted for an
increasing share of total employment,
expansion being particularly marked in
financial and business services. In addition,
there has been a rise in self-employment.
London is one of the world’s leading
centres of banking, insurance and other
financial services. Many high technology
industries in the surrounding regions have
also developed. There has been an increase
in retailing activity, with a trend towards
large shopping developments on the outskirts
of towns, designed for shoppers with cars.
London is also the main English media
centre; the national press is published there,
and the national radio and television
networks have their headquarters there.
London and the neighbouring counties
account for half of central government services
and a significant proportion of non-food
wholesale distribution in England. After
London and the South East (where about
three-quarters of employees are engaged in the
service sector), the South West has the next
highest concentration of service industries.
East Anglia has been the fastest-growing
English region in both population and
employment since the 1960s. Although
largely agricultural, high-technology industry
has in recent years developed throughout the
region. One significant example is the
Cambridge Science Park. It contains a
number of science-based companies and
research organisations, which have close
collaborative links with the University.
Greater London and the industrial cities
of the West Midlands, the North West,
Yorkshire and Humberside, and the North
continue to represent the largest
concentrations of manufacturing industry. A
number of industrial areas (in the North, the
North West, Yorkshire and Humberside, and
the West Midlands) which suffered as a
result of the decline in traditional
manufacturing employment are benefiting
from the Government’s regional industrial
policy. This aims to reduce regional
disparities in job opportunities by making
investment incentives available in the areas of
greatest need, especially those which have
been dependent on declining industries. The
objective of the Enterprise Initiative,
launched in 1988 and aimed particularly at
small and medium-sized businesses, is to
increase competitiveness by improving
management skills.
In agriculture, dairying is most common
in the west of England; sheep and cattle are
reared in the hilly and moorland areas of the
North and South West. Arable farming, pig
and poultry farming and horticulture are
concentrated in the east and south.
Horticulture is also important in the West
Midlands. The principal fishing ports are on
the east coast and in the South West.
England has plentiful energy resources in
its coalfields and has access to offshore oil
and gas reserves. Important mineral deposits
include sand, gravel and crushed rock used
by the construction industry; industrial
minerals include clay, salt from the North
West, china clay from Cornwall and gypsum
from the midlands, North and South East.
The motorway network comprises four
long-distance routes linking London and the
cities of the Midlands, the North and North
West and the South West, the London
orbital route, and over 30 shorter motorways.
Considerable investment is being made in
the railways, both to improve inter-city
services and to provide new rolling-stock for
local services. The cross-Channel railway
tunnel will link Britain with the European
rail system and also provide a vehicle shuttle
service on specially designed trains. Services
through the tunnel are planned to start in
1993.
The major airports are Heathrow (the
busiest international airport in the world)
and Gatwick, both serving London; and
Manchester, Luton and Birmingham.
Stansted is being developed as London’s
third airport.
Tourism and the leisure industries have
expanded considerably in recent years. Over
half of expenditure by overseas visitors in
Britain takes place in London, although areas
7

elsewhere, encouraged by government
policies to expand tourism in the regions, are
becoming increasingly popular with overseas
tourists. The South West is the most
popular region for domestic tourism.
Cultural and Social Life
London has an extraordinary concentration
of cultural features (including four major art
galleries and a dozen renowned museums)
and theatrical, opera, ballet and concert
venues. Much the same broad range of
cultural interests is reflected in other major
cities and towns. Many theatres outside
London are used for touring by the national
theatre, dance and opera companies.
Of the many tourist attractions in
England, the most popular of those charging
for admission in 1990 were Madame
Tussaud’s waxworks in London, the Tower
of London and Alton Towers (Staffordshire),
with 2-5, 2-3 and 2T million visitors
respectively.
The English love of gardens and
landscapes is associated with a tradition of
sightseeing visits to country houses, gardens
and unspoilt rural and coastal areas. There
are seven National Parks, six forest parks, 34
designated ‘areas of outstanding natural
beauty’, ten environmentally sensitive areas,
almost 200 country parks approved by the
Countryside Commission, over 6,000
conservation areas, 800 km (500 miles) of
designated heritage coastline, and about
2,000 historic buildings and over 3,000
gardens open to the public. There are also
safari and wildlife parks, and ‘theme’ parks,
all offering family activities and
entertainment. Many regions and towns have
associations with great English writers and
artists, such as William Shakespeare
(Stratford-upon-Avon), William Wordsworth
(Lake District), Arnold Bennett (Stoke-on-
Trent), the Bronte sisters (Yorkshire),
Thomas Hardy (Dorset) and John Constable
(Essex and Suffolk).
WALES
Wales is a country of hills and mountains,
the highest of which are in Snowdonia in the
north west; the tallest peak is Snowdon
(1,085 m, 3,560 ft). Two-thirds of the
population lives in the southern valleys and
the lower-lying coastal areas. The chief
urban centres are Cardiff, Swansea, Newport
and Wrexham. Wales is a principality; Prince
Charles, the heir to the throne, was invested
by the Queen with the title of Prince of
Wales at Caernarfon Castle in 1969, when he
was 20.
Latest figures suggest that about one-
fifth of the population speaks Welsh, a
language of Celtic origin. 
Welsh speakers are concentrated in the
rural north and west. The Welsh name of
the country is Cymru. Welsh has equal
validity with English in law courts, bilingual
education in schools is encouraged, and there
has been an extended use of Welsh for
official purposes and in broadcasting. Welsh-
language television programmes are
transmitted in Wales by Sianel 4 Cymru
(Channel 4 Wales). A Welsh Language Board
advises on matters relating to the Welsh
language.
There is no established church, the
Anglican church having been disestablished
in 1920 following decades of pressure from
adherents of the Methodist and Baptist
churches. Methodism in particular spread
rapidly in Wales in the eighteenth century,
assuming the nature of a popular movement
among Welsh speakers and finding strong
support later in industrial communities.
Government
The country returns 38 Members of
Parliament and there are special
arrangements for the discussion of Welsh
affairs. For the last 60 years the industrial
communities have tended to support the
Labour Party in elections, ensuring a Labour
majority of seats. Wales has 26 Labour
Members of Parliament, 6 Conservative, 3
Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalist) and 3
Liberal Democrat.
The Secretary of State for Wales, who is
a member of the Cabinet, has wide-ranging
responsibilities relating to the economy,
8
LAND AND PEOPLE
welfare services and the provision of
amenities. The headquarters of the
administration is the Welsh Office in Cardiff,
which also has an office in London. Local
government is exercised through a system of
elected authorities similar to that in England,
and the legal system is identical with the
English one.
The Economy
In the nineteenth century the Welsh economy
was mainly based on coal, iron, steel and
tinplate. It contracted sharply during the
1920s and 1930s, resulting in severe
unemployment and substantial emigration.
In the past 30 years contraction of the
older heavy industries has continued.
Practically all the coal mines have been
closed. Wales produces about 10 per cent of
British opencast coal production, including
all of its anthracite. Although Wales still
accounts for 31 per cent of British steel
production, it is now an important centre for
electronics and several new high-technology
businesses in related industries have been
established. Significant investment by
overseas companies accounts for about 27 per
cent of jobs in manufacturing. Financial and
business services are expanding rapidly; some
large companies have relocated major parts of
their operation to Wales, providing support
for industrial development. Government
relocation has also benefited employment.
Although south Wales remains the
principal industrial area, new industries and
firms have been introduced in north-east
Wales and light industry attracted to the
towns in mid- and north Wales rural areas.
A development corporation was set up in
1987 to stimulate the regeneration of the
Cardiff Bay area. Regional aid for the south
Wales valleys has created and safeguarded
about 18,000 jobs. The Welsh Development
Agency has invested about £65 million in
factory building, and a total of 620 hectares
(1,550 acres) of derelict land in the valleys
has been cleared. A £14 million investment
in environmental improvement schemes was
announced by the Government in 1990.
Agriculture occupies about 80 per cent of
the land area, the main activities being sheep
and cattle rearing in the hill regions and
dairy farming in the lowlands. Wales
accounts for over 20 per cent of the Forestry
Commission’s timber production.
The biggest pumped-storage power
station in Europe is at Dinorwig in
Gwynedd. Good communications exist in the
south, with motorway links across the Severn
Bridge to southern England and the
Midlands, and high-speed rail services to a
number of destinations in England. A second
road crossing of the Severn is planned.
Flights to New York leave from Cardiff-
Wales airport.
There has been expansion in the tourist
and catering trades and in some areas of
public administration. With its coastal resorts,
and three National Parks (Snowdonia, the
Brecon Beacons and the Pembrokeshire
Coast), as well as other areas of picturesque
hill, lake and mountain country, Wales
attracts many tourists, especially for outdoor
holidays.
Cultural and Social Life
Welsh literature is one of the oldest and
richest in Europe, and there is a national
library. The Welsh people also have strong
musical traditions; the country is well known
for its choral singing and the Welsh National
Opera has an international reputation.
Special festivals, known as eisteddfodau,
encourage Welsh literature and music. The
largest is the annual Royal National
Eisteddfod, consisting of competitions in
music, singing, prose and poetry entirely in
Welsh. The town of Llangollen includes
artists from all over the world in the annual
International Musical Eisteddfod. An active
local press includes a number of Welsh
language publications.
The education system is similar to that in
England, except for the use of Welsh in
some schools, particularly in the Welsh¬
speaking, largely rural, areas. The collegiate
University of Wales, founded in 1893,
comprises six member institutions.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union football,
which has come to be regarded as the Welsh
national game.

BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SCOTLAND
Just over half of Scotland consists of the
sparsely populated highlands and islands in
the north. Three-quarters of the population
and most of the industrial towns are in the
central lowlands. Scotland contains large
areas of unspoilt and wild landscape, with
internationally significant concentrations of
plants and animals. It contains the majority
of Britain’s highest mountains—nearly 300
peaks over 913 m (3,000 ft). The highest are
the Grampians in the central highlands, with
Ben Nevis (1,343 m, 4,406 ft) the tallest
peak. The southern uplands, which contain a
number of hill ranges, border on England.
The chief cities are Edinburgh (the capital),
Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee.
The established Church of Scotland is a
Protestant church which is Presbyterian in
form; it is governed by a hierarchy of church
courts, each of which includes lay people.
Government
There are special arrangements for the
conduct of Scottish affairs within the British
svstem of government and separate Acts ot
Parliament are passed for Scotland where
appropriate. In August 1991 the 72 Scottish
seats in the House of Commons were
represented by 48 Labour Members of
Parliament, 10 Conservative, 9 Liberal
Democrat and 5 Scottish National.
Scottish administration is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for
Scotland, a member of the Cabinet, working
through the Scottish Office, which has its
headquarters in Edinburgh and an office in
London.
Local government generally operates on a
two-tier basis broadly similar to that in
England and Wales. The three islands
councils (for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles) are single-tier authorities. The
principles and procedures of the Scottish
legal system (particularly in civil law) differ
in many respects from those of England and
Wales; these differences stem, in part, from
the adoption of elements of other European
legal systems, based on Roman law, during
the sixteenth century.
The Economy
Scotland has experienced the same pressure
on its traditional industries as the north of
England and Wales. However, over the past
decades its economy has been transformed,
with a developed oil and gas industry, and
investment by overseas companies making
significant contributions to the growth of
modern, technologically based industries.
The electronics industry, which includes
many of the world’s leading companies in
this field, provides 12 per cent of jobs in
manufacturing and 20 per cent of output and
investment. Between 1979 and 1989 Scottish
electronics output quadrupled. By mid-1990
about 210 plants were employing some
47,000 workers, one of the biggest
concentrations of the electronics industry in
Western Europe.
Scotland accounts for more than half of
Britain’s output of integrated circuits and
for over 10 per cent of European output.
Since the early 1970s the Scottish
economy has also benefited from industries
related to the discovery of oil and gas under
the northern North Sea. Up to about
100,000 jobs are estimated to have arisen
directly or indirectly as a result of North Sea
activities.
Traditional industries, such as coal, steel
and shipbuilding, have experienced a long¬
term decline in employment. Others, such as
high-quality tweeds and other textiles, and
food and drink products, remain important.
The Scotch whisky industry had exports of
over £1,700 million in 1990.
The disadvantage and decay to be found
in some areas, particularly housing estates on
the periphery of cities and towns, are being
tackled through comprehensive renewal
projects designed to solve the economic,
social and physical problems which have
arisen.
Scotland has about one-third of Britain s
agricultural land, but /0 per cent consists of
rough grazing (including common grazing)
for cattle and sheep. About 11 per cent of
the agricultural area is used for crops, and 53
per cent of this is under barley. Scotland
10
LAND AND PEOPLE
accounts for nearly half of Britain’s forest
area and for over one-third of timber
production; the bulk of new planting in
Britain takes place in Scotland, most of it in
the upland and mountain areas. Fishing
remains an important activity; more than 75
per cent of total landings of fish in Britain
are made at Scottish ports.
Nuclear and hydro-electric generation
supply a higher proportion of energy than in
any other part of Britain. With the two
Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor stations at
Torness (Lothian) and Hunterston
(Strathclyde) in full production, some 50 per
cent of Scotland’s electricity comes from
nuclear power. Hydro-power and other
renewables contribute a further 12 to 15 per
cent, the remainder coming from low-
sulphur Scottish coal and (from 1992) North
Sea gas.
Communications, both domestic and
international, have improved in many areas,
particularly in the north and north east,
owing to the stimulus of the offshore oil
industry, of road- and bridge-building
programmes and of the improvement of ferry
links to the Scottish islands. The offshore oil
industry has also encouraged expansion in
the traditionally strong financial and business
services, which are one of the fastest-growing
sectors of the Scottish economy. Tourism
makes a significant contribution to the
overall economy, and the tourism and leisure
industries directly provide about 154,000 jobs
—8 per cent of Scottish employment.
Cultural and Social Life
A vigorous cultural life has as its highlight
the annual Edinburgh International Festival,
one of the world’s leading cultural events.
Notable performing arts bodies are the Royal
Scottish Orchestra, Scottish Opera, Scottish
Ballet, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Scottish
Baroque Ensemble and the BBC Scottish
Symphony Orchestra. Scotland possesses
excellent collections of the fine and applied
arts, notably in the National Galleries of
Scotland, the Royal Museums of Scotland
and the City of Glasgow Museum and Art
Galleries (including the Burrell collection,
opened in 1983). The Government intends
to fund the construction in Edinburgh of a
new Museum of Scotland.
Gaelic, a language of ancient Celtic origin,
is spoken by some 80,000 people, mainly in
the islands and north west.
An active press includes six national daily
morning newspapers, six local evening
newspapers and four national Sunday
newspapers. Television programmes are
produced by BBC Scotland and by three
independent companies, covering the
highland, lowland and border regions. BBC
Radio Scotland covers most of the
population.
The educational tradition has been
particularly strong, helping many Scots to
positions of eminence in the arts and
sciences. There are eight universities, of
which four (St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen
and Edinburgh) were established in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, while the
other four have been established since 1964.
Over 57 per cent of Scotland’s housing
has been built since 1945, a higher
proportion than in either England or Wales.
The tenure pattern is very different from
that in the rest of Britain, with 42 per cent
of housing rented from the public sector,
compared with 25 per cent for Great Britain
as a whole. As in the rest of Britain, there
has been a noticeable growth in owner-
occupied housing in recent years.
The sport of golf originated in Scotland,
and courses at St Andrews, Gleneagles,
Turnberry, Muirfield, Troon and Prestwick
are internationally renowned. There are also
winter sports centres at Aviemore, Glenshee,
Glen Coe, Aonach Mhor and the Lecht.
NORTHERN IRELAND
Northern Ireland is at its nearest point only
21 km (13 miles) from Scotland. It has a
488-km (303-mile) border in the south and
west with the Irish Republic. At its centre
lies Lough Neagh, Britain’s largest
freshwater lake (381 sq km, 147 sq miles).
Many of the principal towns lie in valleys
leading from the Lough, including the
capital, Belfast, which stands at the mouth of
the river Lagan. The Mourne Mountains,
rising sharply in the south east, include
11
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Slieve Donard, Northern Ireland’s highest
peak (852 m, 2,796 ft).
Just under two-thirds of the population
are descendants of Scots or English settlers
who crossed to north-eastern Ireland mainly
in the seventeenth century; most belong to
the Protestant faith, and support the
maintenance of the union with Great Britain.
The remainder, over a third, are Irish in
origin and mainly Roman Catholic, many of
them are nationalist in political opinion,
favouring union with the Irish Republic.
Government
Background to Civil Disturbances
For 50 years from 1921 Northern Ireland
had its own devolved Parliament in which
the mainly Protestant Unionists consistently
formed the majority and therefore
constituted the Government after successive
elections. Nationalists resented this
domination and their effective exclusion from
political office.
An active and articulate civil rights
movement emerged during the late 1960s.
Reforms were made but sectarian
disturbances developed, which required the
introduction of the Army in 1969 to support
the police in keeping the peace.
Subsequently, sectarian divisions were
exploited by the actions of terrorists from
both sides, but most notably by the
Provisional Irish Republican Army, who
claimed to be protecting the Roman Catholic
minority.
From 1969 the Northern Ireland
Government enacted reforms aimed at
securing the minority’s right to an effective
voice in public bodies. A police authority
representative of all sections of the
community was created. Commissioners
became responsible for investigating
complaints of maladministration, including
discrimination, against government
departments and local authorities. A central
housing executive became responsible for all
public sector house-building and the
allocation of houses according to need.
Local government was restructured and
electoral law, including the franchise and
the arrangements for reviewing electoral
boundaries, was reformed.
Direct Rule and Political Initiatives
Despite this reform programme, the inter-
communal violence continued, this leading to
a decision by the British Government to take
over responsibility for law and order in 1972.
The Northern Ireland Government resigned
in protest against this decision and direct
rule began. Northern Ireland continues to be
governed by direct rule under legislation
passed in 1974. This allows the Parliament in
London to approve all laws for Northern
Ireland and places its government
departments under the direction and control
of the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, who is a Cabinet minister.
Legislation passed in 1973 and 1982
provides for a measure of devolved
government in Northern Ireland. This
arrangement was last in force in January
1974, following agreement between the
Northern Ireland political parties to form a
power-sharing Executive. The Executive,
however, collapsed in May 1974 and there
has been no devolution since.
Attempts have been made by successive
British governments to find a means of
restoring a widely acceptable form of
devolved government to Northern Ireland. A
78-member Assembly was elected by
proportional representation in 1982. Four
years later this was dissolved after it ceased
to discharge its responsibilities to make
proposals for the resumption of devolved
government and to monitor the work of the
Northern Ireland government departments.
One of the reasons for the Assembly’s
dissolution was in part the Unionists’
reaction to the signing of the Anglo-Irish
Agreement between the British and Irish
governments in November 1985.
The objectives of the Agreement are to:
• promote peace and stability in Northern
Ireland;
• create a new climate of friendship and
co-operation between the peoples of
Britain and the Irish Republic; and
• improve co-operation in combating
terrorism.
12
LAND AND PEOPLE
The Agreement commits the British and
Irish governments to the principle that
Northern Ireland shall remain part of Britain
for so long as that is the wish of a majority. It
recognises that at present a majority in
Northern Ireland wishes to remain as part of
Britain. Both governments have undertaken
that, should a majority in Northern Ireland
formally consent to the establishment of a
united Ireland, they would introduce and
support the necessary legislation. The
Agreement binds both governments to these
commitments in international law. The
Agreement also established an Inter¬
governmental Conference through which the
Irish Government can put forward views and
proposals on specified matters affecting
Northern Ireland affairs. This only applies
where these matters are not the responsibility
of a devolved administration in Northern
Ireland and where cross border co-operation
can be promoted in the interests of both
countries. There is no derogation from the
sovereignty of either the British or the Irish
Government as a result of the Agreement;
each retains full responsibility for decisions
and administration within its own jurisdiction.
Despite the dissolution of the last
Assembly the Government remains committed
to finding a means by which substantial power
and responsibility might be transferred to
local elected representatives on a widely
acceptable basis. In January 1990 the
Government invited the leaders of the four
constitutional parties—the Alliance Party, the
Social Democratic and Labour Party, the
Ulster Unionist Party and the Ulster
Democratic Unionist Party—to enter into a
dialogue with it about the possibility of
holding round-table talks. It soon became
clear that the agenda which the parties wished
to address would require the involvement of
the Irish Government and it too became
involved in this process of ‘talks about talks’.
It was agreed that the talks should take place
on the basis of three strands:
• Strand One, involving the constitutional
parties and the Government, would look
at relationships within Northern Ireland,
including that between any new
institutions there and the British
Parliament at Westminster;
• Strand Two, involving the four parties
and the British and Irish governments,
would look at relationships between the
people of the island of Ireland; and
• Strand Three, involving the two
governments, would look at the
relationship between the peoples of the
British Isles.
To allow an opportunity for such wider
political dialogue, the two governments
agreed not to hold any meetings of the
Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference
between two prespecified dates (subsequently
identified as 26 April and 16 July 1991).
The talks began on 30 April with a series
of bilateral meetings between the
Government and the political parties to
discuss practical and procedural issues.
Plenary sessions began on 17 June. By 3 July
it had become clear that it would not be
possible to launch Strands Two and Three
in the time available, and that this was likely
to inhibit further progress in Strand One. It
was therefore agreed that the talks should
end in an orderly manner.
The final statement issued by the
participants affirmed that the talks had been
valuable and had produced genuine dialogue.
The British Government hopes that they will
provide a firm foundation for future dialogue
and that further exchanges with the parties
and the Irish Government will produce a
basis for fresh talks.
Northern Ireland returns 17 members to
the United Kingdom Parliament. In the last
general election in 1987 the seats (and votes)
were distributed as follows: Ulster Unionist
9 (37 8 per cent), Democratic Unionist 3
(11-7 per cent), Ulster Popular Unionist 1
(2 5 per cent), Social Democratic and Labour
3 (21 1 per cent), and Sinn Fein 1 (11-4 per
cent); the Sinn Fein member has not taken
his seat. The Alliance Party received 10 per
cent of the votes but no seats.
Human Rights
The Government is committed to the
protection of human rights in Northern
Ireland. Britain is a signatory to the
European Convention on Human Rights and
13
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
allows individual petition. Legislation passed
in 1973 outlaws discrimination by public
bodies, including the Government, on the
grounds of religious belief or political
opinion. It also set up the independent
Standing Advisory Commission on Human
Rights, which advises the Government on
the effectiveness of anti-discrimination
legislation and on other human rights issues.
In 1987 a central community relations unit
was established within the Government to
advise on the impact of government policies
and programmes on community relations and
to bring forward ideas on future action.
Direct and indirect discrimination in
employment by public and private employers
is also illegal. Legislation passed in 1976
made discrimination on the grounds of
religion or politics unlawful and established a
Fair Employment Agency to promote equal
opportunities and work towards the
eradication of discrimination.
New legislation came into effect in 1990.
It strengthened the 1976 measures by
requiring employers to:
• monitor the religious composition of
their workforce and job applicants;
• take firm action, where necessary, to
provide for a fair distribution of jobs
between the two communities;
and
• review their employment practices every
three years.
The legislation also provides for criminal
fines and economic sanctions against
employers found guilty of bad practice.
Two new bodies have been established.
The Fair Employment Agency was renamed
the Fair Employment Commission. It has
increased powers and resources to enable it
to investigate employment practices,
prescribe affirmative measures and offer
advice and guidance. The new Fair
Employment Tribunal determines individual
complaints of alleged discrimination and
appeals by employers against directions of
the Commission.
The effectiveness of the legislation is
being continuously evaluated and will be
formally reviewed after five years.
Security Policy
While terrorism continues, certain emergency
powers are in force. These include special
powers of arrest in respect of certain serious
crimes, non-jury courts to try those offences,
and the banning of terrorist organisations.
The powers are balanced by specific
safeguards; the measures are temporary, need
annual renewal by Parliament and are subject
to annual independent review.
Most traditional rights, including freedom
from persecution and freedom of speech,
remain in force. The Government has,
however, banned the broadcasting of direct
statements by representatives of terrorist
organisations or their supporters.
The security forces are accountable to the
law; if they break it, their members are liable
to prosecution like any other members of the
community. An independent police
complaints commission supervises police
investigations into more serious complaints
and, at its discretion, the investigation of
others. Northern Ireland’s legal system, and
the safeguards it enshrines, are broadly
similar to those in England and Wales.
The use of violence as a means of
overcoming political differences has been
condemned by the overwhelming majority of
people living in Northern Ireland and,
although terrorism continues, the overall
level of violence is lower than in the early
1970s. Since 1969 some 3,000 people have
been killed as a result of terrorist campaigns.
The police take the primary role in
maintaining order; the Army’s task is one of
assisting the civil authorities, and the number
of soldiers on service has been considerably
reduced. Terrorists are brought to justice
through the courts and are tried for criminal
offences, not political beliefs.
The Economy
Population and industry are concentrated on
the eastern seaboard, while the rest of
Northern Ireland remains predominantly
rural and reliant mainly upon agriculture for
its livelihood. Since the end of the second
world war employment in shipbuilding, linen
and agriculture has declined. However, there
14
LAND AND PEOPLE
has been fast growth in the numbers seeking
work, reflecting the relatively high rate of
natural increase of the population, which is
only partly offset by emigration.
Unemployment is therefore higher than in
any other British region. The unemployment
rate fell from 171 per cent in June 1987 to
13-8 per cent in June 1991.
There has been a switch in emphasis from
agriculture and manufacturing towards
services. However, agriculture
(predominantly livestock and livestock
products) still accounts for three times the
proportion of civil employment in Britain as
a whole. Belfast has one of Britain’s largest
shipyards, and aerospace engineering is one
of Northern Ireland’s biggest manufacturing
industries. Other industrial activities include
the manufacture of a wide range of
engineering products and clothing, vehicle
components, oil-well equipment, electronics,
telecommunications equipment, carpets,
synthetic rubber, and food processing and
packaging.
Manufacturing output increased by 13 per
cent between 1985 and 1990, while output
per employee hour rose by 15 per cent over
this period. Living standards, as measured by
gross domestic product per person, are
lower than in Britain as a whole, standing at
75 per cent in 1989. Average earnings in
1990 were around 86 per cent of those in
Great Britain. Governments have offered
more generous incentives than are available
in the rest of Britain to encourage new
investment.
In 1990 the Government published a
document which concluded that long-term
growth could only be generated by
improvements in competitiveness led by the
private sector. Government policy is to:
• ensure that future assistance tackles
obstacles preventing Northern Ireland
industry becoming internationally
competitive;
• target areas with growth potential in
partnership with the private sector;
• intensify the drive for inward
investment;
• build up management and workforce
skills;
• target programmes on areas of social and
economic deprivation and on the needs
of the long-term unemployed;
• stimulate the development of
entrepreneurs; and
• change the emphasis from promotion of
new jobs to the strengthening of
industry’s competitive position, from
which more jobs can result in the
medium term.
In 1988 the Making Belfast Work
initiative was launched to address the
economic, educational, social and
environmental problems in the most
disadvantaged areas of Belfast. During the
period 1988-94 an additional 3£123-6 million
is being allocated to projects designed to
create jobs and businesses, and to improve
levels of skill, the physical environment, and
health and living conditions in the areas.
Northern Ireland has parity with England,
Scotland and Wales on taxation and services.
To maintain social services at the level of
those in Great Britain, to meet the cost of
security measures and to compensate for the
natural disadvantages of geography and lack
of resources, the British Government’s
subvention to Northern Ireland in 1990-91
was just over £2,000 million.
In 1986 the British and Irish
governments signed an agreement setting up
the International Fund for Ireland and
donations have been received from the
United States, Canada, New Zealand and the
European Community. The Fund finances
projects covering business enterprise,
tourism, urban development, agriculture and
fisheries, science and technology, and
community relations. Two investment
companies, one on each side of the border,
provide venture capital to new businesses.
Three-quarters of the Fund is being spent in
Northern Ireland and the rest in the Irish
Republic’s border counties.
Cultural and Social Life
Northern Ireland’s landscape and natural
features, cultural traditions and festivals
continue to offer special attractions; it
received nearly L2 million visitors in 1990.
15
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The annual Belfast Festival at Queen’s
University is among the most important
international festivals in Britain.The story of
Ulster emigrants’ contributions to American
life, the history of Northern Ireland, and
other aspects of its culture, including its
dialects and strong literary tradition, are
recorded in the Ulster-American Folk Park,
the Ulster Museum and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum.
The Government provides financial
support for arts and cultural activities related
to the Irish language. Over 20,000 secondary
school pupils currently study Irish; full degree
courses and research programmes are available
at Northern Ireland’s two universities, which
have well developed links with industry.
Health and personal social services
correspond fairly closely to those in the rest
of Britain, although the administrative
framework is different.
Although publicly maintained schools
must be open to children from all religions,
in practice Roman Catholic and Protestant
children are for the most part educated in
separate schools. In recent years a small
number of integrated schools have been
established with government support to
provide education for Protestant and Roman
Catholic children together. Successive
governments have encouraged such schools
where there is sufficient parental demand.
In the last ten years the housing stock in
Northern Ireland has increased by about
12 per cent and owner-occupation from
51 per cent to more than 60 per cent.
Major town centre developments are
taking place in Belfast, Londonderry and
other towns, providing greatly improved
shopping facilities.
Local television and radio programmes are
broadcast and there is a local press; national
radio and television networks are also
received, and the national press is sold widely.
The Social Framework
The underlying causes of the changing
lifestyle in Britain in the second half of the
twentieth century include a lower birth rate,
longer life expectancy, a higher divorce rate,
wider educational opportunities, technological
progress and a higher standard of living.
POPULATION
According to preliminary results of the April
1991 census, Britain’s population is 55-5
million. It ranks seventeenth in the world in
terms of population. Population figures are
derived from the census of population (taken
every ten years), with allowance for
subsequent births and deaths (obtained from
compulsory registration) and migration. The
latest census included for the first time a
question on ethnic grouping. The results are
being published in stages from mid-1991.
The British population is expected, on
mid-1989 based projections, to be 59 2
million in 2001 and 60 million in 2011.
Birth Rates
In 1990 there were 798,600 live births,
21,300 more than in 1989. Births
outnumbered deaths (641,800) by 156,800.
The total period fertility rate (an indication
of the average family size) remains below 21,
the level leading to the long-term
replacement of the population, although it is
projected to increase from L8 in 1989 to 2
for women born in or after 1980.
Contributory factors to the relatively low
birth rate in recent years (13-9 live births per
1,000 population in 1990) include:
• the trends towards later marriage and
towards postponing births, which have
led to an increase in the average age of
women having children—provisionally
27-5 years in 1990 compared with 26-7 in
1980;
• the current preference for smaller
families than in the past, which has led
to a significant decline in the proportion
of families with four or more children.
In 1990, 21 per cent of households in
Great Britain consisted of a married
couple with one or two children only,
compared with 4 per cent of households
consisting of a married couple with three
or more children; and
16
LAND AND PEOPLE
• more widespread and effective
contraception, making it easier to plan
families. Voluntary sterilisation of men
and women has also become more
common. Of all pregnancies in England
and Wales in 1989, 42-3 per cent were
conceived outside marriage and of these
36-4 per cent were terminated by legal
abortion.
Mortality
At birth the expectation of life for a man is
about 72 years and for a woman 78 years,
compared with 49 years for men and 52
years for women in 1901. There has only
been a small increase in life expectancy in
the older age groups.
The general death rate has remained
roughly the same for the past 40 years, at
about 12 per 1,000 population, although in
1990 it fell to 11-2. However, there has been
a decline in mortality at most ages,
particularly among children. The infant
mortality rate (deaths of infants under one
year old per 1,000 live births) was 7 9 in
1990; neonatal mortality (deaths of infants
under four weeks old per 1,000 live births)
was 4 5 in 1990; and maternal mortality is
about 0 07 per 1,000 total births. The
decline in mortality reflects better nutrition,
rising standards of living, the advance of
medical science, the growth of medical
facilities, improved health measures, better
working conditions, education in personal
hygiene and the smaller size of families.
Deaths resulting from infectious diseases
(notably tuberculosis) have virtually
disappeared.
Deaths caused by circulatory diseases
(including heart attacks and strokes) now
account for nearly half of all deaths, and
mortality from heart disease in Britain
remains high compared with that of other
developed countries. The next largest cause
of death is cancer, which is responsible for
nearly one-quarter of deaths.
Cigarette smoking is the greatest
preventable cause of illness and death in
Britain. However, there has been a
significant decline in the incidence of
smoking, with 33 per cent of adult males and
30 per cent of adult females smoking
cigarettes in 1988, as against 52 and 41 per
cent respectively in 1972.
The Government is pursuing a
comprehensive strategy against drug misuse
in Britain. Initiatives are aimed at reducing
both the supply of, and demand for, drugs.
A number of government priorities, to
support the overall aims of improving the
country’s health and providing high-quality
care for those who need it, have been listed.
Marriage and Divorce
In 1989 there were 392,042 marriages in
Britain, of which 36 per cent were
remarriages of one or both parties. Some 34
per cent of all marriages in 1989 were
remarriages where one or both parties had
been divorced. Of the population aged 16 or
over in England and Wales in 1989, 59 per
cent were married, 26 per cent single, 9 per
cent widowed and 6 per cent divorced. The
average age for first marriages in England
and Wales is now 26 3 for men and 24 2 for
women.
In 1989 about 12-7 decrees of divorce
were made absolute for every 1,000 married
couples in England and Wales. The rates are
lower in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In
1989, 150,872 divorces were granted in
England and Wales; the proportion granted
to wives was 71‘6 per cent. The average age
of people at the time of divorce in England
and Wales is now about 38 3 for men and
35 7 for women.
Another feature, common to many other
Western European countries, has been an
increase in cohabitation. Over one-quarter of
women in Great Britain marrying during the
period 1980 to 1984, where the marriage was
the first for both parties, had lived with their
husbands before marriage (compared with 7
per cent for those married in the early
1970s). About 21 per cent of non-married
women aged 18 to 49 were cohabiting during
1988. Cohabitation occurs more frequently
for separated or divorced women than for
single women.
There is some evidence of a growing
number of stable non-married relationships.
Half of all births outside marriage (which
17
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
now account for 28 per cent of live births in
Britain) are registered by both parents giving
a single address as their place of residence.
years of age, beyond which the number of
women exceeds the number of men. This
imbalance increases with age so that there are
many more women among the elderly.
Age and Sex Structure
The total population has remained relatively
stable over the last decade. The proportion
of young people aged under 16 fell steadily
in the early 1980s, but numbers in this age
group have increased slightly in the last two
years. The proportion of elderly people,
especially those aged 85 and over, has
continued to increase. The age distribution
of the British population in mid-1990 was
estimated as follows:
• 20-2 per cent under 16 years of age;
• 64-1 per cent between 16 and 64 years;
and
• 15-7 per cent aged 65 and over.
Some 18 per cent of the population were
over the normal retirement ages (65 for men
and 60 for women), compared with 15 per
cent in 1961.
There is a ratio of about 105 females to
every 100 males. There are about 5 per cent
more male than female births every year.
Because of the higher mortality of men at all
ages, there is a turning point, at about 50
Distribution of Population
The population density is about 229
inhabitants per sq km, which is well above
the European Community average of about
145 per sq km. Of the four lands, England is
the most densely populated with 354 people
per sq km. Scotland is the least densely
populated with 64 people per sq km. Wales
and Northern Ireland have 135 and 111
people per sq km respectively.
Since the nineteenth century there has
been a trend, especially in London, for
people to move away from congested urban
centres into the suburbs. There has also been
a geographical redistribution of the
population from Scotland and the northern
regions of England to the South East, East
Anglia, the South West and the East
Midlands in recent decades. An increase in
the rate of retirement migration has also
occurred, the main recipient areas (where in
some towns the retired constitute over one-
quarter of the population) being the south
coast of England and East Anglia.

LAND AND PEOPLE
Migration
From 1984 to 1988 some 998,000 people left
Britain (excluding the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man) to live abroad and about 1 • 1
million came from overseas to live in Britain,
so that net immigration increased the
population by about 114,000. (These figures
exclude migration to and from the Irish
Republic.)
In 1989 the total inflow of people
intending to stay in Britain was 250,000, 16
per cent higher than in 1988. The outflow
of people leaving to live abroad, at 205,000,
was 13 per cent lower than in 1988 and
slightly below the average for the last ten
years.
Of the 205,000 departing residents in
1989:
• 27 per cent left for Australia, Canada or
New Zealand;
• 16 per cent for other Commonwealth
countries;
• 22 per cent for other European
Community countries;
• 15 per cent for the United States;
• 6 per cent for the Middle East; and
• 3 per cent for South Africa.
Of the 250,000 new residents in 1989:
• 19 per cent came from Australia, Canada
or New Zealand;
• 23 per cent from other Commonwealth
countries;
• 22 per cent from other European
Community countries;
• 13 per cent from the United States;
• 5 per cent from the Middle East;
and
• 5 per cent from South Africa.
Nationality
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
• British citizenship for people closely
connected with Britain, the Channel
Islands, and the Isle of Man;
• British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the
dependencies; and
• British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies who did not acquire either of
the other citizenships when the 1981 Act
came into force.
British citizenship is acquired
automatically at birth by a child born in
Britain if his or her father or mother is a
British citizen or is settled in Britain. A child
adopted in Britain by a British citizen is a
British citizen. A child born abroad to a
British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or
registered in Britain is a British citizen by
descent. The Act safeguards the citizenship
of a child born abroad to a British citizen in
Crown service, certain related services, or in
service under a European Community
institution.
British citizenship may also be acquired:
• by registration of certain children,
including those born in Britain who do
not automatically acquire such
citizenship at birth or who have been
born abroad to a parent who is a citizen
by descent;
• by British Dependent Territories
citizens, British Overseas citizens, British
subjects under the Act (three very
limited categories), and British National
(Overseas) and British protected persons
after five years’ residence in Britain
(except for people from Gibraltar, who
may be registered without residence);
and
• by naturalisation for Commonwealth
citizens, citizens of the Irish Republic,
and foreign nationals aged 18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion: it requires five years’ residence,
good character, sound mind, the intention to
have one’s home in Britain thereafter and
sufficient knowledge of English, Welsh or
Scottish Gaelic, except for the spouse of a
British citizen, who needs only three years’
residence and no language or future
intentions qualification.
Legislation passed in 1983 conferred
19
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British citizenship on those Falkland
Islanders who did not acquire it under the
1981 Act. Special arrangements covering the
status of British Dependent Territories
citizens connected with Hong Kong when
the territory returns to the People’s Republic
of China in 1997 are made by the Hong
Kong (British Nationality) Order 1986.
Under this, such citizens are entitled, before
1997, to acquire a status known as British
National (Overseas) and to hold a passport in
that status. In addition, the British
Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1990 made
provision for the registration as British
citizens before 30 June 1997 of up to 50,000
persons who are able to meet certain criteria
and who are recommended by the Governor.
In 1990, 55,693 people acquired
citizenship by naturalisation or registration in
Britain.
Immigration
Immigration into Britain is controlled under
the Immigration Rules made in accordance
with legislation passed in the 1970s and 1980s.
British citizens under the British
Nationality Act 1981 and those
Commonwealth citizens who had the right of
abode before 1 January 1983 (when the 1981
Act came into force) maintain the right of
abode and are not subject to immigration
control. Those who do not have this right
require permission to enter and remain in
Britain; this is given in accordance with the
Immigration Rules, which are subject to the
scrutiny of Parliament and which set out the
requirements to be met by those seeking entry.
The nationals of specified countries
require prior entry clearance before they can
enter Britain. Other nationals subject to
immigration control require entry clearance
when coming to work or to settle in Britain.
Visas and other entry clearances are normally
obtained from the nearest British diplomatic
post in a person’s home country.
In accordance with Britain’s obligations
under the Treaty of Rome, European
Community nationals do not require entry
clearances, nor are they subject to
restrictions on their freedom to take or seek
work in Britain. Britain similarly respects its
obligations under the United Nations
Convention and Protocol relating to the
Status of Refugees. These include granting
refugees the right of access to courts and the
right to work, to education, to social security
and to freedom of religion.
In 1990, 9-2 million foreign and
Commonwealth nationals were admitted to
Britain (excluding European Community
nationals) and 52,400 persons were accepted
for settlement.
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
PATTERN
The average size of households in Great
Britain has fallen from over four people in
1911 to 3 09 in 1961 and 2-46 in 1990. The
fall reflects a greater number of people living
on their own (11 per cent), or in one-parent
families, the increasing number of old people
(more of whom are living alone) and the
preference for smaller families.
Housing, Transport and the
Environment
A large proportion of households, 66 per
cent, own or are buying their own homes.
Owner-occupation is higher among married
couples than for single, divorced or widowed
household heads. The number of owner-
occupied dwellings rose from over 4 million
in 1951 to over 15 million in 1990. Four-
fifths of British households live in houses
rather than flats.
An important influence on the planning of
housing and services has been the growth of
car ownership; in 1990, 67 per cent of
households had the use of at least one car or
van, including 23 per cent with the use of
two or more. Greater access to motorised
transport and the construction of a network
of modern trunk roads and motorways have
resulted in a considerable increase in
personal mobility and changed leisure
patterns. Most detached or semi-detached
houses in new suburban estates have garages,
and out-of-town shopping centres, often
including large supermarkets and do-it-
yourself stores, are usually planned with the
motorist in mind.

The growth in car ownership has brought
great benefits but also a number of problems,
notably, in many towns and cities, increased
congestion, noise and air pollution arising
from motor vehicle emissions. Cars, taxis and
motor cycles accounted for 86 per cent of all
passenger transport in Great Britain in 1989,
compared with 55 per cent in 1961. To
relieve road congestion, the Government
regards carefully targeted improvements to
the road system as essential. With the aim of
shifting traffic from road to rail, however, it
put forward in 1991 measures to help
railways achieve a greater share of traffic.
Living Standards
Economic Growth
Marked improvements in the standard of
living have taken place during the twentieth
century. According to a United Nations
report on human development published in
1991, Britain ranked eleventh out of 160
countries on a human development index
that combines life expectancy, education
levels and basic purchasing power. Britain
has also performed well economically.
Although gross domestic product (GDP) per
head fell in the early 1980s, Britain then
experienced an economic recovery and had
eight successive years of sustained growth at
an annual average rate of over 3 per cent.
Growth since 1980 has been among the
highest in the European Community. By the
late 1980s, however, Britain’s growth rate
had slowed, in common with that of other
major industrialised countries. By September
1991 there were indications that the recession
in Britain was close to its trough.
Eating and Drinking Habits
The general level of nutrition remains high.
Over the last 25 years there have been
substantial rises in the consumption of
21
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
poultry, instant coffee and processed
vegetables and fruit, while home
consumption per person of mutton and lamb,
beef and veal, bread, potatoes, eggs, milk,
butter, sugar, tea and some other foods has
fallen. However, another feature has been an
increase in the number of meals eaten away
from home, either at work or in restaurants,
and a growth in the consumption of food
from ‘take-away’ and ‘fast-food’ shops. In
addition, the proportion of convenience foods
eaten has grown as women increasingly
work outside the home and have less time to
prepare meals, and as the variety of prepared
foods and ‘cook-chill’ meals has risen.
During the 1980s the amounts of
nutrients such as energy, fat and calcium in
household supplies of food declined, and
there was a small decline in iron and vitamin
C. But average mineral and nutrient intakes
were above daily amounts recommended by
the Department of Health. There was a
steady fall in fat intakes, combined with a
decline in carbohydrate consumption. Such
factors as a 17 per cent increase in low fat
milk consumption, a 7 per cent fall in sugar
sales, increased expenditure on all major
vegetable groups, and a rise in consumption
of fresh fruit and fruit juice between 1988
and 1989 reinforce evidence that health
considerations influence food consumption.
The Government encourages the widest
availability of wholesome food, while giving
high priority to consumer safety.
The Food Safety Act 1990 covers all of
Great Britain. It
• strengthens the enforcement of existing
law;
• gives powers for immediate closure of
food premises when the public health is
at risk;
• extends controls throughout the food
chain;
• enables detailed legislation to be
introduced to keep pace with new
technology; and
• increases the penalties for food safety
offences.
There was little change in alcohol
consumption between 1979 and 1989. Beer,
lager (now estimated to account for over half
of beer sales) and cider are the most popular
drinks among male drinkers. Women’s alcohol
consumption is mostly made up from beer,
lager and cider (31 per cent), wine (29 per
cent) and spirits and liqueurs (28 per cent).
Consumption of light (table) wine has grown
considerably, although there has been little
change in the consumption of higher strength
wines such as sherry and port. The pattern of
spirits consumption has also been changing,
with a decline in whisky and gin, and higher
consumption of some other spirits.
Public Houses
A high proportion of beer is drunk in public
houses (‘pubs’), a traditional social centre for
many people, and in clubs. T he Licensing
Act 1988 relaxed restrictions on the opening
hours of public houses. There are signs that
they are becoming more popular with
families: more meals are being served and
the consumption of non-alcoholic drinks is
increasing. Sales of more non-alcoholic and
low-alcohol drinks are promoted, helped by
a favourable excise duty structure and
rigorous application of drink-driving laws.
The Workforce and Earnings
The proportion of the resident population
in the workforce, 63 per cent in 1988, is
the second highest in the European
Community. Some 89 per cent of men of
working age, 70 per cent of married women
and 74 per cent of non-married women
were economically active in 1989. The
educational standards of adults have risen,
with 14 per cent of men and 7 per cent of
women aged 25—29 in Great Britain holding
a degree or equivalent qualification in 1989,
compared with 10 per cent and 3 per cent
respectively of those aged 50—59. The
average size of classes has fallen in recent
years, in both primary and secondary
schools.
Earnings from employment are the main
source of income for most people; in 1989
wages and salaries accounted for 59 per cent
of household income. The distribution of
pre-tax income has remained relatively stable
over a long period, the lower 50 per cent of
22
LAND AND PEOPLE
income earners accounting for some 22 to 24
per cent of pre-tax income since 1949. The
combined effect of the tax system and the
receipt of benefits is to redistribute incomes
on a more equal basis.
Distribution of Wealth
Wealth is less evenly distributed, with the
richest 1 per cent of the population aged 18
or over owning 17 per cent of marketable
wealth in 1988, and the richest 10 per cent
having 53 per cent. The inclusion of ‘non-
marketable’ rights in occupational and state
pension schemes reduces these shares
substantially, to 10 and 36 per cent
respectively. Since the mid-1970s there has
been little change in the distribution of
marketable wealth or in that of marketable
wealth plus occupational and state pension
rights. The proportion of net wealth held in
shares declined up to 1984, but has since
increased. The Government’s privatisation
programme has had a major effect on the
pattern of share ownership. In 1990 nearly
one-quarter of the adult population in Great
Britain owned shares, compared with one in
13 people in 1979.
Women
The economic and domestic lives of women
have been transformed in the twentieth
century. These changes are due partly to the
removal of almost all sex discrimination in
political and legal rights. At the heart of
women’s changed role has been the rise in
the number of women, especially married
women, at work. With later marriages and
the availability of effective contraception
there has been a decline in family size.
Women are involved in childbearing for a
shorter time and this, together with
technological advances which have made
housework less onerous and time-consuming,
has made it possible for women with
children to combine child-rearing with paid
employment. The growth of part-time and
flexible working patterns, and training and
retraining schemes, allows more women to
take advantage of employment opportunities.
Women make up more than two-fifths of
the workforce. The proportion of married
women working outside the home has
increased to two-thirds of those between the
ages of 16 and 59, a quarter of the total
labour force, compared with only 4 per cent
in 1921. Married women are most likely to
be in full-time work if they are aged 16 to 29
with no children. Over two-fifths of all
women in employment work part-time,
representing almost nine-tenths of all part-
time workers.
By the mid-1990s the numbers of young
people entering the labour market will have
declined substantially and it is expected that
the resulting shortfall in the labour force will
be met to a considerable extent by the
recruitment of more married women.
There is still a significant difference
between men’s and women’s earnings, but
the equal pay legislation which came into
force in 1975 has helped to narrow the gap;
in 1990 women’s average hourly earnings
were only 77 per cent of men’s, despite a
progressive rise in women’s hourly rates over
the last three years. Women’s wages remain
relatively low because they tend to work in
the lower-paid sectors of the economy and
work fewer hours than men (the latter
because of their domestic commitments). A
major reform in the taxation of women came
into effect in 1990, when their earnings
began to be taxed separately rather than
being treated as part of their husbands’
income for tax purposes.
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986
make discrimination between men and
women unlawful in employment, education,
training and the provision of housing, goods,
facilities and services. Discriminatory job
recruitment advertisements are also unlawful.
In most cases complaints of discrimination
are dealt with by industrial tribunals since
they concern employment; others are taken
before county courts in England and Wales
or the Sheriff Court in Scotland. Under the
Equal Pay Act 1970, as amended in 1984,
women in Great Britain are entitled to equal
pay with men when doing work that is the
same or broadly similar, or work which is of
23
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
equal value. Parallel legislation on sex
discrimination and equal pay is in operation
in Northern Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission,
set up in 1975 (1976 in Northern Ireland
under separate laws), has powers to enforce
the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts.
Its statutory duties are to work towards
eliminating sex discrimination and to
promote equality of opportunity. The
Commission advises people of their rights
under the Acts and may give financial or
other assistance to help individuals conduct a
case before a court or tribunal. It is
empowered to carry out investigations and
issue notices requiring discriminatory
practices to stop. The Commission also keeps
legislation under review and submits
proposals for amending it to the
Government.
Ethnic and National Minorities
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in Britain, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities.
The Irish have long formed a large
section of the population. Jewish refugees
who came to Britain towards the end of the
nineteenth century and in the 1930s were
followed by other European refugees after
1945. Substantial immigration from the
Caribbean and the South Asian sub¬
continent dates principally from the 1950s
and 1960s. There are also sizeable groups
from the United States and Canada, as well
as Australians, Chinese, Greek and Turkish
Cypriots, Italians and Spaniards. More
recently people from Latin America, Indo-
China and Sri Lanka have sought refuge in
Britain.
In 1987-89, according to the results of a
sample survey, the ethnic minority
population of Great Britain numbered about
2-6 million (some 4 8 per cent of the total
population), of whom 46 per cent were born
in Britain. Some 45 per cent of the ethnic
minority population was of Indian, Pakistani
or Bangladeshi origin; about one-fifth was of
Afro-Caribbean ethnic origin; and one in five
was of mixed ethnic origin.
The sample survey also indicated that the
proportion of men of working age in Great
Britain who were economically active was
higher among the white population and the
Afro-Caribbean group than among those
from other ethnic groups. Among women the
variation was greater: 73 per cent of those
from the Afro-Caribbean ethnic group were
economically active, compared with 69 per
cent in the white group, 57 per cent in the
Indian group and only 20 per cent in the
Pakistani/Bangladeshi group.
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Although many members of the black and
Asian communities are concentrated in the
inner cities, where there are problems of
deprivation and social stress, progress has
been made over the last 20 years in tackling
racial disadvantage in Britain.
Many individuals have achieved
distinction in their careers and in public life
and the proportion of ethnic minority
members occupying professional and
managerial positions is increasing. In law, for
example, an estimated 6 per cent of
practising barristers are of ethnic minority
origin. There are at present four ethnic
minority Members of Parliament, and the
number of ethnic minority councillors in
local government is growing. There has also
been an expansion of commercial enterprise,
and numerous self-help projects in ethnic
minority communities have been established.
Black competitors have represented Britain
in a range of sporting activities, and ethnic
minority talents in the arts and in
entertainment have increasingly been
recognised.
The principal means of combating
disadvantage is through the economic,
environmental, educational and health
programmes of central government and local
authorities. There are also special allocations,
mainly through Home Office grants and the
Urban Programme, which channel extra
resources into projects of specific benefit to
ethnic minorities. These include, for
example, the provision of specialist teachers
for children needing English language
tuition, business support services and
24
LAND AND PEOPLE
measures to revive local economies and
improve the inner city environment. Cultural
and recreational schemes and the health and
personal social services also take account of
the particular needs of ethnic minorities.
The Government is encouraging the
development of black businesses in inner
city areas through the Ethnic Minority
Business Initiative. It is also promoting
equal opportunities for ethnic minorities
through training programmes, including
greater provision for unemployed people who
need training in English as a second
language.
Ethnic Minorities and the Police
In recognition of the tensions that can arise
between the police and ethnic minorities,
there is statutory consultation between the
police and the community. In addition,
liaison work is undertaken in schools.
Police training in race relations has
received particular attention. A specialist
unit, launched in 1989 and run by an
independent company, provides police forces
with practical help and support in
community and race relations training.
Campaigns are run by the police to
encourage the recruitment of officers from
the ethnic minority communities and racially
discriminatory behaviour by officers has been
made an offence under the police discipline
code.
Race Relations Act 1976
Equal opportunities policies are backed up
by legislation against racial discrimination.
The Race Relations Act 1976, which
strengthened previous legislation passed in
the 1960s, makes discrimination unlawful on
grounds of colour, race, nationality or ethnic
or national origin in the provision of goods,
facilities and services, in employment, in
housing and in advertising. The 1976 Act
also gave complainants direct access to civil
courts and, in the case of employment
complaints, to industrial tribunals.
It is a criminal offence to incite racial
hatred under the provisions of the Public
Order Act 1986.
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality was
established by the 1976 Act. It has power
to investigate unlawful discriminatory
practices and to issue non-discrimination
notices, requiring such practices to cease. It
has an important educational role and has
issued codes of practice in employment,
education and rented housing. It also
provides the main advice to the general
public about the Race Relations Act and
has discretion to assist individuals with
their complaints about racial
discrimination. In 1990 the Commission
registered almost 14,000 applications for
assistance and handled successfully 85
litigation cases. It can also undertake or
fund research.
The Commission supports the work of
over 80 race equality councils, which are
autonomous voluntary bodies set up in
most areas with a significant ethnic
minority population to promote equality of
opportunity and good relations at the local
level. It helps pay the salaries of the race
equality officers employed by the councils,
most of whom also receive funds from
their local government authorities, and
gives grants to ethnic minority self-help
groups and to other projects run by
or for the benefit of the minority
communities.
Leisure Trends
Agreed hours of full-time work are usually
from 35 to 40 hours a week, although many
people actually work longer because of
voluntary overtime.
On average between 15 and 16 per cent
of total household expenditure went on
leisure in 1989. The most common leisure
activities are home-based, or social, such as
visiting relatives or friends. Television
viewing is by far the most popular leisure
pastime, and nearly all households have a
television set, with 93 per cent in 1990
having a colour set. Average viewing time
for the population aged four and over is
nearly 25 hours a week. In 1990 more than
half of households had at least one video
25
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
recorder; 38 million pre-recorded
videotapes were bought by the general
public. The proportion of households with
videos rose from 60 per cent to 64 per
cent. Over 40 million compact discs (CDs)
were sold in 1989. For the first time, sales
of CDs exceeded sales of long-play albums.
In 1989 people made on average F5 visits
to the cinema (compared with 23 in 1959).
Other popular pursuits include:
listening to radio, reading, do-it-yourself
home improvements, gardening and going
out for a meal or for a drink. About half of
households have a pet, the most common
being dogs and cats, of which there are
thought to be roughly 7 million of each in
Britain.
Many people give up free time to work
for voluntary organisations, of which there
are over 250,000 in England and Wales. It
is estimated that about one-quarter of the
population is involved in some way in
voluntary work in Britain. Fund-raising is
the most frequently mentioned activity.
Voluntary environmental organisations, for
example, have experienced consistent
growth since 1971.
Holidays
In 1989, 91 per cent of full-time manual
employees were entitled to more than four
weeks paid holiday; in 1961, 97 per cent
were entitled to only two weeks. A
significant proportion of all employees have
at least 24 days leave. In 1990, 59 per cent of
the adult population took at least one long
holiday of four or more nights away from
home. The number of long holidays taken by
British residents was 52-5 million in 1990
(compared with 48 million in 1978), of which
32-5 million were taken in Britain. The most
frequented free attraction in 1990 was
Blackpool Pleasure Beach (Lancashire). The
most popular destinations for summer
holidays are the West Country, Scotland
and Wales. British residents also took 20-5
million holidays overseas in 1990, of
which 56 per cent involved ‘package’
arrangements. The most popular destinations
were Spain, France and Greece, and 77 per
cent of all holidays abroad were taken in
Europe. The proportion of adults taking
two or more holidays a year was 15 per
cent in 1990.

Government
The British constitution, unlike that of most
other countries, is not set out in any single
document. Instead it is made up of statute
law, common law and conventions. It can be
altered by Act of Parliament, or by general
agreement to alter a convention. The
constitution is thus readily adaptable to
changing political conditions.
The organs of government overlap but
can be clearly distinguished. Parliament is
the legislature and the supreme authority.
The executive consists of:
• the Government—the Cabinet and other
ministers responsible for national policies;
• government departments, responsible for
national administration;
• local authorities, responsible for many
local services; and
• public corporations, responsible for
operating particular nationalised
industries or other bodies, subject to
ministerial control.
The judiciary determines common law and
interprets statutes, and is independent of
both legislature and executive.
The Monarchy
The British people look to the Queen not
only as their head of State, but also as the
symbol of national unity. The monarchy is
the most ancient secular institution in
Britain. During the last thousand years its
continuity has only once been broken, by the
establishment of a republic which lasted from
1649 to 1660. Despite interruptions in the
direct line of succession, the hereditary
principle upon which it was founded has
always been preserved.
The form of the royal title varies in the
other Commonwealth countries of which the
Queen is head of State, l Other member
states are republics or have their own
monarchies.
The royal title in Britain is: ‘Elizabeth
the Second, by the Grace of God of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and of Her other
Realms and Territories Queen, Head of
the Commonwealth, Defender of the
Faith’.
The seat of the monarchy is in Great
Britain. In the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man the Queen is represented by a
Lieutenant-Governor. In the other member
nations of the Commonwealth of which the
Queen is head of State, her representative is
the Governor-General, appointed by her on
the advice of the ministers of the country
concerned and completely independent of the
British Government.
In British dependencies the Queen is
usually represented by governors, who are
responsible to the British Government for
the administration of the countries
concerned.
Succession, Accession and Coronation
The title to the Crown is derived both from
statute and from common law rules of
descent. Only Protestant descendants of a
granddaughter of James I of England and VI
of Scotland (Princess Sophia, the Electress of
Hanover) are eligible to succeed. The order
of succession can be altered only by common
consent of the countries of the Commonwealth.
1 The other Commonwealth countries of which the Queen is
head of State are: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas,
Barbados, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, Mauritius, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Christopher and Nevis,
Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands
and Tuvalu.

GOVERNMENT
Sons of the Sovereign have precedence
over daughters in succeeding to the throne.
When a daughter succeeds, she becomes
Queen Regnant, and has the same powers as
a king. The consort of a king takes her
husband’s rank and style, becoming Queen.
The constitution does not give any special
rank or privileges to the husband of a Queen
Regnant, although in practice he fills an
important role in the life of the nation, as
does the Duke of Edinburgh.
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as
soon as his or her predecessor dies: there is
no interregnum. He or she is at once
proclaimed at an Accession Council, to
which all members of the Privy Council are
summoned. The Lords Spiritual and
Temporal (see p 31), the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen and other leading citizens of the
City of London are also invited.
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession after a convenient interval. The
ceremony has remained essentially the same
for over a thousand years, even if details
have often been changed to suit the customs
of the time. It takes place at Westminster
Abbey in London, in the presence of
representatives of the Houses of Parliament
and of all the great public organisations in
Britain. The Prime Ministers and leading
members of the other Commonwealth
nations and representatives of other countries
also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
The Queen personifies the State. In law, she
is head of the executive, an integral part of
the legislature, head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces
of the Crown and the ‘supreme governor’ of
the established Church of England. As a
result of a long process of evolution, during
which the monarchy’s absolute power has
gradually declined, the Queen acts on the
advice of her ministers. Britain is governed
by Her Majesty’s Government in the name
of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a
trend during the past hundred years towards
giving powers directly to ministers, the
Queen still takes part in some important acts
of government. These include summoning,
proroguing (discontinuing until the next
session without dissolution) and dissolving
Parliament; and giving Royal Assent to Bills
passed by Parliament. The Queen also
formally appoints many important office
holders, including government ministers,
judges, officers in the armed forces,
governors, diplomats, bishops and some
other senior clergy of the Church of
England. She is also involved in conferring
peerages, knighthoods and other honours;2
and pardoning people convicted of crimes.
An important function is appointing the
Prime Minister: by convention the Queen
invites the leader of the political party which
commands a majority in the House of
Commons to form a government. In
international affairs the Queen, as head of
State, has the power to declare war and make
peace, to recognise foreign states and
governments, to conclude treaties and to
annex or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as appointing
the Prime Minister), acts involving the use
of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are nowadays
performed by government ministers. The
ministers are responsible to Parliament and
can be questioned about particular policies.
Parliamentary authority is not required for
the exercise of these prerogative powers,
although Parliament has the power to restrict
or abolish such rights.
The Queen continues to play an
important role in the working of government.
She holds meetings of the Privy Council,
gives audiences to her ministers and other
officials in Britain and overseas, receives
accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs state papers. She must
be consulted on every aspect of national life,
and she must show complete impartiality.
The significance attached to these royal
functions is such that provision has been
made to appoint a regent to perform them
should the Queen be totally incapacitated.
The regent would be the Queen’s eldest son,
the Prince of Wales, then those, in order of
2 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her
personally—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle,
the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.
29
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
succession to the throne, who are of age. In
the event of the Queen’s partial incapacity or
absence abroad, the Queen may delegate
certain royal functions to the Counsellors of
State (the Duke of Edinburgh, the four
adults next in line of succession, and the
Queen Mother). However, Counsellors of
State may not, for instance, dissolve
Parliament (except on the Queen’s
instructions), nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Royal Visits
Ceremonial has always been associated with
the British monarchy, and, in spite of
changes in the outlook of both the Sovereign
and the people, many traditional ceremonies
continue to take place. Royal marriages and
royal funerals are marked by public
ceremony, and the Sovereign’s birthday is
officially celebrated in June by Trooping the
Colour on Horse Guards Parade. State
banquets take place when a foreign monarch
or head of State visits Britain; investitures
are held at Buckingham Palace and the
Palace of Holyroodhouse in Scotland to
bestow honours; and royal processions add
significance to such occasions as the state
opening of Parliament.
Each year the Queen and other members
of the royal family visit many parts of
Britain. Their presence at scientific, artistic
and industrial events of national and local
importance attracts nationwide interest and
publicity. They are also closely involved in
the work of many charities. The Queen pays
state visits to foreign governments,
accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh. She
also undertakes lengthy tours in the other
countries of the Commonwealth. Other
members of the royal family pay official
visits overseas, occasionally representing the
Queen, or often in connection with an
organisation or a cause with which they are
associated.
Royal Income and Expenditure
The expenditure incurred by the Queen in
carrying out her public duties is financed
from the Civil List and from government
departments (which meet the cost of, for
example, the Royal Yacht and the Queen s
Flight). All such expenditure is approved by
Parliament. In January 1991 Civil List
payments were fixed at £7 9 million a year
for ten years. About three-quarters of the
Queen’s Civil List provision is required to
meet the cost of staff. These deal, among
other things, with state papers and
correspondence, the organisation of state
occasions, visits and other public
engagements undertaken by the Queen in
Britain and overseas. The Queen’s private
expenditure as Sovereign is met from the
Privy Purse, which is financed mainly from
the revenue of the Duchy of Lancaster,^ her
expenditure as a private individual is met
from her own personal resources.
Under the Civil List Acts, other members
of the royal family also receive parliamentary
annual allowances to enable them to carry
out their public duties. The Prince of Wales,
however, receives no such allowance, since as
Duke of Cornwall he is entitled to the
income of the estate of the Duchy of
Cornwall. (He voluntarily surrenders a
quarter of this revenue to the Government.)
The Queen pays the Government each year a
sum equivalent to that provided by
Parliament for certain members of the royal
family.
Parliament
Parliament is the supreme legislative
authority. Its three elements, the Queen, the
House of Lords and the elected House of
Commons, are constituted on different
principles. They meet together only on
occasions of symbolic significance such as the
state opening of Parliament, when the
Commons are summoned by the Queen to
the House of Lords. The agreement of all
three elements is normally required for
legislation.
Parliament can legislate for Britain as a
whole, or for any part of the country. It can
also legislate for the C hannel Islands and the
Isle of Man, which are Crown dependencies
3 The Duchy of l.ancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399,
has always been enjoyed by the reigning Sovereign; it is kept
quite apart from his or her other possessions and is separately
administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy.
30
GOVERNMENT
and not part of Britain. They have
subordinate legislatures which make laws on
island affairs.4
As there are no legal restraints imposed
by a written constitution, Parliament may
legislate as it pleases. It can make or change
any law; and can overturn established
conventions or turn them into law. It can
even prolong its own life beyond the normal
period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert its supremacy in this way. Its members
bear in mind the common law and normally
act in accordance with precedent. The
validity of an Act of Parliament, once passed,
cannot be disputed in the law courts, but no
Parliament would be likely to pass an Act
which it knew would receive no public
support. The House of Commons is directly
responsible to the electorate, and in this
century the House of Lords has recognised
the priority of the elected chamber. The
system of party government helps to ensure
that Parliament legislates with its
responsibility to the electorate in mind.
As a member of the European
Community, Britain recognises the various
types of Community legislation and wider
policies. It sends 81 elected members to the
European Parliament.
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
• to pass laws;
• to provide, by voting taxation, the means
of carrying on the work of government;
• to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
• to debate the major political issues of the
day.
In carrying out these functions Parliament
helps to bring the relevant facts and issues
before the electorate. By custom, Parliament
4 The legislatures of the Channel Islands (the States of Jersey
and the States of Guernsey) and the Isle of Man (the Tynwald
Court) consist of the Queen, the Privy Council and the local
assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the Privy
Council member primarily concerned with island affa'rs, to
consider each legislative measure before it is submitted to the
Queen in Council.
is also informed before all important
international treaties and agreements are
ratified. The making of treaties is, however,
a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of
the Government and is not subject to
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of
five years, but in practice general elections
are usually held before the end of this term.
The maximum life has been prolonged by
legislation in rare circumstances such as the
two world wars. Parliament is dissolved and
writs for a general election are ordered by
the Queen on the advice of the Prime
Minister.
The life of a Parliament is divided into
sessions. Each usually lasts for one year—
normally beginning and ending in October or
November. There are ‘adjournments’ at
night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the late (English) Spring Bank Holiday, and
during a long summer recess starting in late
July or early August. The average number of
‘sitting’ days in a session is about 168 in the
House of Commons and about 150 in the
House of Lords. At the start of each session
the Queen’s speech to Parliament outlines
the Government’s policies and proposed
legislative programme. Each session is ended
by prorogation. Parliament then ‘stands
prorogued’ for about a week until the new
session opens. Prorogation brings to an end
nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, Bills which have not been passed
by the end of the session are lost.
The House of Lords
f he House of Lords consists of the Lords
Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The
Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of
Canterbury and York, the Bishops of
London, Durham and Winchester, and the
21 next most senior diocesan bishops of the
Church of England. The Lords Temporal
consist of:
• all hereditary peers and peeresses of
England, Scotland, Great Britain and the
United Kingdom;
31
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• life peers created to assist the House in
its judicial duties (Lords of Appeal or
‘law lords’);5 and
• all other life peers.
Hereditary peerages carry a right to sit in
the House (with certain exceptions),
provided holders establish their claim and are
aged 21 years or over. However, anyone
succeeding to a peerage may, within 12
months of succession, disclaim that peerage
for his or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose
their right to sit in the House but gain the
right to vote and stand as candidates at
parliamentary elections.
Peerages, both hereditary and life, are
created by the Sovereign on the advice of the
Prime Minister. They are usually granted in
recognition of service in politics or other
walks of life or because one of the political
parties wishes to have the recipient in the
House of Lords. The House also provides a
place in Parliament for people who offer
useful advice, but do not wish to be involved
in party politics.
In mid-1991 there were 1,191 members of
the House of Lords, including the two
archbishops and 24 bishops. The Lords
Temporal consisted of 762 hereditary peers
who had succeeded to their titles, 20
hereditary peers who have had their titles
conferred on them (including the Prince of
Wales), and 383 life peers, of whom 18 were
‘law lords’. Of the total, 84 peers did not
receive a writ of summons and some 137
peers were on leave of absence from the
House.6 Holders of Irish peerages are not
entitled to membership of the House of
Lords, but some peers of Ireland sit in the
House of Lords as holders of English,
Scottish, Great Britain or United Kingdom
peerages.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the
House of Lords attend the sittings. Peers
who attend the House (the average daily
attendance is some 320) receive no salary for

(for which there are maximum daily rates)
and certain travelling expenses.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who takes his place on the
woolsack^ as ex-officio Speaker of the
House. In his absence his place is taken by a
deputy speaker, a deputy chairman or, if
neither is present, by a speaker chosen by
the Lords present. The first of the deputy
speakers is the Chairman of Committees,
who is appointed at the beginning of each
session and normally chairs all committees.
The Chairman and the Principal Deputy
Chairman of Committees are Lords, but
receive salaries as officers of the House.
The permanent officers of the House
include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is
responsible for the records of proceedings
and for promulgating Acts of Parliament. He
is the accounting officer for money voted to
the House, and is in charge of the
administrative staff of the House, known as
the Parliament Office. The Gentleman Usher
of the Black Rod, who is also Serjeant-at-
Arms in attendance upon the Lord
Chancellor, is responsible for security,
accommodation and services in the House of
Lords’ part of the Palace of Westminster.
The Yeoman Usher is Deputy Serjeant-at-
Arms and assists Black Rod in his duties.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons is elected by
universal adult suffrage and consists of 650
Members of Parliament (MPs). At present
there are 44 women, one Asian and three
black MPs. Of the 650 seats, 523 are for
England, 38 for Wales, 72 for Scotland, and
17 for Northern Ireland. (At the next general
election the number of seats will rise to 651,
with the creation of an additional seat for
Milton Keynes in England.)
v The woolsack is a seat in the form of a large cushion stuffed
with wool from several Commonwealth countries; it is a
tradition dating from the medieval period, when wool was the
chief source of the country’s wealth.
32
GOVERNMENT
General elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Queen. When an MP dies
or resigns,8 or is given a peerage, a by-
election takes place. Members are paid an
annual salary of £28,970 (from January 1991)
and an office costs allowance of up to
£27,166. There are also a number of other
allowances, including travel allowances, a
supplement for London members and, for
provincial members, subsistence allowances
and allowances for second homes. (For
ministers’ salaries see p 44.)
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons
is the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside
over the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two
deputy chairmen, who act as Deputy
Speakers. They are elected by the House on
the nomination of the Government but are
drawn from the Opposition as well as the
government party. They, like the Speaker,
neither speak nor vote other than in their
official capacity. Overall responsibility for the
administration of the House rests with the
House of Commons Commission, a statutory
body chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons,
who is the principal adviser to the Speaker
on its privileges and procedures. The Clerk’s
departmental responsibilities relate to the
conduct of the business of the House and its
committees. The Clerk is also accounting
officer for the House. The Serjeant-at-Arms,
who waits upon the Speaker, carries out
certain orders of the House. He is also the
official housekeeper of the Commons’ part of
the building, and is responsible for security.
Other officers serve the House in the
Library, the Department of the Official
Report {Hansard), the Administration
Department and the Refreshment
Department.
8 An MP who wishes to resign from the House can only do so
by applying for an office under the Crown as Crown Steward or
Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, or Steward of the Manor of
N'orthstead. These are ancient offices which disqualify the
holder from membership of the House but which carry no salary
and have no responsibilities.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes Britain is divided into
constituencies, each of which returns one
member to the House of Commons. To
ensure fair representation four permanent
Parliamentary Boundary Commissions, one
each for England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland, review the constituencies
periodically. They recommend any
adjustment of seats that may seem necessary
in the light of population movements or
other changes. Elections are by secret ballot.
Who May Vote
British citizens, together with citizens of
other Commonwealth countries and citizens
of the Irish Republic resident in Britain, may
vote provided they are aged 18 or over,
included in the annual register of electors for
the constituency and not subject to any
disqualification. People not entitled to vote
include members of the House of Lords,
patients detained under mental health
legislation, sentenced prisoners and people
convicted within the previous five years of
corrupt or illegal election practices. Members
of the armed forces and their spouses,
Crown servants and staff of the British
Council employed overseas (together with
their wives or husbands if accompanying
them) may be registered for an address in
the constituency where they would live but
for their service. The Representation of the
People Act 1989 extended the right to vote
for British citizens living abroad by
increasing from 5 to 20 years the period
during which they may apply to be
registered to vote.
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. People entitled to
an absent vote may vote by post or by proxy,
although postal ballot papers cannot be sent
to addresses outside Britain. Overseas
electors and electors who are physically
incapacitated or unable to vote in person
because of the nature of their work may vote
either by post (unless they are abroad at the
33
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
time of the election) or by proxy for an
indefinite period. Under the 1989 Act,
electors whose circumstances on polling day
are such that they cannot reasonably be
expected to vote in person at their local
polling station—for example, electors away
on holiday—may apply for an absent vote at
a particular election.
Voting is not compulsory; 74 6 per cent of
a total electorate of 43 6 million people voted
in the general election in June 1987. The
simple majority system of voting is used.
Candidates are elected if they have more
votes than any of the other candidates
(although not necessarily an absolute
majority over all other candidates).
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand for
election as MPs provided they are aged 21 or
over and are not disqualified. Those
disqualified include undischarged bankrupts,
people sentenced to more than one year’s
imprisonment; clergy of the Church of
England, Church of Scotland, Church of
Ireland and Roman Catholic Church, peers,
and holders of certain offices listed in the
House of Commons Disqualification Act
1975. The latter include holders of judicial
office, civil servants, some local government
officers, members of the regular armed
forces, police officers, some members of
public corporations and government
commissions, and British members of the
legislature of any country outside the
Commonwealth. A candidate’s nomination
for election must be proposed and seconded
by two electors registered as voters in the
constituency and signed by eight other
electors. Candidates do not have to have
party backing. A candidate must also deposit
£500, which is returned if he or she receives
5 per cent or more of the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may
spend on a general election campaign is
£4,144, plus 3-5 pence for each elector in a
borough constituency or 4 7 pence for each
elector in a county constituency. Higher
limits have been set for by-elections in order
to reflect the fact that they are often
regarded as tests of national opinion in the
period between general elections. The
maximum sum is £16,577, plus 141 pence
for each elector in borough seats and 18-6
pence for each elector in county seats. A
candidate may post an election address to
each elector in the constituency, free of
charge. All election expenses, apart from the
candidate’s personal expenses, are subject to
the statutory limit.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the eighteenth century,
is an essential element in the working of the
constitution.
The present system depends upon the
existence of organised political parties, each
of which presents its policies to the
electorate for approval. The parties are not
registered or formally recognised in law, but
in practice most candidates in elections, and
almost all winning candidates, belong to one
of the main parties.
For the last 150 years a predominantly
two-party system has existed.
Since 1945 either the Conservative Party,
the origins of which go back to the
eighteenth century, or the Labour Party,
which emerged in the last decade of the
nineteenth century, has held power. A new
party—the Liberal Democrats (formally
known as the Social and Liberal
Democrats)—was formed in 1988 when the
Liberal Party (which could trace its origins
to the eighteenth century) merged with the
Social Democratic Party (formed in 1981).
Other parties include two nationalist parties,
Plaid Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and
the Scottish National Party (founded in
1934). In Northern Ireland there are a
number of parties. They include the Ulster
Unionist Party, which was formed in the
early part of this century; the Democratic
Unionist Party, founded in 1971 by a group
which broke away from the Ulster Unionists,
and the Social Democratic and Labour Party,
founded in 1970.
34
GOVERNMENT
Since 1945 seven general elections have
been won by the Conservative Party and six
by the Labour Party; the great majority of
members of the House of Commons have
belonged to one of these two parties. The
percentages of votes cast for the main
political parties in the last general election of
June 1987 and the resulting distribution of
seats in the House of Commons are shown in
Table 2.1.
The party which wins most seats
(although not necessarily the most votes) at a
general election, or which has the support of
a majority of members in the House of
Commons, usually forms the Government.
By tradition, the leader of the majority party
is asked by the Sovereign to form a
government. About 100 of its members in
the House of Commons and the House of
Lords receive ministerial appointments
(including appointment to the Cabinet—see
p 44) on the advice of the Prime Minister.
The largest minority party becomes the
official Opposition, with its own leader and
‘shadow cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition
sit on the front benches of the Commons
with their supporters (the backbenchers)
sitting behind them.
Similar arrangements for the parties also
apply to the House of Lords; however, Lords
who do not wish to be associated with any
political party may sit on the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament rests largely on the relationship
between the Government and the opposition
parties. Depending on the relative strengths
of the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition may seek to overthrow the
Government by defeating it in a vote on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however,
its aims are to contribute to the formulation
of policy and legislation by constructive
criticism; to oppose government proposals it
considers objectionable; to seek amendments
to government Bills; and to put forward its
own policies in order to improve its chances
of winning the next general election.

The former Liberal and Social Democratic Parties (see p 34) entered into an electoral alliance in 1981 and contested the general
elections of 1983 and 1987 with a joint programme.
The member of Sinn Fein (the political wing of the Provisional IRA) has not taken his seat.
The Speaker's candidacy was as ‘Mr Speaker seeking re-election’. (He was, before his election as Speaker, a Conservative MP )
Note: In mid-September 1991 the state of the parties (excluding the Speaker and his three deputies) was as follows: Conservative 368'
hour 227 Liberal Democrats 21; Social Democratic 3; Scottish National 5; Plaid Cymru (Welsh Nationalist) 3; Ulster Unionist 9-
Democratic Unionist 3; Social Democratic and Labour 3; Ulster Popular Unionist 1; Sinn Fein 1; there were 2 vacancies.
35
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government business arrangements are
settled, under the direction of the Prime
Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses,
by the Government Chief Whips in
consultation with the Opposition Chief
Whips. The Chief Whips together constitute
the ‘usual channels’ often referred to when
the question of finding time for a particular
item of business is discussed. The Leaders of
the two Houses are responsible for enabling
the Houses to debate matters about which
they are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is
exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside, it is exercised by the
Chief Whips and their assistants, who are
chosen within the party. Their duties include
keeping members informed of forthcoming
parliamentary business, maintaining the
party’s voting strength by ensuring members
attend important debates, and passing on to
the party leadership the opinions of
backbench members. The Whips indicate the
importance their party attaches to a vote on a
particular issue by underlining items of
business (once, twice or three times) on the
notice sent to MPs. Failure to comply with a
‘three-line whip’ (the most important) is
usually seen as a rebellion against their party.
Party discipline tends to be less strong in the
Lords than in the Commons, since Lords
have less hope of high office and no need of
party support in elections.
The formal title of the Government Chief
Whip in the Commons is Parliamentary
Secretary to the Treasury. Of the other
Government Whips, three are officers of the
Royal Household (one of these is Deputy
Chief Whip), five hold titular posts as Lords
Commissioners of the Treasury and five are
Assistant Whips. Salaries are also paid to the
Opposition Chief Whips in both Houses and
to two of the Opposition Assistant Whips in
the Commons. The Government Whips in
the Lords hold offices in the Royal
Household; they also act as government
spokesmen.
Annual assistance from public funds helps
opposition parties carry out their
parliamentary work at Westminster. It is
limited to parties which had at least two
members elected at the previous general
election or one member elected and a
minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The amount
is £2,550 for every seat won, plus £5-10 for
every 200 votes.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom
and precedent. The system of debate is
similar in both Houses. The subject starts off
as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a member.
When a motion has been moved, the Speaker
proposes the question for debate. At the end
of each debate the question may be decided
without voting, or by a simple majority vote.
The main difference between the two Houses
is that the Speaker of the Lords has no
authority to curtail debate. Such matters are
decided by the general feeling of the House.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House
and must guard against the abuse of
procedure or infringements of minority
rights. The Speaker has discretion on
whether to allow a motion to end discussion
so that a matter may be put to the vote and
has powers to put a stop to irrelevance and
repetition in debate, and to save time in
other ways. In cases of grave disorder the
Speaker can adjourn or suspend the sitting.
The Speaker may order members who have
broken the rules of behaviour of the House
to leave the Chamber or he or she can
initiate their suspension for a period of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. In
a tied vote the Speaker gives a casting vote,
without expressing an opinion on the merits
of the question. The voting procedure in the
House of Lords is similar to that in the
Commons, except that the Speaker or
chairman has an ordinary vote.
The Commons has a public register of
MPs’ financial interests. Members with a
financial interest in a matter before the
House must declare it when taking part in a
debate. To act as a disqualification from
voting the interest must be direct, immediate
and personal. In other proceedings of the
House or in dealings with other members,
ministers or civil servants, MPs must also
disclose any relevant financial interest. There
36
GOVERNMENT
is no register of financial interests in the
Lords, but Lords speaking in a debate in
which they have a direct interest are
expected to declare it.
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
public. The minutes and speeches {Hansard)
are published daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and
of the Commons from 1547, together
with the parliamentary and political
papers of certain past members of both
Houses, are available to the public
through the House of Lords Record
Office.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television
and radio, either live or, more usually, in
recorded or edited form.
Legislative Proceedings
The law undergoes constant reform in the
courts as established principles are clarified
or reapplied to meet new circumstances.
Fundamental changes are the responsibility
of Parliament and the Government through
the normal legislative process.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Most are public Bills involving
measures relating to public policy. Private
Bills deal with matters of individual,
corporate or local interest. Hybrid Bills are
public Bills which may affect private rights.
The passage of private Bills and hybrid Bills
through Parliament is governed by special
procedures which allow those affected to put
their case. Public Bills can be introduced, in
either House, by a government minister or
by an ordinary member. Most public Bills
that become law are sponsored by the
Government.
Before a government Bill is drafted, there
is normally considerable consultation with
professional bodies, voluntary organisations
and other agencies interested in the subject.
These include major interest and pressure
groups which seek to promote specific
causes. Proposals for legislative changes are
sometimes set out in government ‘White
Papers’, which may be debated in Parliament
before a Bill is introduced. From time to
time consultative documents, sometimes
called ‘Green Papers’, set out government
proposals which are still taking shape and
seek comments from the public.
Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Government Bills likely to raise
political controversy usually go through the
Commons before being discussed in the
Lords, while those of a technical but non¬
political nature often pass through the Lords
first. A Bill with a mainly financial purpose
is nearly always introduced in the Commons,
and a Bill involving taxation must be based
on resolutions agreed by that House, often
after debate, before it can be introduced. If
the main object of a Bill is to create a public
charge, it must be introduced by a minister
in the Commons or, if brought from the
Lords, be taken up by a minister. This gives
the Government considerable control over
financial legislation.
Private Members’ Bills
At the beginning of each session private
members of the Commons ballot (or draw
lots) for the opportunity to introduce a Bill
on one of the Fridays specially allocated; the
first 20 are successful. Private members may
also present a Bill after question time (see
p 40). They may also seek to introduce a Bill
under the ‘ten minute rule’. This allows two
speeches, one in favour of and one against
the measure, after which the House decides
whether to allow the Bill to be brought in.
Private members’ Bills do not often proceed
very far, but a few become law each session.
If one secures a second reading, the
Government usually introduces any necessary
money resolution. Private members’ Bills
may be introduced in the House of Lords at
any time, but the time that can be given to
them in the Commons is limited.
Passage of Public Bills
The process of passing a public Bill is
similar in both Houses. The Bill receives a
formal first reading on introduction and is
printed. After between one day and several
weeks, depending on the nature of the Bill, it
37
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is given a second reading after a debate on
its general principles. In the Commons a
non-controversial Bill may be referred to a
second reading committee for its second
reading debate. After a second reading in the
Commons, a Bill is usually referred to a
standing committee for detailed examination
(see p 39). If the House so decides, the Bill
may be referred to the whole House sitting
in committee. The committee stage is
followed by the report stage, during which
further amendments may be considered.
At the third reading a Bill is reviewed in
its final form and may be debated again. The
House may vote to limit the time devoted to
examining a Bill by passing a government
timetable motion, commonly referred to as a
‘guillotine’.
After the third reading a Commons Bill is
sent to the Lords. After the second reading
in the Lords, a Bill is considered by a
committee of the whole House, unless the
House takes the rare decision to refer it to a
Public Bill Committee. It is then considered
on report and read a third time; at all these
stages amendments may be made. A Bill
which starts in the Lords and is passed by
that House is then sent to the Commons for
all its stages there. Amendments made by the
second House must generally be agreed by
the first, or a compromise reached, before a
Bill can become law.
Most government Bills introduced and
passed in the Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty. However, a
Lords Bill which was unacceptable to the
Commons would not become law. The
Lords, on the other hand, do not generally
prevent Bills insisted upon by the Commons
from becoming law, though they will often
amend them and return them for further
consideration by the Commons. In practice,
the Lords pass Bills authorising taxation or
national expenditure without amendment.
Under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, a
Bill that deals only with taxation or
expenditure must become law within one
month of being sent to the Lords, whether
or not they agree to it, unless the Commons
directs otherwise. If no agreement is reached
between the two Houses on a non-financial
Commons Bill the Lords can delay the Bill
for a period which, in practice, amounts to at
least 13 months. Following this the Bill may
be submitted to the Queen for Royal Assent,
provided it has been passed a second time by
the Commons. The Parliament Acts make
one important exception: any Bill to lengthen
the life of a Parliament requires the full
assent of both Houses in the normal way.
The limits to the power of the Lords,
contained in the Parliament Acts, are based
on the belief that nowadays the main
legislative function of the non-elected House
is to act as a chamber of revision, comple¬
menting but not rivalling the elected House.
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen
for Royal Assent, after which it is part of the
law of the land and known as an Act of
Parliament. The Royal Assent has not been
refused since 1707.
Private Bills
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar procedure to
public Bills, but most of the work is done in
committee, where procedures follow a semi¬
judicial pattern. The promoter must prove
the need for the powers sought and the
objections of opposing interests are heard.
Both sides may be legally represented.
Delegated Legislation
In order to reduce pressure on parliamentary
time, much legislation gives ministers and
other authorities the power to regulate
administrative details by making ‘delegated
legislation’. To minimise the risk that powers
given to the executive might undermine
parliamentary government, they are normally
delegated to authorities directly responsible
to Parliament. Moreover, the Acts of
Parliament concerned often provide for some
measure of parliamentary control over the
delegated legislation, by giving Parliament
the right to affirm or annul it. Certain Acts
also state that the organisations affected must
be consulted before rules and orders can be
made.
38
GOVERNMENT
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. In order to save time on the
floor of the House, the Commons also uses
standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments; actual decisions are taken by the
House.
Parliamentary Committees
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may pass a resolution setting
itself up as a committee of the whole House
to consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This permits unrestricted
discussion: the rule that an MP or Lord may
speak only once on each issue does not apply
in committee.
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
formally debate public Bills at the committee
stage and, in certain cases, at the second
reading stage. They also include two Scottish
standing committees, and the Scottish and
Welsh Grand Committees. Ordinary standing
committees do not have names as such but
are referred to simply as Standing
Committee A, B, C, and so on; the members
are separately appointed to consider each
Bill. Each committee has between 16 and 50
members, with a party balance reflecting as
far as possible that in the House as a whole.
The Scottish Grand Committee, which
comprises all 72 Scottish members (and may
be convened in Edinburgh), considers the
principles of Scottish Bills referred to it at
second reading stage. It also debates Scottish
estimates and other matters concerning
Scotland only which may be referred to it.
The Welsh Grand Committee, with all 38
Welsh members and up to five others,
considers Bills referred to it at second
reading stage, and matters concerning Wales
only. There is also provision for a Northern
Ireland committee to debate matters relating
specifically to Northern Ireland.
The Lords’ equivalent to a standing
committee, a Public Bill Committee, is rarely
used.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed, normally
for the duration of a Parliament, to examine
subjects by taking written and oral evidence.
After private discussion they report their
conclusions and recommendations. Some
select committees may be appointed to help
Parliament with the control of the executive
by examining aspects of public policy and
administration. These include the 14
committees established by the House of
Commons to examine the expenditure,
administration and policy of the main
government departments and related bodies.
The Foreign Affairs Committee, for
example, ‘shadows’ the work of the Foreign
& Commonwealth Office. The committees
are constituted on a party basis, in
approximate proportion to party strength in
the House. Select committees also cover the
internal workings of Parliament.
Other regular Commons committees
include those on European Legislation,
Public Accounts, Members’ Interests, and
the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration. The Committee of Selection
and the Standing Orders Committee have
duties relating to private Bills, and the
Committee of Selection also chooses
members to serve on standing and select
committees. A Liaison Committee considers
general matters relating to select committees.
On rare occasions a parliamentary Bill is
examined by a specially appointed select
committee, in addition to the usual legislative
process: this occurs, for example, every few
years for the Armed Forces Bill.
In their scrutiny of government policies
and administration, the committees question
ministers, senior civil servants and interested
bodies and individuals. Through hearings
and published reports, they bring before
Parliament and the public a body of fact and
informed opinion on many issues, and build
up considerable expertise in their subjects of
inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the
Appeal and Appellate Committees, in which
the bulk of the House’s judicial work is
transacted, there are two major select
committees, with several sub-committees, on
39
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the European Communities and on Science
and Technology. There are also select
committees on House of Lords’ Offices,
Hybrid Instruments, Leave of Absence and
Lords’ Expenses, Personal Bills, Private Bill
Standing Orders, Privileges, Procedure,
Selection and Broadcasting.
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
session to deal with Consolidation Bills and
delegated legislation. The two Houses may
also agree to set up joint select committees
on other subjects.
Party Committees
In addition to the official committees of the
two Houses there are several unofficial party
organisations or committees. The
Conservative and Unionist Members’
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of
the backbench membership of the party in
the House of Commons. When the
Conservative Party is in office, ministers
attend its meetings by invitation and not by
right. When the party is in opposition, the
whole membership of the party may attend
meetings and the leader appoints a
consultative committee, which acts as the
party’s ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Parliamentary Labour Party
comprises all members of the party in both
Houses. When the Labour Party is in office
a parliamentary committee, half of whose
members are elected and half of whom are
government representatives, acts as a channel
of communication between the Government
and its backbenchers in both Houses. When
the party is in opposition the Parliamentary
Labour Party is organised under the
direction of an elected parliamentary
committee, which acts as the ‘shadow
cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
The effectiveness of parliamentary control of
the Government is a subject of continuing
discussion, both inside and outside
Parliament. In addition to the system of
scrutiny by select committees, the House of
Commons offers a number of opportunities
for the examination of government policy by
both the Opposition and the Government’s
own backbenchers. These include:
1. Question time, when for an hour on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs’ questions.
The Prime Minister’s question time is on
Tuesday and Thursday. Parliamentary
questions are one means of seeking
information about the Government’s
intentions. They are also a way of raising
grievances brought to MPs’ notice by
constituents. MPs may also put questions to
ministers for written answer; the questions
and answers are published in Hansard, the
official report.
2. The right of MPs to use motions for the
adjournment of the House to raise
constituency cases or matters of public
concern. There is a half-hour adjournment
period at the end of the business of the day,
while immediately before the adjournment
for each recess (Parliament’s Christmas,
Easter, spring and summer breaks) a full day
is spent discussing issues raised by private
members. In addition, an MP wishing to
discuss a ‘specific and important matter that
should have urgent consideration’ may, at
the end of question time, seek leave to move
the adjournment of the House. If the
Speaker accepts the terms of the motion,
the MP asks the House for leave for the
motion to be put forward. Leave can be
given unanimously, or it can be given if 40
or more MPs support the motion or if
fewer than 40 but more than ten support it
and the House (on a vote) is in favour.
Once leave has been given, the matter is
debated for three hours, usually on the
following day.
3. The 20 Opposition days each session,
when the Opposition can choose subjects for
debate. Of these days, 17 are at the disposal
of the Leader of the Opposition and three at
the disposal of the second largest opposition
party.
40
GOVERNMENT
4. Debates on the occasion of the passage,
three times a year, of Consolidated Fund or
Appropriation Bills, when members can
exercise their traditional right of ‘raising
grievances’ on matters for which any
minister is responsible. This takes place after
voting the necessary supplies (money) for the
Government.
5. Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government expenditure
recommended for consideration by the
Liaison Committee (see p 39).
Procedural opportunities for criticism of
the Government also arise during the debate
on the Queen’s speech at the beginning of
each session, during debates on motions of
censure for which the Government gives up
part of its own time, and during debates on
the Government’s legislative proposals.
Opportunities for criticism and
examination of government policy are
provided in the House of Lords at daily
question time and during debates on general
motions. Other opportunities include
‘unstarred’ questions (which can be debated)
at the end of the day’s business and debates
on proposed legislation.
The main responsibilities of Parliament,
and more particularly of the House of
Commons, in managing the revenue of the
State and payments for the public service,
are to authorise the raising of taxes and
duties and the various objects of expenditure
and the sum to be spent on each. It also has
to satisfy itself that the sums granted are
spent only for the purposes which Parliament
intended. No payment out of the central
government’s public funds can be made and
no taxation or loans authorised, except by
Act of Parliament. However, limited interim
payments can be made from the
Contingencies Fund. The Finance Act is the
most important of the annual statutes which
authorise the raising of revenue. The
legislation is based on the Chancellor of the
Exchequer’s Budget statement, normally
made in March or April each year. It
includes a review of the public finances of
the previous year, and proposals for the
estimated expenditure of the coming year.
Scrutiny of public expenditure is carried out
by House of Commons select committees
(see p 39).
To keep the two Houses informed of
European Community developments, and to
enable them to scrutinise and debate
Community policies and proposals, there is a
select committee in each House (see p 39).
Ministers also make regular statements about
Community business.
The final control is the ability of the
House of Commons to force the Government
to resign by passing a resolution of ‘no
confidence’. The Government must also
resign if the House rejects a proposal for
legislation which the Government considers
so vital to its policy that it has made it a
‘matter of confidence’ or if the House refuses
to vote the money required for the public
service.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman’) investigates, independently,
complaints of maladministration when asked
to do so by MPs on behalf of members of the
public. Powers of investigation extend to
administrative actions by central government
departments and certain executive and non-
departmental bodies. They do not include
policy decisions (which can be questioned in
Parliament) and matters affecting relations
with other countries. Complaints by British
citizens arising from dealings with British
diplomatic posts overseas are open to
investigation in some circumstances. The
Commissioner has access to departmental
papers and reports the findings to the MP
who presented the complaint. The
Commissioner is required to report annually
to Parliament. He or she also publishes
details of selected investigations at quarterly
intervals and may submit other reports where
necessary. A Commons select committee
oversees the Commissioner’s work.
Parliamentary Privilege
Each House of Parliament has certain rights
and immunities to protect it from
41
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
obstruction in carrying out its duties. The
rights apply collectively to each House and
individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally
claims from the Queen ‘their ancient and
undoubted rights and privileges’ at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include
freedom of speech; freedom from arrest in
civil actions; exemption from serving on
juries, or being compelled to attend court as
witnesses; and the right of access to the
Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the rights
of the House to control its own proceedings
(so that it is able, for instance, to exclude
‘strangers’9 if it wishes); to decide upon
legal disqualifications for membership and to
declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and to
punish for breach of its privileges and for
contempt.
The privileges of the House of Lords are
broadly similar to those of the House of
Commons.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State. As
the system of Cabinet government
developed, however, the Privy Council
became less prominent. Many powers were
transferred to the Cabinet as an inner
committee of the Council, and much of its
work was handed over to government
departments, some of which were originally
committees of the Privy Council.
Nowadays the main function of the Privy
Council is to advise the Queen to approve
Orders in Council, including those made
under prerogative powers, such as Orders
approving the grant of royal charters of
incorporation, and those made under
statutory powers. Responsibility for each
Order, however, rests with the minister
answerable for the policy concerned,
regardless of whether he or she was present
at the meeting where approval was given.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown
on the issue of royal proclamations, some of
which are prerogative acts, such as
9 All those who are not members or officials of either House.
summoning or dissolving Parliament. The
Council’s own statutory responsibilities,
which are independent of the powers of the
Sovereign in Council, include supervising the
registering bodies for the medical and allied
professions.
Cabinet ministers must be Privy
Counsellors and are sworn in on first
assuming office. Otherwise membership of
the Council (retained for life, except for very
occasional removals) is accorded by the
Sovereign, on the recommendation of the
Prime Minister, to eminent people in Britain
and the independent monarchies of the
Commonwealth. There are about 400 Privy
Counsellors. A full Council is summoned
only on the accession of a new Sovereign or
when the Sovereign announces his or her
intention to marry.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of advisory Privy
Council committees. These include
prerogative committees, such as those dealing
with legislation from the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man, and with applications for
charters of incorporation. Committees may
also be provided for by statute, such as those
for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge
and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is the final court of appeal for
certain independent members of the
Commonwealth, the British dependencies,
the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. It
also hears appeals from the disciplinary
committees of the medical and allied
professions and certain ecclesiastical appeals.
Administrative work is carried out in the
Privy Council Office under the Lord
President of the Council, a Cabinet minister.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of
ministers responsible for the administration
of national affairs. The Prime Minister is
appointed by the Queen, and all other
ministers are appointed by the Queen on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister.
Most ministers are members of the
42
GOVERNMENT
Commons, although the Government is also
fully represented by ministers in the Lords.
The Lord Chancellor is always a member of
the House of Lords.
Composition
The composition of governments can vary
both in the number of ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished, and
functions may be transferred from one
minister to another.
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition,
First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for
the Civil Service. The head of the
Government became known as the Prime
Minister during the eighteenth century. The
Prime Minister’s unique position of authority
derives from majority support in the House
of Commons and from the power to appoint
and dismiss ministers. By modern
convention, the Prime Minister always sits in
the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet, is responsible for the allocation of
functions among ministers and informs the
Queen at regular meetings of the general
business of the Government.
The Prime Minister’s other respon¬
sibilities include recommending to the Queen
a number of appointments. These include:
• Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans and some 200 other clergy in
Crown ‘livings’;
• high judicial offices, such as the Lord
Chief Justice;
• Privy Counsellors; and
• Lord-Lieutenants.
They also include certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate,
Constable of the Tower, and some university
posts; and appointments to various public
boards and institutions, such as the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), as well as
various royal and statutory commissions.
Recommendations are likewise made for the
award of many civil honours and distinctions
and of Civil List pensions (to people who
have achieved eminence in science and the
arts and are in financial need). The Prime
Minister also selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
The Prime Minister’s Office at 10
Downing Street (the official residence in
central London) has a staff of civil servants
who assist the Prime Minister. The Prime
Minister may also appoint special advisers to
the Office from time to time to assist in the
formation of policies.
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or
‘Minister’, or may have a special title, as in
the case of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
Non-Departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the Lord President of the Council,
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,
the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General
and, from time to time, Ministers without
Portfolio, may have few or no departmental
duties. They are thus available to perform
any duties the Prime Minister may wish to
give them.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special
position, as both a minister with
departmental functions and the head of the
judiciary. The four Law Officers of the
Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General;
and for Scotland, the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State
Ministers of State usually work with
ministers in charge of departments. They
normally have specific responsibilities, and
are sometimes given titles which reflect these
43
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
functions. More than one may work in a
department. A Minister of State may be
given a seat in the Cabinet and be paid
accordingly.
Junior Ministers
Junior ministers (generally Parliamentary
Under-Secretaries of State or, where the
senior minister is not a Secretary of State,
simply Parliamentary Secretaries) share in
parliamentary and departmental duties. They
may also be given responsibility, directly
under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work. The
Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and
other Lords Commissioners of the Treasury
are in a different category as Government
Whips (see p 36).
Ministerial Salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons range from £42,272 a year for
junior ministers to £59,914 for Cabinet
ministers. In the House of Lords salaries
range from £36,066 for junior ministers to
£48,381 for Cabinet ministers. The Prime
Minister receives £72,533 and the Lord
Chancellor £91,500.
The Cabinet
The Cabinet is composed of about 20
ministers (the number can vary) chosen by
the Prime Minister and may include
departmental and non-departmental
ministers.
The functions of the Cabinet are initiating
and deciding on policy, the supreme control
of government and the co-ordination of
government departments. The exercise of
these functions is vitally affected by the fact
that the Cabinet is a group of party
representatives, depending upon majority
support in the House of Commons.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its
proceedings are confidential. Its members are
bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not
to disclose information about its proceedings,
although after 30 years Cabinet papers may
be made available for inspection in the
Public Record Office at Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets for a few
hours once or twice a week during
parliamentary sittings, and rather less often
when Parliament is not sitting. To keep the
workload of the Cabinet within manageable
limits, a great deal of work is carried on
through the committee system. This involves
referring issues either to a standing Cabinet
committee or to an ad hoc committee
composed of the ministers directly
concerned. The committee then considers
the matter in detail and either disposes of it
or reports upon it to the Cabinet with
recommendations for action.
The present Cabinet has four standing
committees: a defence and overseas policy
committee and an economic strategy
committee, both chaired by the Prime
Minister; a home and social affairs committee
chaired by the Lord Privy Seal; and a
legislation committee chaired by the Lord
President of the Council. Sub-committees of
the standing committees may be established.
The membership and terms of reference of
all Cabinet committees are confidential.
Diaries published by several former ministers
have given the public insight into Cabinet
procedures in recent times.
Non-Cabinet ministers may be invited to
attend meetings on matters affecting their
departments, and may be members of
Cabinet committees. Where appropriate, the
Secretary of the Cabinet and other senior
officials of the Cabinet Office attend
meetings of the Cabinet and its committees.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary
of the Cabinet (who is also Head of the
Home Civil Service), under the direction of
the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet
Secretariat, the Office of the Minister for the
Civil Service and the Historical Section.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers
collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business, and in the co-ordination of policy
at the highest level.
44
GOVERNMENT
The Office of the Minister for the Civil
Service is responsible for implementing the
Next Steps policy (see p 53). Other tasks
include the provision of services in the field
of recruitment, training and occupational
health; policies for the management and
development of staff; and equal
opportunities.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet
Office recently completed the official
histories of the second world war; it is now
responsible for preparing official histories of
certain peacetime events.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility which ministers share
for government policy and actions and to
ministers’ individual responsibility for their
departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility
means that the Cabinet acts unanimously
even when Cabinet ministers do not all agree
on a subject. The policy of departmental
ministers must be consistent with the policy
of the Government as a whole. Once the
Government’s policy on a matter has been
decided, each minister is expected to support
it or resign. On rare occasions, ministers
have been allowed free votes in Parliament
on government policies involving important
issues of principle.
The individual responsibility of ministers
for the work of their departments means that
they are answerable to Parliament for all
their departments’ activities. They bear the
consequences of any defect of administration,
any injustice to an individual or any aspect
of policy which may be criticised in
Parliament, whether personally responsible or
not. Since most ministers are members of the
House of Commons, they must answer
questions and defend themselves against
criticism in person. Departmental ministers
in the House of Lords are represented in the
Commons by someone qualified to speak on
their behalf, usually a junior minister.
Departmental ministers normally decide
all matters within their responsibility.
However, on important political matters they
usually consult their colleagues collectively,
either through the Cabinet or through a
Cabinet committee. A decision by a
departmental minister binds the Government
as a whole.
On assuming office ministers must resign
directorships in private and public
companies, and must ensure that there is no
conflict between their public duties and
private interests.
Government Departments
Government departments are the main
instruments for giving effect to government
policy when Parliament has passed the
necessary legislation, and for advising
ministers. They often work alongside local
authorities, statutory boards, and
government-sponsored organisations
operating under various degrees of
government control.
A change of government does not
necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments,
although major changes in policy may be
accompanied by organisational changes.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers
Britain as a whole. Other departments (such
as the Department of Employment) cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others, such as the
Department of the Environment, are mainly
concerned with affairs in England. Some
departments, such as the Department of
Trade and Industry, maintain a regional
organisation, and some which have direct
contact with the public throughout the
country (for example, the Department of
Employment) also have local offices.
Departments are usually headed by
ministers. Certain departments in which
questions of policy do not normally arise are
headed by permanent officials, and ministers
with other duties are responsible for them to
Parliament. For instance, ministers in the
Treasury are responsible for HM Customs
and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the Central
Statistical Office, the National Investment
and Loans Office and a number of other
departments as well as executive agencies
such as the Central Office of Information,
45
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
HMSO and the Royal Mint. Departments
generally receive their funds directly out of
money provided by Parliament and are
staffed by members of the Civil Service.
Non-Departmental Public Bodies
A number of bodies with a role in the
process of government are neither
government departments nor part of a
department (in April 1990 there were 1,539).
Known as non-departmental public bodies,
they are of three kinds: executive bodies,
advisory bodies and tribunals.
Executive Bodies
Executive bodies normally employ their own
staff and have their own budget. They are
public organisations whose duties include
executive, administrative, regulatory or
commercial functions. They normally operate
within broad policy guidelines set by
departmental ministers but are in varying
degrees independent of government in
carrying out their day-to-day responsibilities.
Examples include the Arts Council of Great
Britain, the British Council, the
Commonwealth Development Corporation
and the Commission for Racial Equality.
Advisory Bodies
Many government departments are assisted
by advisory councils or committees which
undertake research and collect information,
mainly to give ministers access to informed
opinion before they come to a decision
involving a legislative or executive act. In
some cases a minister must consult a
standing committee, but usually advisory
bodies are appointed at the discretion of the
minister.
The membership of the advisory councils
and committees varies according to the
nature of the work involved, and will usually
include representatives who belong to
relevant interests and professions.
In addition to the standing advisory
bodies, there are committees set up by the
Government to examine specific matters and
make recommendations. For certain
important inquiries Royal Commissions,
whose members are chosen for their wide
experience, may be appointed. Royal
Commissions examine evidence from
government departments, interested
organisations and individuals, and submit
recommendations. The Government may
accept the recommendations in whole or in
part, or may decide to take no further
action or to delay action. Inquiries may
also be undertaken by departmental
committees.
Tribunals
Tribunals are a specialised group of
judicial bodies, akin to courts of law. They
are normally set up under statutory powers
which also govern their constitution,
functions and procedure. Tribunals often
consist of laypeople, but they are generally
chaired by someone who is legally
qualified. They tend to be less expensive,
and less formal, than courts of law.
Independently of the executive, tribunals
decide the rights and obligations of private
citizens, and of government departments
and local authorities. Important examples
are industrial tribunals, rent tribunals and
social security appeal tribunals. Tribunals
usually consist of an uneven number of
people so that a majority decision can be
reached. Members are normally appointed
by the minister concerned with the
subject. Tribunals and advisory bodies do
not normally employ staff or spend money
themselves, but their expenses are paid by
the government departments concerned.
Government Information Services
Each of the main government departments
has its own information division, public
relations branch or news department.
These are normally staffed by professional
information officers responsible for
communicating their department’s
activities to the news media and the public
(sometimes using publicity services
provided by the Central Office of
Information—see p 48). They also advise
their departments on the public’s reaction.
46
GOVERNMENT
As press adviser to the Prime Minister,
the Prime Minister’s Press Secretary and
other staff in the Prime Minister’s Press
Office have direct contact with the
parliamentary press through regular
meetings with the Lobby correspondents.
The Lobby correspondents are a group of
political correspondents who have the
special privilege of access to the Lobby of
the House of Commons where they can
talk privately to government ministers and
other members of the House. The Prime
Minister’s Press Office is the accepted
channel through which information about
parliamentary business is passed to the
media.
Functions of Government Departments
An outline of the principal functions of the
main government departments and executive
agencies is given below. Arrangement is in

SCOTLAND
Scotland has its own system of law and wide
administrative autonomy. The Secretary of
State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister, has
responsibility in Scotland (with some
exceptions) for policy relating to agriculture
and fisheries, education, law and order,
environmental protection and conservation of
the countryside, land-use planning, local
government, housing, roads and certain
aspects of transport services, social work and
health.
The Secretary of State also has a major
role in the planning and development of the
Scottish economy, and important functions
relating to industrial development, with
responsibility for financial assistance to
industry. He or she is also responsible for
Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands
Enterprise and new town development
corporations and for the Scottish Tourist
Board. The Secretary of State plays a full
part in determining energy policy,
particularly in relation to the electricity
supply industry in Scotland. He or she is
also responsible for government involvement
in a range of other functions from fire
services to sport and for overseeing many
non-departmental public bodies.
The Secretary of State has overall
responsibility for legal services in Scotland
and is advised by the two Scottish Law
Officers, the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland (see below).
The distinctive conditions and needs of
Scotland and its people are reflected in
separate Scottish legislation on many
domestic matters. Special provisions applying
to Scotland alone are also inserted in Acts
which otherwise apply to Britain generally.
The Secretary of State’s responsibilities are
discharged principally through the Scottish
Office’s five departments (which include two
executive agencies), supported by Central
Services (see p 51). There are also four smaller
departments: the Registers of Scotland (an
executive agency), the Scottish Record Office,
the General Register Office for Scotland and
the Scottish Courts Administration.
British government departments with
significant Scottish responsibilities have
offices in Scotland and work closely with the
Scottish Office. The British headquarters of
several government departments are located
in Scotland.
An outline of the functions of the main
Scottish departments is given below.

The Civil Service
The Civil Service is concerned with the
conduct of the whole range of government
activities as they affect the community.
These range from policy formulation to
carrying out the day-to-day duties of public
administration.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown.
For all practical purposes the Crown in this
context means, and is represented by, the
Government of the day. There are special
cases in which certain functions are
conferred by law upon particular members or
groups of members of the public service.
However, in general the executive powers of
the Crown are exercised by, and on the
advice of, Her Majesty’s Ministers, who are
in turn answerable to Parliament. The Civil
Service as such has no constitutional
responsibility separate from that of the duly
constituted Government of the day. The
duty of the individual civil servant is first
and foremost to the Minister of the Crown
who is in charge of the Department
concerned. A change of minister, for
whatever reason, does not involve a change
of staff. Ministers sometimes appoint
special advisers from outside the Civil
Service. The advisers are normally paid from
public funds, but their appointments come to
an end when the Government’s term of
office finishes, or when the Minister
concerned leaves the Government or moves
to another appointment.
The number of civil servants has fallen
from 732,000 in April 1979 to 554,000 in
April 1991, reflecting the Government’s
policy of controlling the cost and size of the
Civil Service and of improving its efficiency.
About half of all civil servants are engaged in
the provision of public services. These
include paying sickness benefits and
pensions, collecting taxes and contributions,
running employment services, staffing
prisons, and providing services to industry
and agriculture. Around a quarter are
employed in the Ministry of Defence. The
rest are divided between: central
administrative and policy duties; support
services; and largely financially self-
supporting services, for instance, those
provided by the Department for National
Savings and the Royal Mint. The total
includes about 64,000 ‘industrial’ civil
servants, mainly manual workers in
government industrial establishments. Four-
fifths of civil servants work outside London.
The Government is committed to
achieving equality of opportunity for all its
staff. In support of this commitment, the
Civil Service is actively pursuing policies to
increase employment and career
opportunities for women, ethnic minorities
and people with disabilities. The number of
black and Asian people now employed in the
Civil Service is proportionate to their
representation in Britain’s population.
Reforms of the management of
government departments are being
52
GOVERNMENT
implemented to ensure improved
management performance, in particular
through the increased accountability of
individual managers, based on clear
objectives and responsibilities. These reforms
include performance-related pay schemes and
other incentives.
Executive Agencies: Next Steps Initiative
The Next Steps Initiative, launched in 1988,
is intended to improve management in the
Civil Service and the efficiency and quality
of services provided to the public and to
customers within government. This has
involved setting up, as far as practicable,
separate units or agencies to perform the
executive functions of government. Agencies
remain part of the Civil Service but they
enjoy greater delegation on financial, pay and
personnel matters. Agencies are headed by
chief executives who are personally
responsible for the performance of the
agency. By July 1991 a total of more than 50
agencies had been set up, together with 30
executive units covering 95 per cent of
Customs and Excise. Over 210,000 civil
servants work in organisations run on Next
Steps lines. It is expected that this
programme will have been applied to at
least half the Civil Service in the course
of 1992.
Efficiency Measures
Savings in public expenditure are being
sought by competitive tendering and by
contracting out to the private sector services
carried out by government departments when
this leads to better management and value
for money. By April 1990 savings of around
£54 million net a year had been achieved.
Citizen’s Charter
Government proposals to raise standards in
the public services were set out in a White
Paper, The Citizen’s Charter, published in
July 1991. The proposals involve more
privatisation, wider competition, further
contracting-out and pay more closely related
to performance. They also include
requirements for comprehensive information
on standards achieved, more effective
complaints procedures, better redress for the
citizen when things go wrong, and tougher
and more independent inspectorates and
auditing. All public services are expected to
take action: the Government intends to
publish separate charters for specific services,
for example, taxation (see p 343) and
education (see p 144).
Executive agencies will fully comply with
the principles of The Citizen's Charter. The
Government will introduce legislation to
remove obstacles to the delegation of
decisions to civil servants. Performance-
related pay will be introduced for most staff.
Central Management and Structure
Responsibility for central co-ordination and
management of the Civil Service is divided
between the Treasury and the Cabinet Office
(Office of the Minister for the Civil Service).
In addition to its other functions, the
Treasury is responsible for the structure of
the Civil Service. It is also responsible for
recruitment policy and for controlling
staffing, pay, pensions and allowances. The
Office of the Minister for the Civil Service,
which is under the control of the Prime
Minister, as Minister for the Civil Service, is
responsible for the organisation, non-
financial aspects of personnel management
and overall efficiency of the Service. The
function of official Head of the Home Civil
Service is combined with that of Secretary to
the Cabinet.
At the senior levels, where management
forms a major part of most jobs, there are
common grades throughout the Civil Service.
These unified grades 1 to 7 are known as the
Open Structure and cover grades from
Permanent Secretary level to Principal level.
Within the unified grades each post is filled
by the person best equipped in terms of
skills, ability and experience, regardless of
the occupational group to which he or she
previously belonged.
Below this the structure of the non¬
industrial Civil Service is based on a system
of occupational groups, which are the basic
groupings of staff for the purposes of
53
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
personnel management. T hese include the
Administration, Economist, Information
Officer, Lawyer, Librarian, Professional and
Technical (which includes architects,
surveyors, and electrical and mechanical
engineers), Secretarial, Science and
Statistician Groups. These groups, together
with the Inland Revenue’s administration
and typing grades, account for about 65 per
cent of non-industrial staff. Work requiring
specialist skill is always done by qualified
individuals.
Personnel management policies encourage
the deployment of staff so that talent can be
used to the best advantage. Higher posts are
open to people of outstanding ability,
whatever their specialist background or
original method of entry into the Service.
This ensures that people with the necessary
qualities can gain suitably wide experience to
fit them for posts at the highest levels. The
exchange of staff between the Civil Service
and industry is also encouraged.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of
some 6,600 or so people, provides the
majority of the staff for the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office and at British
diplomatic missions and consular posts
abroad. Its functions include:
• advising on policy;
• negotiating with overseas governments
and conducting business in international
organisations;
• promoting British exports and trade
generally;
• administering aid;
• presenting British ideas, policies and
objectives to the people of overseas
countries;
• administering the remaining dependent
territories; and
• protecting British interests abroad and
British nationals overseas.
The Service has its own grade structure,
linked for salary purposes with that of the
Home Civil Service. Conditions of work are
in many ways comparable, but take into
account the special demands of the Service,
particularly of postings overseas. Members of
the Home Civil Service and the armed
forces, and individuals from the private
sector, may also serve in the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office and at overseas posts
on loan or attachment.
Recruitment and Training
Recruitment is based on the principle of
selection on merit by open competition.
Independent Civil Service Commissioners are
responsible for selecting people for
appointment to the higher levels and to the
fast-streams of the Home Civil Service and
the Diplomatic Service. Recruitment of
middle ranking and junior staff is the
responsibility of departments and executive
agencies; it is monitored by the
Commissioners. Departments and agencies
can choose whether to undertake the
recruitment work themselves, to employ a
private sector recruitment agency or to use
the Recruitment and Assessment Services
Agency (an executive agency) to recruit on
their behalf.
People from outside the Civil Service may
be recruited directly to the higher levels in
the open structure (at and above Grade 7
level), particularly to posts requiring skills
and experience more readily found in the
private sector.
For the Administration Group, there are
three main levels of entry. They broadly
relate to the academic achievements of: a
first or second class honours degree; GCE
Advanced level; and GCSE Grade A, B or
C. For entry at the first of these levels (the
fast-stream administration entry) applicants
must succeed in a one-day qualifying test,
followed by two days of tests and interviews
at the Civil Service Selection Board and an
interview by the Final Selection Board. For
the GCE Advanced entry (Executive Officer)
selection normally involves a qualifying test
followed by an interview. For the GCSE
entry (Administration Officer/Assistant)
selection is usually by interview for those
who hold the required educational or
vocational qualifications, or who pass
specially designed job-related tests.
54
GOVERNMENT
Entrants to the Professional and
Technology Group must usually have
relevant qualifications, ranging from
membership of an architectural, engineering
or related professional institution to technical
qualifications. New graduates are offered a
structured training programme leading to
membership of an appropriate professional
institution.
Entrants to the Science Group must
normally have appropriate qualifications in
science, engineering or mathematical
subjects. Relevant experience is required
before appointment to the more senior levels
(Higher and Senior Scientific Officer). There
are opportunities for accelerated career
development for honours graduates through
the Science Management Trainee scheme.
School leavers with GCSE Grade A, B or C
qualifications may join the Science Group as
Assistant Scientific Officers.
Many government departments and
agencies employ training officers and tutors
to help identify staff training needs and
organise training by the most effective
method. The Civil Service College provides
a wide range of training courses in both
management and specialist skills.
Considerable use is also made of external
institutions.
Civil servants under the age of 18 may
continue their general education by attending
courses, usually for one day a week (‘day
release’ schemes). All staff may be entitled to
financial support to continue their education,
mainly in their own time. There are also
opportunities for civil servants to obtain
fellowships for research and study in areas of
interest to them and to their department or
agency.
Promotion
Departments are responsible for promotion
up to and including Grade 4. Normally
promotion is from grade to grade, but there
can be accelerated promotion for staff who
show exceptional promise. Promotion or
appointment to Grades 1 and 2 and all
transfers between departments at these levels
are approved by the Prime Minister, who is
advised by the Head of the Home Civil
Service. Promotions and appointments to
Grade 3 are approved by the Cabinet Office.
Political and Private Activities
Civil servants are required to perform loyally
the duties assigned to them by the
Government of the day, whatever its political
persuasion. It is essential that ministers and
the public should have confidence that the
personal views of civil servants do not
influence the performance of their official
duties, given the role of the Civil Service in
serving successive governments of different
political complexions. The aim of the rules
which govern political activities by civil
servants is to allow them, subject to these
fundamental principles, the greatest possible
freedom to participate in public affairs
consistent with their rights and duties as
citizens. The rules are therefore concerned
with political activities liable to give public
expression to political views rather than with
privately held beliefs and opinions.
The Civil Service is divided into three
groups for the purposes of deciding the
extent to which individuals may take part in
political activities. Those in the ‘politically
free’ group, consisting of industrial staff and
non-office grades, are free to engage in any
political activity, including adoption as a
candidate for the British or the European
Parliament (although they would have to
resign from the Service if elected). Those in
the ‘politically restricted’ group, which
comprises staff in Grade 7 and above as well
as Administration Trainees and Higher
Executive Officers (D), are debarred from
national political activities but may apply for
permission to take part in local political
activities. The ‘intermediate’ group, which
comprises all other civil servants, may apply
for permission to take part in national or
local political activity, apart from candidature
for the British or the European Parliament.
Where required, permission is granted to
the maximum extent consistent with the
Civil Service’s reputation for political
impartiality and the avoidance of any conflict
with official duties. A code of discretion
requires moderation and the avoidance of
embarrassment to ministers.
55
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Generally, there are no restrictions on the
private activities of civil servants, provided
that these do not bring discredit on the Civil
Service, and that there is no possibility of
conflict with official duties. For instance, a
civil servant must comply with any
departmental instruction on the need to seek
authority before taking part in any outside
activity which involves the use of official
experience, or before accepting a directorship
in any company holding a contract with his
or her department.
Security
As a general rule the political views of civil
servants are not a matter of official concern.
However, no one may be employed in
connection with work which is vital to the
security of the State if they have been
involved in, or associated with, activities
threatening national security. Certain posts
are not open to persons who fall into this
category, or to anyone whose reliability may
be in doubt for any other reason.
Each department is responsible for its own
internal security, advised as necessary by the
Security Service. The Security Commission
may investigate and report on breaches of
security in the public service and advise on
changes in security procedure, if requested to
do so by the Prime Minister after consultation
with the Leader of the Opposition.
Local Government
Many public services, such as school
education and personal social services, are
provided by democratically elected local
authorities throughout Britain.
Local authorities’ powers and duties are
conferred on them by Parliament, or by
measures taken under its authority.
Administration is the responsibility of the
local authority. In the case of certain
services, however, ministers have powers to
secure some national uniformity in standards
in order to safeguard public health or to
protect the rights of individual citizens. For
some services the minister concerned has
wide powers of supervision; in other cases
the minister’s powers are strictly limited.
The main link between local authorities
and central government in England is the
Department of the Environment, although
other departments such as the Department
of Education and Science and the Home
Office are concerned with various local
government functions. In the rest of
Britain the local authorities deal with the
Scottish and Welsh Offices and the
Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
Principal Types of Local Authority
England and Wales (outside Greater
London) are divided into 53 counties, sub¬
divided into 369 districts. All the districts
and 47 of the counties—the ‘non¬
metropolitan’ counties—have locally elected
councils with separate functions. County
councils provide large-scale services, while
district councils are responsible for the more
local ones (see p 58).
Greater London—with a population of
some 6-4 million—is divided into 32
boroughs, each of which has a council
responsible for local government in its area;
in addition there is the Corporation of the
City of London. In the six metropolitan
counties there are 36 district councils; there
are no county councils. A number of
services, however, require a statutory
authority over areas wider than the
individual boroughs and districts. These are
waste regulation and disposal (in certain
areas); the police and fire services, including
civil defence, and public transport (in all
metropolitan counties); and the fire service,
including civil defence (in London). All are
run by joint authorities composed of elected
councillors nominated by the borough or
district councils.
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, there are over 10,000
parish councils or meetings. They provide
and manage local facilities such as allotments
and village halls. They also provide a forum
for discussion of local issues. In Wales
community councils have similar functions.
On the mainland of Scotland local
government is on a two-tier basis: nine regions
are divided into 53 districts, each of which has
56
GOVERNMENT
an elected council. There are three virtually
all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland
and the Western Isles. Provision is also made
for local community councils: although these
have no statutory functions they can draw
attention to matters of local concern.
The areas and electoral arrangements of
local authorities are kept under review by the
Local Government Boundary Commissions
for England, Wales and Scotland.
In Northern Ireland 26 district councils
are responsible for local environmental and
certain other services. Statutory bodies, such
as the Northern Ireland Housing Executive
and area boards, are responsible to central
government departments for administering
other major services (see below).
Proposed Reforms to the Structure and
Internal Management of Local
Government
In April 1991 the Government began
consultations on the structure of local
government in England. The Government
has stated that it believes there should be a
move towards unitary, all-purpose authorities
to replace the existing two-tier structure. In
July 1991 consultation began on the internal
management of local authorities in England.
Consultation on these subjects is also taking
place in Scotland and Wales.
Election of Councils
Local authority councils consist of elected
unpaid councillors. Councillors may,
however, be entitled to a basic flat rate
allowance and to certain expenses when
attending meetings or taking on special
responsibilities. Parish and community
councillors cannot claim allowances for duties
undertaken within their own council areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland
each council elects its presiding officer and
his or her deputy annually. Some districts
have the ceremonial title of borough, or city,
both granted by royal authority (in Northern
Ireland, by the Secretary of State). In
boroughs and cities the presiding officer is
normally known as the Mayor. In the City of
London and certain other large cities, he or
she is known as the Lord Mayor. In
Scotland the presiding officer of the district
council of each of the four cities is called the
Lord Provost. No specific title is laid down
for those of other councils; some are known
as conveners, while others continue to use
the old title of ‘provost’.
Councillors are elected for four years. All
county councils in England and Wales,
London borough councils, and about two-
thirds of non-metropolitan district councils
are elected in their entirety every four years.
In the remaining districts (including all
metropolitan districts) one-third of the
councillors are elected in each of the three
years between county council elections. In
Scotland local elections are held every two
years, alternately for districts and for regions
and islands authorities. Each election covers
the whole council so that councillors are
elected for four years at a time.
Anyone is entitled to vote at a local
government election in Britain provided he
or she is:
• aged 18 years or over;
• is a citizen of Britain or another
Commonwealth country, or a citizen of
the Irish Republic;
• is not subject to any legal incapacity; and
• is on the electoral register.
To qualify for registration a person must
be resident in the council area on the
qualifying date. In Northern Ireland there
are slightly different requirements.
A candidate for election as councillor
normally stands as a representative of one of
the national political parties, although there
are some independent candidates, and some
represent local interests. Candidates must be
British citizens, other Commonwealth
citizens or citizens of the Irish Republic, and
aged 21 or over. In addition, they must either:
• be registered as local electors in the area
of the local authority to which they seek
election; or
• have lived in or occupied (as owner or
tenant) land or other premises in that
area during the whole of the 12 months
preceding the day on which they are
nominated as candidates; or,
57
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• have had their main or only place of
work in the area throughout this 12-
month period.
No one may be elected to a council of
which he or she is an employee, and there
are some other disqualifications. All
candidates for district council elections in
Northern Ireland are required to make a
declaration against terrorism.
Counties in England and Wales are
divided into electoral divisions, each
returning one councillor. Districts in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland are
divided into ‘wards’, returning one councillor
or more. In Scotland the electoral areas in
the regions and islands areas are called
electoral divisions, each returning a single
member; the districts are divided into wards,
similarly returning a single member. For
parish or community council elections in
England and Wales, each parish or
community, or ward of a parish or
community, elects one member or more.
The procedure for local government
voting in Great Britain is similar to that for
parliamentary elections. In Northern Ireland
local government elections are held on the
basis of proportional representation, and
electoral wards are grouped into district
electoral areas.
Functions and Services
In England county councils are responsible
for strategic planning, transport planning,
highways, traffic regulation, education,
consumer protection, refuse disposal, police,
the fire service, libraries and the personal
social services. District councils are
responsible, for instance, for environmental
health, housing, decisions on most local
planning applications, and refuse collection.
They may also provide off-street car parks
subject to the consent of the county council.
Both tiers of local authority have powers to
provide facilities like museums, art galleries
and parks; arrangements depend on local
agreement.
In the metropolitan counties the district
councils are responsible for all services apart
from the police, the fire service and public
transport and, in some areas, waste
regulation and disposal (see p 56). In Greater
London the boroughs and the City
Corporation have similar functions but
London’s metropolitan police force is
directly responsible to the Home Secretary.
Responsibility for public transport lies with
London Transport.
In Wales the division of functions
between county and district councils is much
the same as that between county and district
councils in non-metropolitan areas of
England.
Local authorities in England and Wales
may arrange for any of their functions to be
carried out on their behalf by another local
authority, other than those relating to
education, police, the personal social services
and national parks.
In Scotland the functions of regional and
district authorities are divided up in a similar
way to the counties and districts in England
and Wales. Because of their isolation from
the mainland, Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles have single, virtually all¬
purpose authorities; they take part in wider-
scale administration for their police and fire
services, however, and rely on the mainland
for assistance in the more specialised aspects
of education and social work.
In Northern Ireland local environmental
and certain other services, such as leisure
and the arts, are administered by the district
councils. Responsibility for planning, roads,
water supply and sewerage services is
exercised in each district through a divisional
office of the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland. Area boards,
responsible to central departments,
administer education, public libraries and the
health and personal services locally. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive,
responsible to the Department of the
Environment, administers housing.
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
Local authorities have considerable freedom
to make arrangements for carrying out their
duties. The main policies are decided by the
full council; other matters concerning the
various services are the responsibility of
58
GOVERNMENT
committees composed of members of the
council. A council may delegate to a
committee or officer any function except
those concerned with raising loans, levying
local taxes or making financial demands on
other local authorities liable to contribute.
These powers are legally reserved to the
council as a whole. Some councils have
policy advisory or co-ordinating committees
which originate policy for implementation by
the full council. The powers and duties of
local authority committees are usually laid
down in formal standing orders. Parish and
community councils in England and Wales
are often able to do their work in full
session, although they appoint committees
from time to time as necessary.
Following an independent inquiry into the
conduct of local authority business,
legislation was passed in 1989 to strengthen
the democratic functioning of local
authorities. Under its provisions, committees
have to reflect the political composition of
the council. In England and Wales people
who are not members of the council may be
appointed to decision-making committees
and are able to speak and take part in
debates; they cannot normally vote. The
legislation also prevents senior officers and
others in politically sensitive posts from
being members of another local authority or
undertaking public political activity. Some of
these provisions have not been introduced in
Northern Ireland.
Public Access
The public (including the press) are
admitted to council, committee and sub¬
committee meetings, and have a right of
access to agendas, reports and minutes of
meetings and certain background papers.
Local authorities may exclude the public
from meetings and withhold these papers
only in limited circumstances specified by
legislation.
Officers and Employees
Almost 3 million people are employed by
local authorities in Great Britain. These
include administrative, professional and
technical staff, teachers, firefighters, those
engaged on law and order services, and
manual workers.
Nearly half of all local government
workers are employed in the education
service.
Although a few appointments must be
made by all the authorities responsible for
the functions concerned, councils are
individually responsible within national
policy requirements for determining the size
and duties of their workforces. In Northern
Ireland each council must by law appoint a
clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three
kinds: heads of departments or chief officers;
administrative, professional, clerical and
technical staff; and manual workers. Senior
staff appointments are usually made on the
recommendation of the committee or
committees involved. Most junior appoint¬
ments are made by heads of departments,
who are also responsible for engaging manual
workers. Pay and conditions of service are
generally a matter for each council, although
there are scales recommended by national
negotiating machinery between authorities
and trade unions.
Authorities differ in the degree to which
they employ their own permanent staff to
carry out certain functions or use private
firms under contract. The Government’s
policy of promoting value for money is
encouraging the use of private firms where
savings can be made. Authorities are
required to expose to competition the
following services: refuse collection, street
cleaning, school and general catering, vehicle
maintenance, ground maintenance and
building cleaning, sport and leisure
management, construction and building
maintenance and highways work.
Local Authority Finance
In the past 30 years or so the gradual
expansion of local government led to a steady
rise in local government expenditure which
now accounts for about a quarter of public
spending. The Government has sought to
59
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
check this growth as part of a general policy
of controlling the growth of public
expenditure. Under the community charge
system, introduced in 1990-91, the
Government has the power to restrain
excessive budgets by setting caps or
maximum limits.
In 1990-91 expenditure by local
authorities in Britain amounted to £57,300
million, over one-quarter of general
government expenditure. Current
expenditure amounted to £46,800 million,
and capital expenditure, net of capital
receipts, was £5,300 million and debt
interest £5,200 million.
System of Finance
Local authorities in Great Britain raise
revenue through a community charge, which
is set by each charging local authority and
payable by almost all resident adults. There
is also a grant system, which compensates for
differences in the cost of providing a
standard level of service between authorities.
Finally, in England and in Wales, there are
uniform business rates (single rates per
pound of rateable value of business property
applying throughout England and throughout
Wales), the proceeds of which are distributed
to authorities in proportion to the number of
people registered to pay the community
charge. In Scotland progress is being made
towards a uniform business rate. In Northern
Ireland there is, instead of the community
charge, a system of domestic rates (local
property taxes).
In 1991 the Government announced a
change in the balance between central and
local financing of local authority expenditure.
Local domestic taxpayers would in future be
asked to meet a reduced proportion of such
expenditure. In the longer term the
community charge would be replaced by a
council tax, payable by every household. The
new system could be in place in 1993-94.
Current Expenditure
In 1990-91 education accounted for 44 per
cent of local authorities’ current expenditure
in England, Scotland and Wales. Most of the
remainder was spent on roads and transport;
housing and other environmental services;
law, order and protective services; and
personal social services.
Capital Expenditure
Local government capital expenditure is
financed primarily by borrowing and from
capital receipts from the disposal of land and
buildings. These sources are supplemented
mainly by capital grants and contributions
from central government.
Control of Finance
Local councils normally have a finance
committee to keep their financial policy
under constant review. Their annual
accounts must be audited by independent
auditors appointed by the Audit Commission
in England and Wales, or by the
Commission for Local Authority Accounts in
Scotland. In Northern Ireland this role is
exercised by a local government audit section
appointed by the Department of the
Environment for Northern Ireland.
Local Government Complaints System
Citizens’ allegations of injustice resulting
from local government maladministration
may be investigated by independent statutory
Commissions for Local Administration. The
English Commission has three local
commissioners (or local ombudsmen) and the
Welsh, one. In Scotland there is a single
commissioner.
A report is issued on each complaint
investigated and, if injustice caused by
maladministration is found, the local
ombudsman normally suggests a remedy.
The council must consider the report and
tell the commissioner what action it proposes
to take.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for
Complaints deals with complaints alleging
injustices suffered as a result of
maladministration by district councils and
certain other public bodies.

Overseas Relations
Britain’s main foreign policy objectives are to
maintain its security and prosperity through
global peace and economic growth.
It has worldwide interests, including
responsibility for 14 dependent territories
and for 6 million British citizens who live
overseas. It imports over one-third of its food
and over one-half of its raw materials. Exports
account for over a quarter of gross national
product (GNP). Britain’s overseas investments
are among the largest in the world.
Britain believes that its security and
economic interests can best be protected by
working with other countries. It has
diplomatic or consular relations with 168
countries and is a member of some 120
international organisations, including the
United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO) and the European
Community (EC).
Britain has close links with many
developing countries, notably within the
Commonwealth, which links 50 independent
countries. Commonwealth members have a
language in common and close professional,
academic and commercial ties. In all, Britain
provides development assistance to over 120
independent countries as well as to its
dependencies.
Britain also has strong links with the
United States, including a common language
and similar political and cultural traditions.
Administration
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary
is responsible for the conduct of overseas
relations. He is supported by four Ministers
of State and the staff of the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office (FCO).
Britain has embassies and high
commissions in nearly 130 countries and
missions at ten international organisations.
Other posts include consulates-general and
consulates. All are staffed by members of the
Diplomatic Service and locally engaged
people. About 30 per cent of staff are
involved in commercial work, 24 per cent in
consular services, 18 per cent in political and
economic work and 9 per cent in
information. Other departments concerned
with overseas relations include the Ministry
of Defence, the Department of Trade and
Industry, the Treasury and the Overseas
Development Administration (ODA), which
is part of the FCO.
When other departments are involved, the
FCO makes policy in consultation with them.
The department with the main interest usually
takes the lead, particularly in European
Community matters and international
economic policy. The FCO co-ordinates EC
policy through the Cabinet Office.
The British Overseas Trade Board and
the ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department) provide export services to
industry.
Crown Agents helps to arrange purchases
from British aid funds; it also provides
purchasing and management services to
overseas governments and institutions.
The British Council
The principal agent for British cultural
relations overseas is the British Council
which is represented in 90 countries. Its
main activities are:
• helping people to study and train in
Britain;
• enabling British specialists to teach in
other countries;
• teaching English and promoting its use;
• the provision of library and information
services in other countries;
• the promotion of British education,
science and technology; and
61
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• financing overseas tours by British
theatre and dance companies, orchestras
and authors.
The Council is financed partly by a grant
from the FCO. Another important source of
income is the training and education
programmes organised by the Council on
behalf of the ODA and the FCO. The
Council’s own earnings bring in about a
quarter of its income.
Membership of the
European Community
Britain is an active member of the European
Community. The 1957 Treaty of Rome sets
out the Community’s objectives, which are to
establish:
• a common internal market and closer
union between the peoples of Europe;
• common economic and trade policies;
and
• a framework of Community law.
The 12 member states have agreed to
complete the free internal market by the end
of 1992. The Community, which acts for
member states in international trade
negotiations, accounts for a fifth of world
trade.
Half of Britain’s trade is with the other
member states of the European
Community.
Overseas countries having special links
with the Community are accorded
preferential treatment in aid and the
development of trade.
Community Institutions
Council of Ministers
Policy decisions are taken by the Council of
Ministers, on which member states are
represented by ministers. Most Council
decisions are taken on the basis of a proposal
made by the European Commission.
Depending on the treaty article being used,
some may be decided by majority or
qualified majority, with votes weighted
according to each country’s size. In other
cases the Council proceeds on the basis of
The European Community
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
unanimity. The Single European Act 1986
provided for increased use of qualified
majority voting, particularly on internal
market measures.
Heads of Government usually meet twice
a year as the European Council, which
discusses Community policies and world
affairs generally and provides guidance on
major issues.
European Commission
The European Commission puts forward
policy proposals, executes decisions taken by
the Council of Ministers and ensures that
Community rules are correctly observed. It is
composed of 17 Commissioners (two from
Britain), nominated by member governments
and appointed by common agreement, and is
pledged to act independently of national or
sectional interests.
European Parliament
The 518 members of the European
Parliament are directly elected by the people
in member states at five-yearly intervals; 81
members come from Britain. Members sit
in party political groups and not national
ones. The most recent election took place in
1989.
The Parliament is consulted on a wide
range of issues before final decisions are
taken by the Council of Ministers. The
Single European Act 1986 increased the
Parliament’s legislative powers. On certain
proposed legislation, such as that relating to
the internal market, it can voice an opinion
on the Commission’s proposal and on the
common position adopted by the Council of
Ministers. The latter is done at a second
reading, which allows Parliament to make
amendments. The Commission then
reconsiders the proposal and may take
account of the Parliament’s amendments
before the Council makes a final decision.
There is a strict timetable on these
consultation procedures in order to speed
decision making.
The Parliament adopts the Community’s
annual budget in agreement with the
Council.
New applications for Community
membership must receive the assent of an
absolute majority of the Parliament, as must
the conclusion of agreements establishing an
association with other countries involving
reciprocal agreements.
The Commission can be removed from
office as a whole by a two-thirds majority of
all members of the Parliament in a vote of
censure. Members may also put questions to
the Council of Ministers and the
Commission.
Court of Justice
The Court of Justice, consisting of 13
judges, adjudicates on the meaning of the
treaties and on any measures taken by the
Council of Ministers and the Commission. It
also hears complaints and appeals brought by
or against Community institutions, member
states or individuals and gives preliminary
rulings on cases referred by courts in the
member states. It is the final authority on
Community law.
There is also a Court of First Instance,
created to relieve the Court of Justice of
some of its workload.
Court of Auditors
The Court of Auditors examines all
Community revenue and expenditure to see
that it has been legally received and spent,
and to ensure sound financial management.
Policy Implementation
Community policies are implemented by:
• regulations which are legally binding on
all member states;
• directives which are binding on member
states to which they are addressed but
which allow national authorities to
decide on methods of implementation;
• decisions which are binding on those to
whom they are addressed such as
member states, firms or individuals; and
• recommendations and opinions which
have no binding force.
63
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Council of Ministers can also
indicate a general policy direction through
resolutions.
Intergovernmental Conferences
Two intergovernmental conferences are
considering economic and monetary union
and reform of the Community’s political
institutions. Work began in December
1990 and this is expected to conclude in
December 1991. Britain is taking an active
part.
Finance
The Community is financed by:
• a system of levies on agricultural
imports;
• customs duties;
• contributions from member states based
on value added tax (VAT) levied on a
harmonised base; and
• contributions from member states based
on gross national product (GNP).
These are known as ‘own resources’.
When it first joined the Community,
Britain made a net contribution to the
Community substantially in excess of that
justified by its share of GNP. Following
negotiations to put this right, Britain has
received since 1984 an annual abatement ot
its contribution equal to two-thirds of the
gap between its share of VAT contributions
and its share of expenditure in the previous
year.
Internal Policies
The Single Market
In Britain’s view, completion of a genuine
single market for goods and services should
reduce business costs and stimulate increased
efficiency.
The Single European Act commits
member states to establish a genuine single
market by the end of 1992, and 70 per cent
of the programme is now agreed. It covers,
for example, the liberalisation of capital
movements, the mutual recognition of
professional qualifications and the opening
up of public procurement markets.
Britain’s current priorities include achieving
further progress in the liberalisation of
financial services, public procurement and
transport.
Transport
Britain fully supports the further
liberalisation of transport in the Community,
for example the 1988 regulation to remove
quotas on the movement of road haulage
between member states by 1993 and a 1991
regulation increasing access to the market for
air cargo operators licensed by member
states. Britain is pressing for more
competition in transport. The completion of
the Channel Tunnel in 1993 will improve
Britain’s links with other member states.
Monetary Policy
Britain is a full participant in the European
Monetary System, which consists of an
exchange rate mechanism (ERM), the
European Currency Unit (ECU) and
enlarged short- and medium-term credit
facilities. The ECU is based on a ‘basket’ of
the Community currencies, the value of
which is recalculated daily.
In 1989 the European Council approved
the first stage of a plan for Economic and
Monetary Union (EMU) drawn up by a
committee of governors of central banks.
This stage, implementation of which began
in July 1990, envisages:
• improved economic and monetary policy
co-ordination;
• the completion of the single market;
• the strengthening of competition policy;
and
• all member states joining the ERM on
equal terms.
Britain is fully committed to stage one but
has some reservations about full monetary
union.
During Community discussions on
monetary policy, Britain has suggested the
creation of a European Monetary Fund
64
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
(EMF) to manage the ERM, to co¬
ordinate exchange rate intervention with
external currencies and to promote use of
the ECU. Britain believes that the Fund
could issue ECU bank notes for general
circulation alongside member states’
currencies, backed by EMF holdings of
various Community currencies.
Research and Development
Community industrial collaboration is
promoted primarily through a five-year
Framework Programme for the period
between 1990 and 1994, which defines
priorities and sets out the overall level of
funding.
British firms and other organisations
have secured about 20 per cent of the
funding and participate in between 50 per
cent and 80 per cent of funded projects,
depending on subject area; this gives good
access to the results of the research.
The British Government played a large
role in negotiations on the current
Programme by ensuring that its objectives
reflect the needs of British industry and
that they complement other national and
international programmes. British industry
is expected to receive some £100 million
from Community funds in 1991.
Under the current Programme, priority
is being given to information technology
(ESPRIT), telecommunications (RACE)
and industrial materials and technologies
(BRITE/EURAM). However, there are
other important programmes covering the
environment, biotechnology, agriculture,
health and energy, along with new
funding for the application of information
technology—the Telematics programme.
There is also a scheme for the exchange of
researchers.
Together with a number of other
European states and the European
Commission, Britain participates in the
EUREKA initiative, which encourages
projects in high technology. EUREKA is
concerned with the commercial
exploitation of research and development
and with removing barriers to commercial
success.
Structural Funds
The main objectives of the Community’s
three Structural Funds, administered by the
Commission, are to:
• promote economic development in
poorer regions;
• convert regions seriously affected by
industrial decline;
• combat long-term unemployment;
• find jobs for young people; and
• promote development in rural areas.
Infrastructure projects and productive
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and
employment measures for the long-term
unemployed and young people. The
European Agricultural Guidance Fund
supports agricultural restructuring and some
rural development measures.
Other Community programmes aim to
assist the development of new economic
activities in regions affected by the
restructuring of the steel and coal industries.
In 1990 Britain received 15 per cent of
lending within the Community by the
European Investment Bank. As a non-profit-
making institution, the Bank lends at
competitive interest rates to public and
private capital projects. Lending is directed
towards:
• less favoured regions;
• transport infrastructure;
• protection of the environment; and
• improving industrial competitiveness.
The Bank also provides loans to small and
medium-sized enterprises.
Employment and Social Affairs
Britain believes that Community social policy
should concentrate on creating new jobs by
encouraging competition within the internal
market. The Government fully supports
Community action on such issues as health
and safety, equal opportunities and freedom
of movement.
65
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Environment
Community environment policy is concerned
with such issues as water and air pollution
and the disposal of wastes. A regulation
establishing the European Environment
Agency was adopted by the Community in
1990; this is designed to bring together
environmental information from existing
bodies for the use of member states and the
Commission.
In 1988 Britain and its Community
partners agreed to reduce emissions of
sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide from
power stations, refineries and other industrial
plants and to set stringent emission standards
for new plants. Sulphur dioxide emissions
are to be reduced by 60 per cent of 1980
levels by 2003, and nitrogen oxide emissions
by 30 per cent of 1980 levels by 1998.
Member states are also taking action on
car exhaust pollution; under these measures
emissions of nitrogen oxide, carbon
monoxide and hydrocarbons from each new
car are being reduced by about 60 per cent.
In addition, lead-free petrol is widely
available throughout the Community.
In 1987 the Community signed the
Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention
for Protection of the Ozone Layer. In June
1990 an international conference in London,
attended by nearly 60 developed and
developing countries, agreed to phase out
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by 2000. It also
agreed to phase out halons by 2000, except
for agreed essential uses. Controls on other
ozone-depleting chemicals—carbon
tetrachloride and methyl chloroform—were
also agreed; the use of the former will be
phased out completely by 2000 and the latter
by 2005. Britain believes that CFCs should
be banned by 1997 and is pressing the
Community to ensure that member states do
this.
At the Third North Sea Conference in
1990, Britain, six other Community member
states, Norway and Sweden agreed to phase
out and destroy all remaining identifiable
uses of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by
1999, to end incineration at sea by 1991 and
to protect wildlife such as dolphins and
porpoises. The Community has banned the
import of harp and hooded seal pup skins
and products. In June 1989 Britain banned
imports of ivory from the African elephant,
as did the Community in August 1989.
Agriculture
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is
designed to secure food supply and to
stabilise markets. It has also, however,
created overproduction and unwanted food
surpluses, placing an increasing burden on
the Community budget.
Britain is one of the main advocates of
reform of the CAP. In 1988 it persuaded its
partners to agree a limit on overall
agricultural spending and measures under
which automatic cuts are made in prices for
a commodity if agreed production levels are
exceeded. Britain is insisting on maintaining
CAP budgetary discipline and wants more
CAP reform.
Fisheries
Britain has a particular interest in the control
of Community fishing, since a sizeable
proportion of the total Community catch
comes from British waters. It therefore takes
an active role in Community fisheries policy
negotiations on:
• access to coastal waters;
• conservation of fish stocks;
• the allocation of quotas among member
states within each year’s total allowable
catch;
• enforcement; and
• measures to promote the adaptation and
development of the Community’s fishing
fleet.
Political Co-operation
Member states form common positions on
foreign policy questions. As the result of a
British initiative, the Single European Act
placed this political co-operation on a treaty
basis. Member states are considering how to
move towards a common foreign and security
policy to replace political co-operation.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union
The twelve member states have welcomed
the establishment of democracy in former
Communist-ruled states in Central and
Eastern Europe and the political and
economic reforms in the Soviet Union.
They are committed to helping these states
in the change from centrally planned
economies to market economies. The
Twelve have welcomed the return to
constitutional rule following the attempted
coup in the Soviet Union in August 1991.
They also recognised the independence of
the Baltic states. The Twelve have also
co-operated in the search for a peaceful
solution to the crisis in Yugoslavia. They
favour a secure and stable balance of forces
in Europe at lower levels.
The Middle East
Community member states believe that a
lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute
should be based on UN Security Council
resolutions 242 and 338, which call for
Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied
in 1967 in exchange for security within
guaranteed borders. The Twelve support
the right of the Palestinian people to self-
determination and the convening of a
properly prepared international peace
conference on the Middle East when the
time is right. The Community has a
development programme for the Arab
territories occupied by Israel in 1967 and
has adopted measures to allow direct exports
of agricultural and industrial products from
them to the Community market.
The Twelve condemned Iraq’s invasion
of Kuwait in August 1990 and urged Iraq to
comply with UN Security Council
resolution 660 calling for a withdrawal of its
troops. They supported all subsequent
Security Council resolutions against Iraq,
including the imposition of economic
sanctions and the authorisation of force to
achieve Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
Britain and France contributed ground,
sea and air forces to a coalition led by the
United States and Saudi Arabia which
expelled Iraq from Kuwait in 1991 when
peaceful means failed to secure Iraq’s
withdrawal. Other member states contributed
warships or aircraft to this effort.
South Africa
The Twelve have welcomed reforms in
South Africa which have abolished the core
of statutory racial discrimination. The major
changes announced since February 1990 have
met many of the demands the Twelve have
made, notably the release of Mr Nelson
Mandela and other political prisoners, the
lifting of the ban on the African National
Congress and other organisations and the
repeal of apartheid legislation. Regular
meetings have taken place between
representatives of the South African
Government and the African National
Congress. The Twelve have supported this
process and expressed the hope that full
constitutional negotiations may begin soon.
To encourage more reforms and to help
prevent the process being undermined by
economic recession, the Twelve have lifted
their 1986 ban on new investment and
decided in principle to lift the bans on
imports of iron and steel and gold coins. The
Community has also substantially increased
aid programmes to assist the victims of
apartheid.
There is a voluntary code of conduct for
EC companies with subsidiaries in South
Africa which aims to improve conditions for
black employees.
Terrorism and Crime
Member states have sought to act jointly
against the threat posed by international and
other terrorism. They have agreed not to
export arms or other military equipment to
countries clearly implicated in supporting
terrorist activity and to take steps to prevent
such material being diverted for terrorist
purposes.
The Twelve believe that there should be
no concessions made under duress to
terrorists or their sponsors and that every
effort should be made to prevent terrorism
and to bring the guilty to justice. Counter¬
terrorist measures include a secure
67
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
communications link between police forces
and arrangements for regular assessments
and analyses of terrorist threats to member
states.
Regular meetings of ministers responsible
for criminal justice take place to discuss
common measures directed at terrorists and
other criminals. Britain believes that, with
the completion of the single market in 1992,
some frontier checks will need to be retained
to ensure that such people do not enjoy
unlimited freedom to move throughout the
Community.
Measures against Drug Trafficking
The Twelve attach great importance to co¬
operation against drug trafficking.
Discussions on law enforcement,
international co-operation, assistance to
developing countries, education and health
take place regularly. A committee co¬
ordinates anti-drugs work within the
Community and the international aspects are
dealt with by a political co-operation working
group. Member states fully support the work
of the United Nations in combating drug
abuse. They also participate in regular
meetings of the Council of Europe’s
Pompidou Group, which is concerned with
anti-drugs measures. In June 1990 member
states decided to set up a European drugs
intelligence unit.
Trade
Under the Treaty of Rome, the European
Commission negotiates on behalf of the
Community in major international trade
negotiations. The Community is seeking to
extend the world open trading system on
which member states depend for future
growth and jobs and to defend the interests
of its members against protectionist
measures.
One of the Community’s priorities is the
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round
of trade negotiations launched in 1986. The
negotiations seek to:
• strengthen the rules and disciplines of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT);
• liberalise trade in services and
investment;
• improve protection of intellectual
property;
• negotiate multilateral tariff reductions;
and
• establish a fair and market-oriented
system for agricultural trade.
The Community is negotiating an
agreement with the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) under which the
common internal market would be extended
to EFTA members in January 1993.
The Community has association and co¬
operation agreements with all countries with
a Mediterranean coastline (except Albania
and Libya) and with Jordan; these give
preferential access to Community markets.
Non-preferential co-operation agreements
have also been made with individual
countries in South Asia and Latin America
as well as with the People’s Republic of
China, the Association of South East Asian
Nations, the Andean Pact and the Central
American states. Trade relations with the
developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean
and the Pacific are governed by the Lome
Conventions (see p 80). Trade and co¬
operation agreements have been signed with
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.
Building on these, association agreements are
being negotiated with Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Poland.
The Community’s Generalised System of
Preferences grants tariff-free access to the
Community market for most industrial goods
from developing countries and varying
degrees of preferential access for their
agricultural produce (mainly processed) and
textiles. The scheme concentrates benefits on
the poorer producers and countries. Very few
categories of exports from the more
competitive producers are excluded.
The Commonwealth
The Commonwealth is a voluntary
association of 50 independent states with a
combined population of some 1,300 million,
68
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
nearly a quarter of the world total.
Commonwealth members include some of
the richest and poorest nations of the world
community and also some of the largest and
smallest. Their peoples are drawn from
practically all the world’s main races, from
all continents and from many faiths. Britain
participates fully in all Commonwealth
activities.
The members are Antigua and Barbuda,
Australia, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados,
Belize, Botswana, Britain, Brunei, Canada,
Cyprus, Dominica, The Gambia, Ghana,
Grenada, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya,
Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia,
Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Namibia,
Nauru, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Papua New Guinea, Saint Christopher and
Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,
Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and
Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Western
Samoa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Nauru and
Tuvalu are special members, entitled to take
part in all Commonwealth meetings and
activities, with the exception of
Commonwealth Heads of Government
meetings.
The Queen is recognised as head of the
Commonwealth; she is also head of State in
17 of these countries.
Nearly all the Commonwealth countries
were British territories to which
independence was gradually granted, starting
with the older territories such as Australia,
Canada and New Zealand where European
settlement had occurred on a large scale. The
modern Commonwealth, comprising
republics and national monarchies as well as
monarchies under the Queen, became
possible when it was agreed in 1949 that
India, on becoming a republic, could
continue to be a member. Since then, almost
all of Britain’s former dependent territories
have attained their independence and have
voluntarily joined the Commonwealth.
Consultation
Consultation between Commonwealth
member states takes place through:
• meetings of heads of Government;
• specialised conferences of other ministers
and officials;
• diplomatic representatives known as high
commissioners;
• non-governmental organisations; and
• other international discussions.
Heads of Government meet every two
years. Proceedings are held in private,
facilitating a frank and informal exchange of
views on international issues. No votes are
taken, decisions being reached by consensus.
Common views are set out in the
communiques issued at the end of the
meetings. Occasionally, separate declarations
are made on particular issues.
The apartheid system in South Africa has
been a major concern for Commonwealth
countries for many years. Now that apartheid
is being abolished, Britain hopes that the
Commonwealth will join in building the new
society by helping to restore growth to the
South African economy, and by drawing on
the Commonwealth’s experience with
education and training programmes. Britain
would support any application by the post¬
apartheid South Africa to rejoin the
Commonwealth.
The Commonwealth has expressed
concern about the security and development
of the many small states among its members.
Britain supports regional co-operation and
provides economic aid and technical
assistance. It is also British policy to consult
with other Commonwealth states in the event
of aggression against small member nations
and to involve the UN Security Council
where appropriate.
The Commonwealth Secretariat
The Commonwealth Secretariat promotes
consultation and co-operation, disseminates
information on matters of common concern,
and organises heads of Government meetings,
ministerial meetings and other conferences.
It also administers the Commonwealth Fund
for Technical Co-operation. Because of its
neutral position the Secretariat has been able
to make its good offices available in cases of
69
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
dispute and has carried out, on request,
special assignments requiring demonstrable
impartiality. The Secretariat is financed by
all member governments on an agreed scale,
with Britain contributing 30 per cent of the
total.
The Secretary General is elected by
Commonwealth Heads of Government.
Technical Co-operation
Britain contributes 30 per cent of the income
of the Commonwealth Fund for Technical
Co-operation, which provides technical
assistance for economic and social
development in Commonwealth developing
countries. The Fund helps to raise levels of
technical, industrial, managerial and other
skills, and makes wide use of expertise and
training facilities within developing member
countries for the benefit of other developing
countries. It promotes industrial and
export market development in poor
countries.
Expenditure by Britain on bilateral
technical co-operation with Commonwealth
developing countries in 1990 was £20\
million, the greater part being spent on
financing staff for service with
Commonwealth governments and in funding
training places in Britain. The British
Government also finances students from
Commonwealth developing countries. Other
assistance includes sending volunteers to
serve overseas, consultancy services, the
supply of training and research equipment,
and advice given by British scientific and
technical institutions. (About 70 per cent
of Britain’s gross bilateral aid goes to
Commonwealth countries, including Britain’s
remaining dependencies—see below).
Commonwealth Organisations
Commonwealth Foundation
The Commonwealth Foundation, financed
by member governments, promotes closer
co-operation among professional and other
non-governmental organisations within the
Commonwealth. It has assisted over 30
Commonwealth professional associations.
and has helped in the creation and growth
of many national ones; it has also supported
16 multidisciplinary professional centres.
It is encouraging the strengthening of
information links through the establishment
of liaison units in each Commonwealth
country.
The Commonwealth Institute
The Commonwealth Institute in London
promotes the Commonwealth, its countries
and its peoples to the British public. Funded
mainly by the British Government, it has
galleries of permanent exhibitions and a
changing programme of temporary
exhibitions, conferences and performances.
Its education service runs an extensive
programme of teaching about the
Commonwealth in schools around Britain. A
wide range of books and other materials can
be borrowed.
The Commonwealth Trust
The Commonwealth Trust is a centre for
study and discussion, its library in London
housing one of the largest collections on the
Commonwealth. The Trust has branches in
many countries.
Other Organisations
Many unofficial organisations, professional
bodies and voluntary societies are vehicles
for co-operation. They include the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association,
which organises an annual conference of
parliamentarians, the Commonwealth Press
Union, the Association of Commonw ealth
Universities, the Commonwealth Games
Federation and the English Speaking Union
of the Commonwealth.
DEPENDENCIES
Britain’s 14 dependent territories have a
combined population of about 6 million, of
whom 5 8 million live in Hong Kong. Most
territories have considerable self-government,
with their own legislature and civil service.
70
ARCHITECTURE
Embankment Place is an
office development which
utilises the ‘air rights’
above the railway tracks
at Charing Cross Station,
London. Most of the
superstructure hangs
from arches assembled at
roof level.
The international
passenger terminal at
Stansted .Airport in Essex
was officially op'ened by
the Queen in March 1991.
Inside, 36 columns
support lightweight roof
domes with triangular
window s, allowing
maximum dayhght. Each
column houses heating,
fighting and
air-conditioning and is
the site for passenger
information.

OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Britain is generally responsible for defence,
internal security and foreign affairs. The
territories are:
• Anguilla;
• Bermuda;
• British Antarctic Territory;
• British Indian Ocean Territory;
• British Virgin Islands;
• Cayman Islands;
• Falkland Islands;
• Gibraltar;
• Hong Kong;
• Montserrat;
• Pitcairn, Ducie, Henderson and
Oeno;
• St Helena and St Helena Dependencies
(Ascension and Tristan da Cunha);
• South Georgia and the South Sandwich
Islands; and
• Turks and Caicos Islands.
Few are rich in natural resources, and
some are scattered groups of islands. There
are no permanent inhabitants in the British
Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean
Territory, South Georgia or the South
Sandwich Islands.
Britain’s policy is to give independence to
those dependencies that want it and where it
is practicable to do so.
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina but the
inhabitants wish to retain the link with
Britain. The Government is committed to
the defence of the Islanders’ right to live
under a government of their own choosing.
The Islanders’ right of self-determination is
set out in the 1985 Falkland Islands
Constitution.
Gibraltar is the subject of a territorial
claim by Spain. Britain wishes to see the
development of practical co-operation
between Gibraltar and Spain to the benefit
of both peoples and remains committed to
honouring the wishes of the people of
Gibraltar as to their future, as set out in the
1969 Gibraltar Constitution.
Hong Kong
In 1984 an agreement was signed between
Britain and the People’s Republic of China
on the future of Hong Kong, which is leased
from China until 1997. Under the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, which was
ratified by the two governments in 1985,
Britain is responsible for the administration
of Hong Kong until 30 June 1997. Hong
Kong will then become a Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China,
but its capitalist system and lifestyle will
remain unchanged for at least 50 years. With
the exception of foreign affairs and defence,
the Hong Kong SAR will enjoy a high
degree of autonomy and its government and
legislature will be composed of Hong Kong
people.
In February 1990 the British Government
announced that the Hong Kong Government
would introduce 18 directly elected seats into
the Legislative Council in 1991. Elections to
these seats took place in September 1991.
The ultimate aim is the election of all
members of the Legislative Council by
universal suffrage.
In April 1990 legislation was passed to
give British citizenship to 50,000 key people
in Hong Kong and their dependants without
their having to leave the territory in order to
qualify. Its purpose is to persuade these
people to remain in Hong Kong so that the
territory can remain stable and prosperous
up to and beyond 1997.
International Peace and
Security
Britain is pledged to maintain effective
defence while seeking to reduce tension in
the world. Since 1949 its defence has been
based on membership of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), a
defensive alliance based on the principle of
collective security. In July 1990 NATO
members reaffirmed their commitment to
contribute towards the development
of peaceful and friendly international
relations.
71
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
East-West Relations
Britain has welcomed the recent progress
made in East-West relations, the reforms
being made in the Soviet Union, the
recent replacement of Communist
dictatorships by democratically elected
governments in Eastern and Central
Europe, and the unification of Germany.
Britain is committed to increasing its
official and unofficial contacts with the
Soviet Union and the new governments in
Eastern and Central Europe.
Improvements in East—West relations
include the agreement signed by 22
European and North American states in
1990 limiting the number of conventional
weapons in Europe. Others include
greater co-operation on regional issues
for example, Southern Africa and the
improved human rights provisions of the
1989 agreement signed by the countries
participating in the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE).
Economic Assistance
Britain recognises the magnitude of the
task now being undertaken by the Soviet
Union and the new governments in
Central and Eastern Europe in
transforming their centrally planned
economies into market-based ones. The
British Government’s ‘Know How’ Fund
is helping them by providing training in
such areas as management and financial
services, banking and accountancy, and
commercial law. The Fund also finances
the provision of advice on the running of
a free media, democratic political parties
and an independent judiciary. Britain is
also supporting debt-rescheduling schemes
being negotiated by the International
Monetary Fund with several Eastern
European countries. In addition, it is
participating in other multilateral
assistance plans, including World Bank
loans and European Community
agreements liberalising trade, aimed at
encouraging the development of market
economies.
Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe
Britain welcomes the recent and significant
improvements in the implementation of the
provisions of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.
This established a large number of
important political commitments and a code
of behaviour for a more normal and open
relationship between both governments and
peoples in East and West. In order to
achieve these goals, the signatories of the
Final Act made undertakings about
security, respect for human rights, and co¬
operation in economic, humanitarian and
other matters. These commitments were
developed at follow-up meetings, notably
the Vienna meeting in November 1989,
which agreed new commitments on human
rights.
Meeting in Paris in November 1990,
CSCE states agreed to the formal end of
the Cold War. The Charter of Paris for a
New Europe expressed commitment to
democratic principles and to the principle
of enshrining human rights and
fundamental freedoms in a society based on
the rule of law. States also agreed on a
regular pattern of ministerial and summit
meetings, supported by a permanent
secretariat. A conflict prevention centre was
established, as was an office to exchange
information on democratic elections. A
CSCE parliamentary assembly is also being
established.
In June 1991 CSCE states agreed to a
procedure allowing for special meetings to
discuss emergency situations arising from a
violation of one of the principles of the
Final Act or as the result of incidents
endangering peace, security or stability.
These meetings would not require prior
consensus of the participating states.
In 1986 participating states signed the
Stockholm Document on confidence- and
security-building measures designed to
bring about a greater degree of openness
and predictability in military activities. It
provides for advance notification and
observation of planned military manoeuvres
(above specified thresholds) and the
provision of detailed information on their
72
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
purpose and size. Verification takes place in
the form of on-site challenge inspections. In
November 1990 CSCE states endorsed
further measures, including detailed
exchange of information on armed forces.
Arms Control
Together with its NATO allies, Britain is
committed to the search for significant,
balanced and verifiable measures of arms
control. NATO priorities are further
reductions as appropriate in United States
and Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals, an
agreement on short-range nuclear forces in
Europe, a global ban on chemical weapons,
and the elimination of conventional
imbalances in Europe.
Nuclear Weapons
Britain strongly supported talks between the
United States and the Soviet Union which
led to the signature of the strategic arms
reduction talks (START) treaty in July
1991. Britain fully shares the agreed
objective of limiting and reducing nuclear
arms and strengthening strategic stability.
Britain has welcomed the reciprocal
decisions of the United States and the
Soviet Union to eliminate unilaterally some
of their nuclear weapons.
Nuclear Deterrent
Britain’s strategic nuclear deterrent is the
minimum necessary for credible deterrence
and is very small in comparison with Soviet
nuclear forces. It will continue to be a
minimum force even after the replacement
of the submarine-launched Polaris force by
the modernised Trident missile system.
Britain believes that reductions should
first take place in the arsenals of the United
States and the Soviet Union. It does not
exclude the possibility of British
involvement in strategic arms control talks at
some stage. However, even after the
START treaty is implemented, the size of
Britain’s nuclear forces would in no way be
comparable with those of the two
superpowers.
Non-Proliferation
Britain is a party to the 1968 Non-
Proliferation Treaty designed to stop the
spread of nuclear weapons by ensuring that
nuclear materials in non-nuclear-weapon
states are not used for explosive purposes. It
also protects the right of all countries to use
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.
Britain was the first nuclear-weapon
state to conclude a voluntary agreement with
the International Atomic Energy Agency for
the application of safeguards to some
nuclear installations. It has also undertaken
not to use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon states which are parties
to the Treaty or to other internationally
binding commitments not to manufacture or
acquire nuclear explosive devices. This
undertaking would not apply in the case of
an attack on Britain, its dependent
territories, its armed forces or its allies by
such a state in alliance with a nuclear-
weapon state.
Nuclear Tests
Because of the need to preserve nuclear
deterrence, there is a continuing requirement
to conduct underground nuclear tests to
ensure that Britain’s nuclear weapons remain
effective and up to date. Britain has
welcomed the ratification by the United
States and the Soviet Union of the 1974
Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the 1976
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, which
set ceilings on the yield of nuclear tests.
Protocols on verification were signed by both
countries in 1990. A comprehensive test ban
remains a long-term goal, progress on which
is dependent on improving prospects for
effective verification as well as progress
elsewhere in arms control and the attitude of
other states.
Nuclear- Weapon-Free Zones
The Government thinks that the
establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones
in certain parts of the world could contribute
to regional security, to non-proliferation and
to disarmament in general, provided that
73
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
nuclear weapons do not already feature in
the security of the region involved and that
the balance of security is maintained.
Chemical and Biological Weapons
Britain is working towards a comprehensive
and effectively verifiable worldwide ban on
chemical weapons, having abandoned its own
chemical weapons in the late 1950s. The
negotiations for such a treaty take place at
the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva,
where Britain has presented a number of
proposals, particularly, on the question of
verification.
Pending achievement of a global ban,
Britain and some other Western nations have
imposed export controls on certain chemicals
which may be used to produce chemical
weapons in order to curb further
proliferation of such weapons.
The Government has welcomed the US
pledge to destroy all its chemical weapons
stocks within ten years of a convention
entering into force.
Biological weapons are already prohibited
under a 1972 convention.
Conventional Weapons
Conventional weapons are by far the largest
component of national armouries. In 1990
Britain and 21 other states signed an
agreement (the CFE Treaty) covering
reductions in conventional armed forces in
Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals
mountains.
The Treaty is designed to establish a
balance of conventional forces at lower levels,
while eliminating the danger of surprise
attacks. It establishes limits on tanks,
artillery, armoured combat vehicles, attack
helicopters and combat aircraft. In addition,
there is provision for a rigorous and intrusive
verification regime. Britain played a major
role in the negotiations.
The Gulf war demonstrated the danger of
a nation building up an arsenal far beyond its
legitimate defensive requirements. Britain
believes that more openness is needed in this
sphere, and proposed to the European
Council in April the establishment of a UN
register of conventional arms transfers. This
led to the Twelve adopting a declaration in
which they stated that they would table a
UN resolution setting up a register. Britain
believes that this would introduce greater
transparency in the arms trade, allow the
scale of arms build-up in any one country to
be monitored, and discourage destabilising
sales to regions of tension.
Britain and the United
Nations
Britain is fully committed to the principles
of the United Nations and its Charter and
believes that all member states should ensure
that the organisation functions as effectively
as possible to maintain peace, assist
developing countries and protect human
rights and freedoms. Britain is the sixth
largest contributor to the UN budget,
contributing nearly $45 million in 1991.
Keeping the Peace
Britain believes that the United Nations
should seek to resolve disputes which
threaten international peace and stability. As
a permanent member of the Security
Council, Britain has sought to develop and
improve its role in the peaceful settlement of
disputes.
Britain is the major contributor to the
UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus and has
provided logistic support to the UN Interim
Force in Lebanon. It is also contributing
personnel to the United Nations observer
unit set up to monitor a demilitarised zone
between Iraq and Kuwait, following the
expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait early
in 1991 and has sent a contingent of
observers to the western Sahara to participate
in the monitoring operation established there.
Human Rights
Britain has consistently supported United
Nations efforts to promote human rights
through the establishment of internationally
accepted standards. The UN Charter states
74
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
that one purpose of the United Nations is to
achieve international co-operation in
promoting and encouraging respect for
human rights and for fundamental freedoms
for all. Britain believes that human rights are
a legitimate matter for international concern.
UN members pledge themselves to take joint
and separate action in co-operation with the
UN to promote universal respect for, and
observance of, human rights and
fundamental freedoms without distinction as
to race, sex, language or religion.
Fundamental human rights provisions are
set out in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights proclaimed by the General
Assembly in 1948, and in the two
International Covenants (one on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights and the other on
Civil and Political Rights) which impose legal
obligations on those who ratify them and
which came into force in 1976. Britain has
ratified both Covenants.
Britain is also a party to international
conventions on:
• the elimination of racial discrimination;
• the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
• prevention of genocide;
• the abolition of slavery;
• the status of refugees and stateless
persons;
• the political rights of women; and
• consent to marriage.
In 1988 Britain ratified the UN
Convention against Torture, which had been
adopted with British support by the General
Assembly in 1984. Britain has signed the
Convention on the Rights of the Child and
intends to ratify it shortly.
Britain continues to support the idea of
appointing representatives of the UN
Commission on Human Rights to investigate
human rights abuses. In 1991, Britain was
elected to the Commission for a three-year
term starting in 1992.
In 1985 Britain withdrew from the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation (UNESCO). Although Britain
supports the ideals and objectives contained
in UNESCO’s constitution, it has major
doubts about the effectiveness with which
the Organisation has pursued them. After a
detailed review of UNESCO activities,
Britain announced in 1990 that the reforms
carried out were not yet sufficient to merit
rejoining the Organisation. The funds saved
from the withdrawal are allocated to a
number of educational, scientific and cultural
programmes in developing countries.
Britain’s contributions to UN aid
programmes for developing countries are
described on p 79.
Other International
Organisations
Britain is a member of many other
international organisations, including the
International Monetary Fund, established in
1945 (along with the World Bank) to regulate
the international financial system and to
provide a source of credit for member
countries facing balance-of-payments
problems.
Britain is also a member of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), an instrument for
intergovernmental co-operation among 24
industrialised countries. The basic objectives
of the OECD are to promote the economic
growth of its members, to help less
developed countries within and outside its
own membership and to encourage
worldwide trade expansion.
Other organisations to which Britain
belongs or extends support include the
regional development banks in Africa, the
Caribbean, Latin America and Asia and
specialist technical, agricultural and medical
institutions.
Britain is a founder member of the
Council of Europe, which is open to any
European parliamentary democracy accepting
the rule of law and the protection of
fundamental human rights and freedoms.
The 26 member states co-operate on culture,
education, sport, social questions, legal
affairs, health, crime and drug prevention,
youth affairs and the improvement of the
environment.

The Council was responsible for the
adoption in 1950 of the European
Convention on Human Rights, which Britain
was the first to ratify in 1951. Britain
recognises the right of individual petition
and the compulsory jurisdiction of the
European Court of Human Rights.
Development
Co-operation
The British aid programme for poor
countries is designed to reduce poverty and
promote sustainable economic and social
development. Its main objectives include:
• supporting economic reform programmes
which many countries are pursuing;
• promoting more open and accountable
government;
• helping to lessen the pressure of
excessive population growth;
• helping to protect the environment and
conserve natural resources; and
• ensuring that poor people, and in
particular women, share the benefits of
development.
Gross public expenditure on the aid
programme was £1,722 million in 1990.
About 76 per cent of Britain’s bilateral aid is
directed to the poorest countries of the
world. The Overseas Development
Administration (ODA), responsible for
Britain’s aid policy, ensures that aid is
correctly targeted and efficiently
administered. Individual projects are
carefully appraised before approval,
monitored and then assessed on completion.
British aid takes account of the recipient
country’s development priorities, the
activities of other donors and the
contribution that Britain can make in
expertise, goods and services.
Economic Reform and Debt
Rescheduling
Britain has taken a number of measures to
assist the poorest and most heavily indebted
countries pursuing policies of economic
reform. These include:
• the cancellation of about £1,000 million
of old concessional aid loans; and
• the giving of all new aid on grant
terms.
Britain was the first major creditor to
offer debt reduction on non-concessional
debts owed to export credit agencies. This
proposal led to agreement at the 1988
Toronto Economic Summit under which
government creditors offered concessional
debt reschedulings to the poorest countries
pursuing economic reform. Twenty
countries have benefited.
Britain is the largest contributor to the
interest subsidy account of the IMF’s
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility,
which lends on highly concessional terms to
the poorest countries pursuing economic
reforms.
At the Commonwealth Finance Ministers
Meeting in September 1990, Britain
proposed that the debts of the poorest
countries to governments should be reduced
by two-thirds with the balance payable over
25 years. This proposal is still under
discussion.
Wider Effort
Britain’s aid represents part of a wider
Western effort to help developing countries.
In 1990 total net official development
assistance disbursed by the 18 countries
belonging to the OECD’s Development
Assistance Committee amounted to
$54,077 million.
Private Sector
In addition to official aid, the British
private sector provides investment,
technology and management expertise, and
assists the development of indigenous
resources and skills in developing countries.
In 1990 estimated investment by British
companies in developing countries
amounted to £1,500 million. Trade, too, is
important, developing countries providing
over 12 per cent of British imports in 1990.
76
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Official and Other Flows
In 1990 total official flows1 of aid amounted
to some £1,838 million net, of which £1,485
million represented official development
assistance and £353 million other official
flows.
Bilateral Aid
In 1990, about £839 million of gross public
expenditure on overseas aid went to
individual countries. Some 70 per cent of
that directly allocated to countries went to
the Commonwealth and to Britain’s
remaining dependencies. Total aid of £1,042
million was disbursed regionally as follows:
Africa
Asia
Latin America and
the Caribbean
Pacific
Middle East
Europe
Not allocable by continent
£389 million
£312 million
£93 million
£28 million
£18 million
£5 million
£197 million
Major recipients included Bangladesh, India,
Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania,
Mozambique, Pakistan, Uganda and
Indonesia.
Financial Aid
Gross bilateral financial aid in 1990 totalled
£534 million. Aid for individual projects
totalled £385 million. The main sectors
supported were:
• Agriculture, fisheries £63 million
and forestry
• Manufacturing £45 million
• Energy £90 million
1 ‘1 otal official flows’ is an international reporting concept. Its
main component—official development assistance—is defined as
official flows for development purposes with a grant
(concessional) element of 25 per cent or more. The main British
reporting concept is ‘public expenditure on overseas aid’, which
excludes certain British flows which benefit developing countries
but are not considered developmental, and by recording some
contributions to multilateral agencies at a different time. All
concepts can be measured before (gross) or after (net) deducting
capital repayments.
• Mining £37 million
• Transport and
communications £70 million
• Social and community
services £28 million
Other financial aid totalled £150 million;
of this £73 million was for programme aid,
£37 million for debt relief, £21 million for
disaster relief, £12 million for food aid and
£6 million for budgetary aid.
Some 94 per cent of the ODA’s bilateral
financial aid in 1990 was provided in grants.
Development aid to the poorest countries is
on grant terms which also apply to the
majority of recipients of British financial aid.
There are simplified loan terms for those
countries still not qualifying for grants.
Most financial aid—54 per cent in 1990
—is tied to the purchase of goods,
equipment and services from Britain,
although there may be a substantial element
for local costs and foreign content in
contracts financed from tied aid in
appropriate cases. Commitments can be
untied, if the recipient agrees, to enable
goods to be purchased from the poorest
developing countries as well as from Britain.
Aid Projects
More resources (£250 million) are being
committed to the sustainable development of
forestry. Britain is co-operating with Brazil
to solve environmental problems, including
schemes to manage and conserve the Amazon
rain forest.
In 1989 Britain and India signed a £35
million aid agreement to improve primary
education in the state of Andhra Pradesh in
southern India; over 4,000 new classrooms
will be built and over 1,100 teachers’ centres
upgraded, mostly in remote rural areas. It is
also giving £50 million for Indian energy
efficiency projects.
Direct British support is being given to
over 200 community projects and to a private
sector scheme designed to build new, low-
cost owner-occupied homes in South Africa
for the black population. Some £10 million
of British aid was given to independent
Namibia in 1990.
77
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other British projects include:
• a major water and sanitation scheme in
Karachi;
• the building of a power station in south¬
west Pakistan;
• the repair and maintenance of road
bridges in Sierra Leone, Cameroon and
Zaire;
• the rehabilitation of the Limpopo rail
link between Zimbabwe and Maputo in
Mozambique; and
• major repairs to the Maputo power
station.
Aid and Trade Provision
The Aid and Trade Provision is designed to
match the mixed credit practices of other
donors by providing aid in combination with
export credits to support sound investment
projects offering commercial opportunities to
British exporters. Expenditure under this
provision amounted to £74 million in 1990.
Commonwealth Development Corporation
The Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC) is empowered to invest
in Commonwealth developing countries, in
British dependencies and, with ministerial
approval, in other developing countries.
By the end of 1990, the Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) had
total commitments of £1,248 million in
Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin
America, and the Pacific Islands. The
main areas in which CDC investment
took place were:
• Basic development: £391 million;
• Primary production and processing:
£601 million; and
• Industry and commerce: £256
million.
Disaster Relief and Food Aid
Britain responds to disasters throughout the
world by providing food, medical equipment,
blankets, shelters and clothing, power
generators, boats, bridges and other vital
supplies. Britain is setting up an emergency
aid procedure which will allow it to respond
promptly and effectively to disasters.
British emergency aid was sent to Iran in
1990 following a severe earthquake. In sub-
Saharan and southern Africa, Britain
continued its contribution to disaster relief
and food aid to help combat drought and
famine. In addition to its multilateral aid
contributions to UN agencies and the
European Community (see pp 79-80),
Britain gave £129 million in bilateral disaster
relief in 1990. Bilateral and multilateral food
aid by Britain amounted to £123 million.
Many African countries suffering from
famine are also victims of locusts. Britain
and three other countries are financing
research on the biological control of locusts.
Britain also helps refugees and people
displaced by famine, political upheaval, civil
war and invasion. Since 1980, for instance,
over £70 million has been contributed to
assist Afghan refugees. Over £40 million was
given to assist Iraqi refugees after April
1991; British forces were also committed by
the Government to provide a safe haven in
northern Iraq to which many Kurdish
refugees returned.
Technical Co-operation
Expenditure on the transfer of specialised
knowledge and skills was £452 million,
nearly 43 per cent of gross bilateral aid, in
1990. The distribution was as follows:
Expert personnel and £91 million
volunteers
Students and trainees £85 million
Other education and £55 million
training
Consultancy services £78 million
Research and development £35 million
Equipment and supplies £27 million
At the end of 1990 there were nearly 1,500
people financed by Britain (other than
volunteers or consultants) working in
developing countries. In terms of person-
78
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
years worked, 36 per cent were engaged in
education, 19 per cent agriculture and
related areas, and 8 per cent in health
services.
In addition, there were nearly 1,437
volunteers, mainly qualified people with
some relevant work experience, working in
developing countries, about half in education.
Recruitment, training and placing overseas
are undertaken by voluntary bodies. The four
main agencies are the Catholic Institute for
International Relations, International
Voluntary Service, United Nations
Association International Service and
Voluntary Service Overseas. More than 80
per cent of their costs are met by the
Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students
and trainees from developing countries.
Approximately 15,000 were financed in 1990
under a variety of award schemes.
The ODA’s scientific agency, the Natural
Resources Institute, collaborates with
developing countries on increasing the
productivity of their renewable natural
resources. The Government provides support
for many other institutions, including
overseas units/divisions of the Transport and
Road Research Laboratory, the Building
Research Establishment, the British
Geological Survey, the Overseas Surveys
Directorate of the Ordnance Survey, and of
Hydraulics Research Ltd. These
organisations provide specialist information,
advice and experts for service overseas, and
undertake field and laboratory research
investigations.
International Agencies
Some 40 per cent of British aid is channelled
through international agencies.
The United Nations
The UN system is the largest single source
of technical assistance for developing
countries.
In 1990 Britain contributed £20 million to
the World Health Organisation and £9 6
million to the Food and Agriculture
Organisation. British contributions to the
UN’s voluntary funds, which help
developing countries and provide
emergency and relief aid, including help to
refugees, are as follows:
• UN Development £27 0 million
Programme
• UN High Commissioner £19-5 million
for Refugees
• UN Relief and Works £5 6 million
Agency for Palestinian Refugees
• UN Children's Fund £9 3 million
• UN Population Fund £3 0 million
• World Food Programme £4 2 million
Britain is the largest source of expertise
and the second largest of fellowships and
equipment provided under the UN
Development Programme.
Britain encourages the deployment of
UN resources towards the poorest countries
and the poorest communities in the
developing world. It also seeks to promote
the most efficient use of UN development
funds and improvements in the co¬
ordination, control and effectiveness of the
system.
World Bank Group
Britain is a major subscriber to the World
Bank group of institutions which includes
the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development and the International
Development Association (IDA).
The resources of the IDA, which
provides interest-free loans to developing
countries unable to service loans on
conventional terms, are replenished at
three-year intervals. The British
commitment to its Ninth Replenishment,
covering the three years starting in 1991, is
£619 million towards a total of US$17,000
million.
Britain has welcomed the creation by the
International Monetary Fund of facilities to
provide special assistance to developing
countries experiencing financial or trading
difficulties.
79
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
European Community
Almost half of British multilateral aid goes
to European Community aid programmes.
The largest of these is the Lome
Convention which governs aid, trade and
co-operation between the Community and
69 developing countries in Africa, the
Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP).
Under the current Convention—the
fourth in a series—which was signed in
1989, Britain’s commitment to Community
aid over the next five years is £1,300
million out of a total of £8,500 million. The
Convention will run for ten years with
provision for review after five years; there
will be two European Development Funds,
each lasting five years.
The Convention provides for aid
totalling over £7,700 million for the first
five years and up to £850 million in loans
from the European Investment Bank over
the same period. It also covers emergency
industrial and agricultural co-operation.
There is a scheme designed to help stabilise
the agricultural and commodity export
earnings of the ACP countries and
assistance for ACP producers of certain
products whose output and income suffer
from temporary disruptions beyond their
control. There is a special allocation of
£810 million for countries undertaking
economic reform. In addition, the
Convention offers duty-free access to the
Community for ACP exports of most
agricultural goods, including special
arrangements for sugar, bananas, rum and
beef and industrial products satisfying the
rules of origin.
All British dependent territories (with
the exception of Bermuda, Gibraltar and
Hong Kong), together with the overseas
territories of other Community members,
are formally associated with the Community
under provisions parallel to those of the
Lome Convention.
The Community’s aid programme for
developing countries in Asia and Latin
America not covered by the Lome
Convention or having any other special
relationship with the Community will be
worth some £1,925 million for the period
between 1991 and 1995. Priority is given to
rural development and agricultural
production in the poorest countries, most of
which are in Asia, and economic
co-operation with the better-off countries.
Co-operation and association agreements
with individual countries and regional
groupings also include provision for
development aid. In 1987, for instance, new
five-year financial protocols were agreed with
most of the Community’s Mediterranean
partners. These provide for £430 million of
Community aid and £706 million in loans
from the European Investment Bank.
The Community’s food aid programme is
designed to be an effective instrument of
development policy. In 1990 it spent some
£349 million on food aid, of which Britain’s
share was £77 million, much of which went
to Africa.
Other Bodies
Britain contributes to the Asian Development
Bank, the Inter-American Development
Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and
the African Development Bank.
Voluntary Agencies
Voluntary agencies raise funds for use in
developing countries in such areas as
agriculture, health and nutrition, education
projects, and emergency relief operations.
There are more than 200 agencies,
including church and missionary societies.
Among the best known are Oxfam, Christian
Aid, the Save the Children Fund, and the
Catholic Fund for Overseas Development.
The funds are raised through regular
donations and collections, legacies and
trading activities. Special funds are set up to
cope with emergencies. The Government
meets half the cost of about 1,260 selected
development projects undertaken by the
agencies and aimed at helping the poorest
people; over £20 million was contributed by
the Government in 1990—91. In 1989—90 the
Government gave over £65 million to the
activities of voluntary agencies.

Defence
The primary objectives of Britain’s defence
policy are to ensure the country’s security, to
preserve peace with freedom, and to enable it
to pursue its legitimate interests both within
Britain and overseas. Britain’s policy is based
on membership of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation (NATO), a defensive alliance
whose collective strength continues to
provide each of its members1 with far greater
security than any could achieve alone.
Britain supports the new democratic
governments in Eastern Europe and
welcomes the quickening pace towards
democracy in the Soviet Union and its
republics. It believes that British security can
best be protected by the continuing
maintenance of collective defence with its
NATO allies. At the same time, Britain and
its NATO partners have recognised the need
to readjust their military structure and
strategy to the new security position arising
from these developments and have outlined
ways in which this will be done.
Most of the defence budget goes, directly
or indirectly, towards carrying out Britain’s
main defence roles in NATO, to which the
majority of its armed forces are committed.
In recent years the structure and balance of
these forces have been improved to increase
their combat effectiveness. As a result of
these improvements Britain also has the
flexibility to respond quickly and effectively
to challenges to its interests outside the
NATO area.
Changes in Europe
There have been important and welcome
political and military changes in the Soviet
1 NATO’s 16 member countries are Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey
and the United States.
Union and Eastern Europe in the past few
years. These include:
• the unification of Germany as a
sovereign state within NATO;
• the break-up of the Warsaw Pact as a
military alliance;
• the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from
Hungary and Czechoslovakia;
• the withdrawal by 1994 of Soviet forces
from Germany; and
• the collapse of Communism in the
Soviet Union.
NATO is, however, still needed to
provide continuing stability and security
during a period of great political uncertainty
in Europe. Britain also believes that NATO
provides the most effective forum for
transatlantic political co-operation and
consultation on security and arms control,
for co-ordinating the implementation of arms
control agreements and for establishing the
basis for further negotiations.
NATO Policy
NATO is a political and military alliance of
countries sharing a common commitment to
peace, democracy and the rule of law. Its
aims are:
• to prevent war and maintain the security
of its members at the lowest possible
levels of forces;
• to deter potential aggression by
maintaining a balanced mix of nuclear
and conventional forces, based in Europe
and kept up to date as necessary; and
• to provide a transatlantic forum for allied
consultation.
In a joint declaration in July 1990, the
allies reaffirmed their commitment to defend
81
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the territory of all NATO members.
However, they also recognised that, as
Europe was changing militarily and
politically, the Alliance should alter its
structure and strategy to meet the new
security environment. Alliance strategy in
future will include:
• the deployment of smaller, highly mobile
forces;
• more multinational units; and
• reduced reliance on nuclear weapons.
NATO leaders also agreed to develop
further the Alliance’s political dimension,
initiating, for example, measures to achieve
closer relations with the former Warsaw Pact
countries.
Britain plays a full part in the Alliance’s
efforts to negotiate balanced and verifiable
arms control agreements. NATO seeks:
• the ratification and full implementation
of the 1990 Conventional Armed Forces
in Europe (CFE) agreement;
• a new agreement to limit armed forces’
personnel to restrain further offensive
capabilities in Europe; and
• additional confidence- and security¬
building measures to create greater
openness.
Britain is playing a leading part in work
aimed at establishing a United Nations
register of arms transfers to promote greater
transparency and confidence. It also
participates in negotiations at the Conference
on Disarmament in Geneva. The most
important issue under discussion is a global
ban on chemical weapons.
The NATO allies have acknowledged that
Western interests outside the NATO area
may be threatened and they recognise the
need, in the last resort, for those members
with the means to do so to take action in
consultation with their allies.
Britain’s NATO Contribution
Britain’s contribution to NATO is
concentrated in areas where it can best help
to maintain Alliance security, principally
NATO’s strategic nuclear deterrent and the
defence of the European mainland, the
Eastern Atlantic and English Channel, and
the British ‘home’ base and its immediate
approaches.
Because of the changes in the European
security situation, Britain is reducing the
forces it commits to NATO, although it will
continue to make a substantial contribution
in each of these areas.
Britain’s strategic forces, equipped with
improved Polaris missiles (to be replaced by
a Trident force from the mid-1990s), provide
an independent and European centre of
decision-making within the Alliance, thereby
guarding against any misconception that
Europe’s defence is ultimately dependent on
the US nuclear guarantee. Britain has also
committed its other nuclear systems to
NATO.
Virtually all of the Royal Navy (RN) is
committed to the Alliance. Permanent
contributions are made to NATO’s two
standing naval forces, in the Atlantic and the
Channel, and to its Mediterranean force
when activated. The British Army of the
Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air Force (RAF)
Germany are being restructured.
Nearly all the RAF’s combat and support
aircraft are assigned to NATO. RAF
Germany’s squadrons of combat aircraft and
helicopters are equipped for strike/attack,
reconnaissance, close support, air defence
and air transport roles. RAF Strike
Command, which is based in Britain,
provides forces for these and for the
maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare
roles.
Britain also contributes ships and
commando units to a British—Dutch
amphibious force, ground and air units for
the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force,
and several squadrons for NATO’s Strategic
Air Reserve.
RN and RAF units are stationed at
Gibraltar, which, positioned at the western
entry to the Mediterranean, is an important
base for NATO.
Britain’s Defence for the 1990s
Because of the reduction in East-West
tension in Europe and progress in arms
control negotiations, the Government has
82
DEFENCE
proposed changes in Britain’s defence
structure. The strategic deterrent and a
sub-strategic nuclear force, provided by
dual-capable aircraft, will be retained. The
air defence of Britain will be undertaken
by seven Tornado F3 squadrons,
supplemented by Hawk fighters. Airborne
early warning will be the task of Boeing
aircraft. Home defence forces and the fleet
of mine counter-measures vessels will be
maintained at a substantial level.
Although Britain will continue to play a
full part in the defence of Europe, British
forces stationed in Germany will be
reduced to half their existing strength by
the mid-1990s. When reinforced, Britain’s
land contribution to the defence of
mainland Europe will comprise two
divisions rather than four as at present.
These forces will represent Britain’s main
contribution to the new Allied Command
Europe Rapid Reaction Corps. In addition,
Britain will provide the commander for
this new corps.
RAF Germany will be reduced to six
fixed-wing squadrons, and two of the four
RAF bases in Germany will close. There
will be a reduced force of support
helicopters. An amphibious force will be
retained to reinforce NATO’s northern
region, as will the ability to provide air
support to defend that area. One of the
two divisions assigned to the Rapid
Reaction Corps will also be able to
undertake a range of operations beyond
the NATO area.
The Government proposes that Britain’s
maritime contribution to NATO should
continue to include three aircraft carriers, a
force of destroyers and frigates (reduced to
about 40), nuclear-powered and
conventional submarines, and Nimrod
maritime patrol aircraft.
These changes will mean a reduction of
20 per cent in the strength of the armed
forces to around 55,000 in the Royal Navy
and the Royal Marines; 116,000 in the
Army; and 75,000 in the Royal Air Force.
The number of headquarters staff and
civilian personnel employed by the
Ministry of Defence will be similarly
reduced.
Europe and the Alliance
Britain’s contribution to NATO is part of
the wider effort which the European allies
make to Alliance defence. The European
allies provide the majority of NATO forces,
as well as communications, transport and
military facilities for United States forces.
Britain and its European allies play a full
part in the Independent European
Programme Group, which promotes arms co¬
operation among European allies, and in the
Conference of National Armaments
Directors, the forum for defence equipment
collaboration across the Atlantic. They also
work together in the Eurogroup to improve
their contributions to the Alliance and to
achieve better use of available resources. In
addition, the Western European Union
(WEU)2 provides further impetus towards
European defence and security co-operation.
The WEU helped to co-ordinate
contributions by member countries in mine
clearance operations in the Gulf during the
Iran-Iraq war in the late 1980s; in 1990-91
WEU members agreed to co-ordinate their
participation in the multinational campaign
in the Gulf (see p 84).
Britain believes that the WEU can
provide a focus for a more coherent
European defence identity and act as a
bridge between NATO and the foreign and
security policies of the 12 members of the
European Community.
Outside the NATO Area
Britain maintains the ability to operate
outside the NATO area to protect its
interests without diminishing its commitment
to the Alliance. It has an airborne brigade
which can be deployed to trouble spots
should the need arise. Under the new force
structure Britain will have the ability to
deploy parachute, airmobile and mechanised
formations outside the NATO area as
necessary.
Britain provides the largest national troop
contingent to the United Nations Force in
2 WEU members are Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
83
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cyprus, as well as giving support for the
United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon; it
also contributes a detachment to the
Multinational Force and Observers in
Sinai. Britain contributed significant
contingents to the multinational force
deployed in the Middle East after the
invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in 1990-91; it
also made contributions to the UN force in
southern Iraq and to the military force
providing protection to Iraqi refugees in
northern Iraq.
Considerable effort is devoted to the
provision of military assistance and
training to about 30 countries outside
NATO, and Britain deploys its forces on
visits and exercises in important areas.
British garrisons are maintained in Belize,
Brunei, Cyprus, the Falkland Islands and,
until 1997, Hong Kong.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces continue to support the
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in the
fight against terrorism in Northern Ireland.
The Army provides ten regular units and
nine battalions of the Ulster Defence
Regiment (UDR). The Government has
announced plans to merge the UDR with
another regiment. The RN, which carries
out patrols to prevent arms smuggling, and
the RAF also make substantial contributions;
the Royal Marines support Army and Navy
operations.
THE ARMED FORCES
Personnel
On 1 April 1991 the strength of the regular
armed forces, all volunteers, was about
298,100: 62,100 in the Royal Navy and the
Royal Marines, 147,600 in the Army and
88,400 in the Royal Air Force. The
Ministry of Defence employed about
140,200 civilians (based in Britain) at the
same date.
The 18,600 female personnel in the
nursing and women’s services (4,100 in the
Royal Navy, 7,200 in the Army and 7,200
in the RAF) serve alongside servicemen in
Britain and overseas.
Commissioned Ranks
Commissions, either by promotion from
the ranks or by direct entry based on
educational and other qualifications, are
granted for short, medium and long terms.
All three Services have schemes for school,
university and college sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial
training at the Britannia Royal Naval
College, Dartmouth; the Royal Military
Academy, Sandhurst; or the Royal Air
Force College, Cranwell. This is followed
by specialist training, often including
degree courses at Service establishments or
universities.
Higher training for officers is provided
by the Royal Naval College, Greenwich;
the Army Staff College at Camberley; and
the Royal Air Force Staff College at
Bracknell. Selected senior officers and
civilian officials from Britain attend the
Joint Services Defence College, Greenwich,
and the Royal College of Defence Studies,
London, which is also attended by officers
and officials from other countries. These
provide the wider background necessary
for those destined to fill higher
appointments.
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks
range from three to 22 years, with a wide
choice of length and terms of service.
Subject to a minimum period of service,
entrants may leave at any time, at 18
months’ notice (12 months for certain
engagements). Discharge may also be
granted on compassionate grounds, by
purchase, or on grounds of conscience.
Throughout their Service careers non¬
commissioned personnel receive basic
training supplemented by specialist
training. Study for educational
qualifications is encouraged and Service
trade and technical training lead to
nationally recognised qualifications.

DEFENCE
Reserve Forces
Trained reserve and auxiliary forces
supplement the regular forces on
mobilisation and are able immediately to take
their places either as formed units or as
individual reinforcements. They are also a
link between the Services and the civil
community. Some members of these forces
become reservists following a period of
regular service (regular reserve); others are
volunteers who train in their spare time.
Volunteer reserve forces include the
Territorial Army (TA), whose role is to
reinforce the ground forces committed to
NATO and to help maintain a secure home
base in Britain. Set up in 1985, a Home
Service Force, linked to the TA and with a
current strength of about 3,200, would on
mobilisation assist in guarding important
civilian and military installations.
Other volunteer forces include the Royal
Naval and Royal Marines Reserves, the
Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force and the Royal Air Force
Volunteer Reserve. All, except the Royal
Naval Auxiliary Service, have been expanded
substantially in recent years or are planned
to increase in strength in the near future.
The Ulster Defence Regiment (see p 84) is
also a reserve force.
At the beginning of 1991 regular reserves
totalled 257,000 and volunteer reserves and
auxiliary forces 90,200. The strength of the
cadet forces, which make a significant
contribution to recruitment to the regular
forces, was 130,200.
COMBAT FORCES
Strategic Nuclear Forces
The Royal Navy’s Polaris force comprises
four nuclear submarines, each of which can
remain on underwater patrol for long periods
and is capable of carrying 16 nuclear-armed
Polaris missiles. The missile system,
incorporating improvements designed to
penetrate anti-ballistic missile defences, will
maintain the force’s effectiveness until it is
replaced from the mid-1990s by four Trident
nuclear submarines. They will extend
Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent into
the twenty-first century.
The Trident programme, which will
cost an estimated £9,863 million (at
1990-91 prices), is expected to account
on average for less than 3 per cent of
the defence budget (and less than 6 per
cent of the equipment budget) during its
procurement period. It is also estimated
that about 70 per cent of the money for
the project will be spent in Britain.
Three of the submarines designed to carry
Trident missiles are under construction; the
invitation to tender for the fourth was issued
in 1991.
Royal Navy Combat Forces
Britain’s naval forces, while capable of
operating throughout the world when
required, are concentrated in the Eastern
Atlantic and in the Channel, where they
constitute the majority of naval forces
immediately available to NATO. Their
primary role is anti-submarine warfare. The
Royal Navy includes:
• three Invincible-class anti-submarine
warfare carriers, deploying Sea King
anti-submarine and airborne early
warning helicopters, Sea Harrier aircraft,
and Sea Dart air defence missiles;
• 14 nuclear-powered attack submarines
(with another one on order), equipped
with torpedoes and anti-ship missiles;
and
• six diesel-electric-powered submarines,
including the more powerful Upholder
class, the first two of which have entered
service.
In addition to the four ballistic missile
submarines, Britain’s submarine force will be
reduced to about 16 vessels by the mid-
1990s, three-quarters of which will be
nuclear powered.
The Royal Navy also has 46 destroyers
and frigates (including the first three of the
new Type 23 frigate) for air defence, anti¬
submarine and general purpose duties. These
are to be reduced to about 40. Most of these
85
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
vessels have weapon-carrying helicopters, and
their armaments include surface-to-surface,
air defence, and anti-ship missiles. There are
also Royal Marines forces, specialist
amphibious shipping and supporting vessels.
Other ships include mine counter-measures
vessels, and offshore patrol vessels for
protecting fishing interests and oil and gas
installations.
In future Britain’s contribution to
NATO’s maritime defence will be made up
of nuclear-powered attack submarines and
advanced diesel-electric conventional
submarines; the Type 23 frigate (of which a
further seven have been ordered and tenders
invited for up to three more); and Nimrod
maritime patrol aircraft, equipped with
Searchwater radar and armed with Harpoon
anti-ship missiles and Stingray anti¬
submarine torpedoes. In addition, the surface
fleet has been strengthened by 14 multi-role
Type 22 frigates and by the new Sandown
class of minehunter, of which two are in
service and a further three on order.
New or improved weapons will include
the Harpoon missile for the last four Type
22 and for the new Type 23 frigates, the Sea
Eagle anti-ship missile, Goalkeeper rapid
firing guns, and, for submarines, the
Spearfish torpedo. The Sea Wolf and Sea
Dart air defence missiles are also being
developed or improved. The Type 23 frigate,
which is to be armed with the ship- or air-
launched Stingray torpedo, is planned to
deploy the EH 101 helicopter when that
enters service later in the decade. The
Navy’s Sea Harriers are being updated.
Army Combat Forces
The three armoured divisions currently in
BAOR include 12 armoured regiments; five
of these are equipped with Chieftain tanks
while the other seven have the more modern
Challenger. From the mid-1990s when there
will be one British armoured division based
in Germany, Chieftain will be replaced by
the new Challenger 2 tank. The mobility and
fire power of the armoured infantry is being
enhanced by the continued introduction of
the Warrior mechanised infantry combat
vehicle. Deployment also continues of the
SA80 rifle and the light anti-tank weapon,
LAW80, which have markedly improved the
infantry’s firepower.
The multiple launch rocket system is
entering service; it will be enhanced by
rockets able to lay anti-tank mines at long
range. A new attack helicopter will be
ordered for the Army. In the meantime
improvements are being made to the Lynx
anti-tank helicopter, more of which are being
acquired.
Major improvements to the Army’s air
defences are planned for the 1990s, including
the introduction of the Starstreak missile, the
next generation of Rapier missiles and a new
air defence command and control system.
The need for other types of sophisticated
command, control and communications
systems is being met by the PTARMIGAN
secure communications, the W A YELL
computerised battlefield information and the
BATES artillery targeting systems, among
others.
Royal Air Force
Following the withdrawal from service of
Phantom aircraft by mid-1993, seven
squadrons of Tornado F3 aircraft—together
with Rapier surface-to-air missiles and
Oerlikon guns directed by Skyguard radar—
will provide Britain’s air defence. They will
be assisted by seven Boeing airborne early
warning (AEW) aircraft which are entering
service, and the ground radars and
command, control and communication
systems of the improved United Kingdom
Air Defence Ground Environment. In
addition, a number of Hawk trainer aircraft
have been equipped with air-to-air missiles
and cannon for local air defence. The
strike/attack fleet is equipped with the
Tornado GR1; a variant of this aircraft is
replacing some Jaguars to provide
reconnaissance. Close air support for ground
troops is provided by the Harrier GR5/GR7
and Jaguar aircraft.
Nimrod maritime aircraft form part of
Britain’s anti-submarine warfare force, and
also undertake long-range surveillance
operations against surface ships, as well as
providing offshore surveillance and fishery
86
DEFENCE
protection. The Buccaneer currently
employed in an anti-ship role will be
replaced by Tornado GRls armed with the
Sea Eagle missile.
Victor, TriStar and VC10 aircraft are
used as tankers for in-flight refuelling.
Tactical transport is provided by VC 10 and
Hercules aircraft, while Chinook, Puma and
Wessex helicopters provide tactical support
to ground forces. Sea King and Wessex
helicopters perform search and rescue duties
around the British Isles. Weapons in service
include Skyflash, Sparrow, Sidewinder,
Martel and Sea Eagle missiles, and guided
and cluster bombs.
Improvements to Britain’s air defence
include the modernisation of the Tornado F3
radar, better communications and control
systems and the introduction of the Boeing
AEW aircraft. The ability of the Tornado
GR1 to attack at night will be enhanced; the
new Harrier GR5 is also being upgraded to a
night-attack version, GR7, the first squadron
of which became operational in 1991. All
strike/attack and offensive support aircraft
will be fitted with advanced electronic
warfare equipment to increase their ability to
survive. The Tornado GR1, already
equipped with the British JP233 airfield
attack weapon, will have the ALARM anti¬
radiation missile. It is expected that the
European Fighter Aircraft, which is being
developed by Britain, Germany, Italy and
Spain, will complement the Tornado F3.
Air-to-air refuelling capacity is being
increased by converting more VC 10 aircraft
into tankers; a force of 13 aircraft is planned.
The Chinook helicopter fleet is being
updated.
Finance and Management
The defence budget for 1991-92 is over
£24,000 million. Britain remains one of the
highest contributors to NATO, with about
£670 per capita spent on defence in 1990;
4 per cent of gross domestic product was
devoted to defence expenditure, a proportion
only exceeded in NATO by Greece, Turkey
and the United States.
Increased competition in the letting of
contracts has improved both quality and
value for money. About 39 per cent of
Britain’s defence expenditure is devoted to
the purchase of equipment.
Organisation and Management
Within the Ministry of Defence a military-
civilian Defence Staff is responsible for
defence policy and strategy, operational
requirements and commitments. An Office of
Management and Budget handles budgets and
resources. Each Service Chief of Staff reports
through the Chief of Defence Staff to the
Secretary of State on matters related to the
fighting effectiveness, management, efficiency
and morale of his Service. The management
of the three services is exercised through
executive committees of the Service Boards,
which are chaired by their respective Chiefs
of Staff and act in accordance with centrally
determined policy objectives and budgets.
The Procurement Executive deals with the
purchase of equipment, including equipment
collaboration with allies and friendly nations.
Under a new system of budgeting,
military and civilian managers are allowed
greater discretion in the most efficient use of
their allocated resources. This new approach
is designed to promote better value for
money, and to provide clear direction for
local managers.
Defence Procurement
About £9,271 million is being spent on
defence equipment in 1991-92, making the
Ministry of Defence British industry’s largest
customer. Contracts are awarded by open
international competition where possible, and
strict guidelines ensure that companies are
given the maximum incentive to perform
efficiently.
Research and Development
Research is undertaken by the Ministry’s
research establishments and under contract in
industry and the universities.
Nearly all design and development of
defence equipment is carried out by industry.
The Ministry seeks to involve industry in the
research programme and to promote civil
87
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
applications. As part of the Government’s
policy of improving the strength of Britain’s
science base, the Ministry, together with the
research councils, makes joint grants to
academic institutions in areas of research
relevant to defence. In order to obtain better
value for money, the Ministry’s four main
non-nuclear research and development
establishments were combined into the
Defence Research Agency, which began
operating in 1991. Another research
organisation—the Chemical and Biological
Defence Establishment—was launched as a
Defence Support Agency in 1991.
Around £425 million is expected to be
spent on defence research and £2,500
million on development in 1991-92.
Alliance Co-operation
International co-operation has been a feature
of armaments procurement for over 20 years,
and Britain was one of its pioneers in
programmes such as the British-French
Jaguar aircraft and the Lynx, Puma and
Gazelle helicopters; the FH70 towed
howitzer developed jointly with Germany
and Italy; and the successful Tornado aircraft
developed and produced with the same two
partners. Britain also worked with the
United States on the Harrier GR5.
In order to make better use of limited
resources, Britain plays an active role in
NATO’s Conference of National Armaments
Directors, and the Independent European
Programme Group. In the latter, ten
member countries are following Britain and
France in publishing bulletins of contract
opportunities, so helping to open up the
European defence equipment market.
Major new collaborative programmes
under way include:
• the EH101 helicopter (with Italy);
• the new European Fighter Aircraft (with
Germany, Italy and Spain);
• the multiple-launch rocket system (with
France, Germany, Italy and the United
States); and
• anti-tank guided weapons (with France
and Germany).
Civil Defence
Civil defence arrangements are based on
the extended and adapted use of the
peacetime resources of government
departments, local authorities, emergency
services and nationalised industries,
supplemented by the efforts of voluntary
organisations and individual volunteers.
Civil defence regulations require local
authorities to make and keep up to date
plans for a range of essential functions in
the event of war; to arrange training and
exercises for civil defence staff and
volunteers; and to provide suitable
emergency centres for the direction of civil
defence in wartime. Following legislation
in 1986, local authorities may use their
civil defence resources in responding to
peacetime emergencies.
Expenditure on civil defence has been
growing steadily and was about £129
million in 1990-91. This is being used to:
• improve the quality and readiness of
central and local government planning;
• increase training opportunities
arranged by the Home Office on staff
college lines at the Emergency
Planning College, Easingwold;
• help local authorities to plan for better
community involvement in civil
defence; and
• improve the emergency system for
decentralised government control and
communications.
Improvements are also being made in the
communications, equipment and
administrative facilities of the United
Kingdom Warning and Monitoring
Organisation. This includes the civilian
Royal Observer Corps, which is organised
to provide public warning of an attack, of
the location and strength of nuclear
explosions, and of the distribution and
level of radioactive fall-out.
88
5 Justice and the Law
England and Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland all have their own legal systems, with
considerable differences in law, organisation
and practice. However, a large volume of
modern legislation applies throughout Britain.
The main sources of law are government
legislation, common law and European
Community law. Common law is the ancient
law of the land deduced from custom and
interpreted by judges; it has never been
precisely defined or codified but forms the
basis of the law except when superseded by
legislation. European Community law is
confined mainly to economic and social
matters; in certain circumstances it takes
precedence over domestic law. It is normally
applied by the domestic courts, but the most
authoritative rulings are given by the
Community’s Court of Justice.
Certain changes to United Kingdom law
have been made following rulings of the
European Court of Human Rights. These
arose where domestic law was in breach of
the Council of Europe’s Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms, to which Britain is a
party.
Criminal Justice
The aims of the criminal justice system are:
• to prevent and reduce crime where
possible;
• to help victims;
• to deal fairly, justly and without delay
with those suspected, accused or
convicted of offences;
• to convict the guilty and acquit the
innocent; and
• to punish suitably those found guilty.
Public expenditure on the criminal justice
system has increased in real terms by 50 per
cent since 1979, and in 1990-91 it stood at
£11,120 million. Extra spending has taken
place on the police, the probation service and
prison building. More than two-thirds of
expenditure is initially incurred by local
government authorities, with the help of
central government grants, mainly on the
police.
Crime Statistics
Differences in the legal systems, police
recording practices and statistical
classifications in the countries of Britain
make it impracticable to analyse in detail
trends in crime for the country as a whole.
Nevertheless, it is clear that, as in Western
Europe generally, there has been a
substantial increase in crime since the early
1950s. However, annual official statistics
cover only crime recorded by the police and
can be affected by changes in the proportion
of crimes which are undiscovered or
unreported.
Table 5.1 gives the crime figures for
England and Wales.
The Scottish police recorded 959,000
crimes and offences, of which 32 per cent
were cleared up. In Northern Ireland just
over 57,000 crimes were recorded, of which
38 per cent were cleared up. Crime tends to
be concentrated in inner cities and deprived
areas; the risk of burglary can be as high as
one in ten houses a year in inner city areas,
compared with one in 100 in rural areas.
Rising affluence has provided more
opportunities for casual property crime. In
1957, for example, car crime was only 10 per
cent of total crime but this has risen to over
25 per cent.

a Excludes criminal damage of £20 and under.
Most crime is committed by young
males, is opportunist and is not planned by
hardened professional criminals, although
these do exist. Only a small proportion of
young male offenders go on to become
serious repeat offenders.
Crime Prevention
National publicity campaigns, such as the
current Crack Crime campaign, are a
regular feature of the Government’s
programmes. The Home Office’s Crime
Prevention Unit encourages local agencies
to design and implement preventive
measures and to assess the results. Other
government departments are brought
together with the Home Office to
formulate crime prevention strategies.
The Department of the Environment’s
programmes are designed to encourage
improvements in the design, layout and
management of housing estates. Gas and
electricity suppliers have speeded up their
programme of replacing domestic
prepayment meters by cashless or ‘token’
meters, so removing a prime target for
burglaries.
Crime Concern, a national
independent organisation, encourages
local initiatives and business
participation in crime prevention.
Local crime prevention panels—each
one assisted by the police—identify crime
problems and try to tackle them through
publicity, marking goods and equipment, and
fund-raising to buy security devices. The
police have been closely involved in setting
up 92,000 neighbourhood watch schemes in
England and Wales. There are some 1,700
watch schemes in Scotland.
In 1986 five local projects were set up
with government support to see how crime
and the fear of crime could be reduced
through action by local government, private
businesses, the police and voluntary agencies.
As part of the Government’s Safer Cities
projects, this model has been adapted for use
in 20 inner city areas in England and Wales.
Each project is led by a committee, drawn
from local agencies and supported by a co¬
ordinator funded by the Home Office. Four
projects are also being established in
Scotland. Similar projects are being funded
by the Government in Northern Ireland.
Strengthening the Law
A number of measures to strengthen the
criminal justice system have been taken in
recent years. The courts now have powers to
trace, freeze and confiscate the proceeds of
drug trafficking. A court can issue an order
requiring the offender to pay an amount
equal to the full value of the proceeds arising
from the trafficking. The laundering of
illegal money associated with trafficking is
unlawful. Because of the international nature
of the problem, restraint and confiscation
orders made by courts can be enforced
90
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
against assets held overseas, and vice versa;
these arrangements apply to countries with
which mutual enforcement agreements have
been concluded.
A court may also make a confiscation
order against the proceeds arising from
offences such as robbery, fraud, blackmail
and insider dealing in shares.
The Serious Fraud Office has wide
powers to investigate and prosecute serious
or complex fraud in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Fraud in Scotland is
investigated and prosecuted under the
direction of the Lord Advocate.
A law has been passed to increase
controls on firearms. The private ownership
of certain highly dangerous types of
weapon such as high-powered self-loading
rifles and burst-fire weapons is banned.
The police have increased powers to
regulate the possession, safekeeping and
movement of shotguns and other firearms.
Similar legislation applies in Northern
Ireland.
Under 1988 legislation it is unlawful to
manufacture, sell or import certain weapons
such as knuckledusters or, in England and
Wales, to carry a knife in a public place
without good reason.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 has made a
number of reforms to the criminal law in
England and Wales. These mainly concern
sentencing and the system for early release of
prisoners.
Helping the Victim
Consideration is given to the needs of
victims of crime. There are, for instance,
more than 350 victim support schemes,
covering 96 per cent of the population in
England and Wales, with over 6,000 trained
volunteer visitors. They are co-ordinated by
a national organisation, Victim Support,
which receives a government grant. The
Government also finances local schemes to
meet either the salaries of co-ordinators or
running costs. Victim Support is also
established in Northern Ireland.
In February 1990 the Government
published its Victims’ Charter, setting out
for the first time the standards of service
that victims of crime are entitled to expect
from criminal justice agencies.
Victims of violent crime in Britain,
including foreign nationals, may apply for
compensation under the Criminal Injuries
Compensation Scheme administered by a
Board. Compensation is based on common
law damages and is a lump-sum payment. In
Northern Ireland there is separate, statutory
provision in certain circumstances for
compensation to be paid from public funds
for criminal injuries, and for malicious
damage to property, including the resulting
loss of profits.
In February 1990 Britain ratified a
European Convention under which mutual
arrangements for compensation apply to
citizens of those countries in which the
Convention is in force.
Measures to Combat Terrorism
The Government has certain exceptional
powers for dealing with and preventing
terrorist activities. These take account of the
need to achieve a proper balance between the
safety of the public and the rights of the
individual.
Northern Ireland
The security forces in Northern Ireland have
special powers to search, question and arrest.
The maximum period for which the police
can hold a suspected terrorist on their own
authority has been reduced from 72 to 48
hours, although he or she can be held for up
to a further 5 days with the consent of the
Secretary of State. Legislation allows
terrorist organisations to be banned by the
Government. Terrorist offences are tried by
a judge sitting alone without a jury because
of the possibility of jurors being intimidated
by terrorist organisations. Statements
obtained by the use or threat of violence are
inadmissible in court.
Nobody can be imprisoned for political
beliefs; all prisoners, except those awaiting
trial, have been found guilty in court of
criminal offences. The legislation is reviewed
annually by an independent person whose
reports are presented to Parliament.
91
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other Legislation
Other legislation applies throughout Britain
and is renewable annually by Parliament. It
provides for the exclusion from Great
Britain, Northern Ireland or the United
Kingdom of people connected with terrorism
related to Northern Ireland affairs and for
the banning of terrorist organisations in
Great Britain. It also gives the police powers
to arrest suspects without warrant and hold
them for 48 hours and, with ministerial
approval, for up to a further five days. This
provision also applies to suspected
international terrorists.
It is a criminal offence to finance
terrorism or receive funds for use in the
furtherance of terrorism. Police can apply for
a court order to freeze a suspect’s assets once
he or she has been charged. Funds can be
confiscated if a person is convicted. The
legislation allows for reciprocal enforcement
agreements with other countries.
The Government believes that there
should be no concessions to terrorist
demands and that international co-operation
is essential in tracking down terrorists and
impeding their movement from one country
to another.
THE POLICE SERVICE
Organisation
There are 52 police forces in Britain, mainly
organised on a local basis. The Metropolitan
Police Force and the City of London force
are responsible for policing London. At the
end of 1990 police strength in Britain was
just over 149,000, of which the Royal Ulster
Constabulary numbered over 8,200. Each
force has an attachment of volunteer special
constables who perform police duties in their
spare time, without pay, acting mainly as
auxiliaries to the regular force. In Northern
Ireland there is a 4,600-strong part-time and
full-time paid reserve.
Police forces are maintained in England
and Wales by committees of local county
councillors and magistrates, and in Scotland
by regional and islands councils. The Home
Secretary is responsible for London’s
Metropolitan Police Force. In Northern
Ireland the police force is responsible to a
body appointed by the Government.
Chief constables are in charge of their
police forces and are responsible for the
appointment, promotion and discipline of all
ranks below assistant chief constable. They
are generally answerable to the police
authorities on matters of efficiency, and must
submit an annual report.
The police authorities appoint the chief
constable and other top officers. They also
fix the maximum permitted strength of the
force and provide buildings and equipment.
In the Metropolitan Police area the
commissioner of police and his immediate
subordinates are appointed on the
recommendation of the Home Secretary.
The police service is financed by central
and local government.
Central Authorities
The Home Secretary and the Secretaries of
State for Scotland and Northern Ireland
approve the appointment of chief, deputy
and assistant chief constables. Where
necessary they can:
• require a police authority to retire a
chief constable in the interests of
efficiency;
• call for a report from a chief constable
on matters relating to local policing; and
• institute a local inquiry.
These ministers can also make regulations
covering:
• qualifications for appointment,
promotion and retirement;
• discipline;
• hours of duty, leave, pay and allowances;
and
• uniform.
Some of these regulations are first
negotiable within the Police Negotiating
Board for the United Kingdom. The Board
consists of an independent chairman and
representatives of the police authorities,
police staff associations and the home
departments.
92
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
All police forces (except the
Metropolitan Police) are inspected by
inspectors of constabulary reporting to
central government. On request, the
inspectorate also undertakes inspections of
selected parts of the Metropolitan Police.
Members of the police service may not
belong to a trade union, nor may they
withdraw their labour in furtherance of a
trade dispute. All ranks, however, have
their own staff associations to represent
their interests.
Co-ordination of Police Operations
Several common services are provided by
central government and by arrangements
between forces. In England and Wales the
most important of these cover
telecommunications and central and
provincial criminal records. In Scotland the
main common services are centralised
police training, the Scottish Crime Squad
and the Scottish Criminal Record Office.
Certain special services such as liaison
with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol) are provided for
other British forces by the Metropolitan
Police. The National Drugs Intelligence
Unit assists police forces and the Customs
service throughout Britain. A new National
Criminal Intelligence Service is to be set
up in 1992 to co-ordinate and analyse
intelligence; it will bring together a number
of units, including the National Drugs
Intelligence Unit and the Interpol Bureau.
The services of the Fraud Squad, which
is run jointly by the Metropolitan Police
and City of London Police to investigate
company frauds, are available in England
and Wales.
Regional crime squads, co-ordinated at
national level in England and Wales, deal
with serious crimes, such as drug
trafficking, and are used whenever
operations cannot be dealt with by
individual police forces alone.
In all areas of police work the use of
scientific aids is widespread. A national
police computer helps to rationalise records
and speed up the dissemination of
information.
Police Discipline
A British police officer may be sued or
prosecuted for any wrongful act committed
in carrying out duties. Police discipline codes
are designed to prevent any abuse of police
powers and to maintain public confidence in
the impartiality of the service.
The independent Police Complaints
Authority has powers to supervise the
investigation of any serious complaint against
a police officer in England and Wales. In
Scotland complaints against police officers
involving allegations of any form of criminal
conduct are investigated by an independent
procurator fiscal service.
In Northern Ireland the Independent
Commission for Police Complaints is
required to supervise the investigation of a
complaint regarding death or serious injury
and has the power to supervise that of any
other complaint if it so wishes. In certain
circumstances, the Secretary of State may
direct the Commission to supervise the
investigation of matters that are not the
subject of a formal complaint.
Community Relations
Virtually all forces have liaison departments
designed to develop closer contact between
the force and the community. Almost all
areas have police/community consultative
groups. Particular efforts are made to
develop relations with young people through
greater contact with schools; school
governing bodies and head teachers are
under an obligation to describe in their
annual reports the steps they take to
strengthen their schools’ links with the
community, including the police.
Emphasis is placed on improving relations
with ethnic minorities. The Government
believes that all police officers should receive
a thorough training in community and race
relations. The Home Office sponsors national
courses in these subjects for community
liaison officers and police managers. There is
also a national specialist support unit which
makes a valuable contribution to improving
community and race relations training for the
police. Discriminatory behaviour by police
93
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
officers is an offence under the Police
Discipline Code. The Home Office organises
recruitment advertising campaigns in the
press in order to encourage black and Asian
recruits to the police. In December 1990 there
were 1,418 ethnic minority police officers in
England and Wales.
Police Powers
Officers in Great Britain do not normally
carry firearms, although in an emergency they
can be issued quickly on the authority of a
senior officer. In Northern Ireland police
officers are issued with firearms for personal
protection and other firearms are available for
duty purposes.
Under legislation passed in 1985, the
Government can authorise interception of
postal and telephone services by the police in
order to prevent and detect serious crime, or,
in some cases, national security. The other
ground for interception is the safeguarding of
Britain’s economic well-being. Any interception
outside these procedures is a criminal offence.
A police officer in England and Wales has
a general power of stop and search if he or
she has reasonable grounds for suspicion that
a person is carrying stolen goods, offensive
weapons or implements that could be used for
theft, burglary and other offences. The officer
must, however, state and record the grounds
for taking this action and what, if anything,
was found.
Arrest
In England and Wales the police have wide
powers to arrest suspects with or without a
warrant issued by a magistrate. For serious
offences, known as ‘arrestable offences’, a
suspect can be arrested without a warrant;
this covers all offences for which a maximum
period of five years’ imprisonment can be
imposed on conviction. Arrest without a
warrant also applies to people suspected of
committing ‘serious arrestable offences’ such
as murder, rape and kidnapping. For lesser
offences, arrest without warrant exists only
when certain criteria are met, for instance, if
it is not possible or appropriate to send out a
summons to appear in court.
Detention, Treatment and Questioning
A statutory code of practice issued by the
Government regulates detention, treatment
and questioning of suspects by the police in
England and Wales. Failure to comply with
its provisions can render a police officer
liable to disciplinary proceedings. Evidence
obtained in breach of the code may be ruled
inadmissible in court.
An arrested person has a statutory right to
consult a solicitor and to ask the police to
notify a relative or other named person likely
to take an interest in his or her welfare.
Where a person has been arrested in
connection with a serious arrestable offence,
but has not yet been charged, the police may
delay for up to 36 hours the exercise of these
rights in the interests of the investigation if
certain strict criteria are met.
The police must caution a suspect before
any questions are put for the purpose of
obtaining evidence. The caution informs the
suspect that he or she is entitled to refuse to
answer questions—the so-called ‘right to
silence’. Questions relating to an offence may
not normally be put to a person after he or
she has been charged with that offence or
informed that he or she may be prosecuted
for it.
The length of time a suspect is held in
police custody before charge is strictly
regulated. For lesser offences this may not
exceed 24 hours. A person suspected of
committing a serious arrestable offence can
be detained for up to 96 hours without
charge but only beyond 36 hours if a warrant
is obtained from a magistrates’ court.
Reviews must be made of a person’s
detention at regular intervals—six hours after
initial detention and thereafter every nine
hours as a maximum—to check whether the
criteria for detention are still satisfied. If
they are not, the person must be released
immediately.
The tape recording of interviews with
suspected offenders at police stations will
become standard practice by the end of 1991.
A code of practice governing these tape
recordings has been approved by Parliament.
A person who thinks that the grounds for
detention are unlawful may apply to the
94
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
High Court for a writ of habeas corpus
against the person who detained him or her,
requiring that person to appear before the
court to justify the detention. Habeas corpus
proceedings take precedence over others.
A similar remedy is available to anyone
who is unlawfully detained in Scotland.
Charging
Once there is sufficient evidence for a
charge, the police have to decide whether to
charge the person with the offence. As an
alternative to charging immediately, they can,
for example, decide to defer charging or to
take no further action and release the person
with or without bail. They may also issue a
caution, which is a warning that prosecution
is likely for a second offence.
If charged with an offence, a person may
be kept in custody if there is a risk that he
or she might fail to appear in court or might
interfere with the administration of justice. A
young person may also be detained for his or
her protection. When no such considerations
apply, the person must be released on or
without bail. Where someone is detained
after charge, he or she must be brought
before a magistrates’ court quickly. This is
usually no later than the next working day.
Time Limits
There are time limits on the period a
defendant may be remanded in custody
awaiting trial in England and Wales. In cases
tried before a magistrates’ court these are 56
days from first appearance to trial or 70 days
between first appearance to committal for
trial (see p 98) in the Crown Court. The
limit in Crown Court cases is 112 days from
committal to taking of the plea. When a time
limit expires, the defendant is entitled to bail
unless the court extends the limit; it can only
do this if satisfied that there is a good and
sufficient reason, and that the prosecution
has acted expeditiously.
Bail
Most accused people are released on bail
pending trial. They are not remanded in
custody except where strictly necessary. In
England and Wales, the court decides
whether a defendant should be released on
bail. Unconditional bail may only be
withheld if the court has substantial grounds
for believing that the accused would:
• abscond;
• commit an offence;
• interfere with witnesses; or
• otherwise obstruct the course of justice.
A court may also impose conditions
before granting bail. If bail is refused, the
defendant may apply to a High Court judge
or to the Crown Court for bail. An
application can also be made to the Crown
Court for conditions imposed by a
magistrates’ court to be varied.
In some cases a court may grant bail to a
defendant on condition that he or she lives
in an approved bail or probation/bail hostel.
The probation service has developed bail
information schemes which provide the
Crown Prosecution Service with verified
information about a defendant. This assists
the Service to decide whether to oppose bail
and enables the courts to take an informed
decision on whether to grant bail.
Scotland
In Scotland the police may detain and
question a suspected person for a period of
up to six hours. After this period the person
must either be released or charged. Once a
person has been charged with a criminal
offence, only voluntary statements will
normally be allowed in evidence at the trial.
The court will reject statements unless
satisfied that they have been fairly obtained.
In many areas interviews with suspects in
police stations are tape recorded. Anyone
arrested must be brought before a court with
the least possible delay (generally not later
than the first day after being taken into
custody), or—in less serious cases—liberated
by the police, often on a written undertaking
to attend court.
Where an accusation of a more serious
offence is to be made, the accused is brought
before the sheriff in private to be committed,
95
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
either for further examination or until
liberated in due course of law. A judicial
examination may take place. A maximum of
eight days may elapse between committal for
further examination and committal for trial.
Anyone accused of a crime, except
murder or treason, is entitled to apply for
release on bail. Even in cases of murder or
treason, bail may be granted at the discretion
of the Lord Advocate or a quorum of the
High Court.
There is a right of appeal to the High
Court by the accused person against the
refusal of bail, or by the prosecutor against
the granting of bail, or by either party
against the conditions imposed.
If a person charged with a more serious
offence has been kept in custody pending
trial, the trial must begin within 110 days of
the date of full committal. The trial of a
person charged with a summary offence and
held in custody must begin within 40 days of
the date of first appearance in court.
CRIMINAL COURTS
Prosecution
England and Wales
Once the police have decided to charge a
person with a crime, the Crown Prosecution
Service, headed by the Director of Public
Prosecutions, assumes control of the case and
decides whether to prosecute. The Service is
divided into 31 areas, each of which is run
by a locally based Chief Crown Prosecutor
appointed by the Director. The Service
provides prosecution lawyers for the
magistrates’ courts and briefs barristers to
appear in the Crown Court.
Although the decision to prosecute is
generally delegated to the lawyers in the area
offices, some especially sensitive or complex
cases are dealt with by the headquarters of
the Service, including terrorist offences and
breaches of the Official Secrets Acts.
Scotland
Discharging his duties through the Crown
Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the
Lord Advocate is responsible for
prosecutions. The permanent adviser to the
Lord Advocate on prosecution matters is
the Crown Agent, who is head of the
Procurator Fiscal Service and is assisted in
the Crown Office by a staff of legally
qualified civil servants.
Prosecutions in the High Court of
Justiciary are prepared by procurators fiscal
and Crown Office officials. They are
conducted by the Lord Advocate, the
Solicitor General for Scotland (the Lord
Advocate’s ministerial deputy) and advocate
deputes, who are collectively known as
Crown Counsel.
Crimes tried before the sheriff and
district courts are prepared and prosecuted
by procurators fiscal. The police and other
law enforcement agencies investigate
crimes and offences and report to the
procurator fiscal, who decides whether to
prosecute, subject to the directions of
Crown Counsel.
When dealing with minor crime, the
procurator fiscal increasingly makes use of
alternatives to prosecution such as formal
warnings and fixed penalties. The offender
is not obliged to accept such an offer but if
he or she does so the prosecution loses the
right to prosecute.
Northern Ireland
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland prosecutes all offences
tried on indictment, and may do so in
summary cases of a serious nature. Other
summary offences are prosecuted by the
police.
Prosecutions for Fraud
The Serious Fraud Office investigates and
prosecutes the most serious and complex
cases of fraud in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Investigations are
conducted by teams of lawyers,
accountants, police officers and other
specialists. In Scotland the Crown Office
Fraud Unit investigates and prepares—in
co-operation with the police and other
agencies—prosecutions against fraud.
96
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Courts in England and Wales
Very serious offences such as murder,
manslaughter, rape and robbery are tried on
indictment only by the Crown Court, where
all contested trials are presided over by a
judge sitting with a jury.
Summary offences—the least serious
offences and the vast majority of criminal
cases—are tried by unpaid lay magistrates or
by a few paid stipendiary magistrates; both
sit without a jury.
A third category of offences (such as
theft, burglary or malicious wounding) are
known as ‘either way’ offences; they can be
tried either by magistrates or by jury in the
Crown Court, depending on the
circumstances of each case and the wishes of
the defendant.
All those charged with offences to be tried
in the Crown Court must first appear before
a magistrates’ court, which decides whether
to commit them to the Court for trial.
A magistrates court, which is open to the
public and the media, usually consists of
three lay magistrates—known as justices of
the peace—who are advised on points of law
and procedure by a legally qualified clerk or
a qualified assistant.
There are nearly 28,000 lay magistrates.
The few full-time, legally qualified
stipendiary magistrates may sit alone and
usually preside in courts in urban areas
where the workload is heavy.
Cases involving people under 17 (soon to
be 18) are heard in juvenile courts (to
become youth courts). These are specialist
magistrates’ courts which either sit apart
from other courts or are held at a different
time. Restrictions are placed on access by
ordinary members of the public, and media
reports must not identify a young person
appearing either as a defendant (unless a
judge directs otherwise) or a witness.
Where a young person under 17 is
charged jointly with someone of 17 or over,
the case is heard in an ordinary magistrates’
court or the Crown Court. If the young
person is found guilty, the court may
transfer the case to a juvenile court for
sentence unless satisfied that it is undesirable
to do so.
The Crown Court sits at about 90 centres
and is presided over by High Court judges,
full-time ‘circuit judges’ and part-time
recorders.
In cases of serious or complex fraud, full
committal proceedings in magistrates’ courts
may be bypassed at the discretion of the
prosecution. The accused can apply to the
Crown Court to be discharged on the ground
that there is no case to answer.
Appeals
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court
may appeal to the Crown Court against
sentence if he or she has pleaded guilty. The
appeal may be made against both conviction
and sentence if a not guilty plea has been
made.
If convicted by the Crown Court, the
defendant can appeal to the Court of Appeal
against both conviction and sentence
imposed.
The House of Lords is the final appeal
court, but it will only consider cases
that involve a point of law of general
public importance.
The Attorney General may seek the
opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point of
law which has arisen in a case where a
person tried on indictment is acquitted; the
Court has power to refer the point to the
House of Lords if necessary. The acquittal in
the original case is not affected.
The Attorney General may refer a case to
the Court of Appeal if he considers that a
sentence passed by the Crown Court is over-
lenient. This only applies to a case triable
exclusively in the Crown Court. If the Court
of Appeal agrees, it may increase the
sentence within the statutory maximum laid
down by Parliament for the offence.
Scotland
The High Court of Justiciary, which sits in
Edinburgh and other major towns and cities,
tries the most serious crimes and has
exclusive jurisdiction in cases involving
murder, treason and rape. The sheriff court
97
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is concerned with less serious offences and
the district court with minor offences.
Criminal cases are heard either under
solemn procedure, when the judge sits with a
jury of 15 members, or under summary
procedure, when the judge sits without a
jury.
All cases in the High Court and the more
serious ones in sheriff courts are tried by a
judge and jury. Summary procedure is used
in the less serious cases in the sheriff courts,
and in all cases in the district courts. District
court judges are lay justices of the peace. In
Glasgow there are also stipendiary
magistrates who are full-time lawyers with
the same criminal jurisdiction in summary
procedure as the sheriff.
Children under 16 who have committed
an offence are normally dealt with by
children’s hearings (see p 106).
All appeals are dealt with by the High
Court. In both solemn and summary
procedure, an appeal may be brought by the
accused against conviction, or sentence, or
both. The Court may authorise a retrial if it
sets aside a conviction. There is no further
appeal to the House of Lords. In summary
proceedings the prosecutor may appeal on a
point of law against acquittal or sentence.
The Lord Advocate may seek the opinion of
the High Court on a point of law which has
arisen in a case where a person tried on
indictment is acquitted. The acquittal in the
original case is not affected.
Northern Ireland
Cases involving minor summary offences are
heard by magistrates’ courts presided over by
a full-time, legally qualified resident
magistrate. Young offenders under 17 are
dealt with by a juvenile court consisting of
the resident magistrate and two lay members
(at least one of whom must be a woman)
specially qualified to deal with juveniles.
Appeals from magistrates’ courts are heard
by the county court, as are appeals on a
point of law.
The Crown Court deals with criminal
trials on indictment. It is served by High
Court and county court judges. Proceedings
are heard before a single judge, and all
contested cases, other than those involving
offences specified under emergency
legislation, take place before a jury.
Appeals from the Crown Court against
conviction or sentence are heard by the
Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.
Procedures for a further appeal to the House
of Lords are similar to those in England and
Wales.
Those accused of terrorist offences are
tried in non-jury courts. The onus remains
on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond
reasonable doubt and the defendant has the
right to be represented by a lawyer of his or
her choice. The judge must set out in a
written statement the reasons for convicting
and there is an automatic right of appeal
against conviction and sentence. In 1990
some 43 per cent of defendants who pleaded
not guilty to all charges in the non-jury
courts were found not guilty.
Trial
Criminal trials in Britain have two parties:
the prosecution and the defence. Since the
law presumes the innocence of an accused
person until guilt has been proved, the
prosecution is not granted any advantage
over the defence.
An accused person has the right to
employ a legal adviser and may be granted
legal aid from public funds (see p 111). If
remanded in custody, he or she may be
visited by a legal adviser to ensure a properly
prepared defence.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland
the prosecution has the duty to disclose
information to the defence; it must, for
example, inform the defence of witnesses
whose evidence may help the accused and
whom the prosecution does not propose to
call. In Scotland the prosecution must give
to the defence advance notice of the
witnesses it will call.
The defence or prosecution may suggest
that the defendant’s mental state renders him
or her unfit to be tried. If the jury (or in
Scotland, the judge) decides that this is so,
the defendant is admitted to a specified
hospital.
Criminal trials are normally in open court
98
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
and rules of evidence, which are concerned
with the proof of facts, are rigorously
applied. If evidence is improperly admitted,
a conviction can be quashed on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the
right to hear and cross-examine witnesses for
the prosecution, normally through a lawyer.
He or she can call his or her own witnesses
who, if they will not attend voluntarily, may
be legally compelled to do so. The defendant
can also address the court in person or
through a lawyer, the defence having the
right to the last speech at the trial before the
judge sums up. The defendant cannot be
questioned without consenting to be sworn
as a witness in his or her own defence. When
he or she does testify, cross-examination
about character or other conduct may be
made only in exceptional circumstances;
generally the prosecution may not introduce
such evidence. In Northern Ireland the judge
can draw inferences from a refusal by a
defendant to give evidence.
In England and Wales the judge in
complex fraud cases may order a preparatory
open Crown Court hearing to be held. This is
done to give him or her an opportunity to
settle questions regarding admissibility of
evidence and any other points of law relating
to the case. The law on evidence has been
changed to make it possible for courts to have
before them a wider range of written evidence
in the form of business documents which
could be relevant to a successful prosecution.
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the evidence for the jury, and
discharges the accused or passes sentence. In
England, Wales and Northern Ireland the
jury is responsible for deciding whether a
defendant is ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty’, the latter
verdict resulting in acquittal. If the jury
cannot reach a unanimous verdict, the judge
may direct it to bring in a majority verdict
provided that, in the normal jury of 12
people, there are not more than two
dissenters.
In Scotland the jury’s verdict may be
‘guilty’, ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’; the
accused is acquitted if either of the last two
verdicts is given. The jury consists of 15
people and a verdict of ‘guilty’ can only be
reached if at least eight members are in
favour. As a general rule no one may be
convicted without corroborated evidence
from at least two sources.
If the jury acquits the defendant, the
prosecution has no right of appeal and the
defendant cannot be tried again for the same
offence. The defendant, however, has a right
of appeal to the appropriate court if found
guilty.
A jury is independent of the judiciary.
Any attempt to interfere with a jury once it
is sworn in is a criminal offence. Potential
jurors are put on a panel before the start of
the trial. The prosecution and the defence
may challenge individual jurors on the panel,
giving reasons for doing so. In Scotland the
prosecution or defence may challenge up to
three jurors without reason.
People between the ages of 18 and 65 (70
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland)
whose names appear on the electoral register,
with certain exceptions, are liable for jury
service and their names are chosen at
random. Ineligible people include, for
example, judges and people who have within
the previous ten years been members of the
legal profession or the police, prison or
probation services. People convicted of
certain offences within the previous ten years
cannot serve on a jury. Anyone who has
received a prison sentence of five years or
more is disqualified for life.
Coroners’ Courts
Coroners in England and Wales investigate
violent and unnatural deaths or sudden
deaths where the cause is unknown. An
inquest is, however, not necessary if a
sudden death was due to natural causes. The
coroner must hold an inquest if the deceased
died a violent or unnatural death or died in
prison or in other specified circumstances.
(In Northern Ireland the coroner investigates
the matter to decide whether an inquest is
necessary). It is the duty of the coroner’s
court to establish how, when and where the
deceased died. A coroner may sit alone or, in
certain circumstances, with a jury.
99
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Scotland the local procurator fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and
suspicious deaths and may report the
findings to the Crown Office. In a minority
of cases a fatal accident inquiry may be held
before the sheriff; this is mandatory in cases
of death resulting from industrial accidents
and of deaths in custody.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The Government’s aim is to ensure that
convicted criminals are punished justly and
suitably according to the seriousness of their
offences. It believes that those who commit
very serious crimes, particularly crimes of
violence, should receive long custodial
sentences, but that many other crimes can
best be punished within the community
through compensation and reparation. These
principles are contained in the Criminal
Justice Act 1991.
Legislation sets the maximum penalties
for offences, the sentence being entirely a
matter for the courts, subject to these
maxima. The Court of Appeal issues
guidance to the lower courts on sentencing
issues when points of principle have arisen
on individual cases which are the subject of
appeal.
Custody
The Government believes that custody
should be used only for offenders convicted
of serious criminal offences or where the
public needs to be protected from serious
harm from a violent or sexual offender. The
Court of Appeal has stated that sentencers in
England and Wales should ensure that terms
of custody are as short as possible, consistent
with the courts’ duty to protect the public
and to punish the criminal.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 will
require a court in England and Wales, before
giving a custodial sentence, to be satisfied
that the offence is serious enough to merit
custody. The court will also have to give
reasons if it considers a custodial sentence to
be necessary. Longer custodial sentences—
within the statutory maxima—will be
available for persistent violent and sexual
offenders in order to protect the public from
serious harm.
A magistrates’ court in England and
Wales cannot impose a term of more than six
months’ imprisonment for an individual
offence tried summarily; it can impose
consecutive sentences for ‘either way’
offences (see p 97), subject to an overall
maximum of 12 months’ imprisonment. If an
offence carries a higher maximum penalty,
the court may commit the offender for
sentence at the Crown Court.
The Crown Court may impose a custodial
sentence for any term up to life, depending
on the gravity of the sentence and the
maximum penalty available.
In trials on indictment in Scotland the
High Court may impose a sentence of
imprisonment for any term up to life, and
the sheriff court any term up to three years.
The latter may send any person to the High
Court for sentence if the court considers its
powers are insufficient. In summary cases,
the sheriff may normally impose up to three
months’ imprisonment or six months’ for
some repeated offences. The district court
can impose a maximum term of
imprisonment of 60 days.
In Northern Ireland the position is
generally the same as for England and Wales.
A magistrates’ court, however, cannot
commit an offender for sentencing at the
Crown Court if it has tried the case.
In all three legal systems there is a
mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for
murder. Life imprisonment is also the
maximum penalty for a number of serious
offences such as robbery, rape, arson and
manslaughter.
The Death Penalty
The death penalty remains on the statute
book for the offences of treason, piracy with
violence and some other treasonable and
mutinous offences. It has, however, not been
used for any of these offences since 1946.
Non-custodial Treatment
The Government believes that more
offenders, particularly those convicted of
100
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
property crimes and less serious cases of
violence, should be punished in the
community. In its view this should involve
fines levied on the offender and
compensation to the victim, probation,
community service, a new combined order
linking probation and community service, or
a new curfew order to be used by itself or
with other orders.
Fines
Roughly 80 per cent of offenders are
punished with a fine. There is no limit to
the fine (unless set by statute) which may be
imposed on indictment; on summary
conviction the maximum limit is usually
£2,000 in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, and in Scotland £2,000 in the sheriff
court and £1,000 in the district court.
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 will enable
fines to be more closely related to ability to
pay. The court’s penalty will be given in
units which will then be translated into
monetary values according to the offender’s
disposable weekly income. The maximum
fine usually available on summary conviction
will be increased to £5,000.
Probation
The locally organised probation service
supervises offenders in the community under
direct court orders and after release from
custody. It also provides offenders in custody
with help and advice.
A probation order, which can last between
six months and three years, can only be
made by a court with the consent of the
offender, who may be sentenced for the
original offence if he or she fails to comply
with the order or commits another offence
while on probation.
A probation order requires the offender to
maintain regular contact with the probation
officer. Special conditions attached to the
order may require the offender to attend a
day centre for up to 60 days. Although
intended as a punishment, the time spent by
offenders under supervision in the community
offers an opportunity for constructive work
to reduce the likelihood of reoffending.
In England and Wales the probation
service also administers supervision orders,
the community service scheme and
supervises those released from prison on
parole.
National standards are to be introduced
for a wide range of probation work.
Community Service
Offenders aged 16 or over (17 in Northern
Ireland) convicted of imprisonable offences
may, with their consent, be given community
service orders. The court may order between
40 and 240 hours’ unpaid service to be
completed within 12 months; for 16-year-
olds the maximum in England and Wales is
120 hours. Examples of work done include
decorating the houses of elderly or
disabled people and building adventure
playgrounds.
The Criminal Justice Act will introduce a
new court order in England and Wales which
will combine community service and proba¬
tion. The maximum term for the probation
element will be the same as a probation
order and the maximum period of
community service will be 100 hours.
Curfetv Order
Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 courts
in England and Wales will be empowered to
issue a curfew order confining offenders to
their homes at certain times to prevent them
going to places which may be associated with
their offending. It can also be combined
with probation, community service or the
new order linking probation and community
service.
Compensation and Reparation
The courts may order an offender to pay
compensation for personal injury, loss or
damage resulting from an offence. In
England and Wales courts are required to
give reasons for not awarding compensation
to a victim. Compensation takes precedence
over fines.
Courts may order the confiscation of
proceeds gained by a criminal from drug
101
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
trafficking and other offences such as
robbery, fraud, blackmail and insider dealing
in shares.
Other Measures
A court in England and Wales may discharge
a person if it believes that punishment
should not be inflicted and a probation order
is not appropriate. If he or she is
conditionally discharged, the offender
remains liable to punishment for the offence
if convicted of another offence within a
period specified by the court (not more than
three years).
The Crown Court can require an offender
to keep the peace and/or be of good
behaviour. If this requirement is not
complied with, the offender may be brought
before the court and dealt with for the
original offence. Alternatively a sum of
money may be forfeited if conditions stated
by the court are not met.
In Scotland there is a system of deferral
of sentence until a future date. During this
period the accused is required to be of good
behaviour and to meet any other conditions
stipulated by the court. The court may also
warn the offender or grant an absolute
discharge.
Police cautions are used particularly for
young offenders; the caution is a form of
warning and no court action is taken.
Prisons
The Government aims to provide a humane
and efficient prison service. The average
inmate population in 1990 was about 45,600
in England and Wales, 4,724 in Scotland and
1,750 in Northern Ireland.
Prisoners may be housed in accommodation
ranging from open prisons to high security
establishments. In England, Scotland and
Wales sentenced prisoners are classified into
groups for security purposes. There are
separate prisons for women.
There are no open prisons in Northern
Ireland, where the majority of offenders are
serving sentences for terrorist offences.
People awaiting trial in custody are
entitled to privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners. Those under 21 are, where
possible, separated from convicted prisoners.
Building on the recommendation of the
Woolf Report on the 1990 prison
disturbances, a White Paper, published in
September 1991, set out a programme of
reforms for the prison service in England
and Wales, focusing on the main areas of
custody, care and justice.
The Government is seeking to foster
greater private sector involvement in the
prison system of England and Wales. Under
the Criminal Justice Act 1991 competitive
tenders will be invited from the private
sector for the operation of new remand
centres and for the work of escorting
prisoners to and from courts and
safeguarding them at court.
Many prisons in Great Britain were built
in the nineteenth century and require major
repairs to bring them up to modern
standards. In order to ensure that all
prisoners are housed in decent conditions, a
major programme of improvement is in
progress in England and Wales which will,
for example, eliminate by 1994 cells without
access to integral sanitation. Overcrowding is
being relieved by a prison building
programme; by March 1994 over 7,000
places at new prisons will have been added
in England and Wales, and about 3,000 new
places at existing establishments.
In Northern Ireland there is no over¬
crowding in the six prison establishments,
five of which have been built since 1970.
Remission of Sentence
Most prisoners in Great Britain are eligible
for remission of one-third of their sentence.
Prisoners serving a sentence of 12 months or
less in England and Wales are entitled to half
remission. Release on remission does not
involve any official supervision in the
community. It may be forfeited for serious
misconduct in prison.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland prisoners serving a
sentence of more than five days are eligible
for remission of half their sentence. A
102
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
prisoner serving a sentence of more than 12
months who is given remission is liable to
be ordered to serve the remainder of this
sentence if convicted of fresh imprisonable
offences during this period.
The rate of remission for those convicted
of terrorist offences and serving sentences of
five years or more is one-third. Any released
prisoners convicted of another terrorist
offence before the expiry of the original
sentence must complete that sentence before
serving any term for the second offence.
Parole
In England and Wales prisoners serving
sentences of more than 12 months can be
conditionally released on parole when they
have served one-third of the sentence, or six
months, whichever expires the later. In
Scotland they qualify after 12 months.
The first stage in England and Wales is
consideration by a local review committee
attached to each prison. This is followed by
scrutiny by Home Office officials, who refer
the more difficult and complex cases to the
Parole Board, which makes
recommendations for release on parole.
Home Office ministers take the final
decision on whether to accept the
recommendation. Less serious cases are
dealt with by the Home Office without
reference to the Board on the basis of the
local review committee recommendation.
A similar procedure operates in Scotland,
where there is a separate Parole Board.
Of those cases reviewed in England and
\\ ales each year, three-quarters of prisoners
serving sentences of less than two years
receive parole; the corresponding figure for
those serving two years or more is about a
half. Parole is only granted in exceptional
circumstances, or for a few months at the
end of a sentence, for those serving
sentences of over five years for violence,
arson, sexual offences or drug trafficking.
The parole licence remains in force until the
date on which the prisoner would otherwise
have been released from prison. It prescribes
the conditions, including contact with a
supervising officer, with which the offender
must comply.
Parole is not available in Northern
Ireland, which has more generous remission
terms.
New Legislation
The Criminal Justice Act 1991 is designed to
reform the remission and parole systems in
England and Wales. Remission will be
abolished, as will parole, for prisoners
serving under four years; instead, they will
spend half their sentence in custody and
then be released. All prisoners sentenced to a
year or more will be supervised on release
until three-quarters of their sentence has
passed. Certain sex offenders may be
supervised to the end of their sentence.
For the remainder there will be a selective
system of parole based on clear and
published criteria. Prisoners sentenced will
become eligible for parole halfway through
their sentence. If convicted of another
offence punishable with imprisonment and
committed before the end of the original
sentence, a released prisoner will be liable to
serve all or part of the original sentence
outstanding at the time the fresh offence was
committed.
Similar changes are to be made in
Scotland.
Life Sentence Prisoners
The release of prisoners serving life
sentences is at the discretion of the Home
Secretary or the Secretary of State for
Scotland, subject to a favourable
recommendation by the relevant parole board
and after consultation with the judiciary.
The Secretaries of State do not, however,
have to accept such a recommendation for
release, nor are they bound by the views of
the judiciary.
People serving life sentences for the
murder of police and prison officers, terrorist
murders, murder by firearms in the course of
robbery and the sexual or sadistic murder of
children are normally detained for at least 20
years. At the end of 1990 there were about
2,700 life sentence prisoners detained in
prisons in England and Wales, of whom
about 270 had been detained for over 15
103
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
years. The equivalent figures in Scotland
were 437 and 31 respectively.
On release, life sentence prisoners remain
on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall should their behaviour
suggest that they might again be a danger to
the public.
In Northern Ireland the Secretary of State
reviews life sentence cases on the
recommendation of an internal review body.
Repatriation
Sentenced prisoners who are nationals of
countries which have ratified the Council of
Europe Convention on the Transfer of
Sentenced Persons or similar international
arrangements may apply to be returned to
their own country to serve the rest of their
sentence there.
Independent Oversight of the Prison System
The Secretary of State appoints a board of
visitors, as representatives of the local
community, to act as voluntary independent
observers at every establishment. Boards
report to him annually and whenever any
matter of particular concern arises. Members
see that prisoners are treated fairly and that
the prison is properly administered. They
can go to any part of the prison and
interview any inmate at any time.
Prison Industries, Physical Education and
Education
Prison industries aim to give inmates work
experience which will assist them when
released and to secure a return which will
reduce the cost of the prison system. The
main industries are clothing and textile
manufacture, engineering, woodwork,
laundering, farming and horticulture. Most
production caters for internal needs and for
other public services. A few prisoners are
employed outside prison, some in community
service projects. Inmates are paid at pocket
money rates for work done; in some prisons
incentive payment schemes provide an
opportunity for higher earnings on the basis
of output and skill.
Education is financed by the prison
service and staffed by local education
authorities. Full-time education of 15 hours
a week is compulsory for young offenders
below school leaving age. For older
offenders it is voluntary. Some prisoners
study for public examinations, including
those of the Open University. Library
facilities are available in all
establishments. Voluntary vocational
training courses are taught by prison and
civilian instruction officers in order to
assist prisoners to get a job after
release.
Physical education is voluntary for adult
offenders but compulsory for young
offenders. Practically all prisons have
physical education facilities, some of which
are purpose built. Opportunities are given
for inmates to obtain proficiency awards
issued by governing bodies of sport. Inmates
also compete against teams in the local
community.
Medical and Psychiatric Care
The prison medical service has a general
responsibility for the physical and mental
health of all those in custody. Most
establishments have accommodation for sick
people and some have surgical facilities.
Patients can also be transferred to National
Health Service hospitals. Psychiatric care is
available.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners may write and receive letters and
be visited by relatives and friends, and those
in some establishments may make telephone
calls. Privileges include a personal radio,
books, periodicals and newspapers, and the
opportunity to make purchases from the
canteen with money earned in prison.
Depending on facilities, prisoners may be
granted the further privileges of dining and
recreation in association, and watching
television.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by
the prison governor, or by the boards of
visitors, who have power to order forfeiture
of remission.
104
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
Welfare
Prison officers deal with welfare matters and
are supported in this by probation staff (in
Scotland, social workers), who use their own
professional skills to help individual
prisoners understand more about the nature
of their offending behaviour.
Religion and Spiritual Care
Anglican, Church of Scotland, Roman
Catholic and Methodist chaplains provide
opportunities for worship and spiritual
counselling. They are supported by visiting
ministers of other denominations and faiths
as required. In a multi-faith and
multicultural society particular attention is
given to the needs of those of non-Christian
faiths and ethnic minorities.
Preparation for Release
Many medium- and long-term prisoners in
the later parts of their sentences may be
granted home leave for periods of between
two and five days. Its purpose is to give the
prisoner the opportunity to maintain links
with family and friends, and, where leave is
taken near the end of the sentence, to
contact prospective employers and make firm
plans for release.
The Pre-Release Employment Scheme
provides an opportunity for selected long¬
term prisoners to spend their last six months
before release in one of eight hostels, which
are attached to prisons, to help them re¬
adapt to society. Hostellers work in the
outside community and return to the hostel
each evening. Frequent weekend leave allows
hostellers to renew ties with their families.
In Northern Ireland arrangements exist
for prisoners serving fixed sentences to have
short periods of leave near the end of their
sentences and at Christmas. Life-sentence
prisoners are given a nine-month pre-release
programme which includes employment
outside the prison.
Aftercare
Professional social work support is given to
offenders following their release. Most young
offenders under the age of 22, adult
offenders released on parole and those
released on licence from a life sentence
receive a period of compulsory supervision
from the probation service.
Young Offenders
England and Wales
If charged with a criminal offence, children
aged between 10 and 16 are brought before a
juvenile court which will be renamed as the
youth court. If the child is found guilty, the
court may:
• grant a conditional or absolute discharge;
• order payment of compensation;
• impose a fine which the parents can be
ordered to pay;
• impose a supervision order or attendance
centre order;
• impose a community service order (for
16-year-olds) for up to 120 hours; or
• in some cases, pass a custodial sentence.
A court can also issue a care order under
which the child becomes the responsibility of
local government social services. From
October 1991, however, care orders in
criminal proceedings will be abolished and
juvenile courts will no longer hear care
proceedings.
Under a supervision order (which may
remain in force for not more than three
years) a child normally lives at home under
the supervision of a social worker or a
probation officer. The order can be used to
provide for a programme of constructive and
remedial activities by means of a short
residential course or, more usually,
attendance at a day or evening centre.
The terms of an attendance centre order
mean that the offender has to spend a total
of up to 24 hours of his or her Saturday
leisure time (up to three hours on any one
occasion) at an attendance centre.
Boys aged between 14 and 16, for whom a
non-custodial sentence would not be
appropriate, may be sent to a young offender
institution; for those aged 14 the maximum
105
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
period is four months and for those aged 15
or 16 it is 12 months. This sentence is also
available for girls from the age of 15. In the
case of a very serious crime, detention in a
place approved by the Home Secretary may
be ordered, and must be ordered in the case
of murder.
The custodial sentence for those aged
between 17 and 20 years is also detention in
a young offender institution. The use of
custody for this group has dropped by 40
per cent since 1985. Alternative penalties
include fines and compensation, attendance
centre orders (for up to 36 hours) and
community service orders (for between 40
and 240 hours).
When the Criminal Justice Act 1991
enters into force, it will make major changes
in the arrangements for dealing with young
offenders. In future, 17-year-olds will be
dealt with in the juvenile or youth court. For
16-year-olds the maximum length of a
community service order will be extended to
240 hours, and that for an attendance centre
order to 36 hours—in line with the
arrangements for 17-year-olds. In addition,
probation orders, supervision orders and the
new combination and curfew orders will be
available for 16- and 17-year-olds. Detention
in a young offender institution for 14-year-
olds is being abolished.
Scotland
Children under 16 who have committed an
offence or are considered to be in need of
care and protection may be brought before a
children’s panel which consists of three lay
people. This children’s hearing determines in
an informal setting whether compulsory
measures of care are required and, if so, the
form they should take. An official ‘reporter’
decides whether a child should come before a
hearing. If the grounds for referral are not
accepted by the child or parent, the case goes
to the sheriff for proof. If he finds the
grounds established, the sheriff remits the
case to the reporter to arrange a hearing.
The sheriff also decides appeals against any
decision of a children’s hearing.
Custody is available to the courts for
young people aged between 16 and 21; as in
England and Wales they serve their sentence
in a young offender institution. Remission of
part of the sentence for good behaviour,
release on parole and supervision on release
are available.
Northern Ireland
Those aged between 10 and 16 who are
charged with a criminal offence will normally
be brought before a juvenile court. If found
guilty of an offence punishable in the case of
an adult by imprisonment, the court may
order the child or young person to be placed
in care, under supervision or on probation.
The offender may also be required to attend
a day attendance centre, be sent to a training
school or committed to custody in a remand
home. Non-custodial options are the same as
in England and Wales.
Offenders aged between 17 and 21 who
receive custodial sentences of less than three
years serve them in a young offenders’
centre.
Civil Justice
The Civil Law
The civil law of England, Wales and
Northern Ireland covers business related to
the family, property, contracts and torts
(non-contractual wrongful acts suffered by
one person at the hands of another). It also
includes constitutional, administrative,
industrial, maritime and ecclesiastical law.
Scottish civil law has its own, broadly
similar, branches.
CIVIL COURTS
England and Wales
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’
courts extends to matrimonial proceedings
for custody and maintenance orders,
adoption orders, guardianship orders and
family protection orders. The courts also
have jurisdiction regarding public health and
the recovery of local taxes.
The jurisdiction of the 286 county courts
covers:
106
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
• actions founded upon contract and tort;
• trust and mortgage cases;
• action for the recovery of land;
• adoption and divorce cases;
• cases involving disputes between
landlords and tenants;
• complaints about race and sex
discrimination; and
• from October 1991, child care cases.
There are special arbitration facilities and
simplified procedures for small claims not
exceeding £1,000. The judge normally sits
alone although, in exceptional cases, a trial
may be with a jury.
The High Court deals with the more
complicated civil cases. Its jurisdiction covers
civil and some criminal cases, and it also
deals with appeals. The Family Division is
concerned with jurisdiction affecting the
family, including that relating to wardship,
adoption and guardianship. The Chancery
Division deals with the interpretation of wills
and the administration of estates. Maritime
law and commercial law are the responsibility
of admiralty and commercial courts of the
Queen’s Bench Division.
In the event of overlapping jurisdiction
between the High Court and the County
court, cases of exceptional importance,
complexity or financial substance are
reserved for trial in the High Court. County
courts are no longer restrained by an
upper financial limit in cases, except for
some specialist business such as chancery
matters.
New court rules have been introduced to
reduce delay, encourage openness between
parties and cut the cost of litigation.
Appeals
Appeals in matrimonial, adoption and
guardianship proceedings heard by
magistrates’ courts go to the Family Division
of the High Court. From October 1991
appeals on child care cases will also be
dealt with by the High Court. Appeals from
the High Court and county courts are heard
in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division),
and may go on to the House of Lords, the
final court of appeal in civil and criminal
cases.
The judges in the House of Lords usually
sit as a group of five. Lay peers do not
attend the hearings of appeals, which
normally take place in a committee room,
but peers who hold or have held high
judicial office may also sit. The president of
the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord
Chancellor.
Scotland
The main civil courts are the Court of
Session and the sheriff court. The sheriff
court has jurisdiction over most civil
litigation. Although there is no upper
monetary limit, it considers all cases with a
value of less than £1,500. Appeals may be
made to the sheriff principal or directly to
the Court of Session. This does not apply
where the value of the case is under £1,500,
when an appeal must first be made to the
sheriff principal, who may sanction an appeal
to the Court of Session on a point of law
only.
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh,
and in general has jurisdiction to deal with
all kinds of action. It is divided into the
Outer House, a court of first instance; and
the Inner House, mainly an appeal court.
Appeals to the Inner House may be made
from the Outer House and from the sheriff
court. From the Inner House an appeal may
go to the House of Lords.
The Scottish Land Court deals
exclusively with matters concerning
agriculture. Its chairman has the status and
tenure of a judge of the Court of Session and
its other members are lay specialists.
Northern Ireland
Civil cases up to a limited and specified
monetary value are dealt with in county
courts, though magistrates’ courts also deal
with certain limited classes of civil case. The
superior civil law court is the High Court of
Justice, from which an appeal may be made
to the Court of Appeal. The House of Lords
is the final civil appeal court.
107
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Civil Proceedings
England and Wales
In England and Wales civil proceedings are
started by the aggrieved person. Actions in
the High Court are usually begun by a writ
served on the defendant by the plaintiff,
stating the nature of the claim. Before the
case is set down for trial in the High Court,
documents (pleadings) setting out the scope
of the dispute are filed with the court; the
pleadings are also served on the parties.
County court proceedings are initiated by a
summons usually served on the defendant
by the court. From October 1991, child care
cases will be initiated by an application.
In order to encourage parties to confine
the issues in dispute, the High Court and
the county courts have power to order pre¬
trial exchange of witness statements in most
cases. Courts may impose penalties in costs
on parties who unreasonably refuse to admit
facts or disclose documents before trial.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced
in open court, but a procedure for most
undefended cases dispenses with the need to
give evidence in court and permits written
evidence to be considered by the district
judge.
Civil proceedings, as a private matter,
can usually be abandoned or ended by
settlement between the parties at any time.
Actions brought to court are usually tried
without a jury, except in defamation, false
imprisonment, or malicious prosecution
cases, when either party may apply for trial
by jury. The jury decides questions of fact
and determines damages to be paid to the
injured party; majority verdicts may be
accepted. Under recent legislation the Court
of Appeal would be able to increase or
reduce damages awarded by a jury if it
considered them inadequate or excessive.
In civil cases heard by a magistrates’
court, the court issues a summons to the
defendant setting out details of the
complaint and the date on which it will be
heard. Parties and witnesses give their
evidence at the court hearing. Domestic
proceedings are normally heard by not more
than three lay justices, including, where
practicable, a woman; members of the public
are not allowed to be present. The court may
order provision for custody, access and
supervision of children, as well as
maintenance payments for spouses and
children.
The law has been changed recently to
speed up civil proceedings in magistrates’
courts by allowing written statements, expert
opinions and hearsay evidence to be accepted
in court without the presence of the witness
unless the evidence is disputed and the
disputing party requests the presence of the
witness.
Most judgments are for sums of money
and may be enforced, in cases of non¬
payment, by seizure of the debtor’s goods or
by a court order requiring an employer to
make periodic payments to the court by
deduction from the debtor’s wages. Other
court remedies may include an injunction
restraining someone from performing an
unlawful act. Refusal to obey a court order
may result in imprisonment for contempt.
An arrest under an order of committal may
be effected only on a warrant.
Normally the court orders the costs of an
action to be paid by the party losing it, but,
in the case of family law maintenance
proceedings, a magistrates’ court can order
either party to pay the whole or part of the
other’s costs.
Scotland
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of
Session or ordinary actions in the sheriff
court are initiated by serving the defender
with a summons (an initial writ in the sheriff
court). A defender who intends to contest
the action must inform the court; if he or
she does not appear, the court grants a
decree in absence in favour of the pursuer.
Where a case is contested, both parties must
prepare written statements. Time is allowed
for either party to readjust their statement in
the light of what the other has said. The
court then hears the case.
In summary cases (involving small sums)
in the sheriff court the statement of claim is
incorporated in the summons. The procedure
is designed to enable most actions to be
108
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
carried through without the parties involved
having to appear in court. Normally they
(or their representatives) need appear only
when an action is defended. A new small
claims procedure was introduced in 1988.
Northern Ireland
There are a number of differences between
proceedings in Northern Ireland and those in
England and Wales, for example, procedures
regarding divorce or pre-trial disclosure.
Restrictive Practices Court
The Restrictive Practices Court is a
specialised United Kingdom court dealing
with monopolies and restrictive trade
practices. It comprises five judges and up to
ten other people with expertise in industry,
commerce or public life.
Administrative Tribunals
Administrative tribunals exercise judicial
functions separate from the courts and tend
to be more accessible, less formal and less
expensive.
Some tribunals decide disputes between
private citizens—for example, industrial
tribunals have a major role in employment
disputes. Others, such as those concerned
with social security, resolve claims by
private citizens against public authorities. A
further group (including tax tribunals)
decide disputed claims by public authorities
against private citizens, while others decide
cases concerning immigration into Britain.
In the case of many tribunals, a two-tier
system operates, with an initial right of
appeal to a lower tribunal and a final right
of appeal, usually on a point of law, to a
higher one. Appeals from some of the
higher tribunals on a point of law only may
be made to the High Court in England and
Wales, to the Court of Session in Scotland,
and to the Court of Appeal in Northern
Ireland. There are a few exceptions
including, for example, immigration appeals,
where there is no right of appeal directly
from the Immigration Appeals Tribunal to
the courts.
The independent Council on Tribunals
exercises general supervision over many
tribunals, advising on draft legislation and
rules of procedure, monitoring their activities
and reporting on particular matters. A
Scottish Committee of the Council exercises
the same function in Scotland.
Administration of the Law
GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Administration of justice rests with the Lord
Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the
Attorney General and the Secretaries of
State for Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The highest judicial appointments are made
by the Queen on the advice of the Prime
Minister. The judiciary is independent, its
adjudications not being subject to ministerial
direction or control.
England and Wales
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the
judiciary. He is concerned with court
procedure and is responsible for the
administration of all courts other than
magistrates’ and coroners’ courts, and for a
number of administrative tribunals. He
recommends all other judicial appointments
to the Crown and appoints magistrates. He
has general responsibility for the legal aid
and advice schemes and for the
administration of civil law reform.
The Home Secretary is concerned with
the criminal law, the police service, prisons,
and the probation and after-care service. He
has general supervision over magistrates’
courts and approves the appointment of
justices’ clerks. He appoints a board of
visitors to each prison establishment (see
p 104). He is advised by the Parole Board on
the release of prisoners on licence. The
Home Secretary is also responsible for
advising the Queen on the exercise of the
royal prerogative of mercy to pardon a
person convicted of a crime or to remit all or
part of a penalty imposed by a court.
The Attorney General and the Solicitor
General are the Government’s principal
advisers on English law, and they represent
109
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the Crown in appropriate domestic and
international cases. They are senior
barristers, elected members of the House of
Commons and hold ministerial posts. The
Attorney General is also Attorney General
for Northern Ireland. As well as exercising
various civil law functions, the Attorney
General has final responsibility for enforcing
the criminal law. The Solicitor General is, in
effect, the deputy of the Attorney General.
As head of the Crown Prosecution Service,
the Director of Public Prosecutions is subject
to superintendence by the Attorney General,
as are the Director of the Serious Fraud
Office and the Director of Public
Prosecutions for Northern Ireland.
Scotland
The Secretary of State for Scotland
recommends the appointment of all judges
other than the most senior ones, appoints the
staff of the High Court of Justiciary and the
Court of Session, and is responsible for the
composition, staffing and organisation of the
sheriff courts. District courts are staffed and
administered by the district and islands local
authorities.
The Secretary of State is also responsible
for the criminal law of Scotland, crime
prevention, the police, the penal system and
legal aid; he is advised on parole matters by
the Parole Board for Scotland.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish
questions and the principal representatives of
the Crown for the purposes of litigation in
Scotland. Both are government ministers.
The Lord Advocate is closely concerned with
legal policy and administration, and is
responsible for the Scottish parliamentary
counsel. He must exercise an independent
discretion when prosecuting crime.
Northern Ireland
The administration of all courts is the
responsibility of the Lord Chancellor, while
the Northern Ireland Office, under the
Secretary of State, deals with the criminal
law, the police and the penal system. The
Lord Chancellor has general responsibility
for legal aid, advice and assistance.
THE PERSONNEL OF THE LAW
The courts of the United Kingdom are the
Queen’s Courts, since the Crown is the
historic source of all judicial power. The
Queen, acting on the advice of ministers, is
responsible for all appointments to the
judiciary.
Judges
Judges are normally appointed from
practising barristers, advocates (in Scotland),
or solicitors (see below).
Lay magistrates in England and Wales
need no legal qualifications but are trained to
give them sufficient knowledge of the law,
including the rules of evidence, and of the
nature and purpose of sentencing.
The Scottish district court justices of the
peace need no legal qualifications, but they
too must take part in training.
In Northern Ireland members of a lay
panel who serve in juvenile courts undertake
training courses; resident magistrates are
drawn from practising solicitors or barristers.
The Legal Profession
The legal profession is divided into two
branches: barristers (advocates in Scotland)
and solicitors.
Barristers are known collectively as the
‘Bar’, and collectively and individually as
‘counsel’.
Solicitors undertake legal business for indi¬
vidual and corporate clients, while barristers
advise on legal problems submitted through
solicitors and present cases in the higher
courts. Certain functions are common to both,
for example, presentation of cases in the lower
courts. Although people are free to conduct
their own cases, most people prefer to be
legally represented in the more serious cases.
Recent legislation is designed to increase
the provision of good quality legal services
for clients in Great Britain by lifting
restrictions on who can provide these
services. Solicitors will be eligible to appear
110
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
in the higher courts. Building societies,
banks and other financial organisations can
offer conveyancing services under a scheme
providing important new safeguards to
clients. People in England and Wales
wanting to take legal action will be able, like
those in Scotland, to negotiate a form of ‘no
win, no fee’ agreement, in personal injury
cases, with their legal advisers.
The system of complaints against legal
practitioners has been strengthened by the
creation of a Legal Services Ombudsman
able to investigate how the professional
bodies handle these complaints. Similar
proposals regarding legal services in
Northern Ireland are being considered.
LEGAL AID
A person in need of legal advice or legal
representation in court may qualify for help
with the costs out of public funds, either free
or with a contribution according to means
under the various legal aid schemes.
Green Form Scheme
People whose income and savings are within
certain limits are entitled to help from a
solicitor on legal matters (with the exception
of conveyancing and, in some cases, the
making of a will in England and Wales).
Such help includes advice on the relevant
law, writing letters on the client’s behalf, and
taking the opinion of a barrister or advocate.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it
may be extended to cover representation in
civil proceedings in the magistrates’ court,
Mental Health Review Tribunal hearings and
certain disciplinary proceedings before prison
boards of visitors.
In England and Wales the scheme
provides for initial work to be done up to a
limit of three hours’ worth of work for
matrimonial cases where a petition is drafted
and two hours’ worth for other work. There
are cost limits in Northern Ireland.
Legal Aid in Civil Proceedings
Legal aid, which covers representation before
the court, may be available for most civil
proceedings to those who satisfy the financial
eligibility conditions. An applicant for legal
aid must also show not only that he or she
has reasonable grounds for taking or
defending proceedings—or being a party to
proceedings—but also that it is reasonable
that he or she should receive legal aid. If
legal aid is granted, the case is conducted in
the normal way; in England and Wales all
payments to lawyers are made through the
Legal Aid Fund administered by the Legal
Aid Board.
In certain limited circumstances the
successful unassisted opponent of a legally
aided party may recover his or her costs in
the case from the Legal Aid Fund. Where
the assisted person recovers or preserves
money or property in the proceedings, the
Legal Aid Fund will usually have a first
charge on that money or property to recover
money spent on the assisted person’s behalf.
Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings
In criminal proceedings in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland a legal aid certificate
may be granted by the court if it appears to
be in the interests of justice and if a
defendant is considered to require assistance
in meeting his or her costs. A certificate
must be granted (subject to means) when a
person is committed for trial on a murder
charge or where the prosecutor appeals or
applies for leave to appeal from the Court of
Appeal to the House of Lords. No person
who is unrepresented can be given a
custodial sentence for the first time unless
given the opportunity to apply for legal aid.
The Legal Aid Board in England and
Wales makes arrangements for duty solicitors
to be present at magistrates’ courts to
provide initial advice and representation to
unrepresented defendants. Solicitors are
available, on a 24-hour basis, to give advice
and assistance to suspects at police stations.
The services of a solicitor at a police station
and the duty solicitor at court are free.
In Scotland there is a duty solicitor
scheme for accused people in custody in
sheriff and district court cases. An ‘interests
of justice’ and ‘means’ test applies only in
summary cases, where decisions on
111
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
applications for legal aid are taken by the
Scottish Legal Aid Board.
In Northern Ireland a voluntary duty
solicitor scheme has been introduced at the
principal magistrates’ court in Belfast.
Legal aid for criminal cases in Scotland
and Northern Ireland is free.
Law Centres
In a number of urban areas law centres
provide free legal advice and representation.
Financed from various sources, often
including local government authorities, they
usually employ full-time salaried lawyers and
many have community workers. Much of
their time is devoted to housing,
employment, social security and immigration
problems.
Free advice is also available in Citizens
Advice Bureaux, consumer and housing
advice centres and in specialist advice centres
run by various voluntary organisations.
LAW REFORM
In England and Wales the Law
Commission is responsible for reviewing
the law and making recommendations for
its simplification and modernisation. The
Lord Chancellor also occasionally refers
specific topics to the Law Reform
Committee, nominating as members
experts in the particular field of law
involved. In criminal law matters the
Home Secretary acts similarly with the
Criminal Law Revision Committee. Any
changes in the law are a matter for
legislation.
Law reform in Scotland is the
responsibility of the Scottish Law
Commission, which reports to the Lord
Advocate. In Northern Ireland the Law
Reform Advisory Committee, which
reports to the Secretary of State, reviews
certain aspects of the civil law and makes
recommendations for reform.
112

Social Welfare
The British social welfare system comprises
the National Health Service (NHS), the
personal social services and social security.
The NHS provides a full range of medical
services which are available to all residents,
regardless of their income. Local authority
personal social services and voluntary
organisations provide help and advice to the
most vulnerable members of the community.
These include elderly, physically disabled,
mentally ill and mentally handicapped people
and children in need of care. The social
security system is designed to secure a basic
standard of living for people in financial
need by providing income during periods of
inability to earn (including periods of
unemployment), help for families and
assistance with costs arising from
disablement.
Central government is directly responsible
for the NHS, administered by a range of
health authorities and boards throughout
Britain acting as its agents, and for the social
security system. Personal social services are
administered by local authorities but central
government is responsible for establishing
national policies, issuing guidance and
overseeing standards. Joint finance and
planning between health and local authorities
aims to prevent overlapping of services and
to encourage the development of community
services.
Planned spending on social welfare in
1991-92 is: health nearly £31,000 million
and social security benefits over £60,000
million, while the standard spending
assessment for personal social services is
some £4,800 million.
Spending on the health service has
increased substantially in real terms since
1980, and is planned to grow further over
the next two years. More patients are being
treated than ever before. Spending on social
security is rising because of increased
numbers of beneficiaries, especially
retirement pensioners, and the long-term sick
and disabled. The value of retirement and
most other long-term benefits has also
increased in real terms since 1980. Spending
on the personal social services is determined
by local authorities. Central government has
restricted the total expenditure of individual
local authorities, but spending has risen
substantially in real terms since the late
1970s, reflecting the priority given to this
sector.
National Health Service and
Community Care Act 1990
The National Health Service and
Community Care Act 1990 has introduced
wide-ranging reform in management and
patient care in the health and social care
services. The NHS reforms came into effect
in April 1991. Their aim is to give patients,
wherever they live in Britain, better health
care and greater choice of service. (For fuller
details see pp 115, 117 and 118.) The
reforms in community care provision, which
take effect between April 1991 and April
1993, establish a new financial and
managerial framework which aims to secure
the delivery of good quality services in line
with national objectives. They are intended
to enable vulnerable groups in the
community to live as normal a life as
possible in their own homes, and to give
them a greater say in how they live and how
the services they need should be provided.
(For fuller details see p 130.)
National Health Service
The NHS is based upon the principle that
there should be a full range of publicly
113
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
provided services designed to help the
individual stay healthy. The services are
intended to provide effective and appropriate
treatment and care where necessary while
making the best use of available resources.
All taxpayers, employers and employees
contribute to its cost so that those members
of the community who do not require health
care help to pay for those who do. Some
forms of treatment, such as hospital care, are
provided free; others (see p 115) may be
charged for.
Growth in real spending on the health
service is being used to meet the needs of
increasing numbers of elderly people, to take
full advantage of advances in medical
technology and to remedy shortfalls in areas
such as renal services. It is also used to
provide more appropriate types of care, often
in the community rather than in hospital, for
priority groups such as the elderly, the
mentally ill and people with mental
handicaps. Increased spending is, in addition,
intended to combat the growing health
problems arising from alcohol and drug
misuse; and to remedy disparities in
provision between the regions of Britain.
The Government emphasises the
importance of preventive health services, and
the responsibility of individuals for their own
health. While great progress has been made
in eliminating infectious diseases such as
poliomyelitis and tuberculosis, there has been
less success in controlling the major causes
of early death and disability—heart disease,
cancer and stroke. Most recently the threat
of AIDS (see p 125) has proved a serious
problem for public health services.
Because of the close link between such
diseases and individual behaviour, emphasis
is placed on helping people to adopt
healthier ways of living. In June 1991 the
Government published a consultation paper
containing proposals for a health strategy for
England. Entitled The Health of the Nation,
this outlines plans to reduce preventable
diseases which lead to ill health and early
death.
The Government stresses the need for a
partnership between the public and private
health sectors and for improving efficiency in
order to secure the best value for money and
the maximum patient care. Measures to
achieve more effective management of
resources in the NHS have included:
• appointing at regional, district and unit
levels general managers drawn from
inside and outside the health service;
• improving the accountability of health
authorities for the planning and
management of their resources;
• increasing the proportion of total staff
who provide direct patient care, such as
doctors and nurses; and
• introducing a range of programmes to
provide services at lower cost.
Considerable savings have been made
through the policy of competitive tendering
for hospital cleaning, portering, catering and
laundry services. Economies are also made in
prescribing by restricting the use of
expensive branded products in favour of
cheaper but equally effective equivalent
medicines.
ADMINISTRATION
The Secretary of State for Health in England
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland are responsible
for all aspects of the health services in their
respective countries. The Department of
Health is responsible for national strategic
planning in England. The Scottish Office
Home and Health Department, the Welsh
Office and the Department of Health and
Social Services in Northern Ireland have
similar responsibilities.
District health authorities in England and
Wales and health boards in Scotland are
responsible for planning and operational
control of all health services in their areas.
England, because of its greater size and
population, also has regional authorities
responsible for regional planning, resource
allocation, major capital building work and
certain specialised hospital services. The
authorities and boards co-operate closely
with local authorities responsible for social
work, environmental health, education and
other services. Family health services
authorities (health boards in Scotland)
114
SOCIAL WELFARE
arrange for the provision of services by
doctors, dentists, pharmacists and opticians,
and administer their contracts. Community
health councils represent local opinion on the
health services provided. (In Scotland this
function is exercised by local health
councils.)
In Northern Ireland health and social
services boards are responsible for all health
and personal social services in their areas.
The representation of public opinion on
these services is provided for by area health
and social services councils.
Major Reforms in Management
Under the National Health Service and
Community Care Act 1990 a number of
major reforms in organising and financing
the NHS have been introduced.
1. Health authorities have been given a new
role as purchasers of health care on behalf of
their local residents, responsible for assessing
local health care needs and ensuring that
those needs are met within existing
resources.
2. Each health authority is funded to buy
health care for its local residents through
arranging contracts with hospitals and other
health service units—in either the public or
private sectors. Under this system hospitals
compete to sell their treatments to the health
authorities. For the first time hospitals are
directly funded for the number of patients
they treat, making it easier for family doctors
(general practitioners or GPs) to refer
patients outside their area if treatment
elsewhere is faster and better. Powers exist
for allocating resources where the urgent
need for treatment does not allow NHS
contracts to be arranged in advance.
3. The contracts agreed between health
authorities and hospitals set out the quality,
quantity and cost of the services to be
delivered during the year. The contracts
secured by each health authority are based
on wide consultation with all local GPs.
4. Hospitals may apply to become self-
governing NHS trusts (see p 118),
independent of local health authority control,
but remaining within the NHS, accountable
to the relevant health department and funded
largely through general taxation.
5. Family doctors from larger medical
practices may apply to join the general
practitioner fundholding scheme (see p 117),
under which they receive an annual budget
directly from the health authority, enabling
them to buy certain hospital services for
their patients.
Broadly similar changes have been
introduced in Northern Ireland under
separate legislation.
Finance
Nearly 80 per cent of the cost of the health
service in Great Britain is paid for through
general taxation. The rest is met from the
NHS contribution paid with the National
Insurance contribution and from the charges
towards the cost of certain items such as
drugs prescribed by a family doctor, and
dental treatment. Health authorities may
raise funds from voluntary sources. Certain
hospitals increase their revenue by taking
private patients who pay the full cost of their
accommodation and treatment.
Around 75 per cent of medical
prescription items are supplied free.
Prescription charges do not apply to the
following: children under 16 years (or
students under 19 and still in full-time
education); expectant mothers and women
who have had a baby in the last year; women
aged 60 and over and men aged 65 and over;
patients suffering from certain medical
conditions; war and armed forces
disablement pensioners ; people who are
receiving income support or family credit
(see p 140); and families with low incomes.
There are proportional charges for all types
of general dental treatment including dental
examination. However, women who are
pregnant or who have had a baby in the last
year, anyone under the age of 18 (or 19 if in
full-time education), people receiving income
support or family credit, and families on low
incomes do not have to pay. Sight tests are
free to children, those on low incomes and
certain other priority groups. Some disadvan¬
taged groups receive help for the purchase,
repair and replacement of spectacles.
115
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Family practitioners (doctors, dentists,
opticians and pharmacists) are self-employed
and have contracts with the NHS. Family
doctors are paid by a system of fees and
allowances designed to reflect responsibilities,
workload and practice expenses. Dentists
providing treatment in their own surgeries
are paid by a combination of capitation fees
for treating children, continuing care
payments for adults registered with the
practice, and a prescribed scale of fees for
individual treatments. Pharmacists dispensing
from their own premises are refunded the
cost of the items supplied, together with
professional fees. Ophthalmic medical
practitioners and ophthalmic opticians
taking part in the general ophthalmic service
receive approved fees for each sight test
made.
Staffing
The NHS is one of the largest employers
in the world, with a workforce of nearly
1 million people. Staff costs account for two-
thirds of total NHS expenditure and three-
quarters of current expenditure on hospitals
and community health services. Between
1981 and 1989:
• the number of nursing and midwifery
staff, who make up 51 per cent of the
workforce, increased by 41 per cent;
• the number of medical and dental staff
by 13-8 per cent; and
• the number of scientific, professional and
technical staff by 25 per cent.
Health Service Commissioners
There are three posts of Health Service
Commissioner (one each for England,
Scotland and Wales) for dealing with
complaints from members of the public
about the health service. The three posts are
held by the same person, who is also the
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration (Ombudsman), who reports
annually to Parliament. The Health Service
Commissioner can investigate complaints that
a health authority or family health services
authority has not carried out its statutory
duties, has provided an inadequate service
or, through maladministration, has caused
injustice or hardship. Complaints about
clinical judgment, personnel matters and the
use of a health authority’s discretionary
powers lie beyond the Health Service
Commissioner’s jurisdiction, and separate
procedures exist for these. In Northern
Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints has
a similar role.
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The family health services are those given to
patients by doctors, dentists, opticians and
pharmacists of their own choice. Family
doctors provide the first diagnosis in the case
of illness and either prescribe a suitable course
of treatment or refer a patient to the more
specialised services and hospital consultants.
About four-fifths of family doctors in
Britain work in partnerships or group
practices, often as members of primary
health-care teams. The teams also include
health visitors and district nurses, and
sometimes midwives, social workers and
other professional staff employed by the
health authorities. About a quarter of family
doctors in Great Britain and over half in
Northern Ireland work in modern and well-
equipped health centres, where medical and
nursing services are provided. Health centres
may also have facilities for health education,
family planning, speech therapy, chiropody,
assessment of hearing, physiotherapy and
remedial exercises. Dental, pharmaceutical
and ophthalmic services, hospital outpatient
and supporting social work services may also
be provided.
There have been substantial increases in
primary health care staff in recent years. For
example, in England between 1978 and 1989,
the number of family doctors increased by 22
per cent (to 25,600) and average patient list
size fell by 15 per cent (to 1,970), while the
number of family dentists increased by 28
per cent (to 15,000). Practice staff have
increased by 95 per cent since 1978, and
within that total the number of practice
nurses has grown by 425 per cent.
Special funds have been earmarked by the
Government for improving the quality of
116
SOCIAL WELFARE
primary health care in inner city areas.
Efforts have also been made to improve
health services for black and ethnic minority
groups. These include new health projects in
Britain’s Chinese communities, and increased
central funding for health information
material to be produced in many minority
languages.
Eye Services
Only ophthalmic opticians and ophthalmic
medical practitioners may test sight.
Entitlement to free NHS sight tests is
restricted to people on low incomes, children
and those with particular medical needs.
Spectacles are supplied by registered
ophthalmic and dispensing opticians but
unregistered retailers may also sell spectacles
to adults under carefully prescribed
conditions. Children, people on low incomes
and those requiring certain complex lenses
receive a voucher to put towards the cost of
their spectacles.
Recent Developments
GP Fundholders
Under the 1990 Act GP practices with 9,000
patients or over may apply for fundholding
status. They then become responsible for
their own NHS budgets, enabling them to
buy certain non-urgent hospital services.
Prescription charges and part of the cost of
running the practice are also covered. Fund-
holders may negotiate directly with hospitals
from both public and private sectors in any
district or regional health authority. By
March 1991 over 300 practices—covering
nearly 4 million people or 7 5 per cent of the
population—were awaiting final approval as
fundholders.
Contracts
A new performance-related contract for GPs
came into effect in April 1990. It is designed
to raise standards of care, extend the range
of services available to patients and improve
patient choice. The changes are intended to
make it easier for patients to see their GP at
times convenient to them and easier for
patients to change doctors; and to encourage
doctors to practise more preventive medicine.
A new contract for dentists was
introduced in October 1990. As a result
NHS dental care now includes preventive
care as well as restorative treatment. Under
the contract patients are offered continuing
care, and dentists are encouraged to practise
more preventive dentistry for children.
There are also incentives for dentists to
undertake further training.
Medical Audit
Medical audit systems, which are intended to
enable doctors at all levels in the health
service to review the quality of the medical
care they give to their patients, have been
introduced in all health authorities. In
1991-92 the Government is allocating
£46 million to continue to develop medical
audit in the hospital and community health
services.
Health Visitors, District Nurses and
Midwives
Health visitors are responsible for the
preventive care and health education of
families, particularly those with young
children. They work closely with GPs,
district nurses and other professions. District
nurses give skilled nursing care to people at
home or elsewhere outside hospital; they also
play an important role in health promotion
and education. Although almost all babies are
born in hospital, some antenatal care and
most postnatal care is given in the
community by midwives and GPs, who also
care for women having their babies at home.
Midwives are responsible for educating and
supporting women and their families during
the child-bearing period.
HOSPITALS AND SPECIALIST
SERVICES
A full range of hospital services is provided
by district general hospitals. These include
treatment and diagnostic facilities for in¬
patients, day-patients and outpatients;
117
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
maternity departments; infectious disease
units; psychiatric and geriatric facilities;
rehabilitation facilities; convalescent homes
and all forms of specialised treatment. There
are also specialist hospitals or units for
children, people suffering from mental illness
or mental handicaps, and elderly people, and
for the treatment of specific diseases.
Examples of these include the world-famous
Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond
Street, and the Brompton Heart and Chest
Hospital in London. Hospitals designated as
teaching hospitals combine treatment
facilities with training medical and other
students, and research work.
Many of the hospitals in the NHS were
built in the nineteenth century; some, such
as St Bartholomew’s and St Thomas’ in
London, trace their origins to much earlier
charitable foundations. Much has been done
to improve and extend existing buildings and
many new hospitals have been or are being
opened. Since 1979 in Great Britain 580
health building schemes, each costing £1
million or more, have been completed. A
further 225 schemes are at various stages of
development.
Recent policy in England and Wales has
been to provide a balanced hospital service
centred around a district general hospital,
complemented as necessary by smaller,
locally based hospitals and facilities.
The world’s first low-energy nucleus
hospital, which is expected to use less
than half the energy of a conventional
nucleus hospital, opened on the Isle of
Wight in late 1990, and another is being
built in Northumberland.
The latest development in hospital
planning in England and Wales is the nucleus
hospital. This is designed to accommodate a
full range of district general hospital facilities
and is capable of being built in self-contained
phases or as an extension to an existing
hospital. By mid-1991, 70 nucleus hospitals
had been completed. A further 57 are at
various stages of development. Those already
open have proved economical to build and
are providing high-quality and cost-effective
services to patients.
The hospital service is now treating more
patients a year than ever before. Between
1978 and 1989-90 lengths of stay for
in-patients declined and the number of
people treated as day patients more than
doubled. Over 1 million cases are now dealt
with in this way. Newer forms of treatment
and diagnosis are being made more widely
available. These include kidney dialysis, hip
replacements, laser treatment for certain eye
conditions, and body scanning.
In 1986 the Government launched a drive
to reduce hospital waiting lists and times. In
1991-92 the Government is investing
£35 million in a variety of projects, including
mobile operating theatres, to improve waiting
times for patients.
Community services such as the
psychiatric nursing service, day hospitals,
and local authority day centres have
expanded so that more patients remain in the
community and others are sent home from
hospital sooner.
Self-governing NHS Trusts
Under the National Health Service and
Community Care Act 1990 hospitals and
other health service units may apply to
become independent of health authority
control and establish themselves as self-
governing NHS trusts. These are run by
boards of directors, and are free to employ
their own staff, conduct research and provide
facilities for medical education and other
forms of training. Self-governing NHS trusts
derive their income mainly through NHS
contracts to provide services to health
authorities and GP fundholders. The trusts
may treat private patients. All trusts must
provide annual reports, and annual accounts
modelled on commercial accountancy
practices. By August 1991, 57 NHS trusts
had been established.
Private Medical Treatment
The Government’s policy is for the NHS
and the independent sector to co-operate in
meeting the nation’s health needs. It believes
that this will benefit the NHS by adding to
the resources devoted to health care and
118
SOCIAL WELFARE
offering flexibility to health authorities in the
delivery of services. Some health authorities
share expensive facilities and equipment with
private hospitals, and NHS patients are
sometimes treated (at public expense) in the
private sector to reduce waiting lists.
The scale of private practice in relation to
the NHS is, however, small. There are
113,000 beds in the independent health care
sector, while approximately 3,000 beds in
health service hospitals in England are
authorised for private patients.
It is estimated that about three-quarters of
those receiving acute treatment in private
hospitals or NHS hospital pay-beds are
covered by health insurance schemes which
make provision for private health care in
return for annual subscriptions. Over
3 million people subscribe to such schemes,
half of them within group schemes, some
arranged by firms on behalf of employees.
Subscriptions often cover more than one
person (for example, members of a family)
and the total number of people covered by
private medical insurance in Britain is
estimated at over 6 million. The Government
has introduced tax relief on private health
insurance premiums paid by people aged 60
and over to encourage the increased use of
private health facilities.
Many overseas patients come to Britain for
treatment in private hospitals and clinics, and
Harley Street in London is an internationally
recognised centre for medical consultancy.
There is a growing interest in alternative
therapies such as homoeopathy, osteopathy
and acupuncture, which are mainly practised
outside the NHS.
Organ Transplants
Over the past 25 years there have been
significant developments in transplant
surgery in Britain. The United Kingdom
Transplant Support Service Authority
provides a centralised organ matching and
distribution service. Around 8,000 people in
Britain were living with functioning kidney
transplants, and during 1990 over 1,800
kidney transplants were performed. A similar
service exists for corneas, and in 1990, over
2,000 were transplanted.
Heart transplant operations have been
conducted at Papworth Hospital in
Cambridgeshire and Harefield Hospital in
London since 1979. There are five other
heart transplant centres in England, while
Scotland’s first unit is scheduled to open in
Glasgow in late 1991.
A programme of combined heart and
lung transplants is in progress and in 1990,
over 280 heart and 94 heart-lung
transplants were performed. The world’s
first combined heart, lungs and liver
transplant operation was carried out at
Papworth in 1987. Over 350 liver
transplants were also performed in 1990.
A voluntary organ donor card system
enables people to indicate their willingness
to become organ donors in the event of
their death. Commercial dealing in organs
intended for transplant is illegal.
Blood Transfusion
The blood transfusion service in England
and Wales collects over 2 million donations
of blood and over 130,000 donations of
plasma each year from voluntary unpaid
donors; in Scotland the figures are over
330,000 and over 15,000 respectively.
Regional transfusion centres recruit donors
and organise donor sessions in towns and
villages, factories and offices, and within the
armed forces. Donors are normally aged
between 18 and 65. The centres are also
responsible for blood grouping and testing,
maintaining blood banks, providing a
consultancy service to hospitals, teaching in
medical schools, and instructing doctors,
nurses and technicians.
The Central Blood Laboratories
Authority is responsible for the
manufacture of blood products as well as
for research. There is also increasing
emphasis on the most effective use of blood
and, in particular, its separation into
components such as plasma for specific
uses. A laboratory at Elstree, Hertfordshire,
was opened in 1987 with the aim of
meeting the needs for all blood products in
England and Wales. Facilities in Scotland
are being expanded to cope with rising
demand.
119
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ambulance Services
The health authorities provide free
transport by ambulance for accident and
emergency patients and urgent maternity
cases. Transport is also provided for some
people needing non-emergency outpatient
treatment at hospitals, clinics and day
hospitals. In some areas voluntary
organisations using their own vehicles or
volunteers using their own cars help with
non-urgent cases. In 1991 fast-response
pilot schemes were introduced in London,
the West Midlands area, and in four
Scottish cities, in which paramedics use cars
and motorcycles to reach emergency cases.
In Scotland an air ambulance service is
available in the islands and in the remoter
parts of the mainland. Helicopter
ambulances also serve several parts of
England.
Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation begins at the onset of illness
or of injury and continues throughout, with
the aim of helping people to adjust to
changes in life-style and to live as normally
as possible. Rehabilitation services are
available for elderly, young, disabled,
mentally ill and mentally handicapped
people who need such help to resume life
in the community. These services are
offered in hospitals, centres in the
community and in people’s own homes
through co-ordinated work by a range of
professional workers.
Medical services may provide free
artificial limbs and eyes, hearing aids,
surgical supports, wheelchairs, and other
appliances. Following assessment, very
severely physically handicapped patients
may be provided with environmental
control equipment which enables them to
operate devices such as alarm bells, radio
and television, telephones, and heating
appliances. Nursing aids may be provided
on loan for use in the home.
Local authorities may provide a range of
facilities to help patients in the transition
from hospital to their own homes. These
include the provision of aids, care from
home helps, and professional help from
occupational therapists and social workers.
Voluntary organisations also provide help,
complementing the work of the statutory
agencies and widening the range of
services.
Hospices
A number of hospices provide care for the
terminally ill (including children) either
directly in in-patient or day care units or
through nursing and other assistance in the
patient’s own home. Control of symptoms
and psychological support for patients and
their families form central features of the
modern hospice movement, which started
in Britain and is now worldwide. Some
hospices are administered entirely by the
NHS; the remainder are run by
independent charities, some receiving
support from public funds.
The Government is seeking to provide a
level of public funding for the hospice
movement which matches voluntary
donations. In 1991—92, £17 million was
allocated to health authorities to enable
them to offer increased support to hospices
and similar organisations, while a further
£3 2 million was allocated to enable them
to arrange for drugs to be supplied to
hospices without charge. The Government
has also provided an initial £150,000 to
support research into standards of palliative
care.
Parents and Children
Special preventive services are provided
under the health service to safeguard the
health of expectant mothers and of mothers
with young children. Services include free
dental treatment, dried milk and vitamins;
health education; and vaccination and
immunisation of children against certain
infectious diseases (see p 126). Pregnant
women receive antenatal care from their
family doctor and hospital clinics, and
women in paid employment have the right
to visit the clinics during working hours.
Some 99 per cent of women have their
babies in hospital, returning home shortly
120
SOCIAL WELFARE
afterwards to be attended by a midwife or
health visitor and, where necessary, the
family doctor. The Government attaches
great importance to improving the quality of
maternity services, and to making them more
sensitive to the needs and wishes of mothers
and their families. The perinatal mortality
rate (the number of stillbirths and deaths in
the first week of life) has fallen in England
and Wales from 14 6 per 1,000 births in
1979 to 81 per 1,000 births in 1990. A
similar reduction has occurred in Scotland
and Northern Ireland.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance is provided for pre-school
children in clinics run by the community
health authorities, and increasingly by family
doctors. This enables doctors, dentists and
health visitors to oversee the physical and
mental health and development of pre-school
children. Information on preventive services
is given and welfare foods are distributed.
The school health service offers health care
and advice for schoolchildren, including
medical and dental inspection and treatment
where necessary.
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice for children
with psychological or emotional problems.
In recent years special efforts have been
made to improve co-operation between the
community-based child health services and
local authority social services for children.
This is particularly important in the
prevention of child abuse and for the health
and welfare of children in care.
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born
in Britain in 1978, as a result of the
technique of in vitro fertilisation. This
opened up new horizons for helping with
problems of infertility and for the science of
embryology. The social, ethical and legal
implications were examined by a committee
of inquiry under Baroness Warnock, which
reported in 1984. Legislation implementing
the main recommendations of this report was
passed in 1990. The Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act, which came into effect in
August 1991, provides for:
• The establishment of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority
(HFEA) to regulate certain infertility
treatments and human embryo research
centres.
• Research to be conducted on embryos
for up to 14 days after fertilisation.
• The legal status and rights of children
born as a result of the new treatments.
• The clarification of the legal position on
surrogate motherhood (the practice
where one woman bears a child for
another).
The HFEA is responsible for issuing a
code of practice for such centres and must
report annually to Parliament.
These provisions constitute one of the
most comprehensive pieces of legislation on
assisted reproduction and embryo research in
the world.
Legislation to ban commercial surrogacy
agencies, and advertising of or for surrogacy
services, was passed in 1985.
Family Planning
Free family planning advice and treatment are
available to women from family doctors and
from health authority family planning clinics,
which also make services available to men.
Abortion
The Abortion Act 1967 allows the ending of
pregnancy by a doctor if two doctors
consider that continuing the pregnancy
would be more damaging to the well-being
of the woman (or to any existing children in
the family) than having an abortion. An
abortion may also be allowed if two doctors
consider there is a substantial risk that if the
child were born it would have a severe
physical or mental handicap. In 1990
amendments to the Act introduced a 24-week
time limit for abortions, but stipulated no
time limit where there is risk of grave
permanent injury to the health of the
woman, or substantial risk of serious foetal
handicap.
Abortions are carried out in NHS
hospitals or in private premises approved for
121
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the purpose by the Secretary of State. Over
half of the legal abortions to women resident
in England and Wales in 1990 were
performed in private hospitals and clinics; in
Scotland, 97 per cent of abortions take place
in NHS hospitals.
The Act does not apply in Northern
Ireland.
Drug Misuse
The misuse of dangerous drugs, such as
heroin, cocaine and amphetamines, is a
serious social and health problem, and the
Government has made the fight against such
misuse a major priority. Its strategy
comprises action to reduce the supply of
illicit drugs from abroad; to promote more
effective law enforcement by the police and
Customs services; and to maintain tight
controls on medicinal drugs that can be
misused. It also includes action to maintain
effective deterrents against misuse; to
develop effective programmes to treat and
rehabilitate misusers; and to prevent people
who are not misusers from starting, by
means of educational programmes and
publicity campaigns.
Research on various aspects of drug
misuse is funded by several government
departments. The Government is advised on
a wide range of matters relating to drug
misuse and connected social problems by the
Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs.
Prevention
The Government has set up a drugs advisory
service to advise district health authorities on
the development of facilities in their areas. It
continues to make funds available for local
education authorities in England and Wales
to appoint staff to promote and co-ordinate
preventive work in their areas, especially for
anti-drug-misuse work in schools. As part of
the National Curriculum (see p 152),
children in primary and secondary schools
receive education on the dangers of drug
misuse. Since 1986 the Government has
supported expenditure of over £14 million to
drugs education.
The Government’s Drug Prevention
Initiative has provided funding for the
establishment of local drug prevention teams
in 20 areas in England, Scotland and Wales.
Their task is to strengthen community
resistance to drug misuse. Separate measures
have been introduced in Scotland to
discourage drug misuse through publicity
campaigns and action in the education
service and the community.
Publicity Campaigns
As part of its prevention policy, the
Government began a major publicity
campaign in 1985 to persuade young people
not to take drugs, and to advise parents,
teachers and other professional staff on how
to recognise and combat the problem.
Subsequent phases of the campaign have
warned of the dangers of heroin misuse and
of the risks of transmitting HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus), the virus which
causes AIDS (see p 125), through the
sharing of injecting equipment. In 1990 the
Government launched a further £3 8 million
campaign to promote awareness of the
dangers of drug misuse among young people.
In 1991-92 the campaign is focusing on local
drugs problems and local methods of
prevention.
Treatment and Rehabilitation
A total of £17-5 million over the three years
1988-89 to 1990-91 was spent on the
development of services for drug misusers.
Additional sums have been made available
since 1986-87 through the health authorities
in England for the expansion of services for
drug misusers, rising to nearly £16’5 million
in 1991-92. A further grant of £2 million in
1991-92 is intended to help local authorities
to develop voluntary sector services for drug
as well as alcohol misusers. Similar projects
are in progress in Wales and in Scotland,
where over £2 million is made available
annually to health boards for the support of
drug misuse services. To reduce the spread
of AIDS a number of trial schemes are in
progress, offering drug misusers counselling
and the exchange of clean for used syringes
and needles.
122
SOCIAL WELFARE
Treatment for drug dependence is
provided mainly on an outpatient basis.
Many hospitals provide specialist treatment
for drug misusers, mainly in psychiatric
units, or have special drug treatment units.
An increasing number of family doctors also
treat drug misusers, but only certain
specialist doctors are licensed to prescribe
heroin, cocaine and dipipanone (Diconal). All
doctors must notify the authorities of any
patient they consider to be addicted to
certain controlled drugs, and guidelines on
good medical practice in the treatment of
drug misuse have been issued to all doctors
in Great Britain. The Home Secretary has
statutory powers for dealing with doctors
found to have prescribed irresponsibly.
Other Sources of Provision
A number of non-statutory agencies work
with and complement the health service
provision. Advice and rehabilitation services
including residential facilities, for example,
are provided mainly by voluntary
organisations. Support in the community is
provided by the probation service and local
social services departments.
Solvent Misuse
Action is also being taken by the Government
to curb the problem of solvent misuse (the
breathing in of vapour from glue, lighter fuel
and other substances) by young people. In
England and Wales it is an offence to supply
such substances to children under 18 if the
supplier knows or has reason to believe they
are to be used to cause intoxication.
Information and guidance material have been
distributed to retailers, parents, teachers and
other professional workers to help them
educate young people on the dangers of the
habit and warn them against experimenting.
Work in these areas is increasing in 1991—92.
In Scotland the misuse of a solvent is a ground
for referral to a children’s hearing (see p 106).
Smoking
Cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable
cause of illness and death in Britain. It
accounts for around 110,000 premature
deaths and 30 million lost working days each
year, and costs the NHS an estimated £500
million a year for the treatment of diseases
caused by smoking (for example, heart
disease, lung cancer and bronchitis). In
addition, smoking by pregnant women can
cause low birth weight in infants. The
Government is following an active health
education policy supported by voluntary
agreements with the tobacco industry aimed
at reducing the level of smoking.
Health Education
The Government aims to reduce adult
smoking from the present level of 32 per
cent to 21 per cent among women and 22
per cent among men by the year 2000. A
further aim is to reduce smoking by young
people by one-third by 1994. A £2 million a
year campaign directed at those aged 11 to
15 started in late 1989 and is planned to last
until 1994. In late 1991 the Government will
launch a £1 million campaign over two years
to alert women to the dangers of smoking
during pregnancy.
Education on the harmful effects of
smoking is included in the National
Curriculum for all pupils in publicly
maintained schools in England and
Wales.
The Government also supports the work
of the voluntary organisation Action on
Smoking and Health (ASH), whose services
include a workplace services consultancy,
offering advice and help to employers in
formulating smoking policies. The
Government encourages the restriction of
smoking on public transport and in public
buildings. Health authorities have been asked
to promote non-smoking as the normal
practice in health service buildings and to
give help and advice to people who want to
give up smoking. The Independent Scientific
Committee on Smoking and Health estimates
that ‘passive smoking’, especially in the
workplace and the home, may cause several
hundred deaths through lung cancer every
year.
123
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Voluntary Agreements
Voluntary agreements between the
Government and the tobacco industry
regulate the advertising and promotion of
tobacco products, and sports sponsorship by
the industry. The agreement on tobacco
advertising provides for the use of six
different health warnings about the dangers
of smoking and contains measures to protect
groups at particular risk, such as children,
young people and women in early child¬
bearing years. In September 1991 a new
agreement was signed, under which the
tobacco industry is to reduce shopfront
advertising by 50 per cent by 1996. The
voluntary agreement on sports sponsorship
covers levels of spending, restrictions on
sponsorship of events chiefly for spectators
under 18 years and controls over the siting
of advertising at televised events.
Legislative Measures
It is illegal to sell any type of tobacco
product to children. Cigarette advertising is
banned on television and radio, and cigar
advertisements are to be banned on television
from October 1991. The Government
proposes to replace some aspects of the
voluntary system relating to health warnings
on tobacco products and tar yield by
legislation in 1992.
Alcohol Misuse
The far-reaching effects of alcohol misuse in
terms of illness, family break-ups,
inefficiency at work, loss of earnings,
accidents and crime are widely
acknowledged. The Government considers
that the reduction of such misuse requires a
range of action by central and local
government, voluntary and community
bodies, the health professions, business and
trade unions. It believes that emphasis
should be placed on policies to prevent
alcohol misuse and continues to seek better
information about the causes of problem
drinking. It also seeks to encourage healthier
life-styles, and to provide earlier help for the
problem drinker.
Treatment and rehabilitation include
in-patient and outpatient services in general
and psychiatric hospitals and specialised
alcoholism treatment units. Primary care
teams (GPs, nurses and social workers) and
voluntary organisations providing hostels,
day centres and advisory services also play an
important role.
There is close co-operation between
statutory and voluntary organisations. The
national voluntary agency, Alcohol Concern,
which is receiving a government grant of
£583,000 for 1991-92, plays a prominent role
in the prevention of misuse, training for
professional and voluntary workers, and
improving the network of local voluntary
agencies and their collaboration with
statutory bodies. In 1990 Alcohol Concern
launched a workplace advisory service with
initial government funding of £100,000 as
part of a campaign to persuade companies
that alcohol misuse is an industrial as well as
a social problem. From 1990—91 to 1993—94 a
total government contribution of £4 million
will be allocated to Alcohol Concern for
improving and extending the network of
advisory and counselling services. The
Scottish Council on Alcohol undertakes
similar work in Scotland. Research and
surveys on various aspects of alcohol misuse
are funded by several government
departments.
In 1987 the Government established an
interdepartmental group to develop strategy
for combating the misuse of alcohol.
Measures taken include legislative changes as
well as steps to secure better health
education and more effective action by local
services and organisations. Legislation came
into force in 1988 to strengthen the law
banning the sale of alcohol to people under
18 years. At the same time, stricter controls
on alcohol advertising were introduced.
People appearing in advertisements must
now be seen to be over 25 years of age;
excessive drinking is not to be encouraged,
shown or implied; and alcohol is not to be
advertised alongside aggressive or anti-social
behaviour. Independent television restricts
the advertising of alcohol in programmes
aimed at young people.
In 1989 the Government announced
124
SOCIAL WELFARE
increased funding for the Health Education
Authority’s expanded alcohol education
programme. This aims to reduce the harm
caused by the misuse of alcohol by
promoting sensible drinking as part of a
healthy way of life. It also seeks to develop a
climate of opinion which favours appropriate
measures to prevent alcohol-related harm.
Alcohol misuse co-ordinators have been
appointed in each of the 14 regional health
authorities in England with the aim of
developing strategies to counter the misuse
of alcohol.
AIDS
The number of cases of AIDS reported in
Britain continues to rise: by the end of June
1991 there were 4,758 cases, of whom 2,747
(58 per cent) had died. Recent statistics show
a steady increase in the number of AIDS
cases among injecting drug users and people
infected through heterosexual intercourse.
Government measures to limit the spread
of AIDS have included measures to maintain
the safety of blood and blood products
through publicity aimed at blood donors, the
screening of blood donations, the treatment
of blood products for haemophiliacs, and the
development of public education campaigns
at national and local level.
Public Education Campaigns
The first major public education campaign
on AIDS was launched in 1987. This
comprised television, radio, cinema and
poster advertising, the establishment of a free
national telephone advisory service and the
delivery of leaflets to all households in
Britain. Subsequent campaigns and
educational work have been directed at the
general population and specific groups
including students and young people,
women, homosexual and bisexual men,
people travelling overseas, and at drug
misusers who risk contracting AIDS through
sharing infected needles and syringes. By the
end of 1990-91 the Government had
allocated over £50 million to this work.
Separate educational packages have also been
prepared for particular groups of people,
including prison staff and prisoners,
schoolchildren, and employers. National
campaigns are now being supplemented by
local HIV prevention initiatives run by
health and local authorities and the
voluntary sector. The Government has
asked each district to appoint an HIV
prevention co-ordinator to lead this work
for which additional funds have been
provided. The Government continues to
spend more on HIV/AIDS health education
than on any other single health education
programme.
Funding for Services
The Government continues to make
additional funding available to health
authorities and local authorities for
treatment and advisory services, needle
exchange schemes for drug misusers (see
p 123) and training staff. In 1991-92,
£137 million is being provided to health
authorities and £10 million to local
authorities towards the costs of providing
HIV-related services. Government grants of
£76 million have been allocated to the
Macfarlane Trust to help haemophiliacs in
Britain who have become infected with HIV
as a result of treatment with infected blood
products. The anonymous and voluntary
named screening tests for HIV began in
January 1990. The first results of
anonymised testing carried out in sexually
transmitted disease clinics and in antenatal
clinics indicated a high incidence of HIV in
the London area. In response to this in May
1991 the Government set up an AIDS
Action Group to reinforce prevention
initiatives in areas with high incidence of
AIDS.
Research
In 1987 a £31 million research programme
was launched with the aim of developing
both a vaccine to prevent HIV infection and
drugs to treat people already infected. A
new drug, ‘Retrovir’ (zidovudine—AZT),
which can improve the health of some
people with AIDS, has been developed by a
British pharmaceutical company.

Voluntary Agencies
A number of voluntary agencies receive
financial support from the Government
(some £1-9 million in 1991-92). Among
them, the Terrence Higgins Trust, London
Lighthouse and the Scottish AIDS Monitor
promote knowledge about the disease and
help people with AIDS and HIV. Both
London Lighthouse and the Mildmay
Mission Hospital provide hospice care and
community support.
International Co-operation
Britain gives high priority to international
efforts to reduce the spread of HIV and
AIDS. The Government fully supports the
work of the World Health Organisation
(WHO) in leading and co-ordinating
international action, and has committed £21
million to the WHO’s Global Programme on
AIDS, which is helping developing countries
to establish and develop national AIDS
control programmes. Britain has also
pledged £7-5 million in support of WHO-
co-ordinated national programmes in Africa
and the Caribbean.
Other assistance includes a grant of nearly
£3 million over six years to the International
Planned Parenthood Federation for AIDS-
related activities; about £0-9 million for small
AIDS projects jointly funded by non¬
governmental organisations and some £3
million for research into the demographic,
behavioural, social and economic aspects of
AIDS in the developing world.
The European Community allocated about
£23-3 million to AIDS projects through its
Development Fund in 1987—91, of which
Britain’s attributed share was £4 7 million.
Infectious Diseases
District health authorities (health boards in
Scotland) carry out programmes of
immunisation against diphtheria, measles,
rubella (for women of child-bearing age and
girls only), poliomyelitis, tetanus,
tuberculosis and whooping cough. A new
combined vaccine against measles, mumps
and rubella was introduced in 1988 to
replace that for measles for children in the
second year of life. A new programme for
immunisation, which is designed to provide
earlier protection for children, was
introduced in 1990. Immunisation is
voluntary, but parents are encouraged to
protect their children. The proportion of
children being vaccinated has been increasing
since the end of 1978. In 1990 the
Government introduced special payments to
GPs who achieve targets of 70 and 90 per
cent uptake of child immunisation. The
response to these targets has been
encouraging in many areas.
The Public Health Laboratory Service
provides a network of bacteriological and
virological laboratories throughout England
and Wales which conduct research and assist
in the diagnosis, prevention and control of
communicable diseases. Microbiological work
in Scotland and Northern Ireland is carried
out mainly in hospital laboratories.
Cancer Screening
Breast cancer accounts for some 13,000
deaths in England each year. To help
combat this, the Government is setting up a
nation-wide breast cancer screening service
for all women aged between 50 and 64. The
aim of the programme is to reduce breast
cancer deaths among women invited for
screening by 25 per cent by 2000. The
service is now available in most areas, and all
eligible women in England and Wales should
have their mammography screening
invitations by 1993 (and in Scotland and
Northern Ireland by 1994).
About 1,700 women die each year in
England from cancer of the cervix. The
cervical screening programme aims to reduce
such deaths by inviting women at risk to be
screened regularly. All district health
authorities in England have computerised
call and recall systems, which enable all
women aged between 20 and 64 to be
invited regularly for cervical cancer
screening. Similar arrangements apply in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Special payments are made to GPs who
achieve uptake targets of 50 and 80
per cent.

SOCIAL WELFARE
Health Education
In England health education is promoted
by the Health Education Authority, a part
of the NHS with the major executive
responsibility for public education in
Britain about AIDS (see p 125). In
addition, in England the Authority’s
functions are:
• to advise the Government on health
education;
• plan and carry out health education
programmes in co-operation with
health authorities and other bodies; and
• sponsor research and evaluation.
It also assists the provision of training,
and provides a national centre of
information and advice on health
education. Major campaigns carried out by
the Authority include those that focus on
coronary heart disease (represented by the
Look After Your Heart initiative), smoking
and alcohol misuse.
In Wales these functions are undertaken
by the Welsh Health Promotion Authority.
The Health Education Board for Scotland
and the Northern Ireland Health
Promotion Agency are responsible for
health education in their areas.
Almost all health authorities have their
own health education service, which works
closely with health professionals, health
visitors, community groups, local
employers and others to determine the
most suitable local programmes. Increased
resources in the health service are being
directed towards health education and
preventive measures.
Healthier Eating
There has been growing public awareness
in recent years of the importance of a
healthy diet. Following recommendations
issued by the Committee on Medical
Aspects of Food Policy (COMA), the
Government has advised people to reduce
their intake of fats, particularly saturated
fats, sugar and salt, since this could help to
reduce the possibility of cardiovascular
disease.
Nutritional labelling indicating the
energy, fat, protein and carbohydrate
content of food is being encouraged on a
voluntary basis. Some supermarket chains
have already introduced voluntary labelling
schemes.
To help people reduce their fat intake,
the Government has issued guidelines
on the labelling of food to show
nutrient content in a standard format.
Current work by COMA includes a
review of the relationship between diet and
cardiovascular disease; and matters relating
to the nutrition of infants, children and the
elderly. In 1989 the Committee issued a
report on the role of dietary sugars in
human disease and on the diets of British
schoolchildren. In July 1991 it published a
major report containing comprehensive
information on recommended personal
intakes of food energy and nutrients.
The four health promotion departments
in Britain have all run public information
campaigns promoting healthy eating.
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
Environmental health officers employed by
local authorities are responsible for the
control of air pollution and noise, and food
hygiene and safety. Their duties also cover
the occupational health and safety aspects of
a variety of premises, including offices and
shops; the investigation of unfit housing;
and in some instances refuse collection and
home safety. Doctors who specialise in
community medicine and are employed by
the health authorities advise local authorities
on the medical aspects of environmental
health, infectious diseases and food
poisoning. They may also co-operate with
the authorities responsible for water supply
and sewerage. Environmental health officers
at ports and airports carry out duties
concerned with shipping, inspection of
imported foods and disease control. In
Northern Ireland district councils are
responsible for noise control; collection and
disposal of refuse; clean air; and food
composition, labelling and hygiene.
127
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Safety of Food
It is illegal to supply food unfit for human
consumption or to apply any treatment or
process to food which makes it harmful to
health. Places where food or drink is
prepared, handled, stored or sold must
conform to certain hygiene standards.
Environmental health officers may take for
examination samples of any food on sale or
being distributed. Special regulations control
the safety of particular foods such as milk,
meat, ice-cream and shellfish.
The Food Safety Directorate was
established within the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1989, to
maintain the safety and quality of Britain’s
food supplies. A consumer panel created in
the same year gives consumers a direct
means of conveying their views on food
safety and consumer protection issues to the
Government.
The independent Advisory Committee on
the Microbiological Safety of Food assesses
the risks to human health from micro¬
organisms in food and drink and
recommends action where appropriate.
The Food Safety Act 1990 emphasises
food safety and consumer protection
throughout the food chain. The Act applies
to England, Wales and Scotland, introducing
more effective powers and greatly increased
penalties for offenders. Food companies must
demonstrate that they have taken all
reasonable precautions in manufacture,
transport, storage and preparation. Special
regulations govern the temperatures at which
foods such as cooked meats should be stored.
Separate legislation exists in Northern
Ireland.
SAFETY OF MEDICINES
The health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for licensing the manufacture,
marketing and import of medicines for
human and veterinary use. The Medicines
Commission advises the ministers on policy
regarding such products. The Committees on
Safety of Medicines, on Dental and Surgical
Materials and on the Review of Medicines
advise on the safety, quality and effectiveness
of medicinal products. The Committee on
Safety of Medicines also monitors adverse
reactions to drugs. Legislation also controls
the advertising, labelling, packaging,
distribution, sale and supply of medicinal
products.
RESEARCH
In 1990-91 the health departments spent
about £26-5 million on health research, in
addition to expenditure by the Medical
Research Council (the main government
agency for the support of biomedical and
clinical research). Priority areas include
research into AIDS, primary health care,
community care and child care, the NHS
and personal social services staffing, public
health and the NHS acute sector.
For England and Wales the Director of
Research and Development at the
Department of Health advises health
ministers on the direction of centrally
supported research, and, as a director of the
NHS Management Executive, oversees
research in the NHS. In Scotland the
directly funded programme is administered
by the Chief Scientist of the Scottish Office
Home and Health Department.
In 1991 the Government announced a
major research and development strategy for
the NHS. Its aim is to use scientific research
to identify the best and most cost-effective
methods of health care. The strategy will set
national priorities for research, which will be
carried out by the regional health authorities.
It is intended that up to L5 per cent of
NHS expenditure will be used for research
and development.
The Department of Health is involved in
international research and development, and
takes part in the European Community’s
medical and public health research
programme.
THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS
Doctors and Dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists
in the NHS. University medical and dental
128
SOCIAL WELFARE
schools are responsible for teaching; the
NHS provides hospital facilities for training.
Full registration as a doctor requires five or
six years’ training in a medical school and
hospital, with a further year’s experience in a
hospital. For a dentist, four or more years’
training at a dental school is required. The
regulating body for the medical profession is
the General Medical Council and for
dentists, the General Dental Council. The
main professional associations are the British
Medical Association and the British Dental
Association.
Nurses
The minimum period of training required to
qualify for registration as a first level nurse
in general, mental health or mental handicap,
or children’s nursing is normally three years.
Midwifery training for registered general
nurses takes 18 months, and for other
student midwives in England three years.
Health visitors are registered general nurses
with midwifery or approved obstetric
experience who have completed a one-year
course in health visiting. District nurses are
registered general nurses who practise within
the community. They must complete a six-
month course followed by a period of
supervised practice in district nursing.
Project 2000 is a scheme to reform the
education of nurses, designed to make
training more attractive and to give nurses a
broader based education, enabling them to
work in hospitals or the community without
extensive further training. In 1991-92 the
Government is allocating £71 million to fund
the scheme in 14 colleges of nursing in
England, while comparable arrangements are
being made in other parts of Britain.
The United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering
these professions.
Pharmacists
Pharmacists in general practice and in
hospital must be registered with the
Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain or
the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern
Ireland. A three-year degree course approved
by the Pharmaceutical Society followed by a
year’s approved training is necessary before
registration. Most medicines can be supplied
to customers only by, or under the
supervision of, a registered pharmacist.
Opticians
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician and
dispensing optician. Only registered
ophthalmic opticians (or registered
ophthalmic medical practitioners) may test
sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years, including a year of practical
experience under supervision. Dispensing
opticians take a two-year full-time course
with a year’s practical experience or follow a
part-time day-release course while employed
with an optician.
Other
State registration may also be obtained by
chiropodists, dietitians, medical laboratory
scientific officers, occupational therapists,
orthoptists, physiotherapists and
radiographers. The governing bodies are
seven boards, corresponding to the
professions, under the general supervision of
the Council for Professions Supplementary
to Medicine. Training lasts one to four years
and only those who are state registered may
be employed in the NHS and some other
public services.
Dental therapists (who have taken a two-
year training course) and dental hygienists
(who have taken a training course of about a
year) may carry out some simple dental work
under the supervision of a registered dentist.
In mid-1990 a new group of NHS staff—
health care assistants—began work in
hospitals and the community. They are
intended to support the work of more highly
qualified staff.
ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
The member states of the European
Community have special health arrangements
129
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
under which Community nationals resident
in a member state are entitled to receive any
treatment, either free or at a reduced cost,
during visits to other Community countries.
There are also arrangements to cover people
who go to work or live in other Community
countries. In addition, there are reciprocal
arrangements with some other countries
under which medical treatment is available to
visitors if required immediately. Visitors are
generally expected to pay if the purpose of
their visit is to seek medical treatment.
Visitors who are not covered by reciprocal
arrangements must pay for any medical
treatment they receive.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services assist elderly people,
disabled people and their carers, children and
young people, and families. Major services
include skilled residential and day care, help
for people confined to their homes and the
various forms of social work. The statutory
services are provided by local government
social services authorities in England and
Wales, social work departments in Scotland
and health and social services boards in
Northern Ireland. Alongside these providers
are the many and varied contributions made
by independent voluntary services. Much
of the care given to elderly and disabled
people is provided by families and self-help
groups.
Demand for these services is rising
because of the increasing number of elderly
people and the fact that groups such as the
elderly, the disabled and mentally ill or
handicapped people can lead more normal
lives in the community, given suitable
support and facilities.
New policies regarding community care in
England, Wales and Scotland are being
implemented under the National Health
Service and Community Care Act 1990. In
April 1991 the rights of people using the
personal social services were strengthened
with the introduction of a complaints
procedure. From April 1992 local authorities
will be obliged to produce community care
plans after wide consultation with the NHS
and other interests. New procedures for
assessing individuals’ care needs and
commissioning services to meet them will be
introduced in April 1993. Local authorities
will then become responsible for the financial
support of people in residential or nursing
homes.
Elderly People
Services for elderly people are designed to
help them live at home whenever possible.
Only about 5 per cent of those aged 65 or
over live in residential homes. These services
may include advice and help given by social
workers, domestic help, the provision of
meals in the home, sitters-in, night
attendants and laundry services as well as
day centres, luncheon clubs and recreational
facilities. Adaptations to the home can
overcome a person’s difficulties in moving
about, and a wide range of aids is available
for people with difficulties affecting their
hearing or eyesight. Alarm systems have
been developed to help elderly people obtain
assistance in an emergency. In some areas
‘good neighbour’ and visiting services are
arranged by the local authority or a voluntary !
organisation.
Many local authorities provide free or
subsidised travel to elderly people within
their areas. Social services authorities also
provide residential home care for the elderly
and those in poor health, and register and
inspect homes run by voluntary organisations
or privately.
As part of their responsibility for public
housing, local authorities provide homes
designed for elderly people; some of these
developments have resident wardens.
Housing associations and private builders
also build such accommodation.
Disabled People
Britain has an estimated 6 million adults
with one or more disabilities, of whom
around 400,000 (7 per cent) live in
communal establishments. Local social
services authorities help with social
rehabilitation and adjustment to disability.
They are required to establish the number of
disabled people in their area and to publicise
130
SOCIAL WELFARE
services, which may include advice on
personal and social problems arising from
disability, as well as occupational,
educational, social and recreational facilities,
either at day centres or elsewhere. Other
services provided may include adaptations to
homes (such as ramps for wheelchairs, and
ground-floor toilets); the delivery of cooked
meals; and help in the home. In cases of
special need, help may be given with
installing a telephone or a television. Local
authorities and voluntary organisations may
provide severely disabled people with
residential accommodation or temporary
facilities to allow their carers relief from their
duties. Specially designed housing may be
available for those able to look after
themselves.
Some authorities provide free or
subsidised travel for disabled people on
public transport, and they are encouraged to
provide special means of access to public
buildings. Special government regulations
cover the provision of access for disabled
people in the construction of new buildings.
The Independent Living Fund was set up
in 1988 to provide financial help to very
severely disabled people who need paid
domestic support if they are to live in their
own homes. The Fund, for which the
Government is providing over £62 million in
1991-92, will run for five years.
In March 1991 the Government
committed £3 million for a pilot scheme—
the national disability information project—
designed to improve information services for
disabled people and their carers.
People with a Mental Handicap
The Government’s policy is to encourage the
development of local services for people with
a mental handicap and their families through
mutual co-operation between health and local
authorities and voluntary and other
organisations.
Services provided by social services
authorities include short-term care, support
for families in their own homes, provision
for accommodation in ordinary housing and
various types of day care. The main aims of
the services are to ensure that as far as
possible people with mental handicaps can
lead full lives in their communities and
that no one should be admitted to hospital
unless it is necessary on health grounds.
Social services departments now
provide most community services for
people with a mental handicap. Specialised
residential health provision, which may
consist of small units in the community, is
also provided for people with special
needs, as is specialist health service
support for those living elsewhere.
The transfer of children with a mental
handicap living in institutions to more
ordinary living arrangements remains a
priority.
Mentally 111 People
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing preventive care
and after care for mentally ill people in the
community include day centres, social
centres and residential care. Social workers
help patients and their families with
problems caused by mental illness. In some
cases they can apply for a mentally
disordered person to be compulsorily
admitted to and detained in hospital. The
rights of such patients were extended by
legislation in 1983, and a Mental Health
Act Commission was set up to provide
better safeguards. Corresponding
legislation has also been introduced for
Scotland and Northern Ireland.
In 1989 the Government announced a
number of measures to improve the
provision of services for mentally ill
people. These include requiring district
health authorities (health boards in
Scotland) to plan individual health care
programmes for all patients leaving
hospital and a code of practice for
compulsorily admitting and treating
patients in hospital. Other measures
include a review of public funding of
voluntary organisations concerned with
mental health and a new grant to local
authorities to help meet the social care
needs of patients.
There are many voluntary organisations
concerned with mental illness and mental
131
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
handicap, and these play an important role
in the provision of services for both of
these groups of people.
Help to Families
The Government believes in the central
importance of the family to the well-being of
society and considers that stable adult
relationships are needed to support and
enhance family life. Social services
authorities, through their own social workers
and others, give help to families facing
special problems. This includes services for
children at risk of injury or neglect who need
care away from their own families, and
support for family carers who look after
elderly and other family members in order to
give them relief from their duties. They also
help single parents, including unmarried
mothers. There are now many refuges run
by local authorities or voluntary organisations
for women, often with young children,
whose home conditions have become
intolerable. The refuges provide short-term
accommodation and support while attempts
are made to relieve the women’s problems.
Many authorities also contribute to the cost
of social work with families (such as marriage
guidance) carried out by voluntary
organisations.
The Self-help and Families Project
provides funding for nine voluntary agencies
to assist groups of families to help
themselves.
The Government launched a three-year
initiative in 1989 to increase voluntary sector
provision in England for disadvantaged
families with children under five. With funds
of £2 million, it is enabling voluntary
organisations to research and develop day
care services, particularly for single parents
and families living in temporary
accommodation.
Child Care
Day care facilities for children under five are
provided by local authorities, voluntary
agencies and privately. In allocating places in
their day nurseries and other facilities, local
authorities give priority to children with
special social or health needs. Local authorities
also register childminders, private day
nurseries and playgroups in their areas and
provide support and advice services for them.
The authorities can offer advice and help
to families in difficulties to promote the
welfare of children. The aim is to act at an
early stage to reduce the need to put
children into care or bring them before a
court.
Child Abuse
Cases of child abuse are the joint concern of
many authorities, agencies and professions,
and local review committees provide a forum
for discussion and co-ordination and draw up
policies and procedures for handling these
cases. The Government established a central
training initiative on child abuse in 1986.
This consists of a variety of projects,
including training for health visitors, school
nurses, and local authority social services
staff. Training packs have been drawn up for
those concerned with implementing the
Children Act 1989 (see below).
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland
children under the age of 14 in child abuse
cases are able to give evidence to courts
through television links, thus sparing them
from the need to give evidence in open
court.
Children in Care
Local government authorities must receive
into their care any child under the age of 17
who has no parent or guardian, who has
been abandoned or whose parents are unable
to provide for him or her. The local
authority promotes the welfare of the
children in its care.
Under the Children Act 1989, which
comes into effect in England and Wales in
October 1991, parents of children in care
retain their parental responsibilities but act
as far as possible as partners with the
authority. There is a new requirement to
prepare a child for leaving the local
authority’s responsibility and for continuing
to advise him or her up to the age of 21.
The legislation requires local authorities to
132
SOCIAL WELFARE
have a complaints procedure with an
independent element to cover children in
their care.
In England and Wales a child may be
brought before a family proceedings court if
he or she is neglected or ill-treated, exposed
to moral danger, beyond the control of
parents or not attending school. The court
can commit the child to the care of a local
authority under a care order. Under the
Children Act 1989 certain preconditions have
to be satisfied to justify an order. These are
that the child is suffering or is likely to
suffer significant harm because of a lack of
reasonable parental care or is beyond parental
control. However, an order will be made
only if the court is also satisfied that this will
positively contribute to the child’s well-being
and be in his or her best interests. In court
proceedings the child will be entitled to
separate legal representation and the right to
have a guardian to protect his or her
interests.
All courts have to treat the welfare of the
child as the paramount consideration when
reaching any decision about his or her
upbringing. The family proceedings court
consists of specially trained magistrates with
power to hear care cases as well as all other
family and children’s cases.
In Scotland children in trouble or in need
may be brought before a children’s hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement
on a child if it thinks that compulsory
measures are appropriate. Under these
requirements most children are allowed to
remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker but some may live with foster
parents or in a residential establishment
while under supervision. Supervision
requirements are reviewed at least once a
year until ended by a children’s hearing or
by the Secretary of State. A review of child
care legislation in Scotland has been
conducted and its results are under
consideration.
In Northern Ireland the court may send
children in need or in trouble to a training
school, commit them to the care of a fit
person (including a health and social services
board), or make a supervision order.
Children in trouble may be required to
attend an attendance centre or may be
detained in a remand home. New child care
legislation is being prepared in Northern
Ireland. Where appropriate it will reflect the
changes introduced in England and Wales
and will make a distinction between the
treatment of children in need of care and
young offenders.
Fostering and Community Homes
When appropriate, children in care are
boarded out with foster parents, who receive
payments to cover living costs.
Alternatively, the child may be placed in a
children’s home, voluntary home or other
suitable residential accommodation. In
Scotland local authorities are responsible for
placing children in their care in foster
homes, in local authority or voluntary
homes, or in residential schools. In
Northern Ireland there are residential
homes for children in the care of the health
and social services boards; training schools
and remand homes are administered
separately. Regulations concerning
residential care and the boarding out of
children in care are made by central
government.
Adoption
Local authorities are required by law to
provide an adoption service, either directly
or by arrangement with a voluntary
organisation. Agencies may offer adoptive
parents an allowance if this would help to
find a family for a child. Adoption is strictly
regulated by law, and adoption societies
must be approved by the Government. The
Registrars-General keep confidential
registers of adopted children. Adopted
people may be given details of their original
birth record on reaching the age of 18, and
counselling is provided to help them
understand the circumstances of their
adoption. An Adoption Contact Register
enables adopted adults and their birth
parents to be given a safe and confidential
way of making contact if that is the wish of
both parties. A person’s details are entered
only if they wish to be contacted.
133
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Custodianship
A person who has cared for a child for some
time (for example, a foster parent, step¬
parent or relative) may apply to a court for a
custodianship order giving him or her legal
custody of the child. This gives the
custodian most of the rights and duties of a
natural parent and enables him or her to
make decisions about a child’s day-to-day
care and upbringing in the same way as a
parent. Unlike an adoption order, a
custodianship order may be revoked. The
custodianship provisions do not extend to
Northern Ireland.
Social Workers
The effective operation of the social services
depends largely on professionally qualified
social workers. Training courses in social
work are provided by universities,
polytechnics (in Scotland, central
institutions) and colleges of further
education. The length of courses depends on
educational qualifications and experience and
can extend from one to four years. The
Central Council for Education and Training
in Social Work is the statutory body
responsible for social work training and
offers advice to people considering entering
the profession. The Council has proposed a
range of improvements to the system of
qualifying training.
Professional social workers (including
those working in the NHS) are mainly
employed by the social services departments
of local authorities. Others work in the
probation service, the education welfare
service, or in voluntary organisations.
Voluntary Social Services
There is a long tradition in Britain of
voluntary service to the community, and the
partnership between the voluntary and
statutory sectors is encouraged by the
Government. It has been estimated that
about a quarter of all adults take part in
some form of voluntary work during the
course of a year. Local and health authorities
plan and carry out their duties taking
account of the work of voluntary
organisations. Voluntary provision enables
these authorities to continue the trend
towards local community care rather than
institutional care for the elderly, and for
mentally ill and mentally handicapped
people. Funding voluntary organisations
also provides opportunities to try out new
approaches to services which, if successful,
can be included in mainstream statutory
provision.
Various government schemes assist
almost 3,000 local voluntary projects to
enable unemployed volunteers to help
disadvantaged groups in the community.
Voluntary organisations also take part in
several other government schemes,
including the Employment Training
programme and Youth Training.
Co-ordination of government interests in
the voluntary sector throughout Britain is
the responsibility of the Home Office
Voluntary Services Unit.
Voluntary Organisations
Funding
Voluntary organisations receive income from
several sources, including contributions
from individuals, businesses and trusts,
central and local government grants, and
earnings from commercial activities and
investments. They also receive fees (from
central and local government) for those
services which are provided on a contractual
basis. Some 500 bodies receive government
grants. Tax changes in recent budgets have
helped the voluntary sector secure more
funds from industry and individuals. The
Gift Aid scheme introduced in 1990, for
example, provides tax relief on gifts of
between £600 and £5 million in any one
year. Employees can now make tax-free
donations to charity from their earnings.
The Payroll Giving Scheme provides tax
relief on such donations of up to £50 a
month (£600 a year). Voluntary
organisations benefit not only from direct
donations from the private sector but also
from gifts of goods, sponsorship,
secondments and joint promotions.

SOCIAL WELFARE
Charities
Over 171,000 voluntary organisations are
registered as charities. In England and Wales
the Charity Commission gives advice to
trustees of charities on their administration.
The Commission also maintains a register of
charities, gives consent to land transactions
by charities and holds investments for them.
Organisations may qualify for charitable
status if they are established for purposes
such as the relief of poverty, the
advancement of education or religion or the
promotion of certain other purposes of
public benefit. These include good
community relations, the prevention of racial
discrimination, the protection of health and
the promotion of equal opportunity.
Legislation to strengthen the powers of the
Charity Commissioners and improve the
supervision of charities is proposed.
The Charities Aid Foundation, an
independent body, is one of the main
organisations that aid the flow of funds to
charity from individuals, companies and
grant-making trusts.
Co-ordinating Bodies
The National Council for Voluntary
Organisations is the main co-ordinating body
in England, providing central links between
voluntary organisations, official bodies and the
private sector. It also protects the interests
and independence of voluntary agencies, and
provides them with advice, information and
other services. Councils in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland perform similar
functions. The National Association for
Councils for Voluntary Service is another
network providing resources, with over 200
local councils for voluntary service throughout
England encouraging the development of local
voluntary action, mainly in urban areas. The
rural equivalent is Action with Rural
Communities in England, representing 38
rural community councils.
Types of Voluntary Organisations
There are thousands of voluntary
organisations concerned with health and
social welfare, ranging from national bodies
to small local groups. ‘Self-help’ groups have
been the fastest expanding area over the last
20 or so years—examples include bodies
which provide playgroups for pre-school
children, or help their members to cope with
a particular disability. Groups representing
ethnic minorities and women’s interests have
also developed in recent years. Many
organisations belong to larger associations or
are represented on local or national co¬
ordinating councils or committees. Some are
chiefly concerned with giving personal
service, others with influencing public
opinion and exchanging information. Some
perform both functions. They may be staffed
by both professional and voluntary workers.
Personal and Family Problems
Specialist voluntary organisations concerned
with personal and family problems include
family casework agencies such as the Family
Welfare Association, Family Service Units
and the National Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children. They also include
marriage guidance centres affiliated to Relate:
National Marriage Guidance; Child Care (the
National Council of Voluntary Child Care
Organisations); the National Council for One
Parent Families; Child Poverty Action
Group and the Claimants’ Union, which
provide advice on social security benefits;
and the Samaritans, which helps lonely,
depressed and suicidal people.
Health and Disability
Voluntary service to both sick and disabled
people is given by—among others—the
British Red Cross Society, St John
Ambulance, the Women’s Royal Voluntary
Service and the Leagues of Hospital Friends.
Societies which help people with disabilities
and difficulties include the Royal National
Institute for the Blind, the Royal National
Institute for the Deaf, the Royal Association
for Disability and Rehabilitation, the
Disabled Living Foundation, the
Disablement Income Group, MIND
(National Association for Mental Health),
MENCAP (Royal Society for Mentally
135
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Handicapped Children and Adults), the
Spastics Society, Alcoholics Anonymous, Age
Concern, Help the Aged and their
equivalents in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
Other Organisations
National organisations whose work is
religious in inspiration include the Salvation
Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Board
of Social Responsibility of the Church of
Scotland, the Church of England Children’s
Society, the Church of England Council for
Social Aid, the Young Men’s Christian
Association, the Young Women s Christian
Association, the Catholic Marriage Advisory
Council, the Jewish Welfare Board and the
Church’s Urban Fund.
Community service of many kinds is given
by young people, often through organisations
such as Community Service Volunteers,
Scouts and Girl Guides, and the ‘Time for
God’ scheme run by a group of churches.
A wide range of voluntary personal
services is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service. These include bringing
‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, providing flats and residential
clubs for the elderly, help with family
problems, and assistance in hospitals and
during emergencies.
Over 1,300 Citizens Advice Bureaux
advise people on their social and legal rights.
Some areas have law centres and housing
advisory centres.
The Volunteer Centre
The Volunteer Centre UK provides
information and research on voluntary work.
Its Scottish counterpart is Volunteer
Development Scotland. There are many local
volunteer bureaux, some part-time, which
direct volunteers to opportunities in both the
voluntary and statutory sectors.
Social Security
Nearly a third of government expenditure is
devoted to the social security programme,
which provides financial help for people who
are elderly, sick, disabled, unemployed,
widowed, bringing up children or on very
low incomes.
Some benefits depend on the payment of
contributions by employers, employees and
self-employed people to the National
Insurance Fund, from which benefits are
paid. The Government also contributes to
the Fund. The other social security benefits
are non-contributory and are financed from
general taxation^ some of these are income-
related. Appeals about claims for benefits are
decided by independent tribunals.
Administration
The Department of Social Security’s
Benefits Agency is responsible for paying the
majority of social security benefits in Great
Britain; in Northern Ireland they are
administered by the Social Security Agency.
Administration of National Insurance
contributions is the task of the Department s
National Insurance Contributions Agency.
The Information Technology Services
Agency is responsible for computerising the
administration of social security; once this is
completed, there will be 20,000 terminals in
over 500 locations. This will enable service
to the public to be improved.
The housing benefit scheme is
administered mainly by local government
authorities, which recover most of the cost
from the Government.
Advice about Benefits
The demand for advice about benefits is
partly met by the Freeline Social Securitj'
Service, which handled over 1 million calls
between April 1989 and March 1990. A
complementary service, the Social Security
Advice Line for Employers, provides advice
on social security for employers and the
Ethnic Freeline Service provides information
on social security in Urdu, Punjabi and
Chinese.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits
such as retirement pension, sickness and
136
SOCIAL WELFARE
invalidity benefit, unemployment benefit,
maternity allowance and widow’s benefit is
dependent upon the payment of
contributions. There are four classes of
contributions. Class 1 contributions are
related to earnings subject to an upper limit
and are paid by employees and employers.
The contribution is lower if the employer
operates a ‘contracted-out’ occupational
pension scheme (see below). Self-employed
people pay a flat rate Class 2 contribution
and may have to pay a Class 4 contribution
which is assessed as a percentage of profits
or gains within certain limits; they are not
eligible for unemployment and industrial
injuries benefits. Voluntary Class 3
contributions are made by people wanting to
safeguard rights to some benefits.
Employees who work after pensionable
age (60 for women and 65 for men) do not
pay contributions but the employer continues
to be liable. People earning less than a
certain amount do not pay contributions;
neither do their employers. Self-employed
people with earnings below a set amount
may apply for exemption; those over
pensionable age do not pay contributions.
BENEFITS
For most benefits there are two contribution
conditions. First, before benefit can be paid
at all, a certain number of contributions have
to be paid. Secondly, the full rate of benefit
cannot be paid unless contributions have
been made up to a specific level over a set
period. Benefits are increased annually in
line with percentage increases in retail prices.
The main benefits (payable weekly) are
summarised below. The rates given are those
effective from April 1991 until April 1992.
Retirement Pension
A state retirement pension is payable, on
making a claim, to women at the age of 60
and men at the age of 65. The Sex
Discrimination Act 1986 protects employees
of different sexes in a particular occupation
from being required to retire at different
ages. This, however, has not affected the
payment of state retirement pensions at
different ages for men and women. The state
pension scheme consists of a basic weekly
pension of £52 for a single person and
£83-25 for a married couple, together with
an additional earnings-related pension.
Pensioners may have unlimited earnings
without affecting their pensions. Those who
have put off their retirement during the five
years after state pension age may earn extra
pension. A non-contributory retirement
pension of £31-25 a week is payable to
people over the age of 80 who meet certain
residence conditions, and who have not
qualified for a contributory pension. People
whose pensions do not give them enough to
live on may be entitled to income support
ranging from £13-75 to £18-45 a week for a
single person and £20 90 to £26 20 a week
for a couple.
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded
for mothers who are away from paid
employment looking after children or for
people giving up paid employment to care
for severely disabled relatives. Men and
women may receive the same basic pension,
provided they have paid full-rate National
Insurance contributions when working.
From the year 2000 the earnings-related
pension scheme will be based on a lifetime’s
revalued earnings instead of on the best 20
years. It will be calculated as 20 per cent
rather than 25 per cent of earnings, to be
phased in over ten years from 2000. The
pensions of people retiring this century will
be unaffected.
Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers are free to ‘contract out’ their
employees from the state scheme for the
additional earnings-related pension and to
provide their own occupational pension
instead. Their pension must be at least as
good as the state additional pension. The
State remains responsible for the basic
pension.
Occupational pension schemes cover about
half the working population and have over 11
million members. The occupational pension
rights of those who change jobs before
pensionable age, who are unable or who do
not want to transfer their pension rights, are
137
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
now protected against inflation up to a
maximum of five per cent. Workers leaving a
scheme have the right to a fair transfer value.
Pension funds and other pension schemes
have to provide full information about their
schemes.
As an alternative to occupational pension
schemes or the state additional earnings-
related pension, people are entitled to choose
a personal pension available from a bank,
building society, insurance company or other
financial institution. Over 4 5 million people
have taken out personal pensions.
A Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints about maladministration of
pension schemes and adjudicates on disputes
of fact or law.
Mothers and Children
Most pregnant working women can receive
their statutory maternity pay directly from
their employer. Statutory maternity pay is
normally paid for 18 weeks. There are two
rates: where a woman has been working for
the same employer for at least two years, she
is entitled to 90 per cent of her average
weekly earnings for the first six weeks and to
the lower rate of £44-50 a week for the
remaining 12 weeks; where a woman has
been employed for between six months and
two years, she is entitled to payments for the
full 18 weeks at the lower rate.
Women who are ineligible for statutory
maternity pay because, for example, they are
self-employed, have recently changed jobs or
given up their job, may qualify for a weekly
maternity allowance of £40-60, which is
payable for 18 weeks.
A payment of £100 from the social fund
(see p 140), is available for each living child
born or for a stillborn child if the pregnancy
lasts for at least 28 weeks. It is also payable
for an adopted baby if the mother or her
partner are receiving income support or
family credit.
Non-contributory child benefit of £8-25
for the eldest and £7 25 weekly for each
other child is the main social security benefit
for children. Tax-free and normally paid to
the mother, it is payable for children up to
the age of 16 and for those up to 19 if they
continue in full-time non-advanced
education. In addition, one-parent benefit of
£5-60 a week is payable to certain people
bringing up one or more children on their
own, whether as their parents or not. A non¬
contributory guardian’s allowance of £10-70
a week for an orphaned child is payable to a
person who is entitled to child benefit for
that child. In certain circumstances it can be
paid on the death of only one parent.
As part of its wide-ranging review of
family justice matters, the Government is to
establish a Child Support Agency which will
be responsible for assessing, collecting and
enforcing child maintenance payments.
Assessments will be made using a formula
which will take into account the numbers
and ages of children and the financial
circumstances of all parties. The Agency is
expected to operate from spring 1993.
Widows
Widows under the age of 60, or those over
60 whose husbands were not entitled to a
state retirement pension when they died,
receive a tax-free single payment of £1,000
following the death of their husbands,
providing that their husbands had paid a
minimum number of National Insurance
contributions. Women whose husbands have
died of an industrial injury or disease may
also qualify, regardless of whether their
husbands had paid National Insurance
contributions. A widowed mother with a
young family receives a widowed mother’s
allowance of £52 a week with a further £9 70
for the first child and £10-70 for each
subsequent child. A widow’s pension of £52
a week is payable to a widow who is 45 years
or over when her husband dies or when her
entitlement to widowed mother’s allowance
ends. Special rules apply for widows whose
husbands died before 11 April 1988.
Payment continues until the widow remarries
or begins drawing retirement pension.
Widows also benefit under the industrial
injuries scheme.
A man whose wife dies when both are
over pension age inherits his wife’s pension
rights just as a widow inherits her husband’s
rights.
138
SOCIAL WELFARE
Sick and Disabled People
Statutory Sick Pay and Sickness Benefit
There is a large variety of benefits for
people unable to work because of sickness
or disablement. Employers are responsible
for paying statutory sick pay to employees
for up to a maximum of 28 weeks. There
are two weekly rates—£43-50 or £52-50—
depending on average weekly earnings.
Employees who are not entitled to
statutory sick pay can claim weekly state
sickness benefit of £39-60 instead, as can
self-employed people. Sickness benefit is
payable for up to 28 weeks.
Invalidity Pension and Allowance
A weekly invalidity pension of £52 with
additions of £31-25 for a husband or wife
or other adult dependant and £10-70 for
each child is payable when statutory sick
pay or sickness benefit ends, if the
beneficiary is still incapable of work. For
the period to count towards receiving
invalidity pension, a claimant of statutory
sick pay must have satisfied the
contribution condition for sickness benefit.
An invalidity allowance of up to £11 10
weekly may be paid with the pension to
people who become sick more than five
years before minimum retirement age.
Severe Disablement Allowance
A severe disablement allowance of £31-25
may be payable to people of working age
who are unable to work and do not qualify
for the National Insurance invalidity
pension because they have not paid
sufficient contributions.
Industrial Injuries Benefits
Various benefits are payable for
disablement caused by an accident at work
or a prescribed disease. Disablement
benefit of up to £84 90 a week is usually
paid after a qualifying period of 15 weeks
if a person is physically or mentally
disabled as a result of an industrial
accident or a prescribed disease. During the
qualifying period statutory sick pay or
sickness benefit may be payable if the person
is incapable of work. The degree of
disablement is assessed by a medical
authority and the amount paid depends on
the extent of the disablement and how long
it is expected to last. Disablement of 14 per
cent or more attracts a weekly pension.
Except for certain progressive respiratory
diseases, disablement of less than 14 per cent
does not attract basic benefit. In certain
circumstances disablement benefits may be
supplemented by a constant attendance
allowance. An additional allowance may be
payable in certain cases of exceptionally
severe disablement.
Other Benefits
A non-contributory, tax-free attendance
allowance of £27 80 or £41-65 a week may
be payable to severely disabled people
depending upon the amount of attention they
require. People with a terminal illness receive
the higher rate. A non-contributory invalid
care allowance of £31-25 weekly may be
payable to people between 16 and
pensionable age who cannot take up a paid
job because they are caring for a person
receiving attendance allowance; an additional
carer’s premium may be paid if the recipient
is also receiving income support, housing
benefit or community charge benefit.
Physically disabled people unable to walk
and those who are both deaf and blind may
be entitled to a tax-free mobility allowance of
£2910 weekly to help with transport costs;
there is automatic entitlement for people who
are without both legs. People aged between 5
and 66 may claim, and payment can continue
up to the age of 80. An independent
organisation called Motability helps disabled
drivers and passengers wanting to use their
mobility allowance to obtain a vehicle.
In April 1992 the attendance and mobility
allowances will be extended and replaced by
the disability living allowance. Some 300,000
people who fail to qualify for mobility
allowance and attendance allowance will
receive a new lower rate for mobility and
personal care needs. An independent
139
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Disability Appeal Tribunal will settle
appeals against non-award of disability
living allowance.
A disability working allowance is also
being introduced in 1992. It will for the
first time provide help for disabled people
in work. It will be an income-related
benefit payable to people working as few as
16 hours a week. Awards will be for fixed
periods of six months. People will have to
be receiving disability living allowance or
have recently received a long-term
incapacity benefit or a disability premium
with an income-related benefit as a
condition for receiving the new benefit.
Unemployment Benefit
Unemployment benefit of £41-40 a week
for a single person or £66 95 for a couple
is payable for up to a year in any one
period of unemployment. Periods covered
by unemployment or sickness benefit,
maternity allowance or some training
allowances which are eight weeks or less
apart, are linked to form a single period of
interruption of work. Everyone claiming
unemployment benefit has to be available
for work, but unemployed people wishing
to do voluntary work in the community
may do so in some cases without losing
entitlement to benefit. People seeking
unemployment benefit are expected
actively to look for work and must have
good reasons for rejecting any job that is
offered.
Income Support
Income support is payable to people who
are not in work, or who work for less than
24 hours a week, and whose financial
resources are below certain set levels. It
consists of a personal allowance ranging
(from October 1991) from £23 65 weekly
for a single person or lone parent aged
under 18 to £62 25 for a couple, at least
one of whom is aged over 18. Additional
sums are available to families, single
parents, pensioners, long-term sick and
disabled people, and those caring for them
who qualify for the invalid care allowance.
Housing Benefit
The housing benefit scheme offers help with
the cost of rents to people with low incomes,
using general assessment rules and benefit
levels similar to those for the income support
scheme. People whose net income is below
certain specified levels receive housing
benefit equivalent to 100 per cent of their
rent.
Both income support and housing benefit
schemes set a limit to the amount of capital a
person may have and still remain entitled,
and any income is taken into account after
income tax and National Insurance
contributions.
Community Charge Benefit
The community charge benefit is a rebate
scheme which offers help with the cost of
the community charge (see p 342) to those
claiming income support and others with low
incomes. Subject to rules similar to those
governing the provision of income support
and housing benefit (see above), people can
receive rebates of up to 80 per cent of their
community charge. Under government plans
for a new council tax, the rebate would be
up to 100 per cent.
Family Credit
Family credit is payable to working families
on modest incomes with children where one
parent works for at least 24 hours a week.
The amount payable depends on a family’s
net income (excluding child benefits) and the
number and ages of the children in the
family. A maximum award, consisting of an
adult rate of £38 30 weekly, plus a rate for
each child varying with age, is payable if the
net income does not exceed £62-25 a week.
The award is reduced by 70 pence for each
pound by which net income exceeds this
amount. Family credit is not payable if a
family’s capital exceeds £8,000.
Social Fund
Discretionary payments, in the form of loans
or grants, may be available to people on low
140
SOCIAL WELFARE
incomes for expenses which are difficult
to meet from their regular income. There
are three types: budgeting loans to help
meet important occasional expenses, crisis
loans for help in an emergency or a
disaster, and community care grants to
help people re-establish themselves or
remain in the community and to ease
exceptional pressure on families.
Payments are also made from the social
fund to help with the costs of maternity
or funerals or with heating during very
cold weather. These payments are
entitlements and are not subject to the
same budgetary considerations as other
social fund payments.
War Pensions and Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement or
death as a result of service in the armed
forces or of certain injuries received in the
merchant navy or civil defence during
war-time, or to civilians injured by enemy
action. The amount paid depends on the
degree of disablement and rank held in
service: the maximum disablement
pension for a private soldier is £84-90 a
week. An allowance is also paid for
dependants.
There are a number of extra
allowances. The main ones are for
unemployability, restricted mobility, the
need for constant attendance, the
provision of extra comforts, and as
maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
£6 and ^18-50 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose
disablement is assessed at 40 per cent or
more. Pensions are also paid to war
widows and other dependants. (The
pension for a private’s widow is £67-60.)
The Department of Social Security
maintains a welfare service for war
pensioners, war widows and other
dependants. It works closely with ex-
Service organisations and other voluntary
bodies which give financial aid and
personal support to those disabled or
bereaved as a result of war.
Taxation
Social security benefits are regarded as
taxable income. Various income tax reliefs
and exemptions are allowed on account of
age or a need to support dependants. The
following benefits are not taxable: income
support (except when paid to the
unemployed and to people involved in
industrial disputes), family credit, attendance
allowance, mobility allowance, severe
disablement allowance, industrial injuries
disablement benefit, reduced earnings
allowance, and war pensions. The two new
benefits, disability living allowance and
disability working allowance, will both be
tax-free.
Other Benefits
Other benefits for which unemployed people
and those on low incomes may be eligible
include exemption from health service
charges (see p 115), grants towards the cost
of spectacles, free school meals and free legal
aid. Reduced charges are often made to the
unemployed, for example, for adult
education and exhibitions, and pensioners
usually enjoy reduced transport fares.
Arrangements with Other Countries
As part of the European Community’s efforts
to promote the free movement of labour,
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for
employed and self-employed people who
move between member states. The
regulations also cover retirement pensioners
and other beneficiaries who have been
employed, or self-employed, as well as
dependants. Benefits covered include
child benefit and those for sickness and
maternity, unemployment, retirement,
invalidity, accidents at work and occupational
diseases.
Britain also has reciprocal social security
agreements with a number of other countries.
Their scope and the benefits they cover vary,
but the majority cover most National
Insurance benefits and family benefits.

Education
British education aims to develop fully the
abilities of individuals, both young and old,
for their own benefit and that of society as a
whole. Compulsory schooling takes place
between the ages of 4 or 5 and 16. Some
provision is made for children under school
age, and many pupils remain at school
beyond the minimum leaving age. Post¬
school education, mainly at universities,
polytechnics and colleges of further and
higher education, is organised flexibly to
provide a wide range of opportunities for
academic and vocational education and
continuing study throughout life. Educational
provision in Britain meets the requirements
laid down in the United Nations Convention
on the Rights of the Child.
Major Reforms
During the last few years the education
service has undergone the most far-reaching
reforms since the second world war
(193<M-5). Two major Acts of Parliament
covering education mainly in England and
Wales, and separate legislation for Scotland
and for Northern Ireland, have been
introduced in order to implement the
principal aims of the Government’s
education policies.
These are:
• to raise standards at all levels of ability;
• increase parental choice of schools and
improve the partnership between parents
and schools;
• make further and higher education1 more
widely accessible and more responsive to
the needs of the economy; and
1 Higher education is generally defined as higher courses in any
institution—broadly, those of a standard higher than General
Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced (A) level or its
equivalent—and further education as all other post-school
courses.
• to achieve the best possible return from
the resources invested in the education
service.
In schools, the Government has aimed to:
• improve school management;
• secure a broader and more balanced
curriculum for all pupils so that they can
develop the qualities and skills required
for adult life and work in a technological
age;
• see that examinations support curriculum
objectives;
• implement schemes for the local
management of schools; and
• improve the quality of teaching through
better teacher training and appraisal.
Schools are also encouraged to be more
responsive to the needs of a multi-ethnic
society. Measures are being taken to widen
the choice of schools available and to ensure
that schools respond effectively to the
demands of parents and the broader
community. The Government is also acting
to ensure that school governors are
adequately trained in view of their increased
responsibilities.
The Government’s principal aims for the
further education sector are:
• to enable local education authorities and
colleges to meet more fully the
requirements of students and employers
through the provision of a wide range of
vocational and academic courses;
• to contribute to an improvement in skill
levels; and
• to increase participation in further
education and training, particularly
among 16- to 19-year-olds.
The Government is committed to
maintaining a first class, cost-effective,
143
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
higher education system which helps to
satisfy the nation’s economic and social needs
and at the same time offers the necessary
opportunities for the advancement of
knowledge. It is promoting continuing growth
in student numbers. The proportion of
young people entering higher education rose
from 1 in 8 in 1980 to 1 in 5 by 1990, and is
expected to reach 1 in 3 by the year 2000. In
order to spread the benefits of higher
education more widely, the Government
encourages educational institutions to recruit
more students from ethnic minority and
other under-represented groups.
In May 1991 the Government issued
three White Papers designed to transform
post-compulsory education and training.
Higher Education: A New Framework covers
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland; Education and Training for the 21st
Century covers England and Wales; and
Access and Opportunity: a Strategy for
Education and Training relates to Scotland.
The proposed reforms would mean the
ending of the increasingly artificial
distinction between universities and other
higher education establishments. Also,
barriers between academic and vocational
education and training would be removed for
16- to 19-year-olds.
A single framework for higher education
would be established, with higher education
funding councils in England, Scotland and
Wales allocating public funds for teaching
and general research. New links would be
created to continue the present close
relationship with Northern Ireland’s existing
unitary structure. Degree-awarding powers
would be extended to all major institutions
and there would be new quality assurance
arrangements. Polytechnics and other higher
education colleges would have the right to
call themselves ‘universities’.
Further education and sixth-form colleges
in England and Wales would become
autonomous institutions outside local
authority control, financed through further
education councils from April 1993. New
general vocational qualifications would be
developed and Ordinary and Advanced
Diplomas introduced for those reaching a
required standard in either or both academic
and vocational subjects, thereby ensuring
equal recognition for academic and vocational
qualifications of the same standard. By the
mid-1990s every 16- and 17-year-old leaving
full-time education would be encouraged to
undertake vocational education or training by
the offer of a training credit, enabling them
to buy specific training from the
establishment of their choice. Parallel
reforms are proposed for further education
and training in Scotland.
Parent’s Charter
A parent’s charter was published by the
Government in September 1991, designed to
enable parents to make more informed
choices about their children’s education.
Approved inspections of all schools will take
place at least every four years. Parents will
receive five key documents:
• an annual report on their child’s
progress;
• performance tables with full information
on all schools in their area;
• a summary of a recent inspection report
on their child’s school;
• an action plan for tackling weaknesses
identified in the school inspection; and
• an annual report from the school
governors with information about
examination and test results for the
school, truancy, school-leavers’
destinations, the school budget, and
election procedures for parent-governors. ?
Primary and Secondary Education
Measures to improve the quality and breadth
of education and to extend parental choice
and delegated decision-making in publicly-
funded schools in England and Wales are
embodied in two recent Acts. The Education
(No 2) Act 1986 reformed the composition of
school governing bodies (see p 149) and
reallocated functions between school
governors, local education authorities and
head teachers. It also contained provisions to
appraise the performance of teachers, and
introduce more effective in-service training
of teachers.
144
EDUCATION
The Education Reform Act 1988, relating
to both school and post-school education,
provides for the establishment of a National
Curriculum for children aged 5 to 16 in all
English and Welsh maintained schools and
for regular assessments of performance.
Secondary schools are required to admit
pupils up to the limit of their available
physical capacity if there is sufficient
demand on behalf of children eligible for
admission. There are plans to extend this to
primary schools from August 1992. This
policy, known as ‘more open enrolment’, is
designed to further increase parental choice
of schools. The 1988 Act gives all schools
responsibility for managing the major part of
their budgets, including staffing costs, as
well as the opportunity to withdraw from
local authority control (see p 149). It also
makes provision for the development of a
network of city technology colleges
(see p 146).
The School Boards (Scotland) Act 1988
requires Scottish education authorities to
establish boards with the aim of increasing
parental involvement in school management
(see p 149). The Self-Governing Schools etc.
(Scotland) Act 1989 enables parents to vote
for local self-management of schools in place
of control by education authorities. In
addition, it provides for the establishment of
technology academies outside education
authority control (with a similar role to that
of city technology colleges).
In Northern Ireland legislation which
came into force in 1990 introduced reforms
broadly in line with those being implemented
in England and Wales under the Education
Reform Act 1988. It also seeks to encourage
further the development of integrated
education (see p 150).
Post-school Education
Under the Education Reform Act 1988,
changes were introduced in the structure and
funding of further and higher education to
help institutions improve their management
and planning. The system of university
funding was reformed in England, Wales and
Scotland: the Universities Funding Council
replaced the University Grants Committee
and has executive powers to allocate finances
to individual universities. Polytechnics and
other major higher education colleges in
England were removed from local authority
control, and incorporated as higher education
corporations with boards of governors, half
of whose members are drawn from business
and the professions. Their work is financed
through the Polytechnics and Colleges
Funding Council, with responsibilities
parallel to those of the Universities Funding
Council. Further education and higher
education colleges remaining under local
authority control have taken on greater
responsibility for their annual budgets and
are including more employers on their
governing bodies.
The Government is altering the balance
of public funding for full-time undergraduate
higher education from institutional grant to
tuition fees paid for individual students (see
p 159). This is intended to create a more
direct link between institutional income and
recruitment, encouraging institutions to
increase their efficiency by making full use of
capacity.
Legislation was introduced in both
Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1989 to
allow further education colleges to assume
increased financial powers and managerial
responsibilities. The objectives are to
improve their efficiency and responsiveness
to local demand and to increase employment
interests on governing bodies.
Education-Business Links
The Government considers that co-operation
between the education system and business is
essential to help people of all ages acquire
the skills necessary to maintain Britain’s
position as a leading industrial and trading
nation at a time of rapid technological
change and intense international economic
competition. Many organisations already
work to strengthen such links, and further
contacts are being encouraged.
Much is being done under the
Government’s Technical and Vocational
Education Initiative (TVEI—see p 153), to
which £900 million has been allotted from
1987 to 1997. As a result of this and other
145
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
initiatives, industrial and commercial matters
are being allocated a more prominent place
in school, college and university curricula
and examinations. The relevance of
classroom activities to working life was
central to the thinking behind the
introduction of the General Certificate of
Secondary Education and the National
Curriculum. Businessmen and women are
involved in curriculum development and
enterprise activities for schoolchildren. They
have been enabled to take a bigger part in
the management of schools, colleges and
polytechnics by joining their governing bodies
in greater numbers and through membership
of Training and Enterprise Councils, Local
Enterprise Companies and local Education
Business Partnerships (see p 147).
In line with the concern to maintain
British expertise in science, engineering and
technology, a shift in provision is occurring
in post-school education away from the arts
and social sciences towards these subjects
and towards directly vocational courses.
Business and higher education institutions
are being encouraged to collaborate more
closely for their mutual benefit. The latter
may give enterprise training to students
under the Government’s Enterprise in
Higher Education scheme to help students
acquire the aptitudes and competence
required by industry in the 1990s.
Secondary School Education
Government policy is to ensure that every
year 10 per cent of teachers should be given
the opportunity to gain some business
experience; and that every trainee teacher
should have an appreciation of the needs of
employers. Some 30,000 teachers will spend
time working in industry during 1991-92
under a scheme administered by the
Confederation of British Industry.
The Government also wants all pupils to
have at least two weeks’ work experience
before leaving school. Work experience
involves pupils doing particular jobs much as
would regular employees. More than 70 per
cent of schoolchildren aged 15 to 16 under¬
took work experience placements in 1989.
City technology colleges, sponsored by
industry and commerce, are being set up in
urban areas in England to provide a broadly
based secondary education for girls and boys
of all abilities. The curriculum emphasises
science, technology and business
understanding within the framework of the
National Curriculum. The colleges are state-
aided but independent of local education
authorities. They are managed by sponsors
from universities and commerce, educational
trusts, charities and other voluntary
organisations. The first college opened in
Solihull (West Midlands) in 1988, and by
September 1991, 13 were in operation. The
Government has announced plans to allow
existing schools to transform themselves into
grant-maintained technology colleges.
In 1988 the Government launched the
Compacts initiative as part of the Action for
Cities programme to regenerate inner city
areas. Compacts are local agreements
between employers, local education
authorities and training providers. Young
people, supported by their school or college,
work to reach agreed targets, and employers
undertake to provide a job with training or
training leading to a job for those attaining
the targets. By October 1991, 58 compacts
were in operation (and three were being
developed), with around 500 schools and
colleges and over 92,000 young people
participating. The Government is making
available more than £28 million over four
years from 1990 to support compacts. Under
the White Paper proposals, the compact
approach would be extended nationwide.
The Government’s local Education
Business Partnerships initiative, announced
in 1990, is designed to foster the
development of wide-ranging, formal local
links between businesses, education and
other community interests throughout
Britain. It seeks to improve the coherence
and co-ordination of government support
and the integration of local and national
education-business link organisations,
programmes and activities.
Post-school Education
A network of employer-led Training and
Enterprise Councils (TECs) is being built up
146
EDUCATION
by the Government in England and Wales.
TECs are intended to make training and
enterprise activities more relevant to the
needs of employers and individuals locally.
A total of 82 are expected to be fully
operational by the end of 1991. In
Scotland, 22 Local Enterprise Companies
have been formed with a similar role to
that of the TECs. A Training and
Employment Agency was set up in 1990 in
Northern Ireland with responsibilities for
training and employment programmes and
activities.
Some 11 TECs and Local Enterprise
Companies, working in close co-operation
with local education authorities and other
education interests, have been running
pilot schemes of Training Credits for
young people. Training Credits schemes
offer an entitlement to train to approved
standards for young people leaving full¬
time education.
Over 40 science parks have been set up
by higher education institutions in
conjunction with industrial scientists and
technologists to promote the development
and commercial application of advanced
technology. There are plans to establish
more science parks. In addition, a network
of regional technology centres links
colleges, polytechnics and universities with
local firms. The centres’ incomes are
derived from charges to companies which
send their employees for training.
The Government’s LINK scheme aims
to encourage firms to work jointly with
higher education institutions on
government-funded research relevant to
industrial needs.
Administration
One of the distinctive features of the
education service is the degree to which
responsibility for provision is
decentralised. Overall responsibility for all
aspects of education in England, and for
the Government’s relations with and
support for polytechnics and other higher
education colleges in England as well as
universities throughout Britain, rests with
the Secretary of State for Education and
Science. The Secretaries of State for Wales
and for Scotland have responsibility in their
respective countries for non-university
education, and are consulted about education
in universities. The Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland is responsible for both
university and non-university education in
the Province. Responsibility for sport and
recreation in England was transferred to the
Secretary of State for Education and Science
in 1990.
The government departments responsible
for education are the Department of
Education and Science (DES) in England,
the Welsh Office, the Scottish Office
Education Department, and the Department
of Education for Northern Ireland. Their
chief concerns are formulating education
policies, allocating resources and influencing
the other partners in the education service—
the local education authorities, governing
bodies of educational institutions, the
teaching profession, the churches and
voluntary organisations. The departments are
also responsible for the supply and training
of teachers.
The Education Departments finance
certain aspects of the education service
directly (for instance, grant-maintained
schools and city technology colleges) and also
provide grants to local authorities. The
DES’s own expenditure is devoted mainly to
higher education and science, which accounts
for two-thirds of the total. The Department
of Employment and Department of Trade
and Industry also fund specific educational
programmes; the former, for example,
finances the Technical and Vocational
Education Initiative (see p 153) and compacts
(see p 146).
The provision of most maintained, that is,
publicly financed, school and further
education is the responsibility of local
education authorities, which are funded by
central government and, except in Northern
Ireland, by local taxes. Local education
authorities employ teachers and other staff,
provide and maintain buildings, supply
equipment and materials and, in England
and Wales, award grants to students
progressing to further and higher education.
Universities and the English polytechnics
147
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
are self-governing institutions receiving most
of their income indirectly from central
government grants.
In Scotland the higher education sector
central institutions and colleges of education
providing teacher training are administered
by independent governing bodies. Northern
Ireland colleges of education are controlled
by the Department of Education (Northern
Ireland) and by a voluntary agency.
Finance
Estimated spending on education and science
in Britain in 1990-91 was £26,500 million.
About 70 per cent was incurred by local
education authorities, which are directly
responsible for the funding of most
maintained schools and colleges of further
education. The authorities make their own
expenditure decisions according to local
needs and circumstances, such as the number
of school-age children.
Primary, Secondary and Further Education
In England and Wales the grants for
education support and training programmes
enable the Government to support local
education authority expenditure on
educational activities of national priority. In
1991_92 the Government intends to make
grants of £220 million supporting total
spending of £364 million. Most spending will
be deployed on the implementation of the
Education Reform Act, including activities
related to the National Curriculum (£170
million) and local management of schools and
colleges (£77 million). A total of £10 million
is to be devoted to teacher recruitment and
£7 million to health education in schools.
The balance of the programme is aimed at
improving the general efficiency and
effectiveness of the education service.
The Government funds directly the
current and capital costs both of grant-
maintained schools which have opted to leave
the local authority sector (see p 149) and of
city technology colleges (see p 146) in
England and Wales and comparable
institutions in Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
Higher Education
The greater part of higher education
institutions’ income derives from public
funds via the institutional grant and tuition
fees paid for students through the awards
system. Institutional funding for sectors
within the responsibility of the DES will
exceed £4,000 million in 1991-92.
Institutional grant for universities in Great
Britain is distributed by the Universities
Funding Council (UFC), a statutory body.
Certain individual establishments, such as the
Open University, are financed directly by the
DES. In Northern Ireland grant is paid
directly to the universities by the Northern
Ireland Office with advice from the UFC.
The private University of Buckingham
receives no public grant.
For non-university higher education, the
Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council
is responsible for financing higher courses in
polytechnics and most colleges of higher
education in England. Higher courses in
Wales continue to be financed by local
authorities. In Scotland all courses offered by
the central institutions and colleges of
education are funded by central government,
advanced courses provided by local authority
further education colleges are financed by
the local authorities.
Universities, polytechnics and other
higher education institutions undertake
training, research or consultancy for
commercial firms. The Government is
encouraging them to secure a larger flow of
funds from these sources. Many educational
establishments have endowments or receive
grants from foundations and benefactors.
SCHOOLS
Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive efficient full-time education,
at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5
and 16 in Great Britain and 4 and 16 in
Northern Ireland. Some 9'2 million children
attend Britain’s 35,000 state and private
schools (of which about 25,600 are primary
or nursery and 4,900 secondary schools in
the state sector). Most pupils receive free
education financed from public funds, but a
148
EDUCATION
small proportion attend schools wholly
independent of direct public financial
support.
Boys and girls are taught together in most
primary schools, and more than 80 per cent
of pupils in maintained secondary schools in
England and Wales and over 60 per cent in
Northern Ireland attend mixed schools. In
Scotland nearly all secondary schools are
mixed. Most independent schools for
younger children are co-educational; the
majority providing secondary education are
single-sex, although the number of mixed
schools is growing.
No fees are charged to parents of children
at maintained schools, grant-maintained
schools or city technology colleges, and
books and equipment are free. In Northern
Ireland at present a small proportion of
grammar school pupils are fee-payers. Under
legislation passed in 1989 Northern Ireland
grammar schools will in the main have to
discontinue the practice of admitting fee-
I paying pupils.
Parents throughout Britain have a
statutory right to express a preference for a
particular school for their children, and have
an effective channel of appeal at local level.
Schools are obliged to publish their
admissions criteria and basic information
about themselves and their public
examination results.
Management
England and Wales
Schools supported from public funds are of
two main kinds in England and Wales:
• County schools are owned and
maintained by local education authorities
wholly out of public funds; and
• Voluntary schools, mostly established by
religious denominations, are also wholly
maintained from public funds but the
governors of some types of voluntary
school contribute to capital costs.
Around one-third of the 23,000
maintained primary and secondary
schools are voluntary schools, most of
them Anglican or Roman Catholic.
Each publicly maintained school has a
governing body which includes governors
appointed by the local education authority
and teacher and parent representatives. Most
maintained schools have equal numbers of
parent and local authority governors so that
no single interest predominates. Governing
bodies are responsible for the main policies
of their schools and for the preparation of a
statement of their schools’ curricular aims
and objectives. They also have final
responsibility for school discipline and a
large say in the appointment and dismissal of
staff.
The role of governing bodies in England
and Wales has been further enlarged since
1990. Local education authorities have
delegated responsibility for the management
of school budgets to all secondary schools
and primary schools with more than 200
pupils. Small primary schools will be able to
apply to manage their own budgets from
April 1992. This policy is known as ‘local
management of schools’. Local authorities
allocate money to individual schools mainly
on the basis of pupil numbers.
English and Welsh schools may seek to
withdraw from local authority control,
following a ballot of parents (‘opting out’).
They are then directly financed by central
government as grant-maintained non-
fee-paying schools.
Scotland
In Scotland most of the schools supported
from public funds are provided by education
authorities and are known as public schools;
in England this term is used for a type of
independent school (see p 151). Education
authorities are required to establish school
boards to play a significant part in the
administration and management of schools.
The boards consist of elected parent and
staff members as well as co-opted members,
thereby encouraging greater parental
involvement and closer links between home,
school and local community. Parents of
children at public schools can opt for local
self-management following a ballot; such
schools receive funding directly from central
government (see p 145).
149
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland there are three main
categories of grant-aided school:
• controlled schools, owned and managed
by the area education and library boards
and having all their expenditure met
from public funds;
• voluntary schools, mainly under Roman
Catholic management and also
maintained largely by public funds; and
• voluntary grammar schools, which may
be under Roman Catholic or non-
denominational management and receive
grants from the Northern Ireland
Department of Education.
All grant-aided schools include elected
parents and teachers on their boards of
governors.
While all Northern Ireland schools must
be open to pupils of all religions, most
Catholic pupils attend Catholic schools and
most Protestant children are enrolled at
local authority schools. The policy of
successive governments has been to
encourage integrated education, providing for
both Protestant and Roman Catholic pupils,
where there is a local desire for it. Local
management of schools was introduced in
Northern Ireland in April 1991. Under this,
secondary school governors have taken on
delegated responsibility for managing school
budgets and staff numbers. At present
primary and nursery school governors have
delegated responsibility for managing non¬
staff costs only.
New integrated schools receive immediate
government funding. Existing grant-aided
schools can opt for grant-maintained
integrated status after a ballot of parents.
There are two categories of integrated
schools. Grant-maintained integrated status
can be applied for by new and independent
schools as well as those already receiving
public funds. Grant-maintained integrated
schools are directly financed by the Northern
Ireland Department of Education and are
run by boards of governors. Controlled
integrated status can be sought by voluntary
and controlled schools; local education
authorities can also apply to set up such
schools. Local education authorities provide
funding for and supervise controlled
integrated schools.
Nursery and Primary Schools
Although there is no statutory requirement
to educate under-fives, successive
governments have enabled nursery education
to expand. One-half of three- and four-year-
olds receive education in nursery schools or
classes or in infants’ classes in primary
schools. In addition, many children attend
pre-school playgroups, most of which are
organised by parents and affiliated to the
Pre-School Playgroups Association.
Compulsory education begins at five in
Great Britain and four in Northern Ireland,
when children go to infant schools or
departments; at seven many go on to junior
schools or departments. The usual age for
transfer from primary to secondary schools is
11 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
but some local authorities in England have
established ‘first’ schools for pupils aged 5 to
8, 9 or 10 and ‘middle’ schools for age-
ranges between 8 and 14. In Scotland
primary schools take children from 5 to 12.
Secondary Schools
The publicly maintained system of education
aims to give all children an education suited
to their particular abilities. Around nine-
tenths of the maintained secondary school
population in Great Britain attend
comprehensive schools. These take pupils
without reference to ability or aptitude and
provide a wide range of secondary education
for all or most of the children in a district.
English and Welsh schools can be organised
in a number of ways. They include:
• those that take the full secondary school
age-range from 11 to 18;
• middle schools, whose pupils move on to
senior comprehensive schools at 12, 13
or 14, leaving at 16 or 18; and
• schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to
16, combined with a sixth-form or a
tertiary college for pupils over 16.
150
EDUCATION
Sixth-form colleges are schools which may
provide non-academic in addition to
academic courses. Tertiary colleges offer a
range of full-time and part-time vocational
courses for students over 16, as well as
academic courses. Most other children attend
‘grammar’ or ‘secondary modern’ schools, to
which they are allocated after selection
procedures at the age of 11. By August 1991,
over 100 schools had achieved grant-
maintained status under the Education
Reform Act’s ‘opting out’ provisions (see
p 149).
Scottish secondary education is almost
completely non-selective; the majority of
schools are six-year comprehensives. The
Government, in partnership with private
sponsors, is seeking to set up technology
academies in Scotland with a role similar to
that of the city technology colleges (see
p 146).
In Northern Ireland secondary education
is organised largely along selective lines,
based on a system of testing. However, there
are some secondary schools run on a non-
selective basis.
Independent Schools
Independent schools are outside the publicly
maintained sector, but they must register
with the appropriate education department
and are open to inspection. They can be
required to remedy serious shortcomings in
their accommodation or instruction, and to
exclude anyone regarded as unsuitable to
teach in or own a school. About 7 or 8 per
cent of schoolchildren in Britain attend
independent schools.
There are 2,500 independent schools
educating 600,000 pupils of all ages. They
charge fees varying from around £300 a term
for day pupils at nursery age to £3,500 a
term for senior boarding pupils. Many offer
bursaries to help pupils from less well-off
families. Such pupils may also be helped by
local education authorities—particularly if
the authorities’ own schools cannot meet the
needs of individual children—or by the
Government’s Assisted Places Scheme, under
which assistance is given according to
parental income. In 1990-91 over 33,000
places were offered at 295 schools in England
and Wales, and around 3,000 at 59 schools
in Scotland, under the scheme. The
Government also gives income-related help
with fees to pupils at certain specialist music
and ballet schools.
Within the independent sector there is
great variety of provision, ranging from small
kindergarten to large day and boarding
schools and from new and in some cases
experimental schools to ancient foundations.
The 600 boys’, girls’ and mixed preparatory
schools are so called because they prepare
children for the Common Entrance
Examination to senior schools. The normal
age-range is from seven-plus to 11, 12 or 13,
but many of the schools now have pre¬
preparatory departments for younger
children. A number of independent schools
have been established by religious and ethnic
minorities.
Independent schools for older pupils—
from 11, 12 or 13 to 18 or 19—include about
550 which are sometimes referred to as
‘public schools’. These are schools belonging
to the Headmasters’ Conference, the
Governing Bodies Association, the Society of
Headmasters and Headmistresses of
Independent Schools, the Girls’ Schools
Association and the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association. They should not
be confused with the state-supported public
schools in Scotland.
Special Educational Needs
Special educational needs comprise learning
difficulties of all kinds, including mental and
physical disabilities which hinder or prevent
learning. In the case of children whose
learning difficulties are severe or complex,
local education authorities are required to
assess the child’s special educational needs
and to provide a statement or record of these
needs. Wherever possible, children with
special educational needs are educated in
ordinary schools, provided that the parents’
wishes have been taken into account, and
that this is compatible with meeting the
needs of the child, with the provision of
efficient education for the other children in
the school, and with the efficient use of
151
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
resources. In Scotland the choice of school is
a matter for agreement between education
authorities and parents.
There are 1,900 special schools (both day
and boarding), including those run by
voluntary organisations and those established
in hospitals. They cater for a wide variety of
pupils with special educational needs (about
120,000) who cannot be educated at ordinary
schools. Developments in information
technology (see p 156) are increasingly
leading to better quality education for
children with special needs.
Teachers
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are
appointed by local education authorities or
school governing bodies. A total of 528,000
teachers are employed in maintained and
independent schools, and the average
pupil-teacher ratio for all schools is 17 to 1.
Teachers in maintained schools must hold
qualifications approved by the appropriate
education department (see p 162).
The Curriculum
England and Wales
The Government favours widening
educational opportunities as much as possible
through a broad and balanced curriculum
differentiated to meet the individual needs of
pupils and relevant to the modern world. In
1989 primary and secondary schools began
the gradual introduction of the National
Curriculum in England and Wales. The
National Curriculum, which the Government
believes should occupy not less than 70 per
cent of teaching time, consists of the core
subjects of English, mathematics and science,
as well as the other foundation subjects of
history, geography, technology, music, art,
physical education and, for secondary level
pupils, a modern foreign language. Economic
and industrial awareness are important cross¬
curricular themes in the National
Curriculum.
In Wales the Welsh language constitutes a
core subject in Welsh-speaking schools and a
foundation subject elsewhere under the
National Curriculum. In the primary sector
80 per cent of schools either use Welsh as a
teaching medium or teach it as a second
language, while nearly 90 per cent of
secondary schools teach Welsh as a first or
second language.
Attainment targets are being devised to
establish what children should normally be
expected to know, understand and be able to
do at the ages of 7, 11, 14, and 16, enabling
the progress of each child to be measured
against national standards. Pupils’
performance in relation to attainment targets
is assessed and reported on at the four key
stages. Regulations have been introduced
covering the manner and form in which
assessments of individual pupils are to be
made available to parents and others (see
p 155).
Religious education is required for all
pupils as part of the basic curriculum.
However, parents have a right to withdraw
their children from religious education
classes (see p 154). The content of religious
education courses is determined locally.
Scotland
The content and management of the
curriculum in Scotland are the responsibility
of education authorities and head teachers,
though guidance is provided by the Secretary
of State for Scotland and the Scottish
Consultative Council on the Curriculum.
The Council has recommended that
secondary level pupils should follow a broad
and balanced curriculum consisting of
English, mathematics, science, a modern
European language, social studies,
technological activities, art, music or drama,
religious and moral education, and physical
education. A major programme of curricular
review and development is in progress for
the 5-to-14 age-range. The Government is in
the process of issuing new guidelines on all
aspects of the curriculum and assessment.
Standardised tests in English and
mathematics are being introduced for
primary school pupils at stages 4 and 7,
normally at ages 8 and 12.
A flexible system of vocational courses for
16- to 18-year-olds based on modules or
152
EDUCATION
short units of study has been introduced in
schools and colleges in disciplines like
business and administration and engineering
and industrial production. Though designed
primarily to improve the preparation of
young people for working life, the courses
are also intended to meet the needs of many
adults entering training or returning to
education. The courses lead to the award of
a National Certificate.
A committee has been established to
review courses and assessment arrangements
in the final two years of secondary schooling.
Provision is made for teaching in Gaelic in
Gaelic-speaking areas.
Northern Ireland
A common curriculum is being introduced in
all Northern Ireland grant-aided schools. It is
based on six broad areas of study: English,
mathematics, science and technology, the
environment and society, creative and.
expressive studies, and, for secondary
schools, language studies. Religious
education is obligatory at all stages.
Attainment targets, programmes of study
and methods of assessment—at ages 8, 11, 14
and 16—are specified for all compulsory
subjects. In addition, the school curriculum
includes six compulsory cross-curricular
themes: ‘education for mutual
understanding’, cultural heritage, health
education, information technology, and, in
secondary schools, economic awareness and
careers education.
Ethnic Minority Children
Most school-aged children from ethnic
minorities were born in Britain and tend to
share the interests and aspirations of children
in the population at large. Nevertheless, a
substantial number still have particular needs
arising from cultural differences, including
those of language, religion and custom.
The education authorities have done
much to meet these needs. English language
teaching continues to receive priority, but
attention has been increasingly directed at
supporting the use of mother tongues,
especially in the early primary years.
Emphasis has been placed on the need for
schools to take account of the ethnic and
cultural backgrounds of pupils and
curricula should reflect ethnic and cultural
diversity. Measures are being taken to
improve the achievement of ethnic minority
pupils, and to prepare all children, not just
those of ethnic minority origin, for living in
a multi-ethnic society.
Curriculum Development
In England curriculum development is
promoted by the National Curriculum
Council and in Wales by the Curriculum
Council for Wales. At some 480 teachers’
centres, teachers meet for curriculum
development work, discussion and in-
service training. In Scotland such
development work is undertaken by the
Scottish Consultative Council on the
Curriculum and in Northern Ireland by the
Northern Ireland Curriculum Council.
Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative
The Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative (TVEI) applies in England,
Scotland and Wales. It is financed and
administered by the Department of
Employment and the Scottish Office
Industry Department working in close co¬
operation with local education authorities.
It is intended that the education of 14- to
18-year-olds should equip them for
working life by ensuring that the school
curriculum relates to the working
environment, and by improving skills and
qualifications, particularly in science,
technology and modern languages. The
initiative aims to include all students aged
14 to 18 in maintained schools and colleges
by 1992.
Religious Education and Collective
Worship in Schools
In England and Wales maintained schools
must provide religious education and a
daily act of collective worship for all
pupils except those withdrawn by their
153
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
parents. The Education Reform Act 1988
requires that due recognition be given to
the place of Christianity in teaching in
county schools, but religious education
also covers other faiths. In county schools
collective worship must be wholly or
mainly of a broadly Christian character.
The law provides for the lifting of this
requirement in appropriate circumstances.
In county schools, and sometimes in
voluntary schools, non-denominational
religious education is given in accordance
with a locally agreed syllabus which may
include the comparative study of religions.
Syllabuses have been revised in some areas
to take account of the faiths of the local
population. In all kinds of voluntary
schools there is the opportunity for
denominational religious education.
Scottish education authorities are
required to see that schools practise
religious observance and give pupils
religious instruction; parents may
withdraw their children if they wish.
Certain schools provide for Roman
Catholic children but in all schools there
are safeguards for the individual
conscience.
In Northern Ireland, too, schools are
obliged to offer religious education and
collective worship, although parents have
the right to withdraw their children from
both. In controlled schools clergy have a
right of access which may be used for
denominational instruction. In voluntary
schools collective worship and religious
education are controlled by the
management authorities. It is intended that
religious education will have an agreed
core syllabus which grant-aided schools
can expand according to their own needs
and wishes.
Qualifications
England, Wales and Northern Ireland
The main examinations taken by
secondary school pupils in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland around the age of 16
are those leading to the General Certificate
of Secondary Education (GCSE). GCSE
examinations, which have a seven-point
scale of grades, are usually taken after five
years of secondary education and can lead on
to more advanced education and training.
The Government intends the GCSE to be
the principal means for assessing attainment
at stage 4 of the National Curriculum.
Vocational qualifications may also be
used to certify attainment in the whole or
parts of National Curriculum foundation
subjects.
The General Certificate of Education
(GCE) Advanced (A) level is normally taken
after a further two years of study. New
examinations, Advanced Supplementary (AS)
levels, were held for the first time in 1989
and enable sixth-form pupils to study a
wider range of subjects than was possible
before. Students specialising in the arts and
humanities, for example, can continue to
study mathematics and technological subjects
at the new level. Requiring the same
standard of work but with only half the
content of A levels, an AS level occupies half
the teaching and study time of an A level. A
levels or a mixture of A and AS levels are
the main standard for entrance to higher
education and to many forms of professional
training.
The Government wants more schools to
offer vocational qualifications, which it
considers should be seen as an equally
valid route to further and higher
education and training.
The Certificate of Pre-Vocational
Education is for those at school or college
wishing to continue in full-time education
for a year after the age of 16 and to receive
a broadly based preparation for work or
vocational and other courses. Business &
Technician Education Council (BTEC)
qualifications can also serve as a preparation
for work or a stepping-stone into higher
education. The Certificate is being
developed by the City and Guilds of
London Institute. An improved version will
be called the City and Guilds Diploma of
Vocational Education. Schools are now
allowed to offer BTEC First Diploma
courses to 16- to 19-year-olds.
154
EDUCATION
Scotland
The public examination system in Scotland is
different from that in other parts of Britain.
Scottish pupils take the Scottish Certificate of
Education (SCE) at Standard grade at the
end of their fourth year of secondary
education (equivalent to the fifth year in
England and Wales). Pupils in the fifth and
sixth years sit the SCE Higher grade; passes
at this grade are the basis for entry to higher
education or professional training. However,
entry is becoming more flexible as wider
access to under-represented groups with non¬
standard qualifications is encouraged. For
those who have completed their main studies
at the Higher grade but wish to continue
studies in particular subjects there is the
Certificate of Sixth Year Studies (CSYS).
Standard grade courses and examinations
cater for the whole ability range. Higher and
CSYS examinations are being revised to
ensure compatibility with the Standard grade.
The National Certificate is for students
over 16 who have successfully completed a
programme of vocational courses based on
study units known as modules (see p 153).
These modules are used in schools for pupils
in the 14-to-18 age-range, and other short
courses specifically for use in schools are
being devised.
A new system of Scottish Vocational
Qualifications similar to that of the National
Council for Vocational Qualifications (see
p 161) is being introduced under the
supervision of the Scottish Vocational
Education Council.
Examinations and Assessment Councils
All GCSE and other qualifications offered to
pupils of compulsory school age in
maintained schools in England and Wales
must be approved by the Government.
Associated syllabuses and assessment
procedures must comply with national
guidelines and be approved by the School
Examinations and Assessment Council. The
aim is to secure a reasonably wide choice of
qualifications and syllabuses which promote a
broad and balanced curriculum and support
the National Curriculum.
The Council keeps under review all
aspects of examinations and assessment in
England and Wales and carries out research
and development. It co-operates with the
National Curriculum Council (for England)
and the Curriculum Council for Wales on
work connected with the National
Curriculum in schools.
The equivalent body in Scotland is the
Scottish Examination Board, which liaises
with the Scottish Consultative Council on
the Curriculum. The Northern Ireland
Schools Examinations and Assessment
Council is responsible for keeping all aspects
of examinations and assessment under
review. It liaises with the Northern Ireland
Curriculum Council.
Progress Reports
A system of school reporting of individual
pupils’ achievement was introduced in 1990,
under which parents in England and Wales
receive a yearly progress report on their
child’s National Curriculum achievements
and results in public examinations. The
National Record of Achievement, launched
in February 1991, is designed to present a
simple record of achievement in education
and training throughout working life.
In Scotland the report card system is
being reformed to give parents a clearer view
of their children’s progress. There is a
commitment for all pupils in Northern
Ireland to be issued with a record of their
performance on leaving primary and
secondary school.
Educational Standards
Her Majesty’s Inspectors (HMI) report to
the Government on the quality of education
in schools and most further and higher
education establishments outside the
universities, and advise education authorities
and schools as well as the Government. They
also report on the youth service and
education provision in hospitals, prisons and
youth custody centres, and the armed
services. Local education authorities employ
inspectors or advisers to guide them on
maintained schools.
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the Parent’s Charter, school
governors would appoint independent
HMI-approved inspection teams to inspect
their schools. Some members of HMI
would be drawn from outside education to
bring a wider perspective to inspection.
The role of the Northern Ireland
Education and Training Inspectorate is
roughly comparable to that of Her
Majesty’s Inspectorate.
The Evaluation and Monitoring Unit,
part of the School Examinations and
Assessment Council (see p 155), is mainly
concerned with evaluating the assessment
arrangements for the National Curriculum.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland
programmes of monitoring have been
carried out in English language and
mathematics at the ages of 11 and 15, in
science at the ages of 11, 13 and 15, and in
the first foreign language at the age of 13.
In Scotland the Assessment of
Achievement research programme has
surveyed attainments of pupils in English
and mathematics at ages 8, 12 and 14.
Information Technology
The National Curriculum places a strong
emphasis on the use of information
technology (IT). There have been
government programmes for promoting
curriculum use of IT since 1980. In 1987
the Government announced a major new
strategy to encourage use of educational
technology across the curriculum so that
pupils become familiar with the new
technologies and use them to enhance
learning. In the three years since 1988
grant-supported expenditure of £75 million
has been available to increase the number
of microcomputers in schools and train
teachers in the effective usage of IT. Most
teachers have now received basic training
in the use of IT. There are on average
four computers for each primary school
and 41 for every secondary school.
From 1991 to 1993 grants will be
available to increase the numbers of
microcomputers in schools and for teacher
training. In both years grants may be used
to provide IT support for children with
communication difficulties. In 1992—93
grants will be available to introduce
CD-ROM (compact disc read only
memory) technology in secondary schools.
In each of the three years 1991-92 to
1993_94 there will be grant-supported
spending programmes of around £30
million to provide continuing support
for IT in schools.
The Government is also making a grant
of £5 million a year to support the
National Council for Educational
Technology (NCET). The NCET was set
up by the Government in 1988 to evaluate
the newest technologies in terms of their
application to education. Its objectives are
to support, encourage, develop and apply
the use of learning systems and new
technologies, including microcomputers,
electronic systems and other aspects of IT,
to education and training. The
corresponding body in Scotland is the
Scottish Council for Educational
Technology.
Other specific government funding
includes:
• £750,000 for the development of 19
new National Curriculum software
packages. The programme is
managed by the NCET and the
developers are matching the
Government’s financial contribution.
The software packages will be ready in
1992.
• £410,000 to install information relating
to the National Curriculum on NERIS
(National Educational Resources
Information Service—an electronic
database, see p 157).
• £1-3 million for the development of
five mathematics interactive video
discs. This programme is administered
by the National Curriculum Council.
• £540,000 in 1991-92 to test the
educational potential of CD-ROM
prior to its introduction into the
1992-93 grants programme. This
project is managed by the NCET.
156
EDUCATION
Educational Aids
Teachers and pupils use a range of aids to
assist the processes of teaching and learning.
The government-funded National
Educational Resources Information Service
enables schools to find out about teaching
aids. Most schools have audio-visual
equipment such as slide projectors and
overhead projectors, and educational
broadcasting is of major importance. The
BBC and the independent broadcasting
companies transmit radio and television
programmes designed for schools. Teachers’
notes, pupils’ pamphlets and computer
software accompany many broadcast series.
All primary and secondary schools use
microcomputers (see p 156).
Careers Education and Guidance
Increasing importance is being attached by
schools and colleges to careers education to
raise awareness of further and higher
education and careers opportunities, and help
young people to prepare for working life. As
a result, links between schools and the local
authority careers service are being
strengthened. The work of the careers
service at local level is supported by careers
information material produced by the
Government’s Careers and Occupational
Information Centre. A computer-assisted
careers guidance system known as
PROSPECTS (HE) has been developed by
the Government for students in higher
education.
Under the White Paper proposals, local
education authorities would be encouraged to
co-operate with Training and Enterprise
Councils and Local Enterprise Companies
(see p 147) in overseeing the operation of the
careers service locally.
Health and Welfare of Schoolchildren
Physical education, including organised
games, is part of the curriculum of all
maintained schools, and playing fields must
be available for pupils over the age of eight.
Most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Government health departments are
responsible for the medical inspection of
schoolchildren and for advice on, and
treatment of, specific medical and dental
problems associated with children of school
age. The Government believes that the
education service has a role to play in
preventing and dealing with juvenile drug
misuse and in helping to prevent the spread
of AIDS.
Local education authorities are largely free
to decide what milk, meals or other
refreshment to offer at their schools, and the
charges to make. Provision has to be made
free of charge, however, for pupils from
families receiving certain social security
benefits. Under certain conditions the
authorities must supply free school transport,
and they have discretionary powers to help
with the cost of travel to school. In Northern
Ireland school meals must be provided for
primary school pupils.
Corporal punishment is prohibited by law
in maintained schools in Britain.
POST-SCHOOL EDUCATION
Every 16- and 17-year-old is guaranteed a
place in full-time education or training and
all suitably qualified people are urged to go
into higher education. About two-fifths of
young people receive some form of post¬
school education, compared with a fifth in
1965. One in five of all young people enter
higher education. The Government aims to
have one in three young people in higher
education by the year 2000.
The number of degrees awarded by age-
group is comparable with that of other
developed countries. The proportion of
people in further and higher education also
compares well, taking into account the high
proportion of part-time students and the
large group of students receiving professional
training in firms.
Post-school education takes place at
universities, polytechnics, the Scottish
central institutions and colleges of education,
further and higher education colleges, adult
education centres, colleges of technology,
tertiary colleges, colleges of art and design,
and agricultural and horticultural colleges.
There are also many independent specialist
157
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
establishments, such as secretarial and
correspondence colleges, and colleges for
teaching English as a foreign language.
Voluntary and public bodies offer cultural
and general education, sometimes with
assistance from local education authorities
and central government. Many education and
training schemes are run by public and
private organisations.
The Credit Accumulation and Transfer
Scheme, introduced in 1986, is used by
many English and Welsh further and higher
education establishments. In Scotland a
credit accumulation scheme covers courses in
all further and higher education. The
Government aims to improve awareness of
the opportunities for further and higher
education and training through the
development of national information services,
such as the Educational Counselling and
Credit Transfer Information Service funded
by the Department of Education and
Science.
The Further Education Unit, with
funding from the Department of Education
and Science, is an advisory and development
body for further education. The Scottish
Further Education Unit performs a parallel
role.
Higher Education
Higher education is provided by universities,
polytechnics, the Scottish central institutions
and colleges of education and institutions of
further and higher education, some
concerned wholly with teacher training. The
Government considers that access to higher
education courses should be available to all
those who can benefit from them and have
the necessary intellectual competence,
motivation and maturity.
Although GCE A levels and their
equivalents in Scotland have traditionally
been the standard for entry to higher
education courses, other qualifications and
courses are now considered equally
appropriate. These are AS levels, BTEC and
other vocational qualifications (see p 154)
and access/foundation courses (see p 161).
The Scottish Wider Access Programme
(SWAP) is designed to promote wider
participation in higher education, especially
by more mature students and those without
the normal entry requirements. Successful
completion of a SWAP course guarantees a
higher education place.
In 1989 there were 1 million students in
higher education, about one-quarter more
than in 1980. The Government aims to
secure further increases in participation, and
the number of students in full-time higher
education is expected to rise by some 10 per
cent between 1988—89 and 1992—93. One of
its main aims in higher education is to bring
about a change in the balance of provision in
favour of scientific, technological and directly
vocational courses.
In order to maintain British expertise in
technology, recent government schemes have
sought to expand higher education and
research in electronics, engineering and
computer science by making available extra
student places, and additional staff and
research fellowships in universities,
polytechnics and Scottish central institutions.
In 1988 the Department of Employment
brought in a Graduate Enterprise
Programme offering 450 places on
management training courses for recently
qualified graduates intending to start their
own businesses.
Further Education
Further education comprises all provision
outside schools to people aged over 16 of a
standard up to and including GCE A level or
equivalent. Courses are run by over 500
colleges of further education, many of which
also offer higher education courses. Most of
these colleges are controlled by local
education authorities. In Scotland the new
modular courses at the non-advanced level
(see pp 152 and 155) can be taken in schools,
further education colleges or as part of
government training schemes. In Northern
Ireland further education refers to full-time
and part-time education for people over 16.
Much of the provision outside the
universities is broadly vocational. It extends
from lower-level technical and commercial
courses to advanced courses for those aiming
at higher-level posts in commerce, industry
158
EDUCATION
and administration, or taking up professions
(for example, town planning or estate
management). However, most colleges
provide non-vocational courses, including
GCSE and GCE A level courses. The
system is flexible and enables the student to
acquire whatever qualifications his or her
capabilities and time allow.
Many students on further education
courses attend part time, either by day
release or block release from employment or
during the evenings. A particular feature of
the further education system is its strong ties
with commerce and industry: much of the
further education sector is devoted to work-
related studies. Co-operation with the
business world is encouraged by the
Government and its agencies, and employers
are normally involved in designing courses.
Further education colleges supply much
of the education element in training
programmes like Youth Training and
Employment Training, both sponsored by
the Department of Employment (see p 324).
All young people on Youth Training will be
offered training and vocational education
leading to qualifications at or equivalent to a
minimum of level two in the framework
established by the National Council for
Vocational Qualifications (see p 161) and the
Scottish Vocational Education Council.
Local education authorities in England
and Wales are obliged to prepare a scheme
outlining procedures for planning further
education provision, setting college budgets
and delegating control over budgets to
college governing bodies. They must also
increase employer representation on
governing bodies. There are similar
requirements in Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
Students
Around 1 million students take full-time
courses, including sandwich courses where
substantial periods of full-time study
alternate with periods of supervised
experience on a relevant job, at universities2
and major establishments of further and
^Excluding the University of Buckingham.
higher education in Britain. Of these over
330,000 are at universities, and another
310,000 are following higher courses at
colleges of further and higher education,
polytechnics and Scottish central
institutions and other colleges. More than
400,000 are taking further education
courses, the majority of which lead to
recognised vocational or educational
qualifications.
There are also 4 million part-time
students, some of whom are released by
their employers for further education
during working hours. Many of the
remainder take part in adult education
classes.
Over 90 per cent of full-time students
on higher courses are helped by grants
from public funds, which are mandatory in
England and Wales for eligible students
taking first degree and other comparable
courses. Grants for other courses are given
at the discretion of a local education
authority. They cover tuition fees and
maintenance, with parents contributing to
maintenance costs according to income.
They are awarded by local education
authorities in England and Wales up to
first degree level. Equivalent schemes are
administered in Scotland by the Scottish
Office Education Department, and in
Northern Ireland mainly by the education
and library boards. Grants for postgraduate
study and research are offered by the
education departments and by the research
councils. Some scholarships are available
from endowments and also from particular
industries or companies.
Student Loans Scheme
Under the Education (Student Loans) Act
1990 and corresponding Northern Ireland
legislation, all home students in full-time
higher education below postgraduate level
are eligible for a top-up maintenance loan
averaging at present over £400 a year, in
addition to a maintenance grant. The
standard repayment period will initially be
five years. The scheme is designed to share
the cost of student maintenance more
equitably between students, parents and the
159
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
taxpayer, as well as to promote a stronger
sense of self-reliance among students. It is
intended that loans will eventually provide
about half of a student’s maintenance
entitlement.
Universities
There are 47 universities in Britain,
including the Open University, compared
with 17 in 1945. They are governed by
royal charters or by Act of Parliament,
enjoying complete academic freedom,
appointing their own staff and deciding
which students to admit, subjects and
methods of teaching, and degrees to award.
The universities of Oxford and Cambridge
date from the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, and the Scottish universities of
St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and
Edinburgh from the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries. All the other
universities in Britain were founded in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The
1960s saw considerable expansion in the
university sector.
Admission to universities is by selection.
Of the total number of 334,000 full-time
home and overseas university students in
1989-90, excluding those at the University
of Buckingham, 59,000 were postgraduate.
There are just under 30,000 full-time
university teachers paid wholly from
university funds. The ratio of staff to full¬
time students is about 1 to 11.
Except at the Open University, first
degree courses are mainly full time and
usually last three years. However, there are
some four-year courses, and medical and
veterinary courses normally require five
years. Degree titles vary according to the
practice of each university. In England,
Wales and Northern Ireland the most
common titles for a first degree are
Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of
Science (BSc) and for a second degree
Master of Arts (MA), Master of Science
(MSc), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).
In the older Scottish universities Master is
used for a first degree in arts subjects.
Uniformity of standards between
universities is promoted by employing
external examiners for all university
examinations, and the general pattern of
teaching is similar throughout Britain.
Research is an important feature of
university work; most staff combine research
with their teaching duties and about half of
postgraduate students are engaged on
research projects. The Government has been
seeking greater accountability and selectivity
in research. It is encouraging universities to
co-operate closely with industry on research
projects.
Open University
The Open University is a non-residential
university offering degree and other courses
for adult students of all ages in Britain and
other parts of Europe. In the main it uses a
combination of specially produced printed
texts, correspondence tuition, television and
radio broadcasts, audio and video cassettes,
and residential schools. There is also a
network of study centres for contact with
part-time tutors and counsellors, and with
fellow students. No formal academic
qualifications are required to register for
these courses, but the standards of the
University’s degrees are the same as those of
other universities. Its first degree, for which
courses began in 1971, is the BA (Open), a
general degree awarded on a system of
credits for each course completed. In
1991 there were 75,000 registered
undergraduates, and in all 108,000 first
degrees have been awarded since the
University’s inception.
By the year 2001 the Open University
expects to have 100,000 undergraduate
students on its rolls.
The University has a programme of
higher degrees, Bachelor of Philosophy
(BPhil), MPhil and PhD, available through
research, and MA, MSc and Master of
Business Administration (MBA) through
taught courses. More than 5,700 students
were registered on higher degree courses in
1991.
The University also has programmes for
professionals in education and the health and
160
EDUCATION
social services, and for up-dating managers,
scientists and technologists. Some of these
are presented as multi-media courses in the
same way as the undergraduate programme,
and others are in the form of self-contained
study packs. In 1990, 20,000 students were
following courses in these areas and 62,000
study packs were sold.
Students must normally be resident in the
European Community or in other countries
where the University has agreed to register
students. The University has also advised
many other countries on setting up similar
institutions. It has made a substantial
contribution to the new Commonwealth of
Learning project, which brings together
distance-teaching establishments and students
throughout the Commonwealth.
Polytechnics and Other Institutions
A major contribution to post-school
education in England and Wales is made by
the 34 polytechnics, most of which have been
established since 1967. They offer mainly
higher education courses in a wide range of
subjects, including those leading to first and
higher degrees and graduate-equivalent
qualifications. They also run courses leading
to the examinations of the chief professional
bodies, and to qualifications such as those of
the Business & Technician Education
Council.
‘Access’ and foundation courses provide a
preparation and an appropriate test before
enrolment on a course of higher education
for prospective students who possess non¬
standard entry qualifications. Many are from
the ethnic minority communities. The
growth of access courses has been very rapid
in recent years; about 600 are now available
nationwide.
Polytechnics have close links with
commerce and industry, and many
polytechnic students have jobs and attend on
a part-time basis. Similar provision is made
in Scotland in the 13 central institutions
(which include polytechnics) and 50 further
education colleges, and in Northern Ireland
by the University of Ulster.
In England and Wales institutes and
colleges of higher education, formed by the
integration of teacher training with the rest
of higher education, account for a significant
proportion of higher education students.
Some further education colleges run higher
education courses, often of a specialised
nature.
Council for National Academic Awards
Large numbers of students on higher
education courses in Great Britain outside
the universities take courses leading to the
qualifications of the Council for National
Academic Awards (CNAA). The Council
awards degrees and other academic
qualifications, ensuring that these are
comparable in standard with those granted
by the universities. The courses range from
science and technology to the arts, social
studies, business studies and law, but the
proportion of technology, business or other
broadly vocational courses is much higher
than in universities.
Since 1987 institutions running CNAA-
approved courses have been able to apply to
have delegated responsibility for approving
and reviewing their own courses. By August
1991 a total of 40 institutions had been
accredited by the CNAA for taught degree
courses.
The CNAA would be disbanded under
the White Paper proposals announced in
May 1991.
Vocational Qualifications
The National Council for Vocational
Qualifications (NCVQ) was set up in 1986 to
reform and rationalise the vocational
qualifications system in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The Council aims to make
qualifications more relevant to the needs of
employment by basing them on standards of
competence set by industry. It is establishing
a new framework of National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs) based on defined
levels of achievement to which qualifications
in all sectors can be assigned or accredited.
By August 1991 about 300 qualifications
drawn from 60 different employment sectors
had been accredited. The immediate target is
to complete by the end of 1992 the national
161
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
framework up to level 4 for 80 per cent of
the employed population and all the major
occupational areas.
The competence-based system is being
extended in Scotland, which already has its
own modular system, through a new system
of Scottish Vocational Qualifications (SVQs)
along the lines of NVQs. SVQs are
accredited by the Scottish Vocational
Education Council (see p 155).
Under the White Paper proposals, more
general job-related qualifications would be
devised for those seeking a broad
preparation for employment. The
Government would promote equality of
status for academic and vocational
qualifications by developing new Ordinary
and Advanced Diplomas. Students gaining
an appropriate number of GCSE passes,
equivalent vocational qualifications or a
combination of these would receive the
Ordinary Diploma. The Advanced Diploma
would be awarded to those passing GCE A
level and AS level examinations, students
gaining vocational qualifications at the same
level and those with passes in a mixture of
the two.
Other Examining Bodies
The Business & Technician Education
Council (BTEC) plans and administers a
unified national system of courses at all
levels for students in industry, commerce
and public administration in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. Courses leading to
BTEC awards are available at polytechnics,
colleges of further and higher education,
and in some schools.
The Scottish Vocational Education
Council (SCOTVEC) is the principal
examining and awarding body in the field of
further education in Scotland. SCOTVEC
administers and develops the non-advanced
SCOTVEC National Certificate and the
advanced level Higher National Certificate
and Higher National Diploma.
Qualifications in a range of occupational
areas are offered by the City and Guilds of
London Institute, and qualifications in
commercial and office practice are awarded
by the Royal Society of Arts.
Teacher Training
Courses and Qualifications
Almost all entrants to teaching in maintained
and special schools in England and Wales
complete a recognised course of initial
teacher training. Such courses are offered by
university departments of education as well
as by many polytechnics and colleges. Non¬
graduates usually qualify by taking a four-
year Bachelor of Education (BEd) honours
degree. There are also specially designed
two-year BEd courses—mostly in subjects
where there is a shortage of teachers at the
secondary level—for suitably qualified
people. Graduates normally take a one-year
Postgraduate Certificate of Education
(PGCE) course. Two-year PGCE courses are
available in the secondary shortage subjects
for those whose first degree in an associated
subject included at least one year’s study of
the subject they intend to teach.
Articled teacher courses, offering school-
based training for graduates, were introduced
in 1990. Trainees, who receive a bursary,
take on a progressively greater teaching load,
and formal training is provided both in
initial teacher-training institutions and in
school by college tutors and school teachers.
In 1989 the Government introduced a
licensed teacher scheme in England and
Wales for people without formal teacher¬
training qualifications but with relevant
qualifications and experience. Participants
generally have to complete a period of two
years of in-service training as a licensed
teacher before achieving qualified teacher
status. The Government has also made it
easier for teachers trained abroad to take up
posts in English and Welsh schools. Trained
teachers from other European Community
countries are automatically granted qualified
teacher status, while non-Community
teachers undergo a training and evaluation
period of between three months and two
years.
In Scotland all teachers in education
authority schools must be registered with the
General Teaching Council for Scotland. It is
government policy that all entrants to the
teaching profession in Scotland should be
graduates. New primary teachers qualify
162
EDUCATION
either through a four-year BEd course or a
one-year postgraduate course of teacher
training at one of the five colleges of
education. In addition, the University of
Stirling offers courses which combine
academic and professional training for
intending primary and secondary teachers.
Teachers of academic subjects at secondary
schools must hold a degree containing two
passes in the subjects which they wish to
teach. Secondary teachers must undertake a
one-year postgraduate training course. For
music and technology, four-year BEd
courses are also available, and for physical
education all teachers take BEd courses.
Teacher training in Northern Ireland is
provided by the two universities and two
colleges of education. The principal courses
are BEd Honours (four years), BA Honours
(Education) and the one-year Postgraduate
Certificate of Education.
Measures to Improve Standards
The Government is taking steps to
improve the quality of teaching by revising
selection, training and placement
procedures for new teachers, and by
increasing in-service training opportunities.
Management training courses for head
teachers are also being provided. The
Government believes that more systematic
planning is required by schools and local
education authorities to match in-service
training to both the career needs of
teachers and to the curricular needs of
schools. A major new in-service training
programme to improve the quality of
teaching in schools and institutions of
further education was introduced under the
Education (No 2) Act 1986 (see p 144).
Measures to strengthen initial teacher
training in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland have included the issuing of criteria
which courses must meet and the
establishment of the Council for the
Accreditation of Teacher Education to
review courses against the criteria. Formal
teacher appraisal is being introduced in
English and Welsh schools and the
Government expects all teachers to have
had their first appraisal by 1995.
In Scotland all courses have been revised
following recommendations of working
parties on teacher training. All new pre¬
service and major in-service courses provided
by colleges of education must be approved
by the Scottish Office Education Department
and a validating body. Education authorities
are to be asked to implement national
guidelines for the introduction of systematic
schemes of staff development and appraisal.
The Government has taken reserve powers
requiring authorities to operate schemes
prescribed by it in the event of a breakdown
of voluntary agreements.
Further Education for Adults
Further education for adults is provided by
further education colleges, adult education
colleges, local authority adult education
services and in community schools and
colleges. Provision is also made in six long¬
term residential colleges and by the Workers’
Educational Association and other voluntary
bodies.
More than 2'5 million people aged 19 or
over enrol each year on further
education courses.
In addition to cultural, physical and craft
pursuits, students follow courses leading to
academic and vocational qualifications, and
courses which provide access to higher
education. Adults’ special educational needs
for literacy and numeracy are also met, and
there is provision for those seeking
proficiency in English as a foreign language.
PICKUP
The Government has improved opportunities
for both adult and continuing education. The
Professional, Industrial and Commercial
Updating Programme (PICKUP) is designed
to help colleges, polytechnics and universities
meet the need to up-date and broaden the
skills of those in mid-career. Enrolments on
PICKUP-type courses have been growing by
about 20 per cent annually in recent years.
Many courses are concerned with the single
European market.
163
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
ALBSU
The Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit
(ALBSU) is the central focus for adult
literacy, numeracy and communications skills
in England and Wales. A three-year literacy
and numeracy initiative was launched in 1989
as a joint venture between the Government
and the BBC. It involves the use of
television and radio and specially printed
material to improve the communications
skills of an estimated 6 million adults. Basic
Skills at Work is a programme for raising
basic skill levels with government funding
approaching £3 million. New nationally
recognised qualifications in communication
and numeracy are being developed, and a
referral service is being created to put people
in contact with 60 new open-learning centres
and other local learning facilities.
In Scotland, responsibility for overseeing
adult basic education rests with the Scottish
Community Education Council.
Open College
Open learning opportunities have been
extended with the formation in 1987 of the
Open College, an independent company set
up with government support. The College
brings together broadcasters, educationists
and sponsors, and provides vocational
education and training courses below degree
level. Up to £12 million is being allocated by
the Government for the College’s
commercial activities as well as £6 million
for broadcasting. The Open College of the
Arts, also launched in 1987, offers an art
foundation course to those wishing to study
at home.
Other Institutions
Apart from provision for mature students at
universities and polytechnics, courses are
offered by the Open University, further
education colleges, adult education centres,
residential colleges, extra-mural departments
of universities and bodies such as voluntary
organisations. Most of the provision is made
by the local education authorities in a variety
of establishments, including schools used for
adult evening classes and ‘community
schools’ offering educational, social and
cultural opportunities for the wider
community. A majority of courses are part
time. Local authorities also maintain or aid
many of the short-term residential colleges or
centres. Long-term residential colleges,
grant-aided by central government
departments, have courses of one or two
years and aim to provide a liberal education
for adults with few or no formal academic
qualifications. Most students are entitled to
full maintenance grants.
University extra-mural departments and
the Workers’ Educational Association, the
largest recognised voluntary educational body
in Britain, offer extended part-time courses
of liberal studies. They also run short
courses for special (including vocational)
interests. Various kinds of education and
training are provided by many other
organisations, for example, the National
Federation of Women’s Institutes, the Young
Men’s Christian Association and the Pre-
Retirement Association.
National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education
The National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education is a centre of information,
research, development work and publication
for adult and continuing education. It plays a
central role in advising on and co-ordinating
developments in policy and practice. Also,
the Institute acts as a channel of co-operation
and consultation for the many interested
organisations which it represents in England
and Wales. It administers with government
funding the Unit for the Development of
Adult Continuing Education, which
undertakes research and development work.
The Unit is to merge with the Further
Education Unit in April 1992.
Scottish Community Education Council
The Scottish Community Education Council
advises the Government and promotes all
community education matters, including
adult literacy and basic education, and the
youth service in Scotland.
164
EDUCATION
Teaching Methods
The general pattern of teaching and learning
on full-time courses of higher education is a
mixture of lectures; prescribed or suggested
reading; seminars and tutorials; essays,
exercises and tests; and practical work or
work experience.
Radio and television programmes, both
specifically educational and general, are
important media for continuing education
and are often linked to supplementary
publications, courses and activities. The
BBC, independent television and Channel 4
present programmes which range from basic
education and progressive vocational training
to domestic, social and craft skills. The BBC
also works with the Open University (see
p 160), producing and broadcasting radio and
television programmes that form part of the
University’s courses. Channel 4 has a similar
relationship with the Open College.
EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH
Research into the theory and practice of
education and the organisation of educational
services is supported financially by central
and local government, the Economic and
Social Research Council, philanthropic
organisations, higher education institutions,
teachers’ associations and certain
independent bodies.
The major research institution outside the
universities is the autonomous National
Foundation for Educational Research in
England and Wales. The Scottish Council
for Research in Education and the Northern
Ireland Council for Educational Research
have similar functions.
EDUCATIONAL LINKS OVERSEAS
Schoolchildren, students, teachers and others
come to Britain from overseas to study, and
British people work and train overseas. Many
opportunities for such movement are the
result of international co-operation at
government level within the European
Community and within the Commonwealth.
Educational schemes, courses and
professional contacts are organised in Britain
by officially funded and voluntary
organisations. The British aid programme
encourages links between educational
institutions in Britain and developing
countries.
British membership of the European
Community has created closer ties with other
member countries. Member states are
required to seek to incorporate a European
perspective into their education systems. In
schools, colleges and universities in Britain
there has been an expansion of interest in
European studies and languages, and
exchanges of teachers, schoolchildren and
students take place.
The European Community’s European
Action Scheme for Mobility of University
Students (ERASMUS) promotes exchange of
students throughout the Community. Some
30,000 students participated in the
programme in 1990-91; 179 higher education
institutions were involved. In 1991-92
British institutions are expected to be
involved in more than 1,000 inter-university
programmes. The Community’s LINGUA
programme seeks to promote an
improvement in language competence.
Britain has adhered to the Statute of the
European Schools (nine of which have been
established throughout the Community,
including one at Culham, Oxfordshire) to
provide education for children of people
employed in Community institutions. The
European Community Action Programme for
Education and Training for Technology
(COMETT) aims to foster co-operation
between higher education establishments and
companies throughout the Community. The
UK Centre for European Education, with
government financing, promotes a European
dimension in education.
Overseas Students in Britain
People come to Britain from all over the
world to study. British universities,
polytechnics and other further and higher
education establishments have built up their
reputation overseas by offering tuition of the
highest standards, maintaining low student-
to-staff ratios, and offering relevant courses
and qualifications.
165
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In the academic year 1989-90 there were
about 52,000 overseas students at universities
and 26,000 at polytechnics and other public
sector establishments of further and higher
education. In addition, many thousands of
people from abroad were training for
nursing, law, banking and accountancy, and
service and other industries. About a third of
all overseas students were from the
Commonwealth and Britain’s dependencies.
There are now five times as many students
from European Community states as in 1980.
Many students come to Britain for advanced
training: more than one-third of students
enrolled for full-time postgraduate study or
research in Britain in 1989-90 came from
overseas. Several British colleges of further
education have entered into arrangements
with British universities to provide ‘bridging’
courses for overseas students before they
enter university.
Most overseas students pay their own fees
and expenses or hold awards from their own
governments. Those following courses of
higher or further education pay fees which
cover the full cost of their courses. Nationals
of other member countries of the European
Community generally pay the lower level of
fees that applies to British students.
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes considerable
provision for students and trainees from
overseas under its overseas aid programme
and other award and scholarship schemes. In
1990_91 nearly 25,000 overseas students were
supported, including some studying overseas,
at a cost of more than £140 million. The
majority were from developing countries,
mainly the Commonwealth, studying under
the Technical Co-operation and Training
Programme, which is financed from the aid
programme. Under the Overseas
Development Administration Shared
Scholarship Scheme, 190 awards will be
offered in 1991-92, primarily at postgraduate
level, for students from the developing
countries of the Commonwealth, with costs
being shared between the British
Government and the educational institutions.
The Foreign & Commonwealth Office
Scholarships and Awards Scheme
(FCOSAS), which operates in some 140
countries, is designed to bring to Britain
present and future leaders, decision-makers
and formers of opinion. A notable feature of
the FCOSAS is the increasing number of
awards jointly financed by the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office in partnership with
the private sector and academic institutions.
The Department of Trade and Industry also
finances a trade-related scholarship scheme
in partnership with British industry. Outside
the aid programme, the Overseas Research
Students Awards Scheme, funded by the
Department of Education and Science,
provides assistance for overseas research
students of high ability to attend British
universities.
Other Schemes
Many public and private scholarships and
fellowships are available to students from
overseas and to British students who want to
study overseas. Among the best known, and
open to men and women in all walks of life,
are the British Council Scholarships, the
Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship
Plan, the Fulbright Scholarship Scheme, the
Marshall Scholarships, the Rhodes
Scholarships, the Churchill Scholarships and
the Confederation of British Industry
Scholarships. Most British universities and
colleges offer scholarships for which
graduates of any nationality are eligible.
English as a Foreign Language
The continuing increase in interest in
English as a foreign language is reflected in
the growth of public sector English language
courses and in the number of private
language schools in Britain. Over 240 private
schools are recognised by the British
Council. The Council has expanded its own
teaching of English overseas by opening
centres and extending existing ones (155 in
all by June 1991); it also runs a programme
for teaching English related to specific jobs
and skills. Other British language schools
enable people to learn English in their own
countries, while in Britain university
166
EDUCATION
language and linguistics departments are an
important resource. The Government’s aid
programme supports the teaching of English
in many developing countries by financing
major projects in schools, universities and
other institutions. Publications and other
material relating to English language teaching
have increased in number and are now a
large component in many publishers’ lists,
constituting a major export.
BBC English, the English teaching arm of
the BBC’s World Service, offers a worldwide
facility for the individual learner at home on
radio and, with the advent of the new World
Service Television operation, increasingly on
television.
Educational Exchanges
British Council
The promotion of cultural and educational
relations with other countries is a major
concern of the British Council, which plays an
important part in the management of the aid
programme to education. It recruits teachers
for work overseas, organises short overseas
visits by British experts, and encourages
cultural exchange visits. It also runs schemes
to foster academic interchange between higher
education institutions in Britain and other
countries, and exchange schemes in other
scientific, educational and cultural areas.
Co-operation between higher education in
Britain and developing countries is promoted
with funding from the Overseas Development
Administration. It is brought about through
recruiting staff for overseas universities, the
secondment of staff from British higher
education establishments, interdepartmental
faculty links, local staff development, short¬
term teaching and advisory visits, and general
consultancy services.
Central Bureau for Educational Visits and
Exchanges
The Central Bureau for Educational Visits
and Exchanges is the national centre for
information and advice on all forms of
educational visits and exchanges. It develops
and administers a variety of exchange
schemes; links educational establishments
and local education authorities with
counterparts abroad; and organises meetings
and conferences on professional international
experience.
Among the schemes for professional
exchange which the Bureau administers are
teacher exchange in Europe, the Soviet
Union and the United States; short courses
for language teachers; and international study
visits. Opportunities for young people
include school and class links and English
language summer camps. For the post-16 age
group there are work placements and English
language assistants’ posts, as well as other
exchange programmes.
Association of Commonwealth Universities
The Association of Commonwealth
Universities promotes contact and co¬
operation between 376 member universities
in 30 Commonwealth countries or regions. It
assists student and staff mobility by
administering award schemes, including, for
Britain, the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan and the Overseas
Development Administration Shared
Scholarship Scheme, and by operating an
academic appointments service. It publishes
information about Commonwealth
universities, courses and scholarships, and
organises meetings in different parts of the
world.
Other Organisations
The Commonwealth Education Liaison
Committee supplements normal direct
dealings on education between
Commonwealth countries. The United
Kingdom Council for Overseas Student
Affairs is an independent body serving
overseas students, and those concerned with
student affairs.
The Youth Exchange Centre, managed by
the British Council, gives advice,
information, training and grants to British
youth groups involved in international
exchanges. The Centre is the national agency
for the European Community-sponsored
exchange scheme, Youth for Europe.

The Youth Service
The youth service forms part of the
education system and is concerned with
promoting the personal development and
social education of young people by
providing opportunities for them to
participate in a broad range of leisure time
and extra-curricular activities. Young people
take part in the youth service on a voluntary
basis. Extending the range of experiences
open to young people and giving them
opportunities to take part in the running of
their organisations are seen as key elements
in the provision.
The youth service is a partnership
between central government, local authorities
and voluntary youth organisations. At local
level the youth service is provided by
voluntary organisations and local education
authorities. Government education
departments formulate broad policy
objectives and encourage their
implementation through financial assistance
and advice. Government funding for the
national youth service bodies in England and
Wales is channelled through the National
Youth Agency, which is responsible for
working with voluntary and local authority
sectors to improve the quality, range and
effectiveness of their work. The Agency’s
functions include curriculum development,
youth worker training, support for managers
of organisations within the youth service and
support for international work. It is also
responsible for collecting and publishing
information on youth service matters.
In Scotland the youth service forms a part
of adult education, which is integrated within
community education. The Scottish
Community Education Council has the role
of promoting community education. The
Youth Council for Northern Ireland, with
executive and advisory powers, was set up in
1990.
At national level many voluntary
organisations belong to the National Council
for Voluntary Youth Services, a
representative and consultative body which
aims to develop the partnership between
voluntary and statutory bodies in England.
Similar councils exist in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The British Youth
Council is a national forum for young
people, youth organisations and youth
councils, including the youth wings of the
major political parties, and represents young
people at an international level.
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary youth organisations
undertake the major share of youth activities
through local groups which raise most of
their day-to-day expenses by their own
efforts. Many receive financial and other
help from local education authorities, which
also make available facilities in many areas.
The voluntary organisations vary greatly in
character and include the uniformed and
church organisations. Many local authorities
and voluntary youth organisations have
responded to new needs in society by making
provision, for example, for the young
unemployed, young people from the ethnic
minorities, young people in inner cities or
rural areas and those in trouble or especially
vulnerable. Other areas of concern are
homelessness and provision for handicapped
young people.
Among the largest voluntary youth
organisations are the Scout and Girl Guides
Associations (with about 728,000 and 670,000
members), and the Young Men’s Christian
Association (1-5 million), all of which have
worldwide affiliations; Youth Clubs UK
(about 568,000); the National Association of
Boys’ Clubs (170,000); and clubs run by the
churches. Organisations like the Outward
Bound Trust provide opportunities for
adventurous outdoor pursuits. The three
pre-service organisations (the Sea Cadet
Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training
Corps), with a membership of 130,000,
undertake activities related to the work of the
armed forces.
Many authorities have youth committees
on which official and voluntary bodies are
represented, and employ youth officers to
co-ordinate youth work and to arrange
in-service training. There are also
youth councils, which are representative
bodies of young people from local youth
organisations.
168
EDUCATION
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a basic two-year
training course at certain universities and
higher education colleges leads to the status
of qualified youth and community worker;
several undergraduate part-time and
postgraduate courses are also available. In
Scotland one- , two- and three-year courses
are provided at colleges of education and in
Northern Ireland courses are run by the
University of Ulster.
An estimated 5,500 full-time youth
workers are supported by some 500,000 part-
time workers, both qualified and unqualified,
many of them unpaid. Short courses and
conferences are held on youth and
community work. There are also in-service
courses for serving youth workers and
officers. Initial and in-service courses are
validated by the National Youth Agency.
Youth counselling is supported by the
National Association of Young People’s
Counselling and Advisory Services.
Other Organisations Concerned with
Young People
A substantial sum of money is awarded by
the many grant-giving foundations and trusts
each year for activities involving young
people. King George’s Jubilee Trust, which
distributed £879,000 in 1990—91, supports
work involving young people aged 8 to 25.
The Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust, which
awarded £16 million in 1990—91, supports
young people up to the age of 25 involved in
voluntary community service work. In
addition, The Prince’s Trust, which was set
up in 1976 to help disadvantaged young
people aged 14 to 25, paid £2 million to
individuals and small ad hoc groups in
1990-91.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award
Scheme operates through local authorities,
schools, youth organisations and industrial
firms. It enables young people from Britain
and other Commonwealth countries to take
part, with voluntary help from adults, in a
variety of challenging activities in four
areas: community service, expeditions, the
development of personal interests and
social and practical skills, and physical
recreation.
Voluntary Service by Young People
Thousands of young people voluntarily
undertake community service designed to
help those in need, including elderly and
disabled people, and many others work on
environmental projects. Organisations
providing opportunities for community
service, such as Community Service
Volunteers, International Voluntary Service
and the British Trust for Conservation
Volunteers, receive grants from the
Government. Many schools also organise
community service work as part of the
curriculum, and voluntary work in the
community is sponsored by a number of
churches.
Young Volunteers in the Community is
a national scheme which recruits young
people aged 16 to 24 to work on a variety
of community projects for 12 to 18 weeks.
It is operated jointly by The Prince’s Trust
and the Commission on Citizenship.

8 Planning, Urban
Regeneration and
Housing
Britain seeks to reconcile the conflicting
demands for land from business, housing,
transport, farming and leisure, and to protect
the environment by means of a
comprehensive statutory system of land-use
planning and development control. Most
development requires ‘planning permission’;
applications are dealt with in the light of
development plans, which set out land use
strategies for each area on such matters as
housing and industry. However, many minor
developments do not need specific planning
permission. The Government aims to remove
unnecessary planning controls as part of its
policy to promote enterprise. A
comprehensive programme to revitalise the
inner cities and other urban areas (such as
peripheral housing estates) includes a
number of initiatives designed to encourage
enterprise, employment and educational
opportunities, and to improve the quality of
housing and the urban environment.
Planning
The system of land-use planning in Great
Britain involves local authorities acting under
the supervision of the Secretaries of State for
the Environment, Wales and Scotland. The
Department of the Environment brings
together the major responsibilities in England
for land-use planning, housing and
construction, countryside policy and
environmental protection. The Welsh Office
and the Scottish Office have broadly
equivalent responsibilities.
The Department of the Environment
provides national and regional guidance on
planning matters, while strategic planning at
the county level is the responsibility of the
county councils. District councils are
responsible for local plans and development
control. In the metropolitan areas and
London, the borough and district councils
are preparing new unitary development plans
for each administrative area. In Scotland the
planning context is set by the Scottish Office
and planning functions are undertaken by
regional and district councils, whose
responsibilities are divided on a basis broadly
similar to that in England and Wales. In the
more rural regions and the islands, the
regional and islands councils respectively
have responsibility for planning. In Northern
Ireland the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland is responsible for
planning matters through six divisional
planning offices, which work closely with the
district councils.
The Government’s aim is for the
maximum use to be made of urban land for
new development, having regard to the need
to retain green spaces within the urban
environment and the need to ensure that the
cumulative effects of development do not
harm the character of established residential
areas.
Development Plans
The present development plan system in
England and Wales involves structure, local
and unitary development plans:
• structure plans, prepared by county
planning authorities and approved by the
Secretary of State, set out broad policies
for the development and other use of
land;
171
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• local plans provide detailed guidance for
development expected to start within
about ten years and are normally
prepared by district councils in general
conformity with the approved structure
plan; and
• unitary development plans set out both
strategic and detailed land use and
development policies for metropolitan
districts or boroughs.
Plans are kept under review and may be
altered from time to time. Planning
authorities must take account of any strategic
or regional guidance issued by the Secretary
of State when formulating the plans.
In Scotland structure plans are prepared
by regional or islands authorities, and local
plans by those districts with planning
responsibilities, and by general planning and
islands authorities. Under Northern Ireland’s
single-tier system, plans are prepared by the
Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland.
The Planning and Compensation Act
1991 will reform the planning system in the
non-metropolitan areas of England and
Wales by introducing mandatory district¬
wide local plans and streamlining procedures
for their adoption. The strategic role of the
counties will continue under the new system
but their planning policies will not be subject
to the formal approval of the Secretary of
State. They will, however, be required to
ensure that their statements are consistent
with any regional guidance issued by the
Secretary of State.
Public Participation
Members of the public are given an
opportunity to express their views on the
planning of their area during the formative
stages of plan preparation. Local planning
authorities must ensure publicity for the
proposed content of their plans;
representations about them may be made to
the authorities. There are also provisions for
objecting to draft plans, and for hearing and
resolving such objections.
Where specific proposals for development
differ greatly from the intentions of a
development plan, they must be publicised
locally. Other schemes affecting a large
number of people are usually advertised by
the local planning authority, and applications
seeking permission for certain types of
development—for example, those affecting
conservation areas—must also be
advertised. In Scotland a neighbour
notification system requires the applicant to
notify the owners and occupiers of land and
buildings adjoining the site of a proposed
development at the same time as the
application is submitted to the local planning
authority.
The applicant has a right of appeal to the
Secretary of State if the local authority
refuses planning permission or grants it with
conditions attached. Such appeals are
decided either on the basis of written
submissions or, generally in the case of
important applications, after a public inquiry.
Similar provision is made in Northern
Ireland for public participation in the
planning process and for the hearing of
representations at public inquiries. For
planning applications which do not give rise
to public inquiries the applicant has a right
of appeal to the independent Planning
Appeals Commission.
Major Schemes
The Secretaries of State can direct that a
planning application be referred to them for
decision. This power to ‘call in’ is generally
exercised only for proposals which raise
planning issues of national or regional
importance. The applicant and the local
planning authority have the right to be heard
by a person appointed by the Secretary of
State for that purpose and a public inquiry
will normally be held. In Northern Ireland,
major planning applications are dealt with
under the Planning (NI) Order 1972, which
allows for a public inquiry in certain
circumstances.
For projects which are likely to have
significant effects upon the environment, a
planning application must be accompanied by
an environmental statement. This should
describe the likely significant effects and
propose measures to avoid, reduce or remedy
172
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
any significant adverse effects identified.
Planning permission cannot be given without
first taking into consideration environmental
information—the environmental statement
for the project and representations received
in response to its publication. The public
must be given the opportunity to comment
on the statement, and copies will be sent to
relevant public bodies, such as the
Countryside Commission and English
Nature, so that they can make
representations to the local planning
authority.
New Towns
The 32 new towns designated since 1946—21
in England, two in Wales, five in Scotland
and four in Northern Ireland—have now
largely achieved their aims of dispersal of
industry and population from congested
cities and the stimulation of regional
economies.
The new towns have a total population
of over 2 million; several have become
regional centres for shopping and office
accommodation.
The new town development corporations’
priorities now are to maximise private
investment in housing and employment, to
achieve balanced communities able to
generate their own growth, and to sell or
transfer their assets before winding up.
With the completion of the new towns
programme, the development corporations
which administered the new towns are being
dissolved. The remaining two corporations in
England will be wound up by March 1992,
and dissolution of the first two of the five
Scottish development corporations is due to
begin in late 1991. In Wales responsibility
for Newtown rests with the Development
Board for Rural Wales, while the corporation
responsible for Cwmbran was dissolved in
1988.
Architectural Standards
High standards in new building are
encouraged by the Government, although it
advises local planning authorities not to
impose their architectural tastes on
developers. The Department of the
Environment, in collaboration with the
independent Royal Institute of British
Architects (RIBA) and the National House-
Building Council, sponsors the biennial
Housing Design Awards Scheme for England
and Northern Ireland, with categories for
renovation as well as new building. Scotland
and Wales have similar award schemes.
Royal Fine Art Commissions for England
and Wales and for Scotland advise
government departments, planning
authorities and other public bodies on
questions of public amenity or artistic
importance.
The RIBA, the principal professional
body for architects, together with the
Architects Registration Council of the
United Kingdom, exercises control over
standards in architectural education and
encourages high architectural standards in
the profession. The Royal Incorporation of
Architects in Scotland is allied to it, as is the
Royal Society of Ulster Architects.
Urban Regeneration
Despite much progress in urban
regeneration, areas of deprivation still exist.
These relatively small areas can have a
blighting effect on a city’s image. The
Government is therefore continuing to tackle
urban deprivation.
The ‘Action for Cities’ initiative, launched
in 1988, contains a comprehensive package
for revival in England and Wales, involving
government departments in a co-ordinated
effort. The Government spends some £4,000
million a year in the inner cities, spread
across a range of programmes.
However, sustainable urban regeneration
depends upon the commitment of all those
with an interest in the well-being of an area.
In May 1991 the Government announced a
new initiative called ‘City Challenge’. Under
this programme, local authorities are invited
to submit plans for regenerating their key
neighbourhoods by tackling the problems of
physical decay and poor quality of life. The
best of these proposals will receive a
173
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
commitment of government funding for up
to five years. The local council will provide
the leadership in developing and
implementing the plan, but it will draw on
the talent and expertise of local communities,
the private sector, academic institutions,
statutory agencies and the voluntary
sector.
Pilot projects involving 11 councils will
begin in 1992-93. The Government has set
aside £82-5 million a year over a five-year
period to help these areas. This will be
combined with spending by the councils
themselves, the private sector and other
bodies. The Government intends to hold a
further competition, open to all Urban
Programme authorities, for 1993-94 and
eventually to distribute more urban resources
on a competitive basis.
Urban problems in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are being tackled by
Partnerships, the Programme for the Valleys
and Belfast Action Teams respectively, as
well as by many other government
programmes.
Urban Programme
The Urban Programme is a special allocation
to selected local authorities in addition to
their normal resources. It is concentrated on
target areas (see map, pp 176—7) where the
problems are greatest and the levels of
deprivation most severe, so as to achieve a
greater impact with available funds. The
local authorities concerned receive 75 per
cent grant from central government to cover
spending on approved projects. The
programme supports some 9,000 projects at
any one time and is directed at economic,
social, environmental and housing problems.
In 1990-91 the Urban Programme
supported some 471 new firms, helped to
create or preserve 38,000 jobs and supported
80,000 inner city training places. It improved
6,000 buildings and around 1,600 hectares
(3,950 acres) of unsightly land. It also
supported environmental improvement
schemes for 82,000 dwellings. The
Government has allocated £269 million for
spending on the Urban Programme in
1991-92.
City Action Teams
Eight ‘City Action Teams’ (CATs) have been
established in England to co-ordinate and
target government programmes to regenerate
inner cities. These teams bring together the
regional officials of the Department of
Employment and its Employment Service,
the Department of the Environment and the
Department of Trade and Industry to ensure
that their main programmes are working
together effectively. They act as a central
contact point with government for business
and voluntary and community organisations.
Each CAT has a sponsoring Minister to
advise it and a small special budget for
tackling local inner city problems which
relate to unemployment, enterprise
generation and environmental improvement.
Task Forces
A total of 16 ‘Task Forces’ have been set up
in England to bring together and focus the
efforts of government departments, local
government, the private sector and the local
community to regenerate inner cities. They
are small teams of five or six civil servants
based in the most deprived parts of ;their
inner city areas (see map, pp 176-7). Task
Forces aim to help local people by increasing
their chances of gaining employment and by
building up local businesses. They also
support schemes which improve the
environment or reduce crime where these are
linked directly to the creation of jobs. Since
their inception they have committed some
£80 million to over 3,000 projects. They are
not permanent; an important part of their
work is to build up local organisations to
which they can hand over as they withdraw.
Urban Development Corporations
Eleven urban development corporations
(UDCs) have been set up by the
Government in order to reverse large-scale
urban decline. The first two were established
in London Docklands and Merseyside in
1981. By the end of March 1991 the London
Docklands Development Corporation had
received over £1,100 million in government
174
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
grant and secured private investment
commitments of about £8,400 million. It has
reclaimed over 580 hectares (1,430 acres) of
derelict land for housing, commercial and
recreational use. Over 15,000 homes have
been completed and 31,000 jobs have been
attracted to the area. The Merseyside
Development Corporation has reclaimed 312
hectares (770 acres) of derelict land, and
284,000 sq m (3 1 million sq ft) of
commercial or industrial floorspace have
been built or refurbished in its area.
Nine further UDCs have been set up:
Trafford Park (Greater Manchester),
Teesside, Tyne and Wear, Black Country
(West Midlands) and Cardiff Bay in 1987
and Bristol, Leeds, central Manchester and
Sheffield in 1988-89. UDCs cover about
16,000 hectares (about 40,000 acres), and
public expenditure on the programme will be
£470 million in 1991-92.
City Grant
City Grant was introduced in 1988 to
simplify and replace the existing grants
available for encouraging private sector
developments in inner cities. It is paid direct
to the private sector for projects which
contribute to the regeneration of urban areas.
By May 1991, 195 schemes in England had
been approved, with £177 million of public
money bringing in £770 million of private
investment. Under these schemes, some
28,000 jobs and 4,500 homes were being
provided and 384 hectares (950 acres) were
being reclaimed.
Enterprise and Simplified Planning
Zones
Since 1981 the Government has set up 27
‘enterprise zones’ (see map, pp 176-7); each
zone runs for a period of ten years from
designation. Benefits in the zones include:
• exemption from the uniform business
rate (the local property tax payable by
non-domestic property owners);
• 100 per cent allowances for corporation
and income tax purposes for capital
expenditure on industrial and
commercial buildings;
• a much simplified planning systemand
• a reduction in government requests for
statistical information.
By December 1989, nearly 130,000 jobs in
5,200 establishments were located in
enterprise zones. The Government does not
propose to extend the scheme generally,
although in exceptional circumstances a new
zone might be created as the best way of
tackling a particular local problem. The
earliest zones have reached the end of their
lives; research is being undertaken to identify
the circumstances in which the benefits
available in enterprise zones are most
effective.
The Housing and Planning Act 1986
provided for the establishment of ‘simplified
planning zones’, intended to stimulate
regeneration by removing the uncertainty
from the planning system. They use a
simplified planning framework similar to that
used in enterprise zones, under which
advance planning permission is given for
specified types of development within a zone.
A simplified planning zone scheme lasts for
ten years.
Land Reclamation and Use
The 1988 Derelict Land Survey found that
there were just under 40,500 hectares
(100,000 acres) of derelict land in England,
11 per cent less than in 1982. Although
much land had been reclaimed, substantial
areas had become derelict during this period.
Derelict land is often concentrated in places
associated with nineteenth-century industrial
development, but the continuing
restructuring of particular industries has
added significantly to the problem in certain
areas.
In England government grants are
available to local authorities and to other
public bodies, to the private sector and to
nationalised industries for the reclamation of
such land in order to bring it into beneficial
use or to improve its appearance. In 1991-92
the funding available for derelict land
reclamation in England will be about £72
million, of which some £21 million will be
spent on derelict land reclamation in the

inner cities. Between 1 April 1979 and 31
March 1989 some 13,000 hectares (over
32,000 acres) of derelict land were reclaimed
in England with the aid of some £523
million of grant. The 1990-91 programme
should allow an additional 1,265 hectares
(some 3,125 acres) to be reclaimed.
In Scotland and Wales responsibility for
derelict land reclamation rests with the
respective enterprise and development
agencies, such as Scottish Enterprise and the
Welsh Development Agency, which may
acquire and reclaim land, employ local
authorities as their agents (in Scotland) or
make grants to local authorities for the
purpose (in Wales). In 1988 the pilot
Scottish Vacant Land Survey identified 7,400
hectares (18,280 acres) of derelict land and a
further 5,060 hectares (12,500 acres) of
vacant urban land. Together with surveys in
subsequent years, it will provide a basis for
programming the treatment of derelict land
and help to bring vacant urban land into
use. In Northern Ireland grants may be paid
to landowners who restore or improve
derelict sites.
In Wales land use is also encouraged by
the Land Authority for Wales, a statutory
body with powers to make land available for
development in circumstances where the
private sector would find this difficult or
impossible.
Registers of Unused and Under-used
Land
Since 1989 local authorities, nationalised
industries and other public bodies in
England have been responsible for compiling
registers, open for public inspection, of any
unused or under-used land they hold. These
owners’ registers have largely replaced a
register compiled by the Secretary of State
for the Environment. This latter register is,
however, being retained for the time being
because the Secretary of State’s power to
direct public bodies to dispose of land
applies only to land entered on this register.
By the end of May 1991, directions had
been issued in respect of 83 sites. Under
the ‘Public Request to Order Disposal’
scheme the public is encouraged to request
such directions. Registers are also published
for certain areas of Wales.
Education, Training and
Employment
The first of a network of City Technology
Colleges was opened near Birmingham in
1988; 13 are currently in operation, with
another two approved. Intended to raise
educational standards, the colleges are
funded jointly by the Government and
industry.
A number of schools/industry ‘Compacts’
have been introduced in deprived urban
areas since August 1988. Groups of
employers work with schools to guarantee a
job with training for all school-leavers aged
16 to 18 who meet agreed targets for
motivation and achievement. By October
1991 there were 58 Compacts operational
and another three in development, with some
92,000 young people, almost 9,000 employers
and about 500 schools involved. Compacts
will be operating in all inner city target areas
by the end of 1991.
Training programmes, such as Youth
Training for young people and Employment
Training, aimed particularly at adults
unemployed for more than six months and
those with special needs, are helping many
people in the inner cities. In late 1990, one-
third of young people who were from the
inner cities were participating in Youth
Training and nearly half of all unemployed
people who had joined Employment Training
were inner city residents. There are over 100
Employment Service ‘outreach’ staff based in
or visiting inner city areas, helping
unemployed people look for jobs and
encouraging them to participate in
programmes and training. In mid-1991, there
were about 500 inner city Jobclubs, many
catering for people with literacy and
numeracy or language difficulties. In
addition, Employment Service regional
directors have funds for innovative projects
to help unemployed people in inner cities
and other deprived areas back into work or
training. These projects often involve
partnerships with other organisations or
employers.

PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
Other Measures
Higher than average crime rates, and the fear
of crime, are particular problems in the inner
cities. Safer Cities projects bring together all
sections of the local community to tackle
crime-related problems. The starting point
for a project is the preparation of a detailed
local crime profile, which a Home Office
project team can then use to draw up an
i action plan. Examples of help include
improving street lighting and fitting good
quality locks to houses on estates with a high
burglary rate.
A total of 16 Safer Cities projects are
under way, supporting 1,330 local crime
prevention initiatives with the help of
grants worth £7 million. Four more
projects are due to be established by the
end of 1991.
The Government encourages tourism as a
force for the improvement of inner city
areas, and several major projects which create
a cultural and artistic focus for inner city
regeneration have been undertaken: for
example, the Tate Gallery of the North at
the Albert Dock in Liverpool and the Design
Museum in London’s Docklands. In 1990
the ‘Vision for Cities’ initiative was launched
to help businesses in the inner cities to focus
on the investment opportunities which
tourism brings.
The Government’s priorities for inner city
housing are to secure a wide range of good
quality housing available for rent or
purchase, and to improve conditions and
opportunities for residents, particularly on
local authority estates (see p 184).
Research
The Government commissions research
aimed at developing policies for regenerating
inner cities and returning derelict land to
productive use; 11 new research projects
were launched in 1990-91, and the
programme’s budget totalled £800,000.
Priority themes for research are:
• to assess the progress and achievements
of policies and policy instruments;
• to examine the future for inner cities and
the implications for policy; and
• to learn more about the capacity of the
private and voluntary sectors, and of
local communities, to undertake
regeneration.
Wales
Spending on the Urban Programme in Wales
is expected to be some £38 million in
1991-92, with priority being given to the ten
most deprived urban areas. Urban
Investment Grant was introduced in April
1989 to simplify the grants available to
support private sector projects, replacing
Urban Development Grant and Urban
Regeneration Grant.
The Programme for the Valleys, launched
in 1988, is the most extensive programme of
economic and urban regeneration undertaken
in Wales, and covers an area of some 2,200
sq km (860 sq miles) in the south Wales
valleys (see map, p 177). It involves
increased levels of factory building, land
clearance and Urban Programme support, as
well as action to stimulate private enterprise;
improve health care and educational services;
support private housing improvements; and
strengthen tourism, the arts and voluntary
organisations.
The Cardiff Bay Development
Corporation was set up in 1987 to bring
forward redevelopment in an area of south
Cardiff, once its commercial centre. By the
end of March 1991 the Corporation had
received £92 million in government grant.
Government support for the Corporation in
1991-92 will be £32 million. The
Corporation’s regeneration strategy includes
proposals for the construction of a barrage
across Cardiff harbour mouth, which would
create a large freshwater lake and 12 km
(7 miles) of waterside frontage. It is expected
that over 30,000 new jobs will be created and
that over £1,200 million of private
investment will be attracted.
Scotland
In March 1988 the Government set out in
the White Paper New Life for Urban Scotland
179
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
its strategy for improving the quality of life
for people living on peripheral estates in
Scotland. Building on the experience gained
from inner city regeneration schemes such as
the Glasgow Eastern Area Renewal, the main
aim of the strategy was to encourage
residents to take more responsibility for the
improvement and revitalisation of their own
communities.
The focus of this effort was the
establishment of four Partnerships led by the
Scottish Office and involving other bodies
and groups, including the Scottish
Development Agency (SDA) and the
Training Agency (now both part of Scottish
Enterprise—see p 178), Scottish Homes, the
local authorities, the private sector and the
local communities. These four Partnerships
have been set up in areas of Dundee,
Edinburgh, Glasgow and Paisley. Their
objectives include plans to:
• improve the type and tenure mix of
housing available to local people;
• improve employment prospects by
providing increased avenues to training
and further education; and
• tackle social and environmental problems
on the estates.
Other peripheral estates continue to
receive substantial support through such
sources as the Urban Programme, as do
inner city areas in Scotland.
The Government and its agencies plan to
spend about £450 million in urban Scotland
in 1991-92. This includes the Urban
Programme in Scotland, which has grown
from £44 million in 1988-89 to £76 million
in 1991-92. In addition to any new projects
approved, these resources already support
about 1,200 existing projects.
Scottish Enterprise operates a Local
Enterprise Grants for Urban Project scheme,
which aims to encourage private sector
investment for projects in deprived areas.
The scheme was reviewed by the Scottish
Office Industry Department and the SDA
and a new scheme was set up to run for five
years from July 1989. The areas of need in
which the scheme operates will include the
four Partnership areas, as well as other areas
showing similar characteristics of deprivation.
Local Enterprise Companies (see p 178),
contracted to Scottish Enterprise, can
support projects in their areas up to a limit
of £250,000. Greater amounts can be spent
with the approval of Scottish Enterprise.
The Compact scheme (see p 178) has
been introduced in Scotland, with five
Compacts in operation and four under
development. Some 2,400 young people and
636 employers and training organisations are
involved with the operational Compacts.
Northern Ireland
A comprehensive development programme
aims to revitalise the commercial areas of
Belfast. In 1990-91 regeneration programmes
had a combined allocation of over £40
million. Nine Action Teams have been
established to tackle the problems of
particularly deprived areas of the city. The
‘Making Belfast Work’ initiative, launched in
1988, is designed to reinforce the efforts to
alleviate the economic, educational, social
and environmental problems in the most
disadvantaged areas of Belfast. In addition to
extensive funding already allocated to
mainstream departmental programmes,
Making Belfast Work has provided a further
£124 million for the period 1988-89 to
1993_94. The Laganside Corporation was
established in 1989 to regenerate Belfast’s
riverside area. Its government grant in
1991-92 is £7-5 million.
Housing
The pattern of housing tenure has changed
considerably in recent years, with a
substantial increase in owner-occupation and
a decline in private renting.
Between the end of 1971 and 1990, the
proportion of owner-occupied dwellings
in Great Britain rose from about
50 per cent to nearly 70 per cent.
The promotion of home ownership and more
choice in the rented sector are central to
government housing policy. New house
construction is undertaken by both public
and private sectors, but the majority of
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
dwellings are now built by the private sector
for sale to owner-occupiers. Housing
associations are becoming the main providers
of new housing in the subsidised rented
sector, while local authorities are being
encouraged to see their housing role as more
of an enabling one, working with housing
associations and the private sector to increase
the supply of low-cost housing for rent
without necessarily providing it themselves
and concentrating their resources on
improving the management of their own
stock. In order to stimulate the private
rented sector, which has declined to less than
10 per cent of the total stock, the Housing
Act 1988 deregulated rents on new private
sector lettings.
Administration
The Secretary of State for the Environment
in England and the Secretaries of State for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are
responsible for formulating housing policy
and supervising the housing programme.
Although the policies are broadly similar
throughout Britain, provisions in Northern
Ireland and Scotland differ somewhat from
those in England and Wales.
The construction or structural alteration
of housing is subject to building regulations
laid down by the Government. In addition,
most new houses are covered by warranty
arrangements provided either by the National
House-Building Council or the Housing
Standards Company Ltd. Both organisations
set standards and enforce them by
inspection, and provide cover against
major structural defects for not less than
ten years.
Home Ownership
Over the last 40 years the proportion of
people owning their own homes has risen
from 29 per cent to 68 per cent, and the
number of owner-occupied dwellings in
Great Britain amounted to almost 15 5
million at the end of 1990, compared with
some 4 million in 1950. Most public sector
tenants have the right to buy the homes they
occupy. Local authorities have been asked to
encourage low-cost home ownership in a
variety of ways, for example, by selling land
to builders to construct homes for first-time
buyers, or to individuals or groups to build
their own homes in partnership with private
builders.
Changes in mobility have put pressure on
rural housing in many areas. In 1989 the
Department of the Environment announced
that, where there was a need for low-cost
housing in rural areas, sites which would not
normally be released for housing
development could exceptionally be released,
provided arrangements were made to reserve
the housing for local needs. Similar
arrangements were introduced in Wales in
1991. Housing for Wales has a major role to
play, alongside local authorities, in rural
housing provision in Wales. In Scotland,
Scottish Homes is developing a rural housing
strategy. In Northern Ireland shared
ownership has been developed by the
Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing
Association.
Mortgage Loans
Most people buy their homes with a
mortgage loan, with the property as security.
Building societies are the largest source of
such loans, although banks and other
financial institutions also take a significant
share of the mortgage market, while some
companies also make loans for house
purchase available to their own
employees.
The amount that lenders are prepared to
advance to a would-be house purchaser is
generally calculated as a multiple of his or
her annual income, typically up to three
times earnings, and the term of the loan is
commonly 25 years. The two major forms of
mortgage are ‘repayment’ and ‘endowment’
mortgages. In the former, the borrower
repays principal and interest on the sum
outstanding. In the latter, he or she pays
only interest to the lender but also puts
money into an endowment policy, which on
maturity provides a lump sum to repay the
principal. Owner-occupiers get basic rate tax
relief on interest payments on mortgages of
up to £30,000 on their main home.
181
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Public Sector Housing
Most of the public housing in Great Britain
is provided by 460 local housing authorities.
These are:
• the district councils in England and
Wales, apart from in London;
• the London borough councils and the
Common Council of the City of London;
and
• in Scotland, the district and islands
councils.
Public housing is also provided by the
new town authorities, Scottish Homes (which
has a stock of some 66,000 houses) and the
Development Board for Rural Wales. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive is
responsible for the provision and
management of public housing in Northern
Ireland. Public housing authorities in Great
Britain own some 5-l million houses and
flats; the Northern Ireland Housing
Executive owns over 165,000 homes. A
number of local authorities have transferred
all their housing stock to housing
associations, and others are considering
doing so.
Financial Regime
Local authorities meet the capital costs of
new house construction and of modernisation
of their existing stock by raising loans on the
open market, by borrowing from the Public
Works Loan Board (an independent statutory
body set up to make loans to local
authorities) or from part of the proceeds
from the sale of local authority houses and
housing land. The Northern Ireland Housing
Executive is similarly financed.
From April 1990 a new financial regime
for council housing was introduced. Councils
must now have separate housing revenue
accounts, ‘ring-fenced’ to keep them separate
from other council funds. A Housing
Revenue Account Subsidy, worth more than
£3,500 million in 1991-92, replaced previous
government subsidies to council housing.
The aims of the new system are to:
• put councils’ housing services on a more
accountable and businesslike footing;
• encourage a more sensible pattern of
rents reflecting the value of the
accommodation being provided; and
• target government support for council
housing more effectively.
Sheltered Housing
Sheltered housing, which comprises
accommodation with an alarm system and a
resident warden, is provided for elderly
people who need support. ‘Very sheltered’
housing can be provided for the frail elderly,
giving in addition a degree of care and
enhanced communal facilities. Increasing
emphasis is being placed on schemes to help
elderly people to continue to live in their
own homes, such as home improvement
agency services and adaptations to existing
housing to meet the needs of disabled
people.
Homelessness
Under the homelessness legislation, local
authorities have a duty to secure permanent
accommodation for households which they
accept as unintentionally homeless and in
priority need. The latter category includes
pregnant women, people with dependent
children, and those who are vulnerable
because of old age, mental or physical
handicap or other special reasons. Following
a homelessness review in 1989, which
identified that the worst problems were
concentrated in London and the South East,
the Government made available an additional
£300 million in 1989-90 and 1990-91 to
move families out of bed-and-breakfast
accommodation by bringing empty public
sector dwellings back into use.
Tenants’ Rights
Legislation gives public sector tenants in
England and Wales statutory rights,
including security of tenure. The Housing
Act 1988 and the Housing (Scotland) Act
1988 (see p 183) enable public sector tenants
to change their landlord where they are not
satisfied with the service provided by their
local authority (‘Tenants’ Choice’). With a
182
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
few exceptions, secure tenants with at least
two years’ public sector standing are entitled
to buy their house or flat at a discount which
depends on the length of occupation (the
‘right to buy’). Similar provisions are made
for Scotland and Northern Ireland. By the
end of 1990, \1 million council, housing
association and new town homes had been
sold in Great Britain, and 46,000 Housing
Executive homes had been sold in Northern
Ireland. In April 1991 Scottish Homes’ Rents
to Mortgages scheme, under which tenants
can become homeowners for an initial
payment which can be financed by a
mortgage with payments similar to their rent,
was extended to local authority tenants.
Similar experimental schemes are at present
available in England only to new town
tenants of Basildon and Milton Keynes, and
in Wales to tenants of the Development
Board for Rural Wales. The Welsh scheme,
called Flexi-Ownership, was introduced in
1989.
The Government is committed to
encouraging mobility between all parts of the
subsidised housing sector. Three former
mobility bodies have been merged to form a
single organisation, HOMES, to provide a
more effective service. The aim is to enhance
mobility between the local authority and
housing association sectors, coupled with the
efficient use of the national housing stock.
Privately Rented Housing
There has been a steady decline in the
number of rented dwellings available from
private landlords, from over 50 per cent of
the housing stock in 1951 to 7 per cent in
Great Britain in 1990. Many landlords are
individuals owning a small amount of
property, but some rented housing is
provided by larger property companies.
The Government’s policy is to increase
the availability of privately rented
accommodation by removing disincentives to
letting. This is being implemented through
the Housing Act 1988 for England and
Wales and the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988,
which provide for the deregulation of new
private sector lettings.
The Housing Acts created two forms of
tenancy: the assured tenancy, which gives the
tenant long-term security in return for a
freely negotiated market rent; and the
assured shorthold tenancy (short assured
tenancy in Scotland), which is for a fixed
term, again at a free market rent. Existing
lettings were unaffected; they continue on
the old basis. The Acts strengthen the law
concerning harassment of tenants, which is a
criminal offence, and provide for improved
compensation for tenants driven out by
harassment or illegally evicted. Tenants and
most other residential occupiers may not be
evicted without a court order.
In Northern Ireland only certain pre-1956
properties subject to rent restriction come
under statutory control. Rent levels are
linked to those of the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive, and both landlords and
tenants may apply to a rent assessment
committee for rent determination in cases
where the current rent is considered to be
inappropriate. Rent increases are permitted
only for properties which meet a prescribed
standard. The only assured tenancies in
Northern Ireland are those on properties
made available under a Business Expansion
Scheme; lettings under the shorthold concept
are available.
Housing Associations
Housing associations, which are non-profit-
making, are now the main providers of
additional low-cost housing for rent and for
sale to those on low incomes and in the
greatest housing need.
The housing association sector is
expanding rapidly; associations now own
and manage over 600,000 homes and
some 50,000 hostel bed-spaces in
England alone.
Many associations specialise in providing
accommodation to meet the special needs of
the elderly, the disabled and the mentally
disordered.
People in housing need with insufficient
income to obtain a mortgage for outright
purchase may be able to participate in a
scheme in which a housing association buys
183
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the home and sells a share in it to them,
allowing them to rent the remainder and to
purchase it later if they wish. Housing
associations can also purchase older
properties to improve for sale.
In Great Britain housing schemes
carried out by associations qualify for
Housing Association Grant if the
association concerned is one of about 2,800
registered with the Housing Corporation
(in England), Scottish Homes or Housing
for Wales. These three organisations are
statutory bodies which supervise and pay
grant to housing associations in their
respective parts of Great Britain. Broadly
similar assistance is available to associations
in Northern Ireland. Scottish Homes has a
wide range of general functions and
powers, including giving financial assistance
to housing associations.
The Government plans to increase the
resources distributed to housing
associations through the Housing
Corporation from £938 million in 1989-90
to £2,005 million in 1993-94. The
Government also aims to increase the
amount of private finance being used by
housing associations, allowing more homes
to be built with the available public
resources than would otherwise be the case.
In 1991-92 Scottish Homes’ total
programme expenditure is expected to be
about £312 million, of which over £200
million will go to housing associations.
Housing for Wales is managing a
programme of £150 million in 1991—92,
providing 3,300 new homes in Wales. On
current plans, it will have provided the
housing association movement with nearly
£500 million between 1989-90 and
1993-94.
In England and Wales the rights of
housing association tenants are protected
under the Tenants’ Guarantee, which is
issued by the Housing Corporation. It
covers matters such as tenancy terms,
principles for determining rent levels and
the allocation of tenancies. Under this
guarantee, tenants receive contractual rights
in addition to their basic statutory rights,
and associations are required to set and
maintain rents at levels within the reach of
people in low-paid employment. In
Scotland, similar non-statutory guidance, in
the form of a model tenancy agreement,
has been implemented as proposed jointly
by Scottish Homes and the Scottish
Federation of Housing Associations.
Housing Benefit
Government support is being focused on
tenants rather than on property, through
the housing benefit system. Depending on
their personal circumstances, occupiers may
qualify for housing benefit to help them
pay their rent (see Chapter 6, Social
Welfare).
Improving Older Houses
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance
and redevelopment used to be major
features of housing policy, but there has
been a trend in recent years towards the
retention of existing communities,
accompanied by the modernisation and
conversion of sub-standard homes. Housing
conditions have improved considerably, but
problems remain in some areas where there
are concentrations of dwellings lacking
basic amenities or requiring substantial
repairs; and there are still some pockets of
unfit housing for which demolition is the
best solution. The emphasis now is on area
renewal, with an integrated approach to
renewal and renovation.
In Scotland, Scottish Homes has been
given a major role in tackling housing-
related urban dereliction and providing
rural housing opportunities, in co-operation
with local communities, the private sector,
local authorities and other statutory
agencies. Some groups of tenants are
joining together to form community-based
housing associations and tenant ownership
co-operatives.
Estate Action Programme
The Estate Action programme provides
local authorities in England with additional
resources to regenerate their run-down
housing estates. Government support for
184
PLANNING, URBAN REGENERATION AND HOUSING
the programme has increased considerably
over the years; by March 1991 a total of
£640 million had been made available to
local authorities. Funds are provided to
enable authorities to carry out an agreed
package of measures on an estate, including
physical refurbishment and improved
management.
In 1991-92 funds have been increased
significantly, to £270 million, to enable the
larger and more run-down estates to be
tackled. The Government is looking in
particular for schemes in which local
authorities can show:
• a strategic approach to promoting
comprehensive regeneration;
• an effective partnership with tenants
and the private sector; and
• that the investment in housing would
complement and support training,
enterprise and other urban policies.
Housing Action Trusts
The Housing Act 1988 provides for the
establishment in England and Wales of
Housing Action Trusts (HATs) to focus
resources on some of the most run-down
areas of predominantly local authority
housing. Tenants vote on whether a HAT
should be set up for their area. If the
majority of tenants who vote support the
proposal, the trust takes over responsibility
for local authority housing in designated
areas in order to renovate it, improve the
environment, provide community facilities
and stimulate local enterprise. When it has
completed its work, the trust passes the
housing on to other owners and managers,
such as housing associations or tenants’
co-operatives, or back to the local housing
authority.
In April 1991 tenants on an estate in
Hull (Humberside) were the first to vote
for the establishment of a HAT.
Home Improvement Grants
Over 11 million home improvement
grants, worth almost £3,750 million, were
paid in respect of privately owned
dwellings in England alone between 1983
and 1990. A single system of renovation
grants was introduced in England and
Wales in 1990 to help private owners and
some tenants with the costs of essential
repair and improvement work. A
mandatory grant enables dwellings to be
brought up to a new and more effective
fitness standard, with discretionary grant
available for a wider range of works.
Grants of up to 100 per cent may be
available, subject to a test of the occupants’
resources.
Grants are also available in certain
circumstances for the provision of facilities
for the disabled and for the repair of
houses in multiple occupation and of the
common parts of blocks of flats.
Minor works assistance is also available
to help people in receipt of income-related
benefits with small-scale jobs.
In Scotland, local authorities give grants
for improvement and repair. Scottish
Homes also has the power to provide
grants to complement the role of local
authorities in private house renewal.
In Northern Ireland, improvement and
repair grants are available through the
House Renovation Grants scheme,
administered by the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive.
Housing Renewal Areas
‘Housing renewal areas’ were introduced
for England and Wales in 1990, replacing
earlier powers. Renewal areas are intended
to provide a sharper focus to area action,
covering both renovation and selective
redevelopment and taking account of a
range of issues wider than just housing.
Authorities are free to declare renewal areas
without the specific consent of the
Secretaries of State for the Environment
and for Wales, provided they fulfil certain
criteria. Authorities have additional powers
to acquire land in renewal areas and to
carry out improvement works for which
additional government support is available.
In Scotland housing action area powers
are available for the improvement of areas
in which at least half the houses fail to
185
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
meet a statutory tolerable standard. Since
1975, 1,815 housing action areas have been
declared. Outside such areas in Scotland
local authorities have powers to apply
improvement orders to houses below the
statutory tolerable standard or lacking
certain basic amenities. Local authorities
may also give grants towards improving the
environment of predominantly residential
areas.
Northern Ireland has a large number of
houses which are either unfit or in serious
disrepair. Since 1977, 53 housing action
areas have been declared, involving a
continuous programme of rehabilitation
and associated environmental improvement
schemes. In addition, the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive undertakes a
programme of improvement of its own
stock.

Environmental
Protection
For more than a century Britain has been
evolving policies to protect the
environment against pollution from
industry and other sources. Laws were
introduced at an early stage to control air
and water pollution, to conserve wildlife,
landscape, historic monuments and
buildings, and to plan land use. They have
been revised regularly to meet changing
circumstances. Recently, with increasing
scientific understanding of global pollution
problems, the Government has been
considering how its own policies and
actions can be further guided by the
principle of ‘sustainable development’.
Britain supports international co¬
operation on matters of environmental
protection. Increasingly, much of Britain’s
legislation on pollution control is being
developed in co-operation with other
member states of the European
Community and organisations such as the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development and the United Nations
and its agencies. The laws protecting the
environment have been further
strengthened by the Environmental
Protection Act 1990, which provides added
safeguards for the environment.
The Department of the Environment is
responsible for countryside policy and
environmental protection in England; the
Welsh Office, the Scottish Office
Environment Department and the
Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland have broadly equivalent
responsibilities. In addition, the local
authorities and a wide range of voluntary
organisations are actively involved in
environmental conservation and protection.
This Common Inheritance
The environment White Paper This Common
Inheritance, published in September 1990,
was the first comprehensive statement by the
Government of its policy on issues affecting
the environment. It outlined action already
taken by Government, and set out a strategy
for preserving and protecting the
environment both in Britain and the rest of
the world. It summarised proposals for
tackling such diverse issues as global
warming, pollution control, the regulation of
land use and planning, the rural economy
(including action by the European
Community), the countryside and wildlife.
There was also coverage of action on
heritage, air quality and pollution, noise,
water, hazardous substances, waste and
recycling, and separate sections on specific
initiatives in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. In September 1991 a first
anniversary progress report was published,
which reviewed progress and set out
commitments to further action to protect the
environment.
Conservation
Historic Buildings, Ancient Monuments
and Conservation Areas
Lists of buildings of special architectural or
historical interest are compiled by the
Government. Some 440,000 buildings are
listed in England, some 37,000 in Scotland
and 14,000 in Wales. It is against the law to
demolish, extend or alter the character of any
‘listed’ building without special consent from
the local planning authority or the
187
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
appropriate Secretary of State. The local
planning authority can issue emergency
‘building preservation notices’ to protect
buildings not yet listed. Ancient monuments
are similarly protected through a system of
scheduling. There are approximately 13,000
scheduled ancient monuments in England,
about 5,000 in Scotland and 2,600 in Wales.
English Heritage has embarked upon a
programme to evaluate all known
archaeological remains in England. This is
expected to result in a significant increase in
the number of scheduled monuments.
Many of the royal palaces and parks are
open to the public; their maintenance is the
responsibility of the Secretaries of State for
the Environment and Scotland. English
Heritage (the Historic Buildings and
Monuments Commission for England) is
charged with protecting and conserving
England’s architectural and archaeological
heritage. It manages some 400 ancient
monuments on behalf of the Secretary of
State for the Environment, advises him on
all applications for consent to alter scheduled
monuments, and gives grants for the repair
of ancient monuments, historic buildings and
buildings in conservation areas in England.
Most of its monuments are open to the
public. In Scotland and Wales similar
functions are performed by Historic
Scotland, which cares for 330 monuments,
and by Cadw: Welsh Historic Monuments,
which manages 127, with advice from an
ancient monuments board and a historic
buildings council for each country. In April
1991, Historic Scotland and Cadw became
executive agencies within the Scottish Office
and Welsh Office respectively.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
helps towards the cost of acquiring,
maintaining or preserving land, buildings,
works of art and other items of outstanding
interest which are also of importance to the
national heritage. In 1990-91 the Fund
assisted in the preservation of 49 heritage
items.
Local planning authorities have designated
over 7,000 ‘conservation areas’ of special
architectural or historic interest in England;
there are over 350 in Wales and over 550 in
Scotland. These areas receive special
protection through the planning system.
Grants and loans are available from the
appropriate historic buildings and
monuments body for works which make a
significant contribution towards the
preservation or improvement of a
conservation area.
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland has 168 historic
monuments in its care, and over 1,000
monuments are scheduled for protection. It
is also responsible for designating
conservation areas; there are about 7,800
listed buildings and 18 conservation areas. It
may also provide grants and loans to help
with the repair and maintenance of listed
buildings and to preserve or enhance
conservation areas. It is advised by a Historic
Buildings Council and a Historic
Monuments Council.
The Voluntary Sector
The Government supports the work of the
voluntary sector in the protection of Britain’s j
heritage. The Department of the
Environment intends to make grants totalling
£494,000 to 19 such organisations in
1991_92. Among the voluntary organisations
which campaign for the preservation and
appreciation of buildings are:
• the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings;
• the Ancient Monuments Society;
• the Georgian Group;
• the Architectural Heritage Society of
Scotland;
• the Ulster Architectural Heritage
Society;
• the Victorian Society; and
• the Council for British Archaeology.
The National Trust (for Places of Historic
Interest or Natural Beauty), a charity with
over 2 million members, owns and protects
319 properties open to the public, in additior
to over 230,000 hectares (568,000 acres) of
land in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. Scotland has its own National Trust
188
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
The Civic Trust makes awards for
development and restoration work which
enhances its surroundings. It undertakes
urban regeneration projects and acts as an
‘umbrella’ organisation for nearly 1,000 local
amenity societies. There are associate trusts
in Scotland, Wales and north-east England.
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree preservation orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands in
the interests of amenity. Once a tree is
protected, it is in general an offence to fell,
damage or destroy it, and the courts can
impose substantial fines for breaches, now
increased by recent legislation. Where
protected trees are felled in contravention of
Ian order or are removed because they are
dying, dead or dangerous, a replacement tree
must be planted. The Government is
undertaking a review of tree preservation
policies and procedures, and has announced
its intention to allow local authorities in
England and Wales to safeguard key
hedgerows by making hedgerow management
orders. Tree planting is encouraged through
grants. Recent initiatives include a proposal
to create a major new forest in the Midlands
and a series of ‘community forests’ near
major towns and cities. These would be
aimed at enhancing the environment and
providing new opportunities for leisure and
recreation.
Green Belts
‘Green Belts’ are areas intended to be left
open and free from inappropriate
development where people can seek
recreation. They are intended to restrict the
sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
neighbouring towns merging, to preserve the
special character of historic towns and to
assist in urban regeneration. They have been
established around major cities, including
London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Merseyside,
Greater Manchester and the West Midlands.
Some L5 million hectares (3 8 million acres)
are designated as Green Belt in England, and
200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) in Scotland.
The Government attaches great importance
to the protection of Green Belts and expects
local planning authorities to do likewise
when considering planning applications.
The Coast
Local planning authorities along the coastline
are responsible for planning land use at the
coast; they also attempt to safeguard and
enhance the coast’s natural attractions and
preserve areas of scientific interest. The
protection of the coastline against erosion is
administered centrally by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Welsh
Office and the Scottish Office. Certain
stretches of undeveloped coast of particular
scenic beauty in England and Wales are
treated as heritage coast; jointly with local
authorities, the government countryside
bodies have defined 44 coasts, protecting
1,508 km (937 miles).
The National Trust, through its
Enterprise Neptune campaign, raises funds
to acquire stretches of coastline of great
natural beauty and recreational value. More
than £16 million has been raised so far and
the Trust now protects 840 km (522 miles)
of coastline in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The National Trust for Scotland
also owns large parts of the Scottish coastline
and protects others through conservation
agreements.
Countryside Bodies
Three bodies are responsible for conserving
and enhancing the natural beauty and
amenity of the countryside:
• the Countryside Commission (which acts
for England);
• the Countryside Council for Wales
(CCW); and
• the Countryside Commission for
Scotland (CCS).
These arrangements are in the course of
reorganisation.
They encourage the provision and
improvement of facilities for open-air
recreation. Activities include the provision by
local authorities (sometimes in association
with other bodies) and private individuals of

recognises over 210 country parks and over
230 picnic sites in England. A further 24
country parks and about 40 picnic sites in
Wales are recognised by the CCW. In
Scotland 35 country parks are recognised by
the CCS, and many local authority and
private sector schemes for a variety of
countryside facilities have been approved for
grant aid. The countryside bodies undertake
research projects and experimental schemes,
often working in consultation with local
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
authorities and groups such as the nature
conservation bodies (see below) and the
Sports Councils. They give financial
assistance to public, private and voluntary
organisations, and individuals carrying out
countryside recreation and amenity projects
and landscape conservation projects. Total
funding in 1991-92 is over £30 million for
the Countryside Commission, £14-5 million
for the CCW and £6-9 million for the CCS.
Reorganisation of Countryside and
Nature Conservation Bodies
Until April 1991, the main government body
responsible for nature conservation was the
Nature Conservancy Council (NCC). The
Countryside Commission and the CCS were
responsible for promoting access to the
countryside for recreation, the former in
England and Wales and the latter in Scotland.
New arrangements came into force in
April 1991 under the Environmental
Protection Act 1990. The NCC was split
into separate bodies for England (English
Nature), Scotland (the Nature Conservancy
Council for Scotland—NCCS) and Wales
(the Countryside Council for Wales—CCW).
The CCW also took over the Countryside
Commission’s responsibilities in Wales,
leaving the Commission responsible for
countryside policy in England only. Another
change will take effect in April 1992. The
two Scottish bodies—the CCS and the
NCCS—will merge to form a single body, to
be called Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).
(See diagram on p 190.)
Nature Conservation
The official bodies responsible for nature
conservation in Great Britain are English
Nature, the CCW and the NCCS. Their role
includes:
• establishing, maintaining and managing
nature reserves;
• advising the Government;
• providing general information and
advice;
• giving grants; and
• supporting research.
There is also a statutory Joint Nature
Conservation Committee (JNCC) comprising
representatives from the three bodies and
from Northern Ireland, together with eminent
scientists, to advise ministers and the bodies
themselves on matters of national and inter¬
national importance to nature conservation.
There are 245 national nature reserves
covering some 168,000 hectares (415,000
acres). The first statutory Marine Nature
Reserve, the island of Lundy, off the Devon
coast, was designated in 1986; a second
Marine Nature Reserve at Skomer, off the
coast of Dyfed, in Wales, was declared in
July 1990; and more are proposed. A total of
5,649 Sites of Special Scientific Interest
(SSSIs) have been notified in Great Britain
for their plants, animals or geological or
physiographical features.
Local authorities have declared about 170
Local Nature Reserves. County nature
conservation trusts and the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds play an important
part in protecting wildlife, having established
between them some 1,800 reserves. The
county trusts are affiliated to a parent
organisation, the Royal Society for Nature
Conservation.
The Royal Society for the Protection of
Birds is the largest voluntary wildlife
conservation body in Europe.
In Northern Ireland the Council for
Nature Conservation and the Countryside
advises the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland on nature conservation
matters, including the establishment and
management of land and marine nature
reserves and the declaration of areas of
special scientific interest. Some 44 national
nature reserves have been established and 26
areas of special scientific interest declared.
Wildlife in Britain is protected largely by
the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This
extended the list of protected species,
restricted the introduction into the
countryside of animals not normally found in
the wild in Britain, and afforded greater
protection for SSSIs and other important
habitats. There is also provision for reviews
of the list of protected species to be
191
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
conducted by the three official nature
conservation agencies, acting jointly through
the JNCC, every five years and submitted to
the Secretary of State for the Environment.
In Northern Ireland two Orders, which came
into force in 1985, have brought legislation
into line with the rest of Britain on species
and habitat protection.
Britain plays a full part in international
action to conserve wildlife. Conservation
measures promoted by the Government have
included a ban (in conjunction with other
European Community countries) on the
import of whale products and harp and
hooded seal pup skins, and stricter controls
for the protection of wild birds. Britain
continues to support the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding
Natural Beauty and National Scenic
Areas
The Countryside Commission and the CCW
can designate national parks and areas of
outstanding natural beauty (AONBs), subject
to confirmation by the Secretaries of State
for the Environment and for Wales
respectively, and define heritage coasts in
conjunction with local authorities. They can
also make proposals for the creation of long¬
distance footpaths and bridleways.
Ten National Parks cover 9,500 sq km
(3,670 sq miles) of England and 4,200 sq km
(1,580 sq miles) of Wales, in total some 9 per
cent of total land area. Their aim is first to
provide protection for the outstanding
countryside they contain and secondly to
provide opportunities for access and outdoor
recreation. The parks are ‘national in the
sense that they are of value to the nation as a
whole. However, most of the land remains in
private hands. Special national park
authorities have been set up, one for each
park. Among other things, they:
• act as the development control authority
for their areas;
• negotiate public access and land
management agreements and encourage
farmers to manage their land in the
traditional way;
• plant trees and look after footpaths; and
• set up information centres and employ
rangers.
In 1989, a further special authority was set
up to look after the Norfolk and Suffolk
Broads.
A total of 39 AONBs have been
designated, covering around 19,400 sq km
(7,500 sq miles) in England and 832 sq km
(321 sq miles) in Wales. They comprise parts
of the countryside which lack extensive areas
of open country suitable for recreation and
hence national park status, but have an
important landscape quality. Local
authorities are encouraged to give attention
to AONBs in their planning and countryside
conservation work.
In Scotland there are four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas, covering more
than 1 million hectares (2-5 million acres),
where certain kinds of development are
subject to consultation with the CCS, and in
the event of a disagreement, with the
Secretary of State for Scotland. In the wider
countryside, the CCS provides grants for a
range of countryside projects.
In Northern Ireland the Council for
Nature Conservation and the Countryside
advises the Department of the Environment
for Northern Ireland on the preservation of
amenities and the designation of areas of
outstanding natural beauty. Nine such areas
have been designated, covering 282,000
hectares (698,000 acres), and seven areas are
being managed as country parks and one as a
regional park.
There are 11 forest parks in Great
Britain, covering some 244,000 hectares
(603,000 acres) and administered by the
Forestry Commission. There are nine in
Northern Ireland, where they are
administered by the Forest Service of the
Department of Agriculture.
Many voluntary organisations are
concerned to preserve the amenities of the
countryside, including the Council for the
Protection of Rural England, the Campaign
for the Protection of Rural Wales, the
Association for the Protection of Rural
Scotland and the Ulster Society for the
Preservation of the Countryside.
192
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
County and metropolitan district councils in
England and Wales are responsible for
keeping public rights of way signposted and
free from obstruction. Public paths are
usually maintained by these highway
authorities, which also supervise landowners’
duties to repair stiles and gates. In Scotland,
planning authorities are responsible for
asserting and protecting rights of way. Local
authorities in Great Britain can create paths,
close paths no longer needed for public use
and divert paths to meet the needs of either
the public or landowners. Recent legislation
requires farmers in England and Wales
rapidly to restore footpaths damaged by
agricultural operations. In England and
Wales there are some 225,000 km (140,000
miles) of rights of way. There are 15
approved national trails in England and
Wales, covering over 3,000 km (1,870 miles),
and three approved long-distance routes
in Scotland, covering some 580 km (360
miles).
There is no automatic right of public
access to open country, although many
landowners allow it more or less freely. Local
planning authorities can secure access by
means of agreements with landowners. If
agreements cannot be reached, authorities
may acquire land or make orders for public
access. Similar powers cover Scotland and
Northern Ireland; in Northern Ireland the
primary responsibility lies with district
councils. In Scotland there is a long-standing
tradition of freedom to roam, based on
tolerance between landowners and those
seeking reasonable recreational access to the
hills.
Common land, much of which is open to
the public, totals an estimated 600,000
hectares (L5 million acres) in England and
Wales (there is no common land in Scotland
or Northern Ireland). This land is usually
privately owned, but people other than the
owner may have various rights over it, for
example, as pasture land. Commons are
protected by law and cannot be built on or
enclosed without the consent of the
Secretaries of State for the Environment
or Wales.
Environmental Improvement Schemes
The Government assists local voluntary
organisations to promote projects such as
creating parks, footpaths and other areas of
greenery in cities; conserving the industrial
heritage and the natural environment;
and recycling waste. The Department of the
Environment makes grants through the
Urban Programme (see p 174) and the
Special Grants Programme to support
projects with either direct or indirect
environmental gains. Spending from the
former on such projects was estimated at
over £49 million in 1990-91; grants from the
latter totalled £3-7 million. Welsh Office
equivalents were £21 million and £87,000.
The Government’s programme of
Environmentally Sensitive Areas is a
voluntary scheme, under which farmers are
offered payments for agreeing to farm along
environmentally beneficial lines. The
Scottish Office Environment Department is
making £275,000 available in 1991-92 to
environmental organisations under its Special
Grants (Environmental) Programme. A
further £291,000 is being made available to
UK 2000 Scotland, a partnership between
central and local government, voluntary
bodies and the private sector, which carries
out practical environmental improvements.
The Groundwork Foundation, a partnership
of public bodies, the private sector,
voluntary organisations and individuals, aims
to tackle environmental problems arising
from dereliction and vandalism and to
increase public awareness of the
opportunities to change and improve local
environments.
World Heritage Sites
Britain is fully represented in the World
Heritage List, which was established under
the World Heritage Convention to identify
and secure lasting protection for those parts
of the world heritage of outstanding
universal value. So far 13 sites in Britain
have been listed:
• Canterbury Cathedral, with St
Augustine’s Abbey and St Martin’s
Church, in Kent;
193
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• Durham Cathedral and Castle;
• Studley Royal Gardens and Fountains
Abbey, in North Yorkshire;
• Ironbridge Gorge, with the world s first
iron bridge and other early industrial
sites, in Shropshire;
• the prehistoric stone circles at
Stonehenge and Avebury, in Wiltshire;
• Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire;
• the city of Bath, in Avon;
• Hadrian’s Wall;
• the Tower of London;
• the Palace of Westminster, Westminster
Abbey and St Margaret’s, Westminster,
also in London;
• the islands of St Kilda, in Scotland;
• the castles and town walls of King
Edward I, in north Wales; and
• the Giant’s Causeway and Causeway
Coast, in Northern Ireland.
Government support for these sites can be
considerable. For example, in February 1991
a £4 million endowment for the Ironbridge
Heritage Foundation was announced to
ensure the future of these remains from the
earliest days of the Industrial Revolution.
Control of Pollution
The Environmental Protection Act 1990,
which applies to Great Britain, has
strengthened the existing system of
protection against pollution. British law sets
out a wide range of powers and duties for
central and local government, including
controls over waste, air pollution, litter,
noise, and emissions to water.
Administration
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies.
Central government makes policy,
exercises general budgetary control, promotes
legislation and advises pollution control
authorities on policy implementation. The
Secretary of State for the Environment has
general responsibility for co-ordinating the
work of the Government on environmental
protection. In Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland the respective Secretaries of State are
responsible for pollution control co¬
ordination within their countries.
Local authorities also have important
duties and powers. They are responsible for
matters such as:
• collection and disposal of domestic
wastes;
• keeping the streets clean from litter;
• control of air pollution from domestic
and from many industrial premises;
and
• noise abatement measures.
The National Rivers Authority (NRA) is
responsible for the control of water pollution
in England and Wales; in Scotland, the river
purification authorities have statutory
responsibility for water pollution control. In
England and Wales Her Majesty’s
Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP) has an
important role in the control of emissions to
land, air and water from certain industrial
processes through the new mechanism of
‘integrated pollution control’ (see p 195).
The Government has announced its
intention to merge HMIP and the NRA into
a single environmental agency.
An independent standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution
advises the Government on national and
international matters concerning the
pollution of the environment, on the
adequacy of research and on the future
possibilities of danger to the environment. So
far it has produced 15 reports.
Pollution Inspectorates
Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Pollution was
formed in 1987 by the amalgamation of
several existing inspectorates. It acts
for England and Wales. Under the
Environmental Protection Act, a system of
‘integrated pollution control’ (IPC) is being
phased in to control certain categories of
industrial pollution. The most harmful
processes are specified for IPC, and require
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
consent from HMIP. Less harmful air
pollution is controlled under a system of
local authority air pollution control. In
granting a consent for discharges under IPC,
the Inspectorate requires the use of the best
available techniques not entailing excessive
cost to prevent or minimise polluting
emissions and to ensure that all substances
released are made harmless.
Her Majesty’s Industrial Pollution
Inspectorate is the Scottish equivalent of
HMIP, and administers IPC jointly with the
river purification authorities. In Northern
Ireland broadly similar controls are exercised
by the Environmental Protection Division of
the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland, and the implications of
introducing a system of IPC are being
considered.
The Land
Under the Control of Pollution Act 1974,
certain local authorities are designated as
waste disposal authorities. They are
responsible for regulating the disposal of
controlled wastes. The Act requires them to
draw up and revise periodically a waste
disposal plan. It also establishes a licensing
system for waste disposal sites, treatment
plants and storage facilities receiving
controlled wastes. It provides for a more
intensive control system for certain especially
difficult wastes. HMIP and the Hazardous
Waste Inspectorate for Scotland advise local
authorities on how to improve their control
of waste management and on how to work
towards environmentally acceptable standards
for dealing with hazardous wastes.
Part II of the Environmental Protection
Act, when implemented, will strengthen
existing curbs on waste disposal.
Responsibility for proper handling of waste
will be imposed on everyone who has control
of it from production to final disposal or
reclamation. Authorities may refuse licences
if the applicant is not a fit and proper
person. Operators will be responsible for
their sites until all risks of gas or pollution
are eliminated. In England and Wales local
authorities’ waste disposal operations are to
be transferred to ‘arm’s length’ companies or
private contractors so as to separate them
from the authorities’ other jobs of setting
policies and standards, and enforcement.
Waste regulation authorities will become
both more locally accountable and more
closely supervised by HMIP. In Scotland,
the responsibility for collection, disposal and
regulation remains with the district and
islands councils, whose waste management
function is examined by the Hazardous
Waste Inspectorate. The Government has
also taken powers to control international
shipments of waste.
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in
any public place in the open air or to dump
rubbish except in designated places. The
maximum penalty for this, previously set at
£400, was increased under the
Environmental Protection Act to £1,000.
The Act also introduced new powers for the
issue of litter abatement orders and new
duties on local authorities to keep their
public land as free of litter and refuse
(including dog faeces) as practicable.
To help counteract the problem of litter,
financial support is given to the Tidy Britain
Group (£2-75 million in 1991-92), which
provides a comprehensive litter abatement
programme in collaboration with local
authorities. The Group secures sponsorship
from industry to undertake litter abatement
promotions and programmes such as its
Neighbourhood Litter Watch scheme.
Recycling and Materials Reclamation
The Government encourages the reclamation
and recycling of waste materials wherever
this is practicable; its target is for half of all
recyclable household waste to be reused by
2000. There are over 5,000 ‘bottle banks’ in
Britain, where the public can deposit used
glass containers for recycling. There are also
similar ‘can banks’ and ‘paper banks’ and, in
some cases, plastics or textiles banks to
collect these materials for recycling. In
addition, voluntary organisations arrange
collections of waste material. Under the
Environmental Protection Act 1990, local
authorities have a duty to make plans for the
recycling of waste. The Government is
supporting pilot ‘Recycling City’ initiatives
195
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in places such as Sheffield, Cardiff and
Dundee, which will include kerbside
collections of recyclable waste.
Water
In general, it is against the law to allow any
polluting matter to enter water in Britain
except in accordance with a legal authorisation.
In England and Wales the NRA is responsible
for protecting water quality. Its principal
method of controlling water pollution is
through the regulation of all effluent
discharges into rivers and other inland waters,
except those controlled by HMIP through
IPC. Discharge consents issued by the NRA
specify what may be discharged and set limits
on the volume and content of effluent, in
order to achieve appropriate water quality
standards. The NRA maintains public
registers containing information about
discharge consents and water quality. Similar
arrangements apply in Scotland, where control
is exercised by river purification authorities.
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for controlling
water pollution in Northern Ireland.
Over the past 30 years, notable progress
has been made in cleaning up the
previously heavily polluted major
estuaries of the east coast of England
and Scotland—the Thames, Humber,
Tees, Tyne and Forth—which now
support varied populations of fish and
other wildlife.
A 25-year scheme supported by the
Government and the European Community
aims to reduce river pollution and improve
water quality throughout the Mersey river
basin and estuary. Other major schemes in
progress include programmes to improve
water quality in the Clyde in Scotland and
the Lagan in Northern Ireland.
More than 95 per cent of the population
in Britain lives in properties connected to a
sewer, and sewage treatment works serve
over 80 per cent of the population. In
England and Wales the water industry is
planning to spend some £14,000 million at
1989 prices up to the year 2000 on
improving sewage treatment and disposal.
Progressively higher treatment standards for
industrial waste effluents and new measures
to combat pollution from agriculture are
expected to bring further improvements in
water quality. In Scotland, sewage treatment
and disposal come within the water and
sewerage programme, which will total more
than £600 million in the three years to
1993-94.
The Government is committed to meeting
the requirements of a number of European
Community directives for the protection and
improvement of water quality, for example, on
the quality of surface water for abstraction
for drinking water supply, the quality needed
to support freshwater fisheries, the quality of
water for bathing areas (see p 197) and the
treatment of urban waste water.
Marine Environment
Britain is a leading participant in the series
of North Sea Conferences. This international
forum of the countries bordering the North
Sea provides the prime focus for the
development of Britain’s policies on the
marine environment. The Third North Sea
Conference met in 1990 in The Hague, and
the measures agreed are being applied by
Britain to all its coastal waters, not just the
North Sea.
Progress is being made in reducing the
amount of toxic substances released into the
sea. The Government’s target is a reduction
of the order of 50 per cent by 1995, and of
70 per cent in the most dangerous substances
such as cadmium, mercury, dioxins and lead.
Substantial reductions have already been
achieved. For example, the discharge of
mercury into Britain’s coastal waters fell by
26 per cent between 1985 and 1988, and the
discharge of cadmium fell by 18 per cent.
Prevention of marine pollution from ships
is based largely on international conventions
drawn up under the auspices of the
International Maritime Organization, a
United Nations agency with headquarters in
London, and implemented for British ships
by domestic legislation. British legislation
requires ships to be fitted with specific
pollution control equipment. It makes it an
196
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
offence for ships of any nationality to
discharge oil, oily mixtures or ships’ garbage
into British territorial waters. It is also an
offence for British-registered ships to make
similar discharges anywhere into the sea,
except in accordance with the regulations.
Enforcement of these regulations is
undertaken by the Department of Transport.
Offshore oil operators must ensure that oil
does not escape into the sea and are required
to have contingency plans for dealing with
oil spilled accidentally. Discharges containing
oil are controlled under the Prevention of Oil
Pollution Act 1971. It was agreed at the
Third North Sea Conference to eliminate
progressively discharges of oil-based drilling
cuttings from offshore platforms.
The Department of Transport’s Marine
Pollution Control Unit is responsible for
dealing with pollution at sea when oil or
other dangerous substances from a shipping
casualty threaten major coastal pollution.
The Unit maintains a national contingency
plan and dispersant spraying, cargo transfer,
mechanical recovery and beach-cleaning
resources. It also has two remote sensing
aircraft capable of detecting possible illegal
discharges and of quantifying oil pollution.
A licence has to be obtained for the
permanent deposit of any substance or article
into the sea and tidal waters below the high
water mark. Dumping at sea is presently
permitted where no harm to the marine
environment can be shown and where there
are no practicable alternatives on land.
Nevertheless, a timetable for ending the
dumping of industrial waste at sea was
announced by the Government in 1990. The
Government’s intention is that no industrial
waste should be dumped at sea beyond 1993.
Britain has already stopped the dumping at
sea of more than half the industrial wastes
which were licensed in 1987. Powers to
control dumping at sea are further
strengthened by the Environmental
Protection Act 1990. Waste is no longer
being licensed for incineration at sea.
Bathing Waters
The Government has announced investment
of around £2,160 million to provide
increased sewage treatment, while a £1,400
million programme is intended to improve
the quality of Britain’s bathing waters. The
Government has announced that sea
dumping of sewage sludge will be
terminated completely by the end of 1998.
In the 1990 tests of bathing water
quality, it was found that 78 per cent of
identified bathing waters (318 out of 407)
in England and Wales met the mandatory
coliform bacteria standards of the European
Community Bathing Water directive. This
compared with 76 per cent of the then
identified beaches in 1989 and 66 per cent
in 1988. In Scotland, 12 out of 23 bathing
waters met the coliform standard in 1990.
In Northern Ireland 15 out of the 16
identified bathing waters met the directive.
The Government expects all but a handful
of bathing waters to meet the directive’s
standards by the mid-1990s and to achieve
full compliance soon thereafter.
Air Pollution
Responsibility for clean air rests primarily
with local authorities. Under the Clean Air
Acts 1956 and 1968 they may declare
‘smoke control areas’ within which the
emission of smoke from chimneys is an
offence. About two-thirds of the premises
in conurbations are covered by smoke
control orders—over 6,000 are in force.
Emissions from most industrial processes
are also subject to control by local
authorities. Those processes with the
greatest potential for harmful emissions are,
however, controlled by HMIP. Under the
Environmental Protection Act 1990, these
are becoming subject to IPC. Processes
with a significant but lesser potential for air
pollution require approval from local
authorities under the 1990 Act. Under the
Clean Air Acts, emissions of dark smoke
from any trade or industrial premises or
from the chimney of any building are also
prohibited, and new furnaces must be
capable as far as is practicable of smokeless
operation. The 1990 Act gave local
authorities streamlined powers to deal with
statutory nuisances, including smoke, dust
and smells.
197
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Considerable progress has been made
towards the achievement of cleaner air
and a better environment in the last 30
years or so.
Total emissions of smoke in the air
have fallen by over 85 per cent since
1960.
The domestic smoke control programme
has been particularly important in
achieving this result. London no longer has
the dense smoke-laden ‘smogs’ of the 1950s
and in central London winter sunshine has
increased by about 70 per cent since 1958.
Similar improvement has been achieved in
other cities.
Air pollution data from the Department
of the Environment’s monitoring network
are released to the national press and
television each day as Air Quality Bulletins.
These give the concentrations of three
main pollutants—ozone, nitrogen dioxide
and sulphur dioxide—and grade air quality
on a scale between ‘very poor’ and ‘very
good’. The data are also available to
members of the public on a special
telephone number.
Climate Change
The greenhouse effect is a natural
phenomenon which keeps the earth at a
temperature which can sustain life. But
increasing man-made emissions of
‘greenhouse gases’ such as carbon dioxide,
methane, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
nitrous oxide are leading to greater
concentrations of these gases in the
atmosphere. In response to the concern
about the effect this would have, the
United Nations Environment Programme
(UNEP) and the World Meteorological
Organisation established the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) to study the issues. Britain
chaired the working group which carried
out an assessment of the available scientific
evidence on climate change and published
its report in August 1990. It concluded that
man-made emissions of greenhouse gases
would lead in general to additional
warming of the earth, and could cause
serious changes in the world’s climate. In
response, the international community agreed
to draw up a convention to tackle the threat.
Britain is contributing £750,000 to the
continuing work of the IPCC, and is playing
an active part in the Intergovernmental
Negotiating Committee established by the
United Nations to draw up a convention on
climate change. The aim is to have a
framework convention ready for signature
during the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development in Brazil in
1992. This would provide the basis for
international action to control greenhouse
gases.
Britain is making a major research effort
into global warming. The Hadley Centre for
Climate Prediction and Research was opened
in 1990 to build on the climate modelling
programme of the Meteorological Office, at a
cost of about £6 million a year to the
Department of the Environment. The
research councils (see p 202) allocated over
£84 million in 1990-91 towards research into
all aspects of global climate change. The
value of the Government’s total expenditure
on research related to climate change will be
about £150 million in 1991-92.
British measures to combat the problem
include:
• a government pledge to achieve a 15 per
cent improvement in the energy
efficiency of its buildings over the next
five years;
• a major three-year publicity campaign
from November 1991, on the greenhouse
effect and energy use in the home;
• tighter building regulations to promote
the energy efficiency of new houses;
and
• the non-fossil fuel obligation in the
Electricity Act 1989, which requires that
a proportion of Britain’s electricity be
generated in ways that will not produce
greenhouse gases.
The environment White Paper reaffirmed
Britain’s willingness to return carbon dioxide
emissions to 1990 levels by 2005, provided
other countries take similar action.
198
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Chlorofluorocarbons and the Ozone
Layer
The Government is committed to the earliest
possible phasing-out of all ozone-depleting
substances, including CFCs—artificial gases
used in the manufacture of foams, as
solvents, in refrigeration and as aerosol
propellants. Britain is closely involved in
international action to protect the ozone
layer. In 1990 Britain hosted the second
meeting of the parties to the Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer. This meeting agreed to:
• phase out CFCs by the year 2000, with a
50 per cent reduction by 1995 and an 85
per cent reduction by 1997;
• phase out other ozone-depleting
substances, including halons, carbon
tetrachloride and methyl chloroform; and
• hold another meeting in 1992, with the
objective of accelerating the phase-out
schedules wherever possible.
The European Community has agreed to
phase out CFCs by the end of 1997, with
exemptions for any remaining essential uses
until the end of 1999. The Government also
announced in 1990 that Britain would
contribute at least $9 million to help
developing countries tackle the problem of
ozone depletion. This will be increased to
$15 million if other countries such as India
and the People’s Republic of China join the
Protocol.
Emissions of Sulphur Dioxide and Oxides of
Nitrogen and Acid Rain
National sulphur dioxide emissions have
fallen by about 40 per cent since 1970.
Under the European Community directive
on the control of emissions from large
combustion plants, the Government has
announced a phased programme of
reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide
and oxides of nitrogen from existing large
combustion plants.
Britain is now implementing these
reductions, which are greater than those
stipulated in the directive.
The damaging effect of acid depositions
Table 9.1: Target Percentage Reductions
from 1980 Baselines
By 1993 1998 2003
Sulphur dioxide 21 45 63

from combustion processes on rivers, lakes
and soils has been shown by scientific
research. Britain is spending about £10
million a year on an extensive research
programme into the causes and effects of
acid rain, and the likely results of possible
abatement technologies. Following lower
emissions of sulphur dioxide over the past 20
years, the first signs of a decrease in
acidification in some lochs in south-west
Scotland have been found.
Vehicle Emissions
There are around 24 million vehicles on
Britain’s roads, contributing substantially to
Britain’s total emissions of carbon dioxide,
carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and oxides
of nitrogen. Since 1970 a series of
increasingly stringent regulations on cars and
light vans has been implemented by the
Government to bring carbon monoxide
emissions from each new car down by 50 per
cent and hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide
emissions by over 30 per cent. The European
Community has agreed strict new standards
for these vehicles, which will reduce all
emissions from new cars by a further 75 per
cent and in effect require virtually all new
petrol-engined cars to be fitted with fully-
controlled catalytic converters. The
Community is committed to looking into
possible controls on carbon dioxide emissions
from cars. Britain has also pressed the
Community to introduce very strict emission
standards for heavy goods vehicles by the
mid-1990s and a common position was
agreed in March 1991. The Government
intends to introduce checks on exhaust
emissions into the annual test of vehicle
roadworthiness, which will measure
carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from
November 1991.
199
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The amount of lead in the air in Britain
has halved since the permitted lead content
in petrol was reduced in 1986 from 0 4 to
015 grammes a litre. Britain had previously
taken a leading role in negotiating a
European Community directive which
required unleaded petrol to be available
throughout the Community by October 1989.
Almost all petrol stations in Britain now sell
unleaded petrol, and new cars must be able
to run on it. A substantial tax differential has
been created in favour of unleaded fuel, and
demand for it has risen rapidly. By May
1991 unleaded petrol accounted for 41 per
cent of petrol sales in Britain.
Internationally developed standards have
also been introduced to control the emission
from civil aircraft of smoke, vented fuel and
unburned hydrocarbons. Current indications
are that aircraft contribute only a small
amount to overall pollution, although the
Government is funding further research and
taking a leading role in European studies on
this issue.
Noise
Local authorities have a duty to inspect their
areas for noise nuisance and to investigate
complaints about it. They can serve a noise
abatement notice on a person responsible for
noise nuisance. They can also designate ‘noise
abatement zones’ within which registered
levels of noise from certain premises may not
be increased without their permission. There
are also specific provisions in law to:
• control noise from construction and
demolition sites;
• control the use of loudspeakers in the
streets; and
• enable individuals to take action through
the courts against noise amounting to a
nuisance.
Tougher measures against noise were
proposed in the White Paper. These reflect
much of the thinking of an independent
working party set up by the Government to
review noise control. Government spending
on environmental noise research is expected
to be about £750,000 in 1991-92.
Transport is a major source of noise, and
control measures are aimed at reducing it at
source, through requirements limiting the
noise that aircraft and motor vehicles may
make, and at protecting people from its
effects. Regulations set out the permissible
noise levels for various classes of new
vehicle. Government research also looks at
ways of reducing noise, and has
demonstrated the feasibility of tougher noise
limits for heavy goods vehicles.
Compensation is payable for loss in
property values caused by physical factors,
including noise from new or improved public
works such as roads and airports. Regulations
also enable highway authorities to carry out
or make grants for insulation of homes that
would be subject to specified levels of
increased noise caused by new or improved
roads. Noise insulation may be provided
where construction work for new roads may
seriously affect nearby homes.
Britain has played a leading role in
negotiations aimed at the gradual phasing-out
of older, noisier subsonic jet aircraft. Flying
non-noise certificated aircraft has been
banned in Britain, and since 1990 British
operators have no longer been allowed to add
to their fleets further ‘Chapter 2’ aircraft
(noisier planes, as classified by international
agreement). A complete ban on the operation
of Chapter 2 aircraft will begin to be
implemented in April 1995, and it is
intended to phase out all these types by
April 2002. Various operational restrictions
have been introduced to reduce noise
disturbance further at Heathrow, Gatwick
and Stansted, where the Secretary of State
for Transport has assumed responsibility for
noise abatement. These measures include:
• restrictions on the type and number of
aircraft operating at night;
• the routeing of departing aircraft on
noise preferential routes; and
• quiet take-off and landing procedures.
The population affected by aircraft noise at
Heathrow fell from nearly L5 million in
1978 to less than 550,000 in 1988, even
though the number of air transport
movements increased by about a quarter.
This was largely because of the phasing out
of older, noisier aircraft.
200
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents only a small
fraction of that to which the population is
exposed; most is naturally occurring.
Nevertheless, that fraction is subject to
stringent control. Users of radioactive
materials must be registered by HMIP in
England and Wales, and equivalents in
Scotland and Northern Ireland, and
authorisation is also required for the
accumulation and disposal of radioactive
waste. The Health and Safety Executive,
through its Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate, is the authority responsible for
the granting of nuclear site licences for major
nuclear installations. No installation may be
constructed or operated without a licence
granted by the Executive.
The National Radiological Protection
Board (NRPB) provides an authoritative
point of reference on radiological
protection. Following the accident at the
Chernobyl nuclear power station in the
Soviet Union in 1986, the Government has
set up a national radiation monitoring
network and overseas nuclear accident
response system (RIMNET). An interim
version has been operating since 1988. This
will be replaced during 1992 by a larger
system with more than 90 monitoring
stations across Britain. In 1987 the
Government announced measures to deal
with the problem of naturally occurring
radon gas in houses, including a free survey
by the NRPB for householders living in
radon-affected areas. In 1990 the
Government halved the level at which it is
recommended that householders take action
to reduce radon in their homes. The NRPB
has designated Cornwall and Devon as a
‘Radon Affected Area’ (an area where more
than 1 per cent of the houses exceed the
action level).
Radioactive Waste Disposal
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature and
level of activity, and the methods of disposal
reflect this. Some wastes can be disposed of
safely in the same way as other industrial
and household wastes. UK Nirex Ltd is
responsible for developing a deep disposal
facility for solid low-level and intermediate-
level radioactive waste, and has been
investigating sites. In July 1991 it
announced that these investigations were
being concentrated on Sellafield (Cumbria).
The Department of the Environment is
sponsoring research, in collaboration with
other countries, into disposal of high-level
or heat-generating waste. This waste will
first be stored in vitrified form for at least
50 years to allow the heat and radioactivity
to decay. The vitrification plant at
Sellafield was opened in February 1991.
The Department of the Environment’s
1991-92 budget for research into
environmental radioactivity and radioactive
waste is £10 million.
Genetically Modified Organisms
The Environmental Protection Act 1990
introduced stronger controls over
genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
Anyone who intends to import, acquire,
keep, release or market GMOs first has to
carry out an environmental risk assessment
and in some cases, first notify the
Government or obtain its consent. The
Government has powers to prevent the
import, acquisition, keeping or release of
GMOs where this would involve a
significant risk of damage to the
environment, and inspectors have the
power to destroy or render harmless
organisms which are likely to cause damage
to the environment. A unified system of
administrative control for GMOs is being
developed in parallel with these provisions,
involving the Department of the
Environment, the Health and Safety
Executive and other interested
departments.
Environmental Research
Research into environmental protection is
generally co-ordinated by the Department
of the Environment. It has been estimated
that total government spending on
environmental research and development in
1989-90 was about £200 million, excluding
201
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
work in areas such as renewable energy.
Government spending on research into
marine protection was about £50 million,
with a large additional effort by industry.
The Department of the Environment
expects to spend about £S2 million in
1991-92 on research into subjects
including:
• climate change;
• atmospheric pollution and its
monitoring;
• toxic chemicals and GMOs;
• waste disposal; and
• water quality and health.
Other departments have substantial
programmes, notably the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the
Department of Energy, the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department and
other official bodies such as the NRA and
the Meteorological Office.
One of the initiatives launched under
the White Paper was the Environmental
Technology Innovation Scheme, which
combines existing schemes to promote
innovation and competitiveness in the
environmental technology industry.
RESEARCH COUNCILS
Basic and strategic research is carried out by
five government-funded research councils:
agriculture and food; economic and social
sciences; natural environment; medical; and
science and engineering. All have a role in
environmental protection research.
Particularly important is the Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC),
which has a science budget allocation of
£123 million in 1991-92, plus expected
receipts of about £43 million from
commissioned research and other income.
The NERC, established in 1965, undertakes
and supports research in the environmental
sciences and funds postgraduate training. Its
programmes encompass the marine, earth,
terrestrial, freshwater, polar and atmospheric
sciences. The NERC stresses international
collaborative work on global environmental
issues. For example, it is helping to develop
global atmospheric climate models and
strengthening atmospheric research in the
Arctic. A major new research programme,
the Terrestrial Initiative in Global
Environmental Research, has been started, so
that the impact of climate change on Britain
and elsewhere can be foreseen.

*
10 Religion
Everyone in Britain has the right to religious
freedom—in teaching, worship and
observance—without interference from the
community or the State. Religious
organisations and groups may own property,
run schools, and promote their beliefs in
speech and writing. There is no religious bar
to the holding of public office.
Religious Tolerance
Britain has a long tradition of religious
tolerance, and the past 30 years have seen
the acceptance of a wide variety of religious
beliefs and traditions brought in by large
numbers of immigrants of different
nationalities. There are now large and
growing communities of Muslims, Hindus
and Sikhs, and arrangements are made at
places of work to allow the members of non-
Christian religions to follow their religious
observances.
Freedom of conscience in religious
matters in Britain was achieved gradually
from the seventeenth century onwards. The
laws discriminating against minority religious
groups were gradually administered less
harshly and then finally repealed. Heresy
ceased to be a legal offence with the passing
of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677,
and the Toleration Act 1688 granted freedom
of worship to Protestant minority groups. In
1828 the repeal of the Test and Corporation
Acts gave nonconformists full political rights,
making it possible for them to be appointed
to public office. Roman Catholics gained
political rights under the Roman Catholic
Relief Act 1829, and the Jewish Relief Act
1858 enabled Jews to become Members of
Parliament. In addition, the religious tests
imposed on prospective students and
academic staff of the universities of Oxford,
Cambridge and Durham were successively
abolished by Acts of 1854, 1856 and 1871.
Similar restrictions on the staff of Scottish
universities were formally removed in 1932.
Relations with the State
There are two established churches in
Britain, that is, churches legally recognised
as official churches of the State: in England
the (Anglican) Church of England, and in
Scotland the (Presbyterian) Church of
Scotland. Ministers of the established
churches, as well as clergy belonging to other
religious groups, work in services run by the
State, such as the armed forces, national
hospitals and prisons, and are paid a salary
for such services by the State. Voluntary
schools provided by religious denominations
may be wholly or partly maintained from
public funds.
The State makes no direct contribution to
church expenses, although since 1977 limited
state aid has been given for the repair of
historic churches. In 1990 the Government
announced that £11-5 million would be made
available to assist with the cost of repairs to
cathedrals and comparable buildings over the
following three years. Such funding is not
restricted to Church of England buildings.
The Government also contributes towards
the Redundant Churches Fund, a body
which maintains some 270 redundant Church
of England churches for which no alternative
use can be found but which are of
architectural or historic importance. The
contribution for the period from 1989 to
1994 will be about ^8 7 million.
Involvement in Social Issues
Religious involvement in broader social
issues was highlighted in the Church of
England report Faith in the City: A Call for
203
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Action by Church and Nation, published in
1985. This made recommendations for
improving conditions in the inner cities and
other socially deprived areas, and led to the
establishment in 1988 of the Church of
England’s Church Urban Fund, which aims
to raise money for the Church’s work in
inner city and other priority areas. By July
1991 it had raised over £17 million and
given grants to over 400 inner city projects.
Two further reports, Living Faith in the City
and Faith in the Countryside, were published
in 1990.
Statistics on Religious Affiliation
There is no standard information about the
number of members of religious groups since
questions are not normally asked about
religious beliefs in censuses or for other
official purposes, except in Northern Ireland.
Each group adopts its own way of counting
its members, and membership figures are
therefore approximate.
There has been a fall in recent years in
both the number of full-time ministers and
the number of adults recorded as members
of most of the larger Christian churches. At
the same time there has been significant
growth in a range of independent and
Pentecostal churches, and in new religious
movements. However, the churches today
share a desire to work together and the
ecumenical movement is well supported.
Education
Religious education in publicly maintained
schools is required by law throughout
Britain. Under the Education Reform Act
1988 it forms part of the basic curriculum
for all pupils in England and Wales. The Act
requires due recognition to be given to the
place of Christianity in teaching at county
schools, but the subject also covers other
faiths. Schools also have to provide a daily
act of collective worship. In county schools
collective worship must be largely Christian
in character, although non-Christian worship
may be allowed in certain circumstances.
Parents may withdraw their children from
religious education and collective worship if
they wish. The Education (Scotland) Act
1980 imposes slightly different requirements
in Scotland.
Broadcasting
The Broadcasting Act 1990 allows Christian
and other religious groups to compete for
licences to have their own local radio
stations. They can also seek licences for some
cable and satellite television channels. The
Act also requires those running television
stations on the new Channel 3 service (which
is to replace the Independent Television
network) to show religious programmes at
peak times.
The Church of England
The Church of England, founded by St
Augustine in AD 597, became the established
church of the land in the Reformation in the
sixteenth century. Its form of worship was set
out in the Book of Common Praver, dating
from 1549. The Church of England's
relationship with the State is one of mutual
obligation—the Church s privileges are
balanced by certain duties it must fulfil. The
Sovereign must always be a member of the
Church, and promise to uphold it. Church of
England archbishops, bishops and deans are
appointed bv the Sovereign on the advice of
the Prime Minister, and all clergy swear their
allegiance to the Crown. The Church can
regulate its own worship. The two
archbishops (of Canterbury and ^ ork), the
bishops of London, Durham and YV inchester,
and 21 other senior bishops sit in the House
of Lords. Clergy of the Church, together with
those of the Church of Scodand, the Church
of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church,
may not sit in the House of Commons.
The Archbishop of Canterbury is
‘Primate of All England’, and the
Archbishop of York ‘Primate of
England’.   
The Church has two provinces:
Canterbury, comprising 30 dioceses,
including the Diocese of Europe; and \ ork,
which has 14 dioceses.
204
.
RELIGION
The dioceses are divided into 13,150
parishes. In 1988 it was estimated that, in
the two provinces (excluding the Diocese of
Europe), some 233,000 people were baptised
into the Church; of these, 189,200 were
under one year old, representing 29 per cent
of live births. In the same year there were
63,895 confirmations. Attendances at services
on a normal Sunday are around T2 million.
Many people who rarely, if ever, attend
services still regard themselves as belonging
to the Church of England.
The central governing body is the
General Synod, to which belong bishops,
clergy and lay members who are involved in
decision-making. Lay people are also
concerned with church government in the
parishes. The Synod is the centre of an
administrative system dealing with such
matters as missionary work, inter-church
relations, social questions, and recruitment
and training for the ministry. It also covers
other church work in Britain and overseas,
the care of church buildings, church schools
(which are maintained from public funds),
colleges of education, and centres for training
women in pastoral work. At present, only
men may join the priesthood, but in 1987
the General Synod voted to proceed with
legislation to enable women to become
priests; final decisions on the matter,
however, are not expected to be taken for
some years. The Deacons (Ordination of
Women) Measure 1986 has made it possible
for women to become deacons.
Church finance is administered locally,
with contributions to a central fund running
central services. The Church’s investment
income is managed mainly by the Church
Commissioners.
The Anglican Communion
The Anglican Communion comprises 28
autonomous provinces in Britain and abroad,
and three regional councils overseas with a
total membership of about 70 million. In the
British Isles there are four provinces: the
Church of England (established), the Church
in W ales, the Scottish Episcopal Church in
Scotland, and the Church of Ireland.
Every ten years the Lambeth Conference
meets for consultation between all Anglican
bishops. The last Conference was held in
Canterbury in 1988. Presided over by the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Conference
has no executive authority , but enjoys
considerable influence. The Anglican
Consultative Council, an assembly of lay
people and clergy as w ell as of bishops,
meets every two or three years and is
intended to allow7 consultations within the
Anglican Communion. The Council last met
in Wales in 1990.
The Church of Scotland
The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian
form of government, that is, government by
ministers and elders, all of w hom are
ordained to office. It became the national
church following the Scottish Reformation
and legislation of the Scottish Parliament,
consolidated in the Treaty of Union 1707
and the Church of Scotland Act 1921, the
latter confirming its complete freedom in all
spiritual matters. It appoints its own office
bearers and its affairs are not subject to anv
civil authority.
The adult communicant membership of
the Church of Scotland is over 785,000.
Both men and women may join the
ministry and about 1,500 churches are
governed locally by Kirk Sessions, consisting
of ministers and elders. Above the Kirk
Session is the Presbytery, then the Synod,
and finally the General Assembly, consisting
of elected ministers and elders. This meets
annually under the presidency of an elected
moderator, who serves for one year. The
Sovereign is normally represented at the
General Assembly by the Lord High
Commissioner.
The Free Churches
The term ‘Free Churches’ is often used to
describe those Protestant churches in Britain
which, unlike the Church of England and the
Church of Scotland, are not established
churches. In the course of history they have
developed their own traditions. All the major
205
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Free Churches—Methodist, Baptist, United
Reformed and Salvation Army—allow both
men and women to become ministers.
The Methodist Church, the largest of
the Free Churches, with over 430,000 adult
full members and a community of more
than 1-3 million, originated in the
eighteenth century following the evangelical
revival under John Wesley. The present
church is based on a 1932 union of most of
the separate Methodist Churches.
The Baptists are mainly organised in
groups of churches, most of which belong
to the Baptist Union of Great Britain
(formed in 1812), with a membership of
about 160,000. There are also separate
Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales and
Ireland, and other independent Baptist
Churches.
The United Reformed Church, with
some 121,000 members, was formed in
1972, when the Congregational Church in
England and Wales (the oldest Protestant
minority in Britain) and the Presbyterian
Church of England merged. This was the
first union of two different churches in
Britain since the Reformation in the
sixteenth century.
Among the other Free Churches are the
Presbvterian Church in Ireland; the
Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist)
Church of Wales; and a number of
independent Scottish Presbyterian churches.
Other Protestant Churches include the
Unitarians, Free Christians, and the
Pentecostalists, who are increasing in
number. The two mam organisations
operating in Britain are the Assemblies of
God and the Elim Pentecostal Church,
many of whose members are of West Indian
origin. There is also a growing number of
black-led churches.
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 18,000 adult
members in Britain and 4^0 places of
worship, came into being in the middle of
the seventeenth century under the
leadership of George Fox. Silent worship is
central to its life as a religious organisation.
The Salvation Army was founded in
Britain in 1865. Within Britain there are
55,000 members and nearly 1,000 centres of
worship. The Salvation Army is well known
for the work of its social service centres,
which range from hostels for the homeless
to homes for those in need, and for its
prison chaplaincy service.
A recent development in Christian
worship has been the house church
movement, which began in the early 1970s
and now has an estimated membership of
120,000. Services are held in private houses.
House churches receive money from their
members to enable them to support their
leaders and carry out missionary and social
work.
There are also several other religious
organisations in Britain which were founded
in the United States in the last century.
These include the Jehovah s W itnesses, the
Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church), the Christian
Scientists and the Spiritualists.
The Roman Catholic Church
The formal structure of the Roman
Catholic Church in England and Wales,
which had ceased to exist after the
Reformation in the sixteenth century, was
restored in 1850. The Scottish Church’s
formal structure went out of existence in
the early seventeenth century and was
restored in 1878. However, throughout this
period Catholicism never disappeared
entirely. There are now seven Roman
Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each
under an archbishop, and 29 dioceses, each
under a bishop (22 in England and Wales
and seven in Scotland, independently
responsible to the Pope). There are o\er
3,000 parishes. Northern Ireland has six
dioceses, some with territory partly in the
Irish Republic.
About one British citizen in ten claims
to be a Roman Catholic.
Only men may become priests. In 1982
Pope John Paul H paid a pastoral visit to
Britain, the first by a reigning pope.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches
great importance to the education ol its
children and requires its members to try to
206
,
RELIGION
bring up their children in the Catholic
faith. Almost 5 per cent of the teachers in
Catholic schools are members of religious
orders. These orders also undertake other
social work. The majority of Catholic
schools are maintained out of public funds
and new schools may be established with
government grants.
Other Christian Communities
Christian communities of foreign origin,
including the Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European
countries, together with the Armenian
Church, have established their own centres
of worship, particularly in London.
The Jewish Community
Jews first settled in England at the time of
the Norman Conquest in the latter half of
the eleventh century. The present
community in Britain dates from 1656,
having been founded by those of Spanish
and Portuguese origin, known as
Sephardim. Later more settlers came from
Germany and Eastern Europe; they are
known as Ashkenazim. The present
community, numbering about 330,000, is
the second largest in Europe.
The community is divided into two
main groups. Some 70 per cent of the
majority Ashkenazi Jews are Orthodox and
most acknowledge the authority of the
Chief Rabbi. The Sephardi Orthodox
element follow their own spiritual head,
the Haham. The recently established
Masorti movement, the Reform movement,
founded in 1840, and the Liberal and
Progressive movement, established in
1901, account for most of the remaining
30 per cent.
Jewish congregations in Britain number
about 300. About one in three Jewish
children attend Jewish schools, some of
which are supported by public funds.
Several agencies care for elderly and
handicapped people.
The officially recognised representative
body is the Board of Deputies of British
Jews.
The Muslim Community
The most recent estimates suggest that
Britain’s Muslim population is around 1
million. The largest number originate from
Pakistan and Bangladesh, while sizeable
groups have come from India, Cyprus, the
Arab world, Malaysia and parts of Africa. A
growing community of British-born
Muslims, mainly the children of immigrant
parents, includes an increasing number of
converts to Islam. There are some 300
mosques and numerous prayer centres
throughout Britain. Mosques are not only
places of worship; they also offer
instruction in the Muslim way of life and
facilities for social and welfare activities.
The first was established at Woking in
Surrey in 1890. They now range from
converted houses in many industrial towns
to the Central Mosque in London and its
associated Islamic Cultural Centre, one of
the most important Muslim institutions in
the Western world.
The Central Mosque has the largest
congregation in Britain, and during
festivals it may number over 60,000.
Important mosques and cultural centres
are also to be found in Liverpool,
Manchester, Leicester, Edinburgh and
Glasgow.
Many of the mosques belong to various
Muslim organisations, and both the Sunni
and the Shia traditions within Islam are
represented among the Muslim community
in Britain. Members of some of the major
Sufi traditions have also developed branches
in British cities.
The Sikh Community
A large British Sikh community, comprising
over 500,000, originates mainly from India.
The largest groups of Sikhs are in Greater
London, Manchester, Birmingham,
Nottingham and Wolverhampton. Sikh
temples or gurdwaras cater for the religious,
educational, social, and cultural needs of
their community. The oldest gurdwara in
London was established in 1908 and the
207
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
largest one is in Southall, Middlesex. There
are over 170 gurdwaras in Britain.
The Hindu Community
The Hindu community in Britain comprises
around 300,000 members and also originates
largely from India. The largest groups of
Hindus are to be found in Leicester, north
and north-west London, Birmingham and
Bradford. The first Hindu temple or
mandir was opened in Leicester in 1969 and
there are now over 150 mandirs in Britain.
Buddhism
There are also about 130 Buddhist groups
in Britain and some 55 centres, with at least
13 monasteries and a number of temples.
All the main schools of Buddhism are
represented. The Buddhist Society, with its
headquarters in London, promotes the
principles of Buddhism; it does not belong
to any particular school of Buddhism.
New Religious Movements
A large number of new religious movements
or cults, mainly established since the second
world war (1939—45) and often with
overseas origins, are active in Britain. In
response to public concern about the
activities of some of these cults the
Government has since 1987 provided
funding for the Information Network Focus
on Religious Movements (INFORM), which
is also supported by the main churches.
The aims of INFORM are to conduct
research into new religious movements and
to provide objective information about
them.
Co-operation among the Churches
The Council of Churches for Britain and
Ireland was established in 1990, replacing
the former British Council of Churches and
taking over its role as the main overall body
for the Christian churches in Britain. The
Council co-ordinates the work of the
churches grouped in separate ecumenical
bodies for England, Scotland, Wales, and
Ireland.
The Free Church Federal Council
includes most of the Free Churches of
England and Wales. It promotes unity
among the Free Churches and is a channel !
for communication with government.
Inter-church discussions about the
search for unity now take place through
international as well as national bodies. The
Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Lutheran
Churches are represented on some of these,
as are the Anglican and some of the Free
Churches.
The Anglican Church, the Church of
Scotland and the main Free Churches are
also members of the World Council of
Churches. This links some 300 churches in
over 100 countries.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act
1969 enables agreements to be made by two
or more churches for sharing church
buildings.
Co-operation between Religions
A number of organisations exist which seek
to develop relations between different
religions in Britain. They include the Inter
Faith Network, which has received support
from Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist,
Hindu and Sikh leaders. Other organisations
include the Council of Christians and Jews,
which works for better understanding among
members of the two religions and deals with
problems in the social field. Religious leader:
belonging to different faiths have also
officiated jointly at a number of important
public occasions. Christians, Muslims, Sikhs
Hindus, Jews and Buddhists, for example, al
took part in the annual religious observance
to mark Commonwealth Day in March 1991
which was attended by the Queen.
11 National Economy
From 1981 to 1989 the British economy had
eight years of sustained growth at an annual
average rate of over 3 per cent. However,
growth of gross domestic product (GDP) in
1990 was only 0 5 per cent, with output
falling in the second half of the year.
Investment underwent sustained growth from
1981 to 1989, to reach record levels, with
particularly rapid growth between 1987 and
1989. It fell between 1989 and 1990. There
has been a recent fall in the number of jobs,
from the highest-ever levels of 1990, and a
rise in unemployment since early 1990. The
annual rate of retail price inflation in August
1991 was 4-7 per cent, down from 10 9 per
cent in September and October 1990.
The current account of the balance of
payments has been in deficit since 1986,
following six successive years of surplus, but
the deficit has been on a downward trend
since 1989. Export volumes have continued
to grow.
ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
Britain has an open economy, in which
international trade is a vital part of economic
performance. In 1990 exports of goods and
services accounted for about a quarter of
GDP—a comparatively high share among the
major economies. The proportion has
increased in recent decades, from about 20
per cent in the early 1960s. Similar rises
have occurred in most other developed
countries, reflecting the growing importance
of international trade in an increasingly
interdependent world economy.
The economy is primarily—and
increasingly—based on private enterprise, and
government policy is aimed at encouraging
and expanding the private sector, which
accounts for about three-quarters of GDP and
over two-thirds of total employment.
While manufacturing, the traditional
engine of economic growth in Britain,
continues to play a vital role, recent decades
have generally seen a faster growth in the
services sector. An adjustment to the relative
size of the manufacturing sector has also
resulted from the growth of North Sea oil
output. Services account for over three-fifths
of GDP and for two-thirds of employment,
compared with about half of both GDP and
employment in 1950. Manufacturing
accounts for less than a quarter of each,
compared with over a third in 1950.
Around 2 per cent of Britain’s workforce
is engaged in agriculture—a lower proportion
than in any other major industrialised
country. However, because of a high level of
productivity, Britain is able to produce over
half of its own food.
With the exploitation of oil and natural
gas from the Continental Shelf under the
North Sea, the country is self-sufficient in
energy in net terms and expects to remain so
for some years. Together, the extraction of
oil and gas accounted for some 2 per cent of
GDP in 1990. Coal-—traditionally the most
important source of energy—still meets
almost a third of Britain’s energy needs.
One of the largest exporters of
manufactures, Britain accounts for over 5 per
cent of the world total. It is among the major
exporters of aerospace products, electrical
equipment, most types of machinery,
chemicals and oil. It is also one of the
world’s largest importers of agricultural
products, raw materials and semi¬
manufactures.
In about half the years since the end of
the second world war in 1945, a deficit on
Britain’s visible trade has been offset by a
surplus on transactions in invisibles.
However, the surplus on invisibles declined
sharply in 1989 and stayed at roughly the
209
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
same level in 1990, mainly because of a fall
in net investment income and an increase in
net transfers to European Community
institutions. The significant contribution
made by invisibles to the current account is
partly a reflection of Britain’s position as a
major financial centre. The banks, insurance
underwriters and brokers, and other financial
institutions of the City of London provide
worldwide financial services, and the City
contains one of the most comprehensive and
advanced capital markets in the world.
Values for some of the main economic
indicators in selected years since 1980 are
shown in Table 11.1.
Economic Growth
The marked rise in living standards in
recent years has been accompanied by the
emergence of new industries and the renewal
and improvement of much of the country’s
infrastructure. Britain had a higher rate of
economic growth over the decade 1980—90
than either Germany or France. However,
economic growth in 1990 was 0 5 per cent,
and output fell between mid-1990 and
mid-1991.
Inflation and Competitiveness
From the late 1960s until about 1980 Britain
had generally high annual rates of inflation
compared with other countries. Huge rises in
the price of oil in 1973 and 1979 and
substantial increases in the money supply
and public spending were followed by
upsurges in inflation in 1975 and 1980.
Earnings also grew rapidly. Inflation fell in
the early 1980s and stayed low for a
number of years. However, it picked up
towards the end of the decade, so that the
annual rate was 10-9 per cent in September
1990. It then fell again, to 4 7 per cent in
August 1991. In the year to July 1991
earnings rose at an underlying rate of some
7 5 per cent—down from about 10 per cent
in the year to mid-1990.
Industrial Production
In the decade to 1973 output of the
manufacturing industries grew at a faster
rate than the economy as a whole. After
the oil price rises of 1973-74, however,
manufacturing output fell sharply. It later
increased from this trough but, following
another oil price rise and stagnation in the
world economy, fell back in the late 1970s
and early 1980s. This was followed by a
period of steady growth until 1990, since
when there has been a cyclical decline.
By 1985 output of the production
industries as a whole (manufacturing,
energy and water) had risen above its
earlier peak of 1979. It experienced
sustained growth between 1983 and 1989,
but declined in 1990. In 1986 energy
output was about twice the level of ten
years earlier. With oil output having passed
its peak of the mid-1980s and with the
need to shut down fields in order to carry
out safety work, it had fallen back by over
15 per cent by 1990.

NATIONAL ECONOMY
Investment
From 1983 until 1989 fixed investment
increased by about 7 per cent a year on
average, with particularly rapid growth of
nearly 10 per cent a year between 1986
and 1989. This was followed by a cyclical
decline in 1990. Over the decade 1980-90
there was an increase in the private
sector’s share of fixed investment from 72
to 84 per cent (due in part to
privatisation). Over the same period there
was a rise in the share of investment
undertaken by the services sector and a
fall in that carried out by manufacturing.
An improvement in the quality of
investment contributed to the rise in the
late 1980s in the net real rate of return on
capital employed in non-North Sea
industrial and commercial companies.
However, there was a decline in 1990,
when the rate fell to some 6 per cent.
Employment and Productivity
Britain’s workforce in employment
increased by 3-3 million in the seven years
to June 1990. However, it has
subsequently declined and in March 1991
amounted to 26 4 million. Since 1979 self-
employment has risen every year, to reach
3 3 million by mid-1990. The number of
women seeking work has also risen.
As in other industrialised countries,
there is concern about unemployment.
Even when the workforce was expanding,
unemployment did not fall as quickly as
employment rose. However, with the
economy growing rapidly, unemployment
fell by 1-6 million between July 1986 and
March 1990. Subsequently unemployment
has risen. In August 1991 it amounted to
2 4 million—equal to 8-5 per cent of the
workforce.
Between 1980 and 1990 manufacturing
productivity in Britain grew by an average
of 4 7 per cent a year. This was higher
than in any other major industrialised
country and in contrast to the previous
two decades, when Britain was at the
bottom of the league. However,
productivity in Britain’s economy as a
whole increased only slowly in 1990 as part
of the normal reaction to a cyclical
slowdown in activity.
As a result of demographic changes, the
population of working age will grow more
slowly during the 1990s than in recent
years, with a fall in the number of young
people. The increase in Great Britain
between 1988 and 2001 is projected at 0 6
million, compared with a rise of 2 4 million
in the previous 13 years. Accordingly,
there will be a need for increased flexibility
among those in work and for employers to
tap new sources of recruitment. The
Government has launched a new training
framework, involving a greater role for
employers.
Overseas Sector
Britain’s overseas trade performance
fluctuated during the 1970s. In general,
imports of food, energy, raw materials and
manufactured goods were greater than
visible exports, around 80 per cent of
which were manufactured goods. This
deficit on visible trade was wholly or partly
offset by a surplus on invisibles, which
cover earnings from services, together with
interest, profits and dividends, and
transfers.
In the years 1980 to 1982 Britain ran
surpluses on visible trade. Since then,
however, imports—especially of
manufactures—have tended to rise more
sharply than exports (although the trend
was reversed in 1990) and the deficit on
visible trade has reappeared. After a long
period of deterioration in the balance of
trade in manufactures there was a deficit in
1983, which has continued in subsequent
years. However, the deficit has declined
and was virtually eliminated in the summer
of 1991. Substantial net earnings on
invisible transactions kept the current
account in surplus up to 1985, but it has
been in deficit since then.
Membership of the European
Community has had a major impact on
Britain’s pattern of trade, increasing the
proportion with other member countries.
Between 1972 and 1990 the proportion of
211
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain’s exports of goods going to other
members of the Community rose from 34 to
53 per cent. Imports followed a similar
trend. Trade with Japan and with the newly
industrialised countries, including Singapore,
Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia, has risen
substantially.
The invisibles account has had to adapt to
new conditions, in particular, the abolition of
exchange controls in 1979 and the growth in
world markets of insurance, banking,
tourism, construction, consultancy and other
services. In 1990 exports of services were
valued at around one-third of exports of
goods.
The substantial cumulative surplus on
current account in the first half of the 1980s
contributed to a corresponding increase in
Britain’s net external assets. These are
estimated to have risen from £18,000 million
at the end of 1980 to £104,000 million at the
end of 1986. They have since fallen, to
£84,000 million at the end of 1989 and to
£30,000 million at the end of 1990. The
latter decline reflected mainly the effect of
falling security prices on substantial portfolios
held abroad. At the end of 1990 the book
value of British direct investment holdings
overseas was £127,000 million, reflecting the
growth of multinational companies based in
Britain, and that of British portfolio
investment holdings overseas was £186,000
million. Direct and portfolio investment in
Britain from overseas has also grown as
overseas companies have become established
in Britain, especially in recent years in
preparation for the onset of the single
European market by the end of 1992.
Oil
The development of North Sea oil and gas
production has had a significant effect on the
economy; in 1990 Britain was the world’s
ninth largest oil producer. The benefits to
the balance of payments began to appear in
the second half of the 1970s and in 1980
Britain had its first surplus on oil trade. In
1974 oil accounted for some 4 per cent of
Britain’s visible exports and 19 per cent of
visible imports. In 1990 the proportions were
7 and 5 per cent respectively (the export
proportion having been as high as 21 per
cent in the mid-1980s). The oil surplus
reached its peak in 1985, at £8,100 million.
With the fall in oil prices the surplus has
fallen and amounted to some £1,500 million
in 1990. Exports, mainly to other European
Community countries, are equivalent to
well over half of domestic oil production.
They are partly offset in balance-of-
payments terms by imports of other grades
of crude oil from the Middle East and
elsewhere.
North Sea oil helped to alleviate the fall
in real national income which Britain, along
with other industrialised countries, suffered
following the oil price rises of the 1970s. In
the early 1980s it helped to ease the task of
controlling public sector borrowing, one
component of the Government’s counter¬
inflation strategy. Even as production falls
from its mid-1980s peak, the stock of
external assets that has been built up,
largely during the period of oil surpluses,
provides a flow of income.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
The Government’s economic policy is set in
the context of a medium-term financial
strategy, which is reviewed each year at the
time of the Budget. Within this strategy,
firm financial policies are designed to defeat
inflation. This strategy was reaffirmed in
the 1991 Budget. Short-term interest rates
remain the essential instrument of monetary
policy. The framework of monetary
discipline has been reinforced by British
membership of the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) of the European
Monetary System (EMS). Fiscal policy is
set over a medium-term horizon to support
tight monetary policies.
Macroeconomic policy is directed
towards bringing down the rate of inflation
and ultimately achieving price stability. On
top of this, microeconomic policies are
aimed at improving the working of markets
and encouraging enterprise, efficiency and
flexibility. By means of policies such as
deregulation and tax reform, these are
designed to improve the supply-side
performance of the economy (see p 213).
212
NATIONAL ECONOMY
Monetary Policy
The central aim of monetary policy, which
the Government sees as lying at the heart of
macroeconomic policy, is the creation of
conditions that will exert steady downward
pressure on the rate of growth of money
GDP, so bringing down the rate of inflation.
Interest rates are the primary instrument for
achieving this. Britain’s membership of the
ERM constitutes an added element of
monetary discipline by making explicit the
Government’s commitment to a firm
exchange rate and by linking sterling to the
currencies of countries such as Germany,
which have a record of low inflation.
Under the ERM the central exchange
rate for sterling is £\ = 2 95 Deutsche
Mark, with a permitted fluctuation of
6 per cent either side of the central rate.
In assessing the overall stance of monetary
conditions, the Government pays attention to
a range of indicators. In particular, narrow
money, as measured by MO,1 has had a
stable relationship with money GDP over a
number of years and has proved a reliable
indicator of monetary conditions. A target
range of 0 to 4 per cent has been set for MO
growth in 1991-92. This will help to
underpin the Government’s commitment to
the ERM.
Changes in broad money, or liquidity,
have become increasingly difficult to
interpret; far-reaching changes in financial
practices have meant that there is no simple
relationship between the growth in broad
money and in money GDP. Consequently,
no explicit target range is set for broad
money, though the assessment of monetary
conditions continues to take broad money
into account.
Fiscal Policy
The role of a tight monetary policy in
reducing inflation is supported by a firm
1 MO is notes and coin in circulation with the public and banks’
holdings of cash and their operational balances at the Bank of
England.
fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is set according
to the medium-term objective of a balanced
budget. This is consistent with cyclical
variations in government spending and
revenues—‘automatic stabilisers’. The
public sector therefore tends to run a
surplus when the level of economic activity
is high and a deficit when it is low. The
Government does not attempt to ‘fine-tune’
the level of demand through changes in
fiscal policy; it believes that the associated
time lags generally mean that such changes
will be destabilising. Frequent changes in
taxation or spending policy may also
produce an adverse supply-side response.
Within the overall policy of a balanced
budget over the medium term, the
Government aims to reduce taxes so as to
leave people with more of their own
money. In particular, the basic rate of
income tax has already been cut from 33 to
25 per cent. The Government wishes to
move towards 20 per cent when prudent to
do so within the overall balanced budget
constraint. Such tax cuts can only be
achieved if public spending is kept under
control. The Government therefore aims
over the medium term to maintain general
government expenditure, excluding
privatisation proceeds (which count as
negative expenditure), on a downward
trend as a share of GDP. The ratio of
general government expenditure, excluding
privatisation proceeds, to GDP fell from
47-5 per cent in 1982-83 to some 40-5 per
cent in 1990-91.
Supply-Side Policies
While macroeconomic policy is directed
towards reducing inflation, the
Government has sought to improve the
supply response, and thus the efficiency, of
the economy through microeconomic
policies. Action has been taken to expose
more of the economy to market forces.
Direct controls (for example, on pay,
prices, foreign exchange, dividend
payments and commercial credit) have been
abolished and competition in domestic
markets strengthened. Labour market
reforms have also been introduced,

measures taken to encourage saving and
share ownership, and a substantial amount
of activity transferred from the public to
the private sector by privatisation and
contracting work out. In addition, efforts
have been made to improve value for
money in the public sector by, for example,
transferring many of the executive functions
of government to new executive agencies,
and to reduce regulatory burdens on
business.
The Government has sought to improve
work incentives by reducing personal
income tax rates, raising tax thresholds and
reforming the benefits system. It has also,
through the tax system, encouraged the
extension of share ownership among
employees. A scheme of income tax relief
has been introduced to encourage the
spread of profit-related pay. The
Government has taken steps to achieve a
better-balanced legal framework for
industrial relations and has expanded
training opportunities. Obstacles to the
mobility of labour have been reduced. For
example, the rights of those leaving
occupational pension schemes early have
been improved and new arrangements for
personal pensions introduced, both of which
will reduce the pension disadvantage of
changing jobs. Reforms in the housing
market have been introduced to make it
easier for people to move house. Policies
have been set in train to reduce the
number of obstacles facing small firms and
the self-employed.
Competition among financial
institutions is being encouraged within a
new statutory framework of investor
protection. The Government has also taken
steps to reduce the distorting effects of the
tax system on investment and savings
decisions by, among other things,
reforming corporation tax (the burden of
which has been eased) and the system of
capital allowances. Planning restrictions on
industrial investment have been eased,
while government support to industry has
become more selective and, where
appropriate, more closely related to job
creation. Particular efforts have been made
to improve the flow of investment funds to
small firms, to assist innovation in industry
and to attract industry to the inner cities.
Economic Management
HM Treasury has prime responsibility for
the formulation and conduct of economic
policy, which it carries out in conjunction
with the Bank of England (the central
bank) and the Departments of Trade and
Industry, Employment, Energy, the
Environment and I ransport, and the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food.

A number of other bodies deal with
specific aspects of economic policy and the
regulation of certain sectors of the
economy. These include bodies such as the
Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
On major matters of public policy such
as the broad economic strategy, and on the
economic problems it faces, the
Government makes known its policies and
keeps in touch with developments
throughout the economy by means of
informal and continuous links with the
chief industrial, financial, labour and other
interests. Final responsibility for the broad
lines of economic policy rests with the
Cabinet.
NATIONAL INCOME AND
EXPENDITURE
The value of all goods and services
produced in the economy is measured by
GDP. This can be expressed either in
terms of market prices (the prices people
pay for the goods and services they buy) or
at factor cost (the cost of the goods and
services before adding taxes and subtracting
subsidies). It can also be expressed in
current prices or in constant prices (that is,
removing the effects of inflation in order to
measure the underlying growth in the
economy). In 1990 GDP at current factor
cost totalled £487,000 million.
Estimation of GDP can be approached
in three different ways as the sum total of
expenditure, income or output. Each
method yields the same total in principle
but in practice there are slight differences.
The definitive measure of GDP is derived
as an average of these approaches. In 1990
this index of the average estimate of
GDP at constant factor cost was 116-2
(1985 = 100), compared with 90 7 in 1980,
an increase of some 28 per cent.
Table 11.2 gives figures for the average
estimate of GDP, at both current market
prices and current factor cost, and also
shows how two other main aggregates used
in the national accounts, gross national
product and national income, are derived.
Table 11.3 shows the categories of total
final expenditure in 1990. Consumers’
expenditure accounted for 50 per cent of
total final expenditure, and exports of goods
and services for 19 per cent.
Personal Incomes and Expenditure
Personal disposable income (that is,
personal incomes after deductions—mainly
taxation and social security contributions)
rose rapidly and fairly steadily from
£161,000 million in 1980 to £384,800
million in 1990, 3-3 per cent higher in real
terms than in 1989. Consumers’
expenditure amounted to 70 9 per cent of
pre-tax personal income in 1990, compared
with 74 per cent in 1989.
Table 11.4 shows the changing pattern
of consumers’ expenditure. Housing, food,
alcoholic drink, clothing and footwear, and
fuel and power together accounted for 42
per cent of the total. The changes in the

pattern between 1980 and 1990 in Britain
were paralleled in other industrialised
countries, with declining proportions spent
on food, tobacco, clothing and footwear, and
fuel and power. Over the longer term, as
incomes rise, people tend to spend increasing
proportions on services. Consumers’
expenditure increased by 1 per cent in real
terms between 1989 and 1990.
Saving as a percentage of personal
disposable income varied during the 1980s,
but fell from 13 3 per cent in 1980 to 54 per
cent in 1988. This reflected a number of
factors, including lower inflation, higher
property prices and the deregulation of the
personal finance market, so making
borrowing easier. However, the savings ratio
increased in 1989 and 1990, reaching 9 2 per
cent in the latter year.
Sources of Income
The proportion of total personal pre-tax
income accounted for by income from
employment was 64 per cent in 1990; average
gross weekly earnings in April 1991 in Oreat
Britain were £319 for full-time male workers
and £222 for full-time female workers. The
three other main sources of personal income
were self-employment (12 per cent in 1990),
rent, dividends and interest (11 per cent) and
social security benefits and other current
grants from general government (13 per
cent).
Current Government Expenditure
Final consumption by central government
and local authorities amounted to £109,500
million in 1990; it rose by 12 per cent in real
terms over the period 1980 to 1990. The
main cause of this was the growth over the
period in spending on the social services,
health, and law and order.
In addition to their expenditure on goods
and services, public authorities transfer large
sums to other sectors, mainly the personal
sector, by way of National Insurance and
other social security benefits, grants, and
interest and subsidies. Central government
also makes grants to local authorities to
finance about half of their current
expenditure.
Gross Domestic Product by Industry
Table 11.5 shows GDP by industry in 1980
and 1990. Over a period of time agriculture
and manufacturing have come to account for
smaller proportions of national income, whik
services have grown relatively; services now
account for 64 per cent of GDP.

12 Industry and Commerce
Introduction
The most important industrial developments
in the last 15 years have been the growth of
the offshore oil and gas industries and the
rapid development of electronic and
microelectronic technologies and their wide
application in industry and commerce
generally. There has been a steady increase
in the share of output and employment
accounted for by private sector enterprises as
privatisation has progressed. In addition, the
proportion of jobs in the service industries
has continued to rise.
The Government believes that economic
decisions are best taken by those competing
in the market place, and that government
should encourage enterprise and create the
right climate for markets to work better.
This chapter outlines some of the general
features of industrial and commercial
performance and organisation, and goes on to
describe government policies and legislation,
the functioning of markets, and research and
innovation.
Performance
Between 1981 and 1989 Britain had eight
successive years of growth, at an annual
average rate of over 3 per cent. In the
1980s Britain grew faster than France and
the then Federal Republic of Germany.
This was in contrast to the experience of
the previous two decades, when Britain
had the lowest growth rate in Europe.
Over the same period, productivity in
manufacturing grew more rapidly than in
all other major industrialised countries.
Following a very rapid rate of
expansion in the late 1980s, however, the
pace of activity began to falter in 1990; in
common with other major industrialised
countries, Britain entered recession.
Investment
Investment totalled £105,195 million in
1990 (see Table 12.3). In real terms
investment was 32 per cent higher than in
1985. However, investment in 1990 was
2 4 per cent lower than in 1989, although
in some sectors (such as energy)
investment continued to rise. The figures
for manufacturing industry do not include
expenditure on leased assets since these
are attributed to the service industries on
the basis of ownership. Manufacturing
industry is, however, a major user of
leased assets.

Inward Investment
Britain is recognised as an attractive location
for inward direct investment. This reflects its
membership of the European Community
and proximity to other European markets,
stable labour relations and comparatively low
corporate and personal taxation. Overseas-
owned firms are offered the same facilities
and incentives as British-owned ones.
The Invest in Britain Bureau of the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
provides foreign companies with advice and
assistance on locating and relocating
businesses in Britain, and on expanding
existing facilities. It reported 350 new inward
investment projects in 1990-91. The
promotion of England as a location for
inward investment projects is handled by the
English unit of the DTI. Similar advice and
assistance is also available through Locate in
Scotland, operated jointly by the Scottish
Office Industry Department and Scottish
Enterprise; Welsh Development
International, the investment arm of the
Welsh Development Agency; and the
Industrial Development Board in Northern
Ireland.
At the end of 1990 total United States
investment in Britain was valued at $165,000
million, representing 42 per cent of United
States investment in the European
Community. Britain has for many years been
the leading country for United States
manufacturing investment in Europe.
Britain also has about 39 per cent of
Japanese investment in the European
Community.

INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
Organisation and
Ownership
The main categories of business and
commercial organisation are:
• unincorporated businesses (sole traders
and partnerships), of which there are
more than 1 million;
• incorporated companies; and
• government-owned enterprises (see
below).
In some sectors a small number of large
companies and their subsidiaries are
responsible for a large proportion of total
production, notably in the vehicle, aerospace
and transport equipment industries. Private
enterprises generate about three-quarters of
total domestic income. They account for the
greater part of activity in the agricultural,
manufacturing, construction, distributive,
financial and miscellaneous service sectors.
The private sector accounted for 77 per cent
of total domestic final expenditure in 1990,
general government for 22 per cent and
public corporations for 1 per cent.
About 250 British industrial companies in
the latest reporting period each had an
annual turnover of more than £500 million.
The annual turnover of the biggest, British
Petroleum (BP), makes it the eleventh largest
industrial grouping in the world and the
second largest in Europe. Five British firms
are among the top 25 European Community
companies.
Nationalised Industries
The major nationalised industries are British
Coal, British Rail, the Post Office and
London Transport. The managing boards
and staffs of the nationalised industries are
not civil servants. The boards are appointed
by ministers who have the power to give
general directions but are not involved in
day-to-day management.
The Government believes that
nationalised industries should act as
commercial enterprises and has set policies
with which they are expected to conform.
These involve:
• clear government objectives for the
industries;
• regular corporate plans and performance
reviews;
• agreed principles relating to investment
appraisal and pricing;
• financial targets and performance aims;
• external financing limits; and
• systematic monitoring.
The industries are expected to achieve a
required rate of return, currently 8 per cent
in real terms before tax. The financial target
set by the Government is usually supported
by a series of performance aims, covering
costs and, where appropriate, standards of
service. External financing limits, which
control the amount of finance (grants and
borrowing) that a nationalised industry can
raise in any financial year, are an important
operating control. They are set in the light
of the industry’s financial target and its
expected performance and investment
requirements. The proportion of investment
financed from internally generated funds has
risen in recent years.
External scrutiny of nationalised industry
efficiency is conducted by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission (see p 231). Where
appropriate, investigations may also be
undertaken by management consultants.
House of Commons Select Committees, such
as the Treasury and Civil Service Committee
and the Public Accounts Committee, also
scrutinise the industries’ performance.
Industrial Associations
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
represents about 250,000 parent and
subsidiary companies, as well as the members
of some 150 trade associations and
employers’ organisations and the majority of
public sector enterprises, together employing
more than half the nation’s workforce. The
largest employers’ organisation in the
country, it provides members with a forum,
a lobby and a range of advisory services. The
CBI also conducts a series of surveys on
221
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
manufacturing, distribution, financial
services, regions, and pay and productivity.
British chambers of commerce represent
business views and interests to the
Government both at national and local levels.
They promote local economic development,
for example, through regeneration projects,
tourism, inward investment promotion in
certain areas of Britain and business services,
including overseas trade missions, exhibitions
and training conferences. The Association of
British Chambers of Commerce represents
over 90,000 businesses in over 100 chambers
of commerce throughout Britain.
Trade associations consist of companies
producing or selling a particular product or
group of products. They exist to provide
common services, regulate trading practices
and represent their members to government
departments.
Employers’ organisations are usually
concerned with the negotiation of wages and
conditions of work in a particular industry,
although sometimes one institution may
combine this function with that of a trade
association.
Industrial Financing
Over half of companies’ funds for investment
and other purposes are internally generated.
Banks provide the chief external source of
finance, but companies have increasingly
turned to equity finance. The main forms of
short-term finance available in the private
sector are bank overdrafts, trade credit and
factoring (making cash available to a
company in exchange for debts owing to it).
Types of medium- and long-term finance
include bank loans, the mortgaging of
property and the issue of shares and other
securities to the public through The London
Stock Exchange. The leasing of equipment
may also be regarded as a form of finance.
Other sources of finance for industry include
the Government, the European Community
and specialist financial institutions.
There has been a growing number of
schemes involving equity funds made
available by financial institutions in support
of innovative or other new and growing
business ventures. This is known as venture
capital. Since 1985 the members of the
British Venture Capital Association have
invested some £6,200 million and currently
command an investment pool of £2,000
million.
There has also been a rise in the number
of ‘buy-outs’, in which the staff or
management of a company raise the finance
to purchase it, and ‘buy-ins’, in which the
staff or management of one firm purchase
another. Since 1979 there have been over
3,000 buy-outs, with a total value of £17,040
million. The amount invested in management
buy-outs and buy-ins in 1990 was
£382 million.
Management Development and
Industrial Training
Management education is provided by many
polytechnics and colleges of higher and
further education. Some regional
management centres have been established in
England and Wales by associations of these
colleges, and there are several similar
organisations in Scotland. Universities make
an important contribution, especially through
the full-time postgraduate programmes at
business schools such as those of London,
Manchester, Durham, Warwick and
Strathclyde universities.
Training courses for managers are offered
by several independent colleges, including
the Management College (Henley-on-
Thames), Ashridge College (Berkhamsted)
and Cranfield School of Management
(Bedford). Open and distance learning
opportunities are becoming more widely
available. The British Institute of
Management encourages excellence in
management. Other professional bodies are
concerned with standards and training in
specialised branches of management.
The Open University, which provides
degree courses using distance learning
techniques, notably television broadcasts, has
its own Business School offering part-time
courses leading to a diploma in management
and to a Master’s degree in Business
Administration.
The employer-led Management Charter
Initiative (MCI) is the operating arm of the
222
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
National Forum for Management Education
and Development and the leading industrial
body for management standards. Over
840 employers, representing 7 million
employees, are members of MCI, which has
50 local networks working with local
employers.
Government Management Initiatives
The DTI is working with other government
departments and with industry to improve
management education, and to spread
awareness about best management practices.
It strongly supports the MCI. The
consultancy support offered by the DTI to
businesses with fewer than 500 employees is
designed to help businesses improve their
management performance. Another
programme, ‘Managing into the 90s’, is
designed to encourage managers to integrate
the role of design, quality, manufacturing
management, and purchasing and supply,
within an overall business strategy leading to
improved competitiveness.
The DTI has also encouraged the growth
of links between industry and higher
education in recent years, primarily through
collaborative research. One of the most
successful ways has been the Teaching
Company Scheme, under which young
graduates undertake key projects in
companies under the joint supervision of
academic and company staff.
The Engineering Council
Established under Royal Charter in 1981, the
Engineering Council promotes the science
and practice of engineering and advances
education in engineering. The Council
maintains a register of 290,000 chartered
engineers, incorporated engineers and
engineering technicians. In co-operation with
the various professional institutions and
other organisations concerned with training
in engineering, it has set standards for
education, training and experience, and
accredited courses by which people qualify
for registration. The Council is advised by
some 260 industrial affiliates on industrial
requirements for engineers and technicians.
Government Policies and
Legislation
The DTI is the main department responsible
for the Government’s relations with industry
and commerce. Specific responsibilities
include technology and innovation, overseas
trade and export promotion, competition
policy and consumer affairs, company
legislation and the Patent Office. Through
the Invest in Britain Bureau, it gives advice
and assistance to foreign companies on
locating in Britain. The Scottish, Welsh
and Northern Ireland Offices are responsible
for the range of industrial policies in their
areas.
The Enterprise Initiative
The Enterprise Initiative brings together a
wide range of the services that the DTI
provides for industry and commerce. Its
consultancy scheme encourages small and
medium-sized businesses to use outside
consultancy services as a regular part of their
management strategy. It also offers
consultancy support in design, marketing,
manufacturing and service systems, quality,
business planning, and financial and
management information systems. In
Scotland and Wales the scheme is operated
by Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh
Development Agency. Assistance is available
to manufacturing and service businesses with
fewer than 500 employees. In the Assisted
Areas (see p 228) and Urban Programme
Areas, two-thirds of the costs of a project are
met; elsewhere the rate is 50 per cent. Some
£46 million is being provided in 1991-92 to
support the consultancy scheme.
Industrial Policy
In 1991 the DTI specified its objectives for
industrial policy as:
• working for trade liberalisation
worldwide and the completion of the
single European market (see below);
• promoting British exports;
• stimulating innovation in industry;
223
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• improving the flow of information to
business;
• encouraging competition;
• aiming for a light but effective
framework of market regulation;
• fostering a positive attitude towards
wealth creation;
• reducing burdens on business;
• taking into account the concerns of
business and consumers in the
development of government policies, and
• responding to regional needs.
Single European Market
The Government is firmly committed to the
completion of the single European market by
the end of 1992. This will provide major
benefits for business and consumers, and
improve European competitiveness in world
markets. The DTI runs campaigns to
emphasise to businesses the importance of
taking full advantage of the opportunities
presented by the single market.
Small Firms
Small businesses make a major contribution
to the economy by employing 36 per cent of
the private sector workforce and producing
21 per cent of British turnover.
The Government runs schemes which
provide either direct assistance or advice and
guidance on a wide range of business
problems affecting small firms. In addition to
DTI schemes such as consultancy help under
the Enterprise Initiative, the Government s
Small Firms Service, available throughout
Britain, provides information, advice,
counselling and training services to
prospective and established small businesses.
Other government help to small firms
includes:
• guaranteed repayment of /0 per cent of
medium-term loans made by financial
institutions (rising to 85 per cent of
loans in inner city Task Force areas);
• the Business Expansion Scheme, which
improves the flow of equity finance to
small firms by offering tax incentives to
investors;
• the Enterprise Allowance Scheme,
enabling unemployed people to claim an
allowance while establishing a new
business;
• the Manufacturing Planning and
Implementation Studies Programme, set
up to help companies exploit Advanced
Manufacturing Technology (AMT) to
the full, by offering grants towards the
costs of hiring external advisors;
• the introduction of tax concessions and
training for people setting up their own
businesses;
• encouragement of new advisory services
for small firms; and
• the Regional Enterprise Grants Scheme,
designed to support small firms’
investment and innovation projects.
Deregulation
In order to encourage enterprise, the
Government is attempting to reduce the
administrative and legislative burdens
imposed on business, particularly small
businesses, by central and local government.
Under the Deregulation Initiative, all
proposals for new regulation, whether of
British or European Community origin, are
examined for their impact on business. The
costs to business are taken into account in
deciding whether and how they should be
imposed. Existing controls are also reviewed
to identify any which may be unnecessary or
outdated. There is a rolling review of
existing regulation and an annual programme
of work on deregulation, which covers all
government departments and on which
regular progress reports are published. The
initiative is co-ordinated by the DTFs
Deregulation Unit.
Privatisation
The Government believes that the best way
to improve the performance of the
nationalised industries in the long term is to
expose them to market forces, through
privatisation and the promotion of
competition. Privatisation has also provided a
major opportunity for the Government to
224
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
widen and deepen share ownership by
encouraging both employees and the general
public to take a direct stake in British
industry. Employees in privatised companies
are normally given a preferential right to buy
shares in the new companies.
Some 25 per cent of the adult
population holds shares, compared with
7 per cent in 1979.
Since 1979 the Government has privatised
46 major businesses, with net proceeds of
some £35,000 million. Planned privatisations
include those of British Technology Group
and the electricity supply industry in
Northern Ireland. Work is also in hand on
the planned privatisation of British Coal and
on options for British Rail. The sale of part
of the Government’s residual shareholding in
BT is planned for November 1991.
Taxation
The rates of corporate taxation have been
progressively reduced. In the case of business
plant and machinery, there is an annual
allowance against profits for tax purposes of
25 per cent (on a reducing balance basis),
beginning in the year in which expenditure
occurs. There is an allowance for investment
in industrial building of 4 per cent a year.
Special arrangements exist for short-life
(often high-technology) assets. There are 100
per cent allowances for capital expenditure
on scientific research, and, in designated
Enterprise Zones, for expenditure on
construction.
Business and Education
A well educated and well trained workforce
is essential for economic growth, particularly
at a time of intense international competition
and rapid technological advance. The
Government takes measures to ensure that
education and training are broadly based and
that people of all ages can acquire relevant
knowledge and skills. It plans to introduce
legislation to improve education and training
for young people by, among other things,
removing barriers between academic and
vocational studies.
Industrial and commercial matters are
being allotted a more prominent place in
school and post-school curriculums. The
introduction of the National Curriculum in
England and Wales, with parallel
developments in Scotland and Northern
Ireland, is helping to achieve this in schools,
and the Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative contributes to this trend in schools
and colleges. Businessmen and women
contribute to curriculum development and

‘enterprise activities’ for schoolchildren and
they have been enabled to take a larger part
in the management of educational
establishments.
The Government is setting up a network
of 82 business-led Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) in England and Wales and
22 Local Enterprise Companies (LECs) in
Scotland (see p 230). Through their
involvement in these bodies, employers will
have a bigger role in the working of colleges
and the careers service. Schoolchildren and
teachers are given the opportunity to gain
business experience. Colleges and universities
co-operate with industry in joint ventures
such as science parks and regional technology
centres and in the provision of enterprise
training to higher education students.
DESIGN, QUALITY, STANDARDS
AND AWARDS
Design
The Design Council encourages industry and
commerce to pay more attention to good
design. It organises conferences to underline
the importance of design and has encouraged
design education at all levels, including
business education.
As the DTPs main agent for design
promotion, the Design Council has
responsibility for linking design to innovation
and technology to ensure that British
products compete effectively in world
markets, and for the design element of the
Enterprise Initiative consultancy scheme. It
is also responsible for the DTI’s element of
the ‘Managing into the 90s’ programme. Its
activities include:
• offering advice on design matters and
problems;
• organising conferences and seminars,
• providing help for design education, and
• producing publications and videos.
The Design Council operates the DTPs
consultancy initiative on design, which offers
firms employing up to 500 people 5 to 15
days of subsidised consultancy. The Council
provides annual awards for consumer and
contract furniture, engineering products
and components, computer software,
medical equipment, and motor vehicles
and accessories.
Quality and Standards
The Government is encouraging industry
and commerce to pay attention to quality
at all stages of design, production,
marketing and delivery to customers.
Through its support for consultancy
projects the Government is helping small
and medium-sized firms to learn about and
apply quality management techniques
based on a national standard which meets
international requirements. To increase
customer confidence, companies are being
encouraged to obtain assessment and
registration to this standard. The
competence and performance of
organisations undertaking such certification
are officially approved by the National
Accreditation Council for Certification
Bodies. Companies certified by accredited
bodies are permitted to use the national
‘crown and tick’ accreditation mark.
The British Standards Institution (BSI),
incorporated by Royal Charter, is the
British member of the European and
international standards organisations. It
works with industry and government to
produce standards which are of the
required quality, relevant to the needs of
the market, internationally respected, and
suitable for public purchasing and
regulatory purposes. Government support
for BSI is directed particularly towards
European and international standards
work. Common standards will contribute
to the aim of creating a single internal
market in the European Community by
the end of 1992. About 30 per cent of the
11,000 British Standards are now identical
with European or international standards.
The kitemark is BSI’s registered
certification trade mark. Resource, a joint
venture between BSI and the Government,
has been launched to promote
collaboration with overseas countries in
standards, quality assurance, metrology
and testing.
226
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
Measurement Standards
The Department of Trade and Industry is
responsible for policy relating to the National
Measurement System. The National Physical
Laboratory (NPL) is the main contractor for
providing most of the physical measurement
standards and associated calibration facilities
necessary to ensure that measurements in
Britain are made on a common basis and to
the required accuracy. It maintains links with
other national standards laboratories to
ensure international compatibility in
j; standards and measurement essential for
| overseas trade and technological co¬
operation. The NPL’s National
Measurement Accreditation Service
(NAMAS) is the national accreditation
service for calibration and testing
laboratories. Its accredited laboratories offer
calibration of scientific instruments and
supply official certificates in many areas,
primarily the physical, chemical and
engineering fields.
The Laboratory of the Government
Chemist (LGC) is the main contractor
providing standards associated with chemical
and analytical measurement. International
agreement is based on the provision of
appropriate standards and the utilisation of
approved methods of analysis. These
standards and approved methods also form
the basis for NAMAS accreditation of
laboratories carrying out analytical
measurement.
The National Weights and Measures
Laboratory administers legislation concerned
with standards and measuring equipment for
use in trade. New European Community
directives on measuring instruments, which
will replace national legislation by 1992, will
ensure free circulation of approved
equipment within the Community.
Industrial Awards
The Queen’s Awards for Export and
Technology recognise outstanding industrial
performance in their respective fields.
Awarded annually, they last for five years
and are granted by the Queen on the advice
of the Prime Minister, assisted by an
Advisory Committee, which includes senior
representatives from industry, commerce and
the trade unions. Any self-contained
‘industrial unit’ in Britain is eligible to apply,
regardless of size, if it meets the scheme’s
criteria.
Other awards include the Export Award
for Smaller Businesses (for firms employing
fewer than 200 people) and the MacRobert
Award, the major award for engineering in
Britain made by the Fellowship of
Engineering for successful technological
innovation.
REGIONAL INDUSTRIAL
DEVELOPMENT
Regional industrial policy is designed to
encourage enterprise and economic growth in
all areas of Britain. In some areas, however,
where additional help is needed, it is
provided under the DTTs Enterprise
Initiative. Help is focused on the Assisted
Areas (Development Areas and Intermediate
Areas), which cover 35 per cent of Britain’s
working population (see map).
The principal instruments are:
• regional selective assistance, available
throughout the Assisted Areas, for
investment projects undertaken by firms
meeting certain criteria; and
• Regional Enterprise Grants, available in
Development Areas and other areas
covered by European Community
schemes to support investment and
innovation in firms with fewer than 25
employees.
England
The English Industrial Estates Corporation
makes available industrial and commercial
premises in certain parts of the Assisted
Areas in England where private sector
provision is insufficient.
The Rural Development Commission is
responsible for advising the Government on
issues affecting rural England and for
promoting its economic and social
development. It provides small factories and

workshops which are built and managed by
English Estates, and administers a grant
scheme for the conversion of redundant
buildings to industrial or commercial
premises. The Commission provides
technical, management and financial advice;
and training facilities and loans to small
businesses. It also supports voluntary bodies
in rural areas to encourage community
activity and self-help and provides finance
for small-scale rural housing and transport
schemes. The Commission’s resources are
concentrated in the areas of greatest need,
known as Rural Development Areas.
Scotland
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise provide a wide range of
support to industry and commerce, in
lowland and highland Scotland respectively,
operating mainly through a network of
private-sector-led Local Enterprise
Companies. They encourage investment in
the development of skills throughout the
workforce and invest directly in training,
particularly for school-leavers and the long¬
term unemployed. Offering a range of
advisory and training services to businesses
to enhance the expertise of managers, the
two bodies seek to ensure that the flow of
sites, factories and investment funding for
businesses in the private sector is adequate.
Where necessary they contribute financially
to such provision. They also remove
obstacles to economic development through
the treatment of derelict land and by
contributing to tackling deficiencies in the
physical environment and infrastructure of
towns and cities. The development
corporations of the five Scottish new towns
contribute to the development of existing
and new businesses and the attraction of
companies to Scotland.
Wales
The Welsh Development Agency promotes
industrial development in Wales by
encouraging investment by overseas
companies. It makes available equity and loan
capital for industrial projects with maximum
private sector participation. In addition, it
provides government factories and has
powers to assist small firms, promote new
technology and undertake land reclamation
and urban renewal.
The Development Board for Rural Wales
provides factories, key worker housing and
advice for small businesses. It has a general
responsibility to promote the economic and
social well-being of mid-Wales and a
particular responsibility for the new town of
Newtown, Powys.
Northern Ireland
The Industrial Development Board (IDB)
offers incentives for the introduction and
development of internationally competitive
companies in the manufacturing and service
sectors in Northern Ireland. IDB helps
companies with marketing, exporting,
product development and design, improved
productivity and quality practices. Its full
range of assistance is available to those
companies with the greatest development
potential and prospect of long-term
competitive growth. Where appropriate, this
assistance includes capital grants, revenue
grants, loans and share capital investment.
The IDB also offers stocks of land and
industrial premises for purchase or lease.
Other forms of help include:
• training grants;
• exemption from local taxes for
manufacturing premises; and
• grants to attract and retain good
management.
Similar help is available to firms with
fewer than 50 employees from the Local
Enterprise Development Unit.
European Community Regional Policy
and Aid
The European Community seeks to reduce
disparities between its regions. The
principal responsibility for helping less
prosperous areas remains with national
authorities, but the Community may
complement schemes through aid from a
number of sources.
229
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
European Regional Development Fund
The European Regional Development Fund,
the largest of the European Community’s
structural funds, is intended to help redress
the principal regional imbalances. Its budget
for 1991-92 is £4,686 million, 10 per cent of
which has been allocated to Britain.
European Investment Bank
European Community member states
subscribe to the capital of the European
Investment Bank, which aims to:
• facilitate development in less developed
regions;
• modernise or convert undertakings; and
• help to create new economic activities.
The Bank also helps to Finance projects of
common interest to several member states.
The Channel Tunnel is one such project
currently being assisted in Britain.
Coal and Steel
The European Community makes loans and
grants to encourage rational distribution of
production and a high level of productivity
in the coal and steel industries while
safeguarding employment and avoiding
unfair competition.
Schemes eligible for aid are coal industry
projects, projects to create new activities in
coal and steel areas, construction of housing
for workers, allowances for redeployed
workers, and research, including research of
a social or medical nature.
Functioning and Regulation
of Markets
While preferring to let markets operate as
freely as possible, the Government recognises
that action may be needed to ensure that
markets are open and fair. The Government
therefore seeks to control restrictive or anti¬
competitive practices.
Within the public sector the Government
has taken a number of steps to increase
competition, notably through privatisation
(see p 225). The DTFs Deregulation Unit
seeks to reduce regulations which inhibit
competition, innovation or consumer choice
(see p 225).
COMPETITION POLICY
The Government scrutinises and regulates
monopolies, mergers, anti-competitive
practices, restrictive trade practices, and
resale price maintenance.
The Government is taking measures to
increase competition in professional services
by tackling restrictive practices. For instance,
the opticians’ monopoly on the dispensing of
spectacles and the solicitors’ monopoly on
conveyancing have been ended. Certain
professional groups (for example,
accountants, solicitors, veterinary surgeons,
stockbrokers, doctors, dentists and surveyors)
have eased the restrictions on advertising by
their members, and rules on fee scales have
been made more liberal in a number of areas.
Building societies are now allowed to offer a
greater range of services. Legislation also
provides greater competition in the provision
of legal services (see p 110).
Monopolies
The Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry and the Director General of Fair
Trading can refer monopolies for
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, an independent body. Its
members are drawn from a variety of
backgrounds and include lawyers,
economists, industrialists and trade unionists.
The legislation defines a monopoly as a
situation in which at least a quarter of a
particular kind of product or service is
supplied by a single person or a group of
connected companies or by two or more
people acting in a way which prevents,
restricts, or distorts competition. The market ;
definition of a monopoly can relate to all of
Britain or part of it.

operates against the public interest, the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
has powers to take action to remedy this.

INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
asked to negotiate undertakings to remedy
the adverse effects identified by the
Commission.
Mergers
The Government believes that the market is,
in most cases, the best judge of the
advantages and disadvantages of mergers.
The great majority of mergers which do not
pose a threat to competition are therefore
decided by the market. However, under the
Fair Trading Act 1973, the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry can refer
mergers for investigation by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission if they could lead
to a significant reduction in competition or
otherwise raise matters of public concern.
A merger is defined as occurring when
two or more enterprises are brought under
common ownership or control. A merger
qualifies for investigation by the Commission
where:
• an existing market share of 25 per cent
or more is increased; or
• the total value of gross assets to be taken
over exceeds £30 million.
After considering advice from the
Director General of Fair Trading, the
Secretary of State may refer a merger or
proposed merger to the Commission. The
primary criterion of the Government’s
reference policy is the possible effects on
competition. To preserve competition in a
free market, the Secretary of State takes
account of the degree of state ownership of a
prospective acquiring enterprise, whether
British or foreign. If the Commission finds
that a merger or proposed merger may be
expected to operate against the public
interest, the Secretary of State can prevent it
by making a statutory order. Alternatively,
the Director General may be asked to obtain
suitable undertakings from the companies
involved to remedy the adverse effects
identified. If the merger has already taken
place, the Secretary of State can take similar
action to reverse it. There are special
provisions for newspaper and water company
mergers.
The Companies Act 1989 made changes
to improve merger control procedure. This
provided for:
• a voluntary procedure for pre¬
notification of proposed mergers which,
for the majority of cases, permits prompt
clearance;
• the acceptance of statutory undertakings
by the parties concerned in order to
obviate the need for a full investigation
by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in certain cases; and
• the temporary prohibition on reciprocal
share dealing by the parties to a merger
referred to the Commission.
The Secretary of State has powers to refer
to the Commission any questions concerning
the efficiency and costs of the service
provided by, or the possible abuse of a
monopoly situation by, certain bodies in the
public sector. The results of inquiries are
reported to Parliament.
Anti-competitive Practices
The Director General of Fair Trading can,
with limited exceptions, investigate any
business practice which appears anti¬
competitive. If the Director General
concludes that a practice is anti-competitive,
an undertaking may be sought from the
business responsible for the practice; if this
is not given, the matter may be referred to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to
establish whether it operates against the
public interest. In the case of an adverse
finding by the Commission, the Secretary of
State has powers to take remedial action.
Restrictive Trade Practices
Certain kinds of commercial agreements
containing restrictions on matters such as
prices or conditions of sale have to be
notified to the Director General of Fair
Trading for registration. Failure to register
an agreement within the required period
means that the restrictions are void and
unenforceable and the parties may be liable
to legal proceedings.
Once an agreement has been registered,
the Director General is under a general duty
231
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to refer it to the Restrictive Practices Court.
In practice, however, the great majority of
agreements never reach the Court because,
for example, the parties elect to give up the
restrictions rather than go to court, or the
Secretary of State accepts the Director
General’s advice that the restrictions are not
significant enough to warrant reference to
the Court.
If an agreement goes to the Court, it must
declare the restrictions contrary to the public
interest unless the parties can satisfy the
Court that this is not the case. Restrictions
declared contrary to the public interest by
the Court are void, the Court having the
power to order the parties not to give effect
to them.
In 1989 the Government published a White
Paper which set out proposals to amend the
existing legislation and make it more effective
in the detection and investigation of restrictive
agreements, particularly price-fixing and
market-sharing cartels.
Retail Price Maintenance
It is now unlawful for suppliers to notify
dealers of a minimum resale price for their
goods or to make it a condition of supply
that their goods must not be sold below a
specified price. With some exceptions, it is
also unlawful for suppliers to seek to impose
minimum resale prices by withholding
supplies of goods or discriminating in other
ways. The Director General of Fair Trading,
or anyone affected, can take proceedings
against such actions in the civil courts.
Financial Services
Legislation has been passed to offer greater
protection to investors.The Securities and
Investments Board (see p 351) is empowered
to set out general principles governing the
conduct of investment business.
Under the Financial Services Act 1986,
the Director General of Fair Trading is able
to consider the effects on competition of the
rules and practices of the various regulatory
bodies operating under the Act. Where a
significant or potentially significant effect has
been identified, a report is made to the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. If
the Secretary of State agrees with this view
and does not consider that the provisions are
necessary for the protection of investors, he
or she may refuse or revoke recognition of
the organisation or require it to make
alterations to its provisions.
European Community
European Community rules provide for free
and fair competition in trade between
member states. In most areas of economic
activity the enforcement of these rules is
primarily the responsibility of the European
Commission, which has powers to investigate
and terminate alleged infringements and to
impose fines.
The Treaty of Rome prohibits agreements
or concerted practices which affect trade
between member states and which prevent,
restrict or distort competition within the
common market. Agreements meeting
specified criteria may be exempted from this
prohibition either individually or by category
of agreement. The latter include certain
agreements in exclusive distribution and
exclusive purchasing, franchising, co¬
operative research and development,
specialisation, patent licensing, and air
services within the Community.
The Treaty also prohibits any abuse of a
dominant position within the common
market or a substantial part of it if this
affects trade between member states.
In 1990 a Community regulation on the
control of mergers came into force. Large
mergers with a Community dimension,
which are assessed by reference to turnover,
are normally under the exclusive jurisdiction
of the European Commission. The
Commission can prohibit them if it considers
that they create or strengthen a dominant
position which would significantly impede
effective competition within the common
market.
Consumer Protection
The Government believes that consumers are
best protected by open and competitive
markets offering the widest range of choice
232
INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE
in goods and services, backed by adequate
information. There are, however, laws to
ensure that consumers are adequately
protected.
Legislation covers the sale of goods, the
supply of goods and services, and the way
that goods and services are described. The
marking and accuracy of quantities are
regulated by weights and measures
legislation. The Food Safety Act 1990
contains measures to improve food safety and
to protect consumers; these include tougher
penalties and better enforcement powers.
Another law provides for the control of
medical products, and certain other
substances and articles, through a system of
licences and certificates. Under European
Community legislation, it is a criminal
offence to supply unsafe consumer products.
The Director General of Fair Trading can
make recommendations to the Government
for legislation to put a stop to trading
practices that unfairly affect consumers’
interests. He or she can also take action
against persistent offenders of existing law.
Under the Fair Trading Act 1973, the
Director General has a duty to encourage
trade associations to prepare and circulate to
their members codes of practice aimed at
raising trading standards.
The Director General is responsible for
the operation of legislation regulating
consumer credit and hire business and estate
agency work. He or she also has certain
responsibilities under legislation for
controlling misleading advertisements.
The European Community’s consumer
programme covers a number of important
activities, such as health and safety,
protection of the consumer’s economic
interests, promotion of consumer education
and strengthening the representation of
consumers. The views of British consumer
organisations are represented in Europe by
the Consumers in the European Community
Group (UK).
Consumer Advice and Information
Advice and information on consumer matters
is provided by Citizens Advice Bureaux, the
trading standards or consumer protection
departments of local authorities, and, in
some areas, by specialist Consumer Advice
Centres.
The independent, non-statutory National
Consumer Council (and the associated
councils for Scotland and Wales), which
receives government finance, presents the
consumer’s view to government, industry
and others. The General Consumer Council
for Northern Ireland has wide-ranging
responsibilities in consumer protection and
consumer affairs in general.
Consumer bodies for the rail and certain
other nationalised industries and privatised
industries investigate questions of concern to
the consumer. Some trade associations in
industry and commerce have established
codes of practice. In addition, several private
organisations work to further consumer
interests. The largest is the Consumers’
Association, funded by the subscriptions of
around 900,000 members.
Company Law
All British companies are registered with the
Registrar of Companies in Cardiff,
Edinburgh or Belfast, depending on whether
a company’s registered office is in England
or Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.
Legislation deals with capital structure, the
rights and duties of directors and members,
and the preparation and filing of accounts.
Most corporate businesses are ‘limited
liability’ companies. The liability of members
of a limited company is limited to
contributing an amount related to their
shareholding. In the case of unincorporated
businesses, such as sole proprietorships or
partnerships, individuals are personally liable
for any business debts (except where a
member of a partnership is a limited liability
company).
Companies may be either public or
private. A company must satisfy three
conditions before it can be a public limited
company (pic). It must:
• be limited by shares and have a share
capital;
• state in its memorandum of association
that it is to be a public limited company;
and
_
233
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• meet specified minimum capital
requirements.
All other British companies are private
companies and are generally prohibited
from offering their shares to the public.
Companies with a place of business in
Britain, but which are incorporated
overseas, are also required to register.
Laws relating to companies are designed
to meet the need for proper regulation of
business, secure open markets and create
greater safeguards for those wishing to
invest in companies or do business with
them. They implement European
Community directives dealing with
company laws, and company and group
accounts and their auditing. In addition,
they permit the implementation of policy
changes designed to reduce burdens on
business, to strengthen rules on the
disclosure of interest in shares, and to
strengthen powers to investigate
companies.
Insider dealing in shares is a criminal
offence. Inspectors may be appointed to
investigate possible insider dealing.
In England, Wales and Scotland there is
a licensing procedure to ensure the
professional competence, integrity and
independence of people who act as trustees
of bankrupt individuals, or as liquidators,
receivers or administrators of insolvent
companies.
The Serious Fraud Office investigates
and prosecutes cases of fraud in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
Legislation exists to secure the rights of the
originators of inventions, new industrial
designs and trade marks. These matters are
administered by the Patent Office, which
includes the Design Registry and the Trade
Marks Registry. The Patent Office is an
executive agency of the DTI. Protection is
also available under the European Patent Con¬
vention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty.
Benefits may be claimed in other countries
by virtue of the International Convention for
the Protection of Industrial Property.
The Government supports innovation by
protecting the ownership of ideas through
patents, registered designs, trade marks and
copyright. Recent measures include:
• a sharp increase in penalties for making
and trading in pirate sound and film
recordings (including video);
• the extension of copyright protection to
owners of computer software;
• the widening of the law on trade marks
to embrace services;
• the introduction of powers for customs
authorities to prevent the entry of
counterfeit goods;
• the introduction of a new form of
protection for designs; and
• new laws to protect performers.
In 1990 the Government published a
White Paper which proposed changes
designed to modernise and simplify existing
trade marks law, and to make trade mark
registration and protection easier.

13 Manufacturing Industry
Manufacturing accounted for 22 per cent of
gross domestic product (GDP) in 1990 and
for about the same percentage of
employment. Over 80 per cent of visible
exports consisted of manufactured or semi¬
manufactured goods. Almost all
manufacturing is carried out by private
businesses.
Structure
The ten largest manufacturing concerns (bv
^million of turnover in the latest financial
year) are BAT Industries (13,311), Imperial
Chemical Industries (13,171), Grand
Metropolitan (9,298), British Aerospace
(9,085), Unilever (7,419), Hanson Trust
(6,998), Ford Motor Company (6,732)
General Electric Company (GEC) (5,878),
British Steel (5,113) and Smithkline
Beecham (4,897).
Growth
In 1990 manufacturing output was 18 per
cent higher than in 1985 (see Table 13.2).
Net manufacturing profitability, in terms of
the rate of return on capital employed, rose
steadily in the 1980s. Manufacturing
employment in Great Britain fell from 7-1
million in 1979 to 5-8 million in 1982; in
1990 it was 4 9 million. Productivity rose
until the late 1980s and has since stabilised.
Although there was a slight decline in
manufacturing output in 1990, output in
some industries, such as aerospace and other
transport equipment, and paper, printing and
publishing, continued to rise (see Table
13.2). In terms of constant (1985) prices,
fixed investment in manufacturing reached
£12,142 million in 1990. Total fixed capital
expenditure in manufacturing at current
prices was £14,800 million in 1990,

comprising £11,699 million in plant and
machinery, £2,233 million in new building
work and £877 million in vehicles
(investment by sector is shown in Table
13.3).
The underlying level of exports of
manufactured goods has risen in volume
terms. On the basis of overseas trade
statistics, the index stood at 142-4 in 1990
(1985 = 100). Manufacturing exports rose
to nearly £84,470 million in 1990.
Among the leading exports in 1990
were:
• machinery and other transport
equipment (£42,200 million);
• chemicals (£13,200 million);
• consumer goods, including passenger
cars (£12,900 million); and
• metal manufacturing and mineral
products (£7,300 million).
Import volumes of manufactured goods
rose strongly in the 1980s, with the index
reaching 153-9 in 1990 (1985 = 100).
Imports were valued at £98,190 million
in 1990.
High-technology Industries
The high-technology manufacturing
industries in Britain—electrical, electronic
and instrument engineering, chemicals and
aerospace—include industries with the
highest levels of research and development
spending in relation to their gross output.
Most of the electrical and electronic
industries—office machinery, electronic
data-processing equipment, basic electrical
equipment, telecommunications equipment,
electric instruments and control systems,
radio and electronic capital goods, and
components—are included. Instrument
engineering includes precision equipment for
measuring and checking, plus medical,
optical, photographic and filming equipment.
High-technology chemicals include
specialised organics, plastics materials,
synthetic resins, synthetic rubbers and
pharmaceuticals. Aerospace production as a
whole is defined as high-technology. All
these industries have continued their
growth, with levels of output, productivity
and exports above the average for
manufacturing.
236
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY
Take-up of Advanced Technology
Computer technology is now commonplace
in British production. Of 21,000
engineering sites, 55 per cent use
computers for some aspect of
manufacturing management. When sites
with more than 50 employees are
considered in isolation the proportion rises
to over 80 per cent. Some 51 per cent of
12,300 design sites use computer aided
design (CAD), while 25 per cent of 14,900
sites with machine tools use computer
aided manufacturing (CAM). About
131,000 computers valued at £2,225 million
were in use in the engineering sector in
1990 and firms reported that expenditure
on computer hardware, software and
services was planned to reach £935 million
during 1991. Many British concerns are
also making use of advanced materials,
such as carbon fibre composites in the
aerospace industry, new types of plastics in
the automotive sector and high-fibre,
cholesterol-free protein in food production.
In the traditional branches of heavy
industry, further rationalisation continues
to raise productivity. There has been a
substantial increase in the use of robots in
manufacturing industry since the mid-1980s;
advanced robots function in conditions too
hazardous for human operators, such as
certain areas of mining, nuclear engineering
and firefighting. The widespread adoption of
Advanced Manufacturing Techniques
(AMT) has also enabled the motor vehicle
industry to become more efficient.
The Government provides financial
assistance to companies and research
organisations seeking to develop and improve
the technologies needed by industry. It has,
for example, made available resources to
encourage and assist companies to take
advantage of the emerging technologies of
multi-vendor computer communications and
exchange of data.
Sectors of Manufacturing
Relative sizes of the various branches of
manufacturing are shown in the first
columns of Tables 13.2 and 13.3. Table 13.3
also shows employment and investment
levels in each sector. A more detailed

BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Mineral and Metal Products
Iron and Steel Products
Britain is the world’s tenth largest steel-
producing nation. British producers delivered
16-1 million tonnes of finished steel in 1990,
of which 60 per cent was sold on the home
market and the remainder exported. The
steel industry has operated a balance of
payments surplus since 1983. The major
areas of steel production are Wales, northern
and eastern England, and Scotland, with
substantial re-rolling and further processing
in the Midlands.
British Steel pic is the fourth largest steel
company in the Western world, producing
78 per cent of Britain’s crude steel. British
Steel’s output is based on strip products,
plate, heavy sections, tubes and stainless
items. Its products are used principally in
the packaging, construction, automotive,
engineering, transport, metal goods and
energy industries.
Forty other steel-producing firms,
represented bv the British Independent Steel
Producers’ Association, manufacture
engineering and other special steels, wire
rod, wire and wire products, reinforcements
for use in the construction industry, and
other more specialised goods. They are
responsible for about 35 per cent by value of
total British steel deliveries.
The industry has achieved significant
advances in operational and cost efficiency
over the past decade as a result of extensive
rationalisation, investment in modern plant
and continuous improvement of operating
performance. Product ranges have been
extended and product quality enhanced to
meet home and export requirements. Exports
have increased appreciably, particularly to
the rest of the European Community.
Non-ferrous Metals
Output of non-ferrous metals and their alloys
in 1990 included primary aluminium, of
which nearly 300,000 tonnes were delivered,
and secondary aluminium, of which over
120,000 tonnes were delivered. Britain
produced over 120,000 tonnes of unwrought
copper and over 450,000 tonnes of copper
and copper alloy semi-manufactures. Primary
metal production relies mainly on imported
ores, concentrates and partially refined metal.
Recycled metal plays an important part in
raw material supply.
Britain is a major producer of specialised
alloys for high-technology requirements in
the aerospace, electronic, petrochemical, and
nuclear and other fuel industries. Titanium
and titanium alloys are used in aircraft
production, power generation and North Sea
oil production, and nickel alloys for aero¬
engines operating in high-temperature
environments.
In recent years considerable progress has
been made in the development of
‘superplastic’ alloys, which are more ductile
and elastic than conventional alloys.
Aluminium lithium, developed by British
Alcan Aluminium, is ideal for use in aircraft,
being lighter, stronger and stiffer than
normal aluminium. Nearly half of the
industry is situated in the Midlands and
Wales.

MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY
Ceramics
The ceramics industry manufactures clay
products, including domestic pottery,
sanitaryware and tiles, and clay pipes for the
building trade. Total sales of ceramic goods
in 1990 were £1,189 million. Domestic
pottery, which includes the manufacture of
china, earthenware and stoneware, accounted
for over 22 per cent of the industry’s output.
Tableware is produced in Stoke-on-Trent,
and Britain is the world’s leading
manufacturer and major exporter of fine
bone china.
Research is being conducted into ceramics
for use in housebuilding and diesel and jet
engines. Important industrial ceramics
invented in Britain include silicon carbides
developed by the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority and sialons developed at
the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.
Other Mineral Products
Glass-reinforced cement composites for the
construction industry were invented in
Britain in the early 1970s and are
manufactured under licence in over 40
countries.
Flat glass is manufactured through the
float glass process, which was developed by
Pilkington Brothers and licensed to
glassmakers throughout the world. Pilkington
has also produced an energy-saving window
glass which reflects room heat without
impairing visibility. Export sales of flat glass
principal products amounted to £394 million
in 1990.
Britain is the world’s biggest exporter of
china clay (kaolin). In 1990 some 2 5 million
tonnes, valued at £183 million, were sold
overseas. The main company involved is
English China Clays.
Chemicals and Synthetic Fibres
Britain’s chemicals industry is the third
largest in Western Europe and the fifth
largest in the Western world. Nearly half of
its production of principal products is
exported; in 1990 it had a trade surplus of
more than £2,300 million. The most rapid
growth in recent years has been in speciality
chemicals, especially pharmaceuticals,
pesticides and cosmetics. Imperial Chemical
Industries (ICI) accounts for a substantial
part of the industry’s production and is the
fourth largest chemicals company in the
world. Traditionally Britain has been a major
producer of basic industrial chemicals, such
as inorganic and basic organic chemicals,
plastics and fertilisers. Sales of principal
fertiliser products reached £1,136 million in
1990.
Chemicals
Sales of the principal products of organic
chemicals amounted to £6,439 million in
1990 and those of miscellaneous chemicals
for industrial use were £2,782 million; the
surplus on overseas trade in the latter sector
was nearly £545 million.
A large proportion of world research and
development in agrochemicals is conducted
in Britain. Notable recent British discoveries
include pyrethroid insecticides, Id’s diquat
and paraquat herbicides, systemic fungicides
and aphicides, genetically engineered
microbial pesticides and methods of
encouraging natural parasites against
common pests in horticulture.
Exports of cosmetics, toiletries and
perfumery in 1990 were £572 million,
compared with imports of £355 million.
Total sales amounted to £2,380 million.
Much of inorganic chemicals production
consists of relatively simple bulk chemicals,
such as sulphuric acid and metallic and non-
metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for
industry. The most important products sold
in the organic chemicals range (by weight)
are ethylene (IT million tonnes produced in
1990), benzene (489,000 tonnes) and
propylene (464,000 tonnes). Exports of
organic chemicals amounted to £715 million.
Plastics
About one-third of semi-manufactured
plastics production is exported. Expansion in
recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic
materials, of which the most important are
polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene

and polypropylene. Total sales of plastics
packaging products, valued at £2,240 million
in 1990, were largely accounted for by the
home market. With up to three times the
strength but only 20 per cent of the weight
of steel, these plastics are used in aircraft and
vehicle manufacture. ICI has produced the
world’s first biodegradable thermoplastic,
Biopol, which is used as a slow release agent
for drugs and herbicides and for making
non-polluting bottles and films. Synthetic
rubbers in large-scale production include
butadiene-based neoprene for tyres, high-
styrene for shoe soles and flooring, and oil-
resistant nitrile rubbers. Plastics are fast
replacing traditional packaging materials such
as paper, tin and glass.
ICI is the world’s largest paint
manufacturer. Specialised products include
new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments,
powder coatings, non-drip and quick-drying
paints and paints needing only one top coat.
Two recent innovations have been solid
emulsion paint and a temporary water-based
finish which can be removed easily by
chemical treatment, for vehicle bodies and
road markings. Sales of principal paint and
varnish products were £1,870 million in
1990.
Pharmaceuticals
The pharmaceutical industry in Britain
includes some of the world’s largest
multinational research-intensive
manufacturers, as well as middle-sized and
smaller specialist companies, with a total
gross output in 1990 of around £6,700
million. Pharmaceutical exports were valued
at £2,258 million; the industry’s trade
surplus of £955 million was the second
largest of all manufacturing sectors.
Employing over 70,000 people directly, it
supports employment for 250,000 others in
related activities.
The pharmaceutical industry invested
more than £1,000 million in research and
development in 1990. This sum amounts to
more than 14 per cent of British
manufacturing industry’s research and
development, representing about 8 per cent
of total world expenditure on medicines
research. Progress in pharmaceutical research
has helped to reduce dramatically the impact
of diseases such as polio, tuberculosis,
diphtheria and measles.
British firms make four of the world’s
ten best-selling medicines.
Glaxo’s ulcer treatment Zantac and Id’s
beta-blocker Tenormin, for treating high
blood pressure, are the first and sixth best¬
selling medicines in the world. The United
States subsidiary of Britain’s Wellcome
Foundation developed Retrovir (also called
Zidovudine), the first treatment for HIV
infection to gain government approval, as
well as Zovirax, the first routine treatment
for the herpes group of viruses. Other recent
major developments pioneered in Britain are
semi-synthetic penicillins and cephalosporins,
both powerful antibiotics, and new
treatments for asthma, arthritis and coronary
heart disease.
In biotechnology, Britain has made major
advances in the development of human
insulin, genetically-engineered vaccines and
240
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY
the production of antibiotics by fermentation.
The British company Celltech was the first
licensed by the United States Food and
Drug Administration for the large-scale
production of monoclonal antibodies,
proteins which can seek out a particular
substance. They are used to diagnose
diseases, identify different blood types and
can be used in the treatment of a range of
conditions, including cancer.
Britain leads in the development of
molecular graphics, which contribute to the
rational design of new and improved
medicines through a computer-aided
'technique for analysing the structures of
: complicated organic molecules on a visual
display unit.
Fibres
The main types of synthetic fibre are still
those first developed: regenerated cellulosic
fibres such as viscose, and the major
synthetic fibres such as nylon polyamide,
polyester and acrylics. Extensive research
continues to produce a wide variety of
innovative products with characteristics
designed to meet market needs, such as
antistatic and flame-retardant fibres. More
specialist products include the aramids (with
very high thermal stability and strength),
elastanes (giving very high stretch and
recovery) and melded fabrics (produced
without the need for knitting or weaving).
Special acrylic fibre (SAF) is now being
made for use in carbon fibre manufacturing.
Mechanical Engineering and
Metal Goods
Exports of mechanical machinery
amounted to about 14 per cent of all
visible exports in 1990. Output includes
pressure vessels, heat exchangers and
storage tanks for chemical and oil-refining
(process) plant, steam-raising boilers
(including those of high capacity for power
stations), nuclear reactors, water and
sewage treatment plant, and fabricated
steelwork for bridges, buildings and
industrial installations.
Britain is among the Western world’s
largest producers of tractors, which make
up over three-quarters of the country’s
total output of agricultural equipment.
Sales of the principal products of the
tractor industry were more than £1,300
million in 1990, of which about £1,057
million was accounted for by overseas
sales. Recent technical innovations include
computer-controlled tractors, a highly
efficient pesticide sprayer and combined
mower/conditioners that significantly
reduce the drying time for grass. Much of
the new machinery is designed for use in a
variety of conditions to meet the needs of
overseas farmers. The Royal International
Agricultural Exhibition, held annually near
Coventry, has a specialised tropical
machinery centre, where demonstrations of
such machinery are given.
With almost all of Britain’s machine
tools purchased by the engineering,

vehicles and metal goods industries, the
demand for computerised, numerically-
controlled machine tools and flexible
manufacturing systems has grown.
Britain is the world’s seventh largest
producer of machine tools. Total sales of
metal-working machine tools reached
£960 million in 1990, of which some 50
per cent were exports. British technology
leads in probes, sensors, co-ordinate
measuring devices, laser melting and the
installation of flexible manufacturing
systems. Computer numerical-controlled
machines now account for 40 per cent of
output.
In 1990 most sales of textile machinery
were to export markets. Recent British
innovations include computerised colour
matching and weave simulation, friction
spinning, high-speed computer-controlled
knitting machines and electronic jacquard
attachments for weaving looms.
Overseas sales of mining machinery
and tunnelling equipment are substantial.
J.C. Bamford is the world’s leading
manufacturer of backhoe loaders and
telescopic handlers, of which 65 per cent
are exported. Britain’s mining equipment
industry leads in the production of coal¬
cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports,
conveying equipment, flameproof
transformers, switchgear, and subsurface
transport equipment and control systems.
The mechanical handling equipment
industry produces cranes and
transporters, lifting devices, escalators,
conveyors, powered industrial trucks and
air bridges, as well as electronically
controlled and automatic handling
systems. Britain is also a major producer
of industrial engines, pumps, valves and
compressors, and of pneumatic and
hydraulic equipment.
Despite an overall decline in the
castings industry, some foundries have
been investing in new melting, moulding
and quality control equipment. Cosworth
Engineering, for example, has developed a
high-quality aluminium casting process to
produce cylinder heads for Mercedes-
Benz and Ford cars.
Electrical, Electronic and Instrument
Engineering
Output by this group of industries continues
to grow, with sales of the principal products
of basic electrical equipment reaching £1,825
million in 1990. Sales of electronic data-
processing equipment rose by more than half
between 1985 and 1990, reaching £7,719
million.
Computers
This sector produces an extensive range of
systems, central processors and peripheral
equipment, from large computers for large-
scale data-processing and scientific work to
mini- and microcomputers for control and
automation systems and for home,
educational and office use. Total billings by
companies for computer services rose by
£500 million compared with 1989 to reach
£3,560 million in 1990. The largest
components of these billings were for
software and related services, worth £1,468
million, and for bureau services, valued at
£813 million. Total sales of home computers
amounted to £245 million in 1990. Amstrad
is Britain’s largest personal computer
manufacturer, whose products are aimed at
the mass market.
Sales of microcomputers other than home
computers reached £750 million in 1990,
while total export sales of data-processing
equipment amounted to £5,554 million.
Several leading overseas manufacturers of
data-processing equipment—for example,
IBM, Unisys, Compaq and Seiko—have
established manufacturing plants in Britain.
Other companies have concentrated on
developing new products for specialised
markets. For example, the transputer,
produced by Inmos, is effectively a computer 1
on a single chip, which can be combined
with hundreds of others in parallel to form a
machine as powerful as existing
‘supercomputers’ but at less than a quarter
of their price. British firms and research
organisations, with government support, are
also heavily involved in the development and
application of the new family of ‘three-five’
semiconductor materials, such as gallium

Communications Equipment
Britain’s main communications products are
switching and transmission equipment,
telephones and terminals, with BT (formerly
British Telecom) the main customer for
communications network equipment.
Mercury Communications is licensed to
compete with BT in the provision of
network services, while the market for
terminals and telephones has been fully
liberalised. Innovative work is being
stimulated by the expansion of cable
television and the growth in value added
network services. There was rapid expansion
in the market for cellular telephones in the
second half of the 1980s, with sales peaking
in 1989 at £144 million, although they
declined in 1990 to £127 million.
Transmission equipment and cables for
telecommunications and information
networks include submarine and high-
specification data-carrying cables. Supported
by a technically advanced cable industry, BT
has led in the development of optical fibre
communications systems and has paved the
way for simpler and cheaper optical cables by
laying the first non-repeatered cable over 100
km (62 miles) long, and by developing the
first all-optical repeater. More than half of
the world’s undersea communications cables
have been made and laid by STC Submarine
Systems, which, with its United States and
French partners, completed the laying of the
first transatlantic optical fibre cable, TAT 8,
in 1988. Britain also has a world lead in the
transmission of computerised data along
telephone lines for reproduction on television
screens. Export sales of telegraph and
telephone apparatus and equipment by
British firms almost doubled between 1985
(£242 million) and 1990 (£478 million).
Another expanding sector of the industry
manufactures radio communications
equipment, radar, radio and sonar
navigational aids for ships and aircraft,
thermal imaging systems, alarms and
signalling equipment, public broadcasting
equipment and other capital goods. Radar
was invented in Britain and British firms are
still in the forefront of technical advances.
Racal Avionics’ X-band radar can distinguish
different types of aircraft flying at very low
altitude and is in use at airports in several
countries. Cable and Wireless’s submarine
cable-laying robot ‘CIRRUS’ can work at
depths of up to 1 km (3,280 ft) controlled
entirely by a computer on its mother ship.
Other Electronic Equipment
A range of electronic measurement and test
equipment is made in Britain, as well as
analytical instruments. Production of process
control equipment is expanding, as is the
manufacture of numerical control and
indication equipment for use in machine
tools. British companies lead in several types
of advanced electronic medical equipment,
such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a
technique which enables internal examination
of large body areas without recourse to
surgery or potentially harmful radiation.
243
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British companies such as GEC and
Oxford Instruments also produce other
advanced electronic medical equipment,
including ultrasound scanners,
electromyography systems and patient
monitoring systems for intensive and
coronary care and other uses.
The indigenous electronics components
industry is supplemented by subsidiaries of
several large overseas companies. An area of
very rapid change in which Britain is
particularly strong is the manufacture of
advanced components, such as integrated
circuits.
Electrical Engineering and Appliances
Making extensive use of advanced
technologies, the electrical engineering
industry manufactures products for the
electricity supply sector, including power
plant, cable transformers and switchgear, as
well as lighting, plugs and sockets. The
domestic electrical appliance sector is
dominated by a few large firms. The major
electronic consumer goods produced are
radio and television sets, and high-fidelity
audio and video equipment. In the audio
field British manufacturers have a reputation
for high-quality goods but are less strong in
the mass market.
The instrument engineering industry
produces measuring, photographic,
cinematographic and reprographic
equipment; watches, clocks and other timing
devices; and medical and surgical
instruments. Its precision instrument and
medical branches both earn significant and
growing export surpluses, but the sector as a
whole is contracting.
Motor Vehicles and Other Transport
Equipment (excluding Aerospace)
A total of 2,302,400 new cars and
commercial vehicles were sold in 1990. Car
output is dominated by five groups,
accounting for 99 per cent of the total:
Rover, Ford (including Jaguar), Vauxhall,
Peugeot-Talbot and Nissan. The remainder
is in the hands of smaller, specialist
producers such as Rolls-Royce, whose cars
are renowned for their quality and
durability.
Despite falling domestic demand, British
car manufacturers have been able to
maintain production levels due to
substantial exports over the past year.
Recent inward investment projects by
Nissan, Honda and Toyota will lead to
increased production and employment in
the sector by the mid-1990s.
Ranked as one of the most important
industries in Britain, the motor components
industry consists of over 2,000 companies
employing 120,000 people. A period of
major change has accompanied the arrival
of the three major Japanese assemblers.
The established motor manufacturers are
undergoing restructuring to respond to this
new situation. The production of motor
cycles is set to rise with the return of
Triumph to the market. Sales of pedal
cycles came to £l-25 million in 1990.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
Britain has a long tradition of shipbuilding
and remains active in the construction,
conversion and repair of merchant vessels,
warships and offshore structures. The

largest sector is the building of warships. As
well as meeting all the needs of the Royal
Navy, the warship yards build and convert
ships for overseas governments.
British yards build some of the most
sophisticated merchant vessels in the world,
including gas carriers, cross-Channel
superferries and offshore support and
research vessels, as well as more traditional
■ ships and craft for the leisure market. The
Shipbuilders and Ship Repairers Association
estimates that orders taken by British
merchant shipbuilders for the construction of
vessels were around £120 million in 1990.
The shipbuilding industry is
supplemented by ship-repairers which
modernise and convert vessels. The British
marine equipment industry offers a complete
range of products, from engines to
sophisticated navigational systems.
More than two decades of oil exploitation
in the North Sea have generated a major
offshore industry. Shipbuilders and
fabricators build fixed platforms and semi-
submersible units for drilling, production
and emergency/maintenance support, drill
ships, jack-up rigs, modules and offshore
loading systems. Several thousand
manufacturing and service industry firms
supply goods and services, including
consultancy, design, project management,
and research and development to the
offshore industry.
Aerospace
Britain’s aerospace industry is the third
largest in the world, after those of the
United States and the Soviet Union. With
more than 300 companies involved, it had a
turnover in 1990 of around £11,000 million.
Exports totalled £8,167 million and
contributed £1,664 million in net terms to
the balance of payments.
As the largest British exporter of
manufactured goods, British Aerospace (BAe)
produces both civil and military aircraft.
Civil aircraft include the 146 family of
regional quiet-jet airliners, the 64-seat ATP
(advanced turboprop) airliner, the 19/29-seat
Jetstream 31 and 41 commuterliners, and the
125 (the world’s best-selling middle-sized
business jet). BAe owns a 20 per cent share
of the European consortium Airbus
Industrie, which has sold over 1,400 aircraft.
BAe designs and supplies the wings for all
Airbus airliners. Together with other
international aerospace organisations, BAe is
studying the feasibility of developing a
successor to the Concorde supersonic
airliner. Steady growth in demand for air
travel is expected in the 1990s following
further consolidation of the commercial
aerospace industry, with British parts-makers
increasing business with the commercial
sector to offset reductions in defence orders.
The military production of BAe includes
the Harrier, a unique vertical/short take-off
and landing (V/STOL) military combat
aircraft. Sea Harriers are being supplied to
the Royal Navy and, in association with
McDonnell Douglas in the United States,
BAe is building the improved Harrier II.
BAe also produces the Hawk fast-jet trainer
and, with McDonnell Douglas, the Goshawk
carrier jet trainer. BAe has a 33 per cent
share in the development of the next-
generation European Fighter Aircraft
(EFA)—a co-operative venture between
Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. BAe is a
major supplier of tactical guided weapon
systems.
Short Brothers of Belfast produces a
range of aerospace products, including the
Shorts 330 and 360 commuter airliners and
the military freighter version of the 330
known as the Sherpa. It also produces the
Tucano, a turboprop basic military trainer
which is in use with the Royal Air Force.
The company, which was privatised in 1989,
also produces guided missiles and airframe
components for overseas aerospace
manufacturers.
In addition to its production of aerospace
equipment, Westland manufactures the Sea
King and Lynx military helicopters. In
collaboration with Agusta of Italy, Westland
is developing the multi-role EH101 three-
engine helicopter, which will be delivered to
the Royal Navy and the Italian Navy by the
mid-1990s. The company is also a leading
manufacturer of composite helicopter blades.
Rolls-Royce is one of the three major
manufacturers of aero-engines in the
245
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Western world, with a turnover in 1990 of
some £3,670 million and an order book at
the end of 1990 of £5,700 million. The
company’s civil engine group produces
engines for airliners and executive and
corporate jets. Rolls-Royce RB211-535
engines have been selected by 75 per cent of
airlines using Boeing 757 airliners. The
RB211-524G and H engines, which were
launched in 1986 with orders from Cathay
Pacific and British Airways to power Boeing
747-400 airliners, entered service in 1989.
The company’s new Tay turbofan engines
are in service with the Gulfstream IV and
Fokker 100 airliners, and are available as
replacement engines for older aircraft.
Rolls-Royce’s latest and most powerful
engine, the Trent, is being built for the
new generation of wide-body airliners.
Rolls-Royce is a partner in the five-nation
International Aero Engine consortium which
produces the V2500 aero-engine, now in
service on some versions of the Airbus
Industrie A320 airliner.
The military engine group of Rolls-Royce
produces engines for military aircraft and
helicopters. Rolls-Royce is a partner in
Eurojet, a consortium from four countries
formed to develop the EJ200 for the
Eurofighter’s EFA. It also produces gas
turbines for power generation and for oil and
gas pumping, gas turbine power for 25 of the
world’s navies, and propulsion systems for
the Royal Navy’s nuclear-powered
submarines.
Aviation equipment manufacturers
provide essential systems for engines and
aircraft, including engine and flight controls,
electrical generation, mechanical and
hydraulic power systems, cabin furnishings,
flight-deck control and information displays.
British firms have made important advances
in developing ejector seats, firefighting
equipment and flight simulators, as well as
fly_by-wire and fly-by-light technology,
where control surfaces are moved by means
of automatic electronic signalling and
fibreoptics respectively, rather than by
mechanical means. Britain’s aerospace
companies provide radar and air traffic
control equipment and ground power
supplies to airports and airlines worldwide.
Satellite Equipment
Over 400 companies in Britain are involved
in space activities. The British industry’s
major strength is in the manufacture of
satellites. British Aerospace Space
Communications Systems is Europe’s
largest—and the world’s third largest
producer of communications satellites. It was
prime contractor for all such satellites built
for the European Space Agency (ESA), as
well as the Marecs and Inmarsat-2 series of
maritime communications satellites, and the
Skynet and NATO IV military
communications satellites. BAe was also
prime contractor for Giotto, the scientific
satellite that intercepted Halley’s Comet.
BAe built 18 payload pallets for the United
States Space Shuttle and supplies SPELDA,
a structure that enables the ESA’s Ariane 4
launcher to carry two spacecraft on the same
mission. BAe has set up the National Remote
Sensing Centre to process and supply
commercial data derived from Earth
observation satellites.
Marconi Space Systems has acted as
principal contractor on many
telecommunications satellite payloads,
including those for the ESA’s Olympus
satellite. GEC Ferranti Defence Systems
produces the inertial guidance system for the

Food, Drink and Tobacco
Britain has a large and sophisticated food
processing industry, which has accounted for
a growing proportion of total domestic food
supply in recent decades. The industry’s
interests are advanced by Food From Britain,
a body with a wide remit to improve the
marketing of British food and agricultural
produce both domestically and overseas.
Convenience foods (particularly frozen
foods, annual sales of which now stand at
approximately £2,500 million), yoghurts,
other dairy desserts and instant snacks have
formed the fastest-growing sector of the food
market in recent years. The market in health
and slimming foods continues to grow.
Production of milk was 14,766 million
litres in 1990, of which 6,954 million litres
was sold as liquid milk. Nearly seven out of
ten households in Britain receive milk
through a doorstep delivery system
employing about 35,000 people driving
electric vehicles. Domestic milk consumption
per head—P9 litres (3 42 pints) per week in
1990—is among the highest in the world.
Consumption of skimmed and semi-skimmed
milk is rising as people seek to reduce the fat
content in their diet.
The main milk products are butter
(138,000 tonnes produced in 1990), cheese
(312,000 tonnes), condensed milk (204,000
tonnes) and dried whole and skimmed milk
(236,000 tonnes). The British dairy industry
accounted for 65 per cent of new butter
supplies to the domestic market in 1990 and
66 per cent of new cheese supplies. Butter
exports in 1990 came to 38,423 tonnes and
cheese exports 40,447 tonnes. The other
main exports are skimmed and whole milk
powder (103,656 and 54,655 tonnes).
About 80 per cent of bread is
manufactured in large mechanised bakeries
using the British ‘Chorleywood’ process,
which is also used in other countries. After
years of decline, overall consumption of
bread stabilised in the 1980s. This reflected
increased demand for wholemeal varieties at
the expense of the standard sliced white loaf,
although this has slowed down with the
introduction of soft-grained white bread.
Biscuit exports were valued at £110 million
in 1990.
Of prime importance among the alcoholic
drinks produced in Britain is Scotch whisky.
There are 110 distilleries in Scotland, where
the best known brands of blended Scotch
whisky are made from the products of malt
and grain whisky distilleries. Some 84 per

cent of all Scotch whisky produced is
exported. The value of whisky exports was
over £1,100 million in 1990, Europe taking
30 per cent and the United States taking
nearly 20 per cent by volume.
The brewing and malting industry has
five major brewery groups whose products
are sold nationally. One of the main raw
materials in beer is malt. British malt, which
is made almost entirely from home-grown
barley, is used by brewers throughout the
world. Demand for traditional cask-
conditioned ales, which had been falling, has
now stabilised, while lager now accounts for
just over half of all beer sales. In 1990
purchases of beer in Britain were £11,743
million, nearly 3 5 per cent of total
consumers’ expenditure.
Several companies produce up to 20
brands of soft drinks, which are marketed on
a national scale. Purchases of soft drink
products reached £3,300 million in 1990, an
increase of 95 per cent compared with 1985.
The British tobacco industry
manufactures 99 per cent of cigarettes and
tobacco goods sold in Britain. Almost all of
domestic output is provided by three major
manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco, Gallaher
and Carreras Rothmans). The industry
specialises in the production of high-quality
cigarettes made from flue-cured tobacco and
achieves significant exports, with the
participation of BAT Industries. Countries in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa are
important markets.
Textiles, Footwear, Clothing and
Leather
These products make a substantial
contribution to the British economy in terms
of employment, exports and turnover.
Together, they employ some 480,000 people,
equal to around 10 per cent of manufacturing
employment. For textiles, there is a high
degree of regional concentration. Particularly
important areas are the North West, West
Yorkshire (mainly wool), the East Midlands
(knitwear), Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Most of the clothing industry is widely
scattered throughout the country and does
not represent a large proportion of
employment in any region, although there
are significant concentrations in inner city
areas of cities such as Manchester, Leicester,
Leeds and London. The industries’ main
products are yarn, woven and knitted fabrics,
apparel, industrial and household textiles,
and carpets based mainly on wool, cotton
and synthetic fibres.
The textile and clothing industry has
around 15,000 firms, comprising a few large
multi-process companies and including two
of the world’s largest—Coats Viyella and
Courtaulds Textiles—as well as a large
number of small and medium-sized firms.
Increased investment in new machinery and
enhanced attention to design, training and
marketing have helped the industry to raise
its competitiveness. A new export record for
textiles and clothing of £4,500 million was

achieved in 1990. The Multi-Fibre
Arrangement (MFA) of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
allows a measure of restraint on imports of
textiles and clothing from low-cost countries
into the European Community.
Britain’s wool textile industry is one of
the largest in the world, with two main
branches making woollen and worsted. In the
past few years the industry’s export earnings
have been consistently high. Synthetic fibre
is sometimes blended with wool. West
Yorkshire is the main producing area, but
Scotland is also famous as a specialised
producer of high-quality yarn and cloth.
Large quantities of raw wool are scoured and
cleaned in Britain in preparation for
spinning. British mills also process the bulk
of rare fibres such as cashmere. Sales of the
principal products of the woollen and
worsted industry amounted to £1,600 million
in 1990, with exports amounting to £589
million of this total.
Low-cost competition has cut
progressively into British markets for cotton
and allied products, but output in 1990 still
exceeded £1,000 million. Production includes
f yarn and fabrics of cotton, spun synthetic
fibres and cotton-synthetic mixes, with large-
scale dyeing and printing of cotton and
synthetic fibre fabric. The linen industry is
centred in Northern Ireland.
Over half the value of carpet and rug
output is made up of tufted carpets. Woven
carpets, mainly Axminster, account for most
of the remaining sales. There is a higher
wool content in woven types, although in
these, too, considerable use is being made of
synthetic fibres. The high quality and variety
of design make Britain one of the world’s
leading producers of woven carpets.
Industrial textiles account for an increasing
proportion of the industry’s output, covering
products such as conveyor belting and
geotextiles used in civil engineering projects.
Many of these are non-woven, made of fibres
assembled using advanced techniques.
Synthetic polypropylene yarn is used in
the manufacture of carpet backing and ropes,
and woven into fabrics for a wide range of
applications in the packaging, upholstery,
building and motor vehicle industries.
The clothing industry is labour intensive,
involving about 9,000 companies. While a
wide range of clothing is imported from the
rest of Europe and Asia, British industry
supplies almost two-thirds of domestic
demand. Exports have risen since the British
fashion designer industry became prominent
during the 1980s and traditional British
tailoring enables clothing companies such as
Burberry’s to compete overseas. The hosiery
and knitwear industry comprises about 1,600
small to medium-sized companies, mainly in
the East Midlands and Scotland. The
footwear manufacturing industry is made up
predominantly of small companies,
increasingly under pressure from imports,
which accounted for about 87 per cent of
total sales in 1990.
Other Manufacturing
Nearly 400 companies in the wooden
furniture industry supply domestic, contract
and institutional markets. Domestic
production of wood for industrial use has
been steadily increasing and deliveries in
1990 amounted to 6 6 million cubic metres
(233 million cubic feet). There were 112
paper and board mills employing 131,000
people in 1990. Among the largest British
groups are Wiggins Teape, St Regis and
Davidsons. Overseas paper and board groups
with manufacturing investments in Britain
include Georgia Pacific, Kimberly Clark,
Consolidated Bathurst, the Scott Corporation
and United Paper Mills of Finland.
There has been a significant trend
towards waste-based packaging grades in
order to reduce the industry’s reliance on
imported woodpulp supplies. The use of
recycled waste paper is increasing and
research is helping to extend it. Waste paper
provides about half of the industry’s fibre
needs. Domestically produced wood pulp
represents only a small percentage of raw
material supplies.
Mergers have led to the formation of large
groups in newspaper, magazine and book
publishing. Printing, engraving, bookbinding
and specialist publishing activities still
involve many small firms using new
technology such as computer typesetting and
249
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
desktop publishing. The book-publishing
industry is a major exporter, selling one-
third of production in overseas markets.
Security printers (of, for example, banknotes
and postage stamps) are important exporters,
the major company being De La Rue. 1 otal
employment in the paper, printing and
publishing industries in 1990 was 467,000.
Most of the printing and publishing
industry’s employment and output is
concentrated in firms based in the South East.
Rubber tyres and tubes sold by British
manufacturers in 1990 were valued at £1,349
million, about £560 million of which went
overseas. Other important rubber goods
include vehicle components and accessories,
conveyor belting, cables, hoses, latex foam
products, and footwear, gloves and clothing.
Tyre manufacturers include subsidiaries of
United States and other overseas companies.
The industry’s consumption of rubber
includes natural, synthetic and recycled
rubber.
Toys, games and sports equipment are
established in export markets, while
jewellery, gold and silverware and the
refining of precious metals are industries
maintaining a strong craft tradition.

14 Construction and
Service Industries
Introduction
Services contribute about 64 per cent of
gross domestic product and some 70 per
cent of employment. Overseas earnings from
services amounted to nearly 40 per cent
of the value of exports of manufactures in
1990.
The number of employees in services in
Great Britain rose from just over 13 million
in 1982 to nearly 15-5 million by the end of
1990. Much of this was accounted for by
growth in part-time (principally female)
employment. In the past decade employment
has grown more rapidly in the private sector
than in the public sector, partly reflecting
the Government’s policy of restricting
employment in public sector services.
With the rise in real incomes, consumers
have spent more on personal, financial and
leisure services. While consumers have to
some extent exchanged services such as
public transport, laundries and cinemas for
goods such as cars, washing-machines and
television sets, this has generated demand for
distribution, maintenance and repair of these
goods.
Demand for British air travel, hotel and
catering services has also resulted from the
increase in real incomes in other countries.
By the same token, the substantial rise in
real disposable incomes in Britain has
resulted in more holidays being taken by
Britons both within Britain and overseas.
Other factors include the increased use of
a wide variety of banking services and the
spread of home ownership, which has
increased demand for legal and estate agency
services. Demographic changes, such as the
increasing proportion of elderly people in the
population, help to explain the growth of
medical services.
Changes in technology have also played a
part in the growth of services. Examples
range from the computer services industry to
the provision of cash and credit by means of
cards, and the growth of information systems
such as viewdata and teletext.
A notable trend is the growth in
franchising, an operation in which a company
owning the rights to a particular form of
trading licenses them to franchisees, usually
by means of an initial payment with
continuing royalties. The main areas include
cleaning services, film processing, print
shops, hairdressing and cosmetics, fitness
centres, courier delivery, car rental, engine
tuning and servicing, and fast food retailing.
It is estimated that franchising’s share of
total retail sales is about 10 per cent, a figure
which is likely to increase.
Construction
The construction industry accounts for 7-6
per cent of gross domestic product and
employs just under 1 million people; there
are also more than 700,000 self-employed in
the industry. It accounts for just under 5 per
cent of employment.
Efficiency and productivity are benefiting
from new computerised techniques such as
electronic load safety measures for cranes,
distance measuring equipment, computerised
stock ordering and job costing, and
computer-aided design. Increasingly, major
contractors are managing projects
(particularly higher value ones) and using
subcontractors to do the actual work.
The Department of the Environment’s
building regulations prescribe minimum
standards of construction in England and
Wales. Administered and enforced by local
government authorities, the regulations apply
to new building, the installation or
replacement of fittings, and alterations and
L
251
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
extensions to existing buildings. There are
similar controls in Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
An alternative to local authority building
control was introduced in 1984; under this
there is a system of private certification of
compliance with building regulations.
The British Board of Agrement,
sponsored by the Department, assesses and
issues reports and certificates relating to
products and systems for use in the
construction industry. 1 he British Standards
Institution is providing Britain’s contribution
to the drafting of European standards, which
are increasingly replacing national
construction standards.
Structure
Construction work is carried out by private
contractors and by public authorities which
employ their own labour. In 1990 some 92
per cent of the work was done by private
firms, 98 per cent of which employ fewer
than 25 people. Some of the large firms own
quarries and workshops, mechanised plant
and standard builders’ equipment. Some
undertake responsibility for all stages of
projects from initial design to finished
building.
All but the smallest projects are generally
carried out under professional direction by
architects or, in the case of the more
complicated civil engineering projects, by
consulting engineers. The latter, acting on
behalf of a client, may advise on the
feasibility of projects, draw up plans and
supervise the construction work.
The financial aspects and control of
project costs are undertaken by quantity
surveyors and construction surveyors. The
inspection and maintenance of buildings are
carried out by building surveyors. In
addition, town planning and municipal
surveyors deal with local planning issues.
Independent estates and valuation surveyors
manage privately-owned property.
Two organisations have special
responsibilities for construction work
undertaken by the Government. Property
Holdings acts as landlord for its Common
User Estate. The functions of the second
body, PSA Services (formerly Property
Services Agency), are to:
• offer management and design services for
major projects;
• provide services in maintenance and
estates surveying;
• manage and design locally designed
projects;
• provide specialist professional services;
and
• organise support services overseas for the
Ministry of Defence.
Departments are no longer required to
use PSA Services, as the Government has
announced its intention to privatise the
organisation.
Housing
During 1990 a total of 158,300 dwellings
were started in Great Britain. Starts in the
public sector were 25,300 and those for
private owners 133,000. Some 184,100
dwellings were completed: 31,000 in the
public sector and 153,100 in the private
sector.
Major Construction Projects
Among important construction projects in
hand or recently completed are the Channel
Tunnel, the M25 motorway widening
scheme, the Dartford Bridge, the A55
Conwy Tunnel, the extensive development in
London’s Docklands (including the
Limehouse link road), the new British
Library, the Glasgow Concert Hall and
Birmingham’s Symphony Hall.
Consultancy
In 1990 members of the Association of
Consulting Engineers were involved in new
work overseas valued at £15,935 million, a
10 3 per cent increase over the figure for
1989. The capital value of projects underway
at the end of 1990 or completed during the
year was £44,685 million. The three largest
categories of work covered railways; roads,
bridges and tunnels; and water supply. The
252
CONSTRUCTION AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
largest markets were the Middle East, the
Far East and Africa. Projects include:
• the Channel Tunnel (£5,500 million);
• a thermal power station in Sabriyah,
Kuwait (£3,000 million);
• a river project in Libya (£2,600 million);
and
• the Hong Kong International Airport
(£2,400 million).
British consulting engineers, process
engineers and chartered surveyors had
estimated net earnings in 1990 of £480
million from overseas commissions.
Contracting
Overseas construction contracts awarded to
British companies in 1990 included:
• a concrete gravity platform off
Newfoundland, with a French
partnership, worth £500 million;
• expansion of Kuentan Airport in
Malaysia;
• a wastewater treatment plant in Canada;
• the design, construction and equipping
of eight district hospitals in Malaysia,
with a Malaysian partnership, worth
£112 million; and
• a joint venture to build a major section
of the Lesotho Highlands Water
Development Project.
Research and Advisory Services
The Government’s research and advisory
body on construction is the Building
Research Establishment, part of the
Department of the Environment. It has four
laboratories, including a fire research station,
and is the site of a building energy manage¬
ment systems centre. The major construction
and materials firms, universities, colleges of
technology and research associations carry
out research and provide advisory services.
The Building Centre, run by its own
trust, provides exhibition and information
services on materials, products, techniques
and building services.
Service Industries
DISTRIBUTION
There were some 3 5 million employees in
the distributive and allied trades in Great
Britain in early 1990, together with a large
number of owners of businesses. The
distributive and allied trades accounted for
about 15 per cent of national income in 1990.

WHOLESALE TRADES
According to the most recently published
Census of Production, there were 115,000
businesses, with a turnover valued at nearly
£205,000 million (see Table 14.1), engaged
in wholesaling and dealing in Great Britain
in 1988. This represented a growth in stock
of businesses of 26 per cent and of turnover
at current prices of 94 per cent since 1980.
The co-operative movement has its own
wholesale organisation, the Co-operative
Wholesale Society (CWS). Retail co-operative
societies are encouraged to buy from the
CWS, which is their main supplier. The
CWS is also a major retailer in Scotland,
Northern Ireland and south-east England.
In the food and drink trade almost all
large retailers have their own buying and
central distribution operations. Elsewhere in
the trade voluntary groups have been formed
by wholesalers with small independent
retailers, in which the retailers are
encouraged by discounts and other incentives
to buy as much as possible from the
wholesaler. This has helped to preserve
many smaller retail outlets for the
wholesaler, including the traditional ‘corner
shops’ and village stores, and has given small
retailers the advantages of bulk buying and
co-ordinated distribution.
London’s wholesale markets play a
significant part in the distribution of
foodstuffs. New Covent Garden is the main
market for fruit and vegetables, Smithfield
for meat and Billingsgate for fish.
RETAIL TRADES
Of the 25 largest retailers in Western Europe
by sales reported in either financial or
calendar years embracing 1988 to 1990, ten
were British firms. The Census of
Production 1988 found 237,832 retail
businesses, with 338,248 outlets, in Great
Britain (see Table 14.2). In recent years, the
large multiple retailers have grown in size,
decreasing their store numbers but increasing
outlet size and diversifying their product
ranges. Decline has been particularly evident
among small independent businesses and
retail co-operative societies. Food retailers

CONSTRUCTION AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
have experienced the fastest growth in
turnover, while hire and repair businesses
and shops selling durable household goods
have recorded the slowest growth.
The largest multiple retailers in the
grocery market are Sainsbury, Tesco,
Safeway, Asda and Gateway. These five
groups are responsible for around
£25,000 million of grocery sales a year.
Retail co-operative societies are voluntary
organisations controlled by their members,
membership being open to anyone paying a
small deposit on a minimum share. Retail
co-operatives and the Co-operative Wholesale
Society (see p 254) are members of the
Co-operative Union, as are a number of
other co-operative bodies such as the Co¬
operative Bank. There are 4,671 retail co¬
operative outlets, 62 per cent of which sell
food and groceries.
The leading mixed retail businesses are
Marks and Spencer, Boots, Kingfisher,
Storehouse, W.H. Smith, Argos,
Littlewoods, Savacentre, John Menzies,
Sears, Burton Group and House of Fraser.
About 20 million people regularly
purchase goods through mail order
catalogues. In 1990 sales by general mail
order totalled some £3,700 million,
representing nearly 3 per cent of all retail
sales and 4 5 per cent of non-food retail
sales. Leading items sold by the mail order
companies include clothing, footwear,
furniture, household textiles, televisions,
radios and electrical goods.
Trends
Although one of the most significant trends in
retailing has been the decline of the specialist
sector and the development of the large
supermarket and superstore, the nine largest
multiple retailers have only 27 per cent of
retail turnover. Other trends include:
• more very large self-service stores selling
a wide variety of products;
• the slowing down of recent
diversification by food multiples into
selling a wider range of goods; and
• the creation of specially designed
shopping precincts.
Large Shopping Centres
Britain has a wide range of complementary
shopping facilities inside and outside town
and city centres. There continues to be a
demand for the services provided by small,
specialised shops, but the trend is towards
larger shops in order to increase efficiency
and the range of goods available. The main
multiple grocery companies have been
steadily increasing the size of their stores
both in towns and cities and on suburban
and out-of-town sites. Also, retailers of
goods such as do-it-yourself products,
furniture and electrical appliances have
built retail warehouses outside town and
city centres, particularly to attract shoppers
with cars. More recently, there has been a
trend towards the grouping of retail
warehouses into retail warehouse parks.
Many towns and cities have purpose-built
shopping centres.
Proposals have also been made recently
for a number of regional out-of-town
shopping centres, on sites which offer good
access to large numbers of customers with
cars and ample space for car parking, and
which benefit from low acquisition and
operating costs. One of the first centres
was the Metro Centre at Gateshead, Tyne
and Wear, which includes over 93,000 sq
m (1 million sq ft) of floorspace. The
Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield
was opened in September 1990 and the
Lakeside centre at Thurrock in Essex in
October 1990.
All new retail development requires
planning permission from the local
government planning authority. These
authorities must consult the appropriate
central government department before
granting permission for developments of
23,325 sq m (250,000 sq ft) or more. The
Government’s policy is to encourage the
provision of a wide range of shopping
facilities to the public, while ensuring that
the effects of major new retail development
do not undermine the viability and vitality
of existing town centres.

BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Diversification
Many of the large multiple groups offer a
much bigger range of goods and services
than previously. However, extensive
diversification has proved unprofitable and
large food retailers are increasing their range
of foods instead. More emphasis is also being
placed on selling own-label goods and
environmentally friendly products. Man\
superstores and large supermarkets offer
fresh as well as packaged food, often with
special counters or areas for fresh meat, fish,
vegetables and bread baked on the premises.
Some large retailers have in recent years
begun to provide financial and estate agency
services.
Promotions
Retailers are placing greater emphasis on
price competition and quality as a means of
promoting sales. Some large retailers have
issued their own credit cards for regular
customers in an attempt to increase sales,
particularly of high-value goods.
Use of Technology
Laser-scanning electronic check-outs are
already having a major impact on British
retailing. Substantial savings are being made
from improved stock control and a reduction
of individual price marking in stores. Some
large multiple retailers are using electronic
order and invoice systems in dealing with
their suppliers, following a legal change
permitting tax invoices in forms other than
paper. Small independent retailers are also
using electronic ordering, pricing and
delivery systems. High-speed labelling
techniques are being adopted, including the
use of electronic printers which can overprint
labels, the use of pressure-sensitive glues and
printing in foil instead of ink.
‘EFTPOS’ (electronic funds transfer at
point of sale) is a system which enables
shoppers to pay for goods using a debit or
credit card to transfer funds electronically via
terminals in retail premises. Several major
EFTPOS schemes are well established, with
altogether more than 190,000 terminals, a
number that is growing quickly. In many
cases the terminals are integrated with the
retailers’ in-house computer systems.
Vehicle and Petrol Retailing
In 1990 there were 460,000 people employed
in the retail distribution of motor vehicles
and parts, in petrol stations and in the repair
and recovery of vehicles. Many of the
businesses selling new vehicles are franchised
by the motor manufacturers.
” One-third of the 19,500 petrol stations are
owned by oil companies. The three
companies with the largest number of outlets
in 1990 were Shell (2,653), Esso (2,520) and
BP/National (1,992). Unleaded petrol is sold
at more than 94 per cent of outlets, its sales
accounting for about 41 per cent of petrol
sold. The majority of petrol stations are self-
service. About 15,500 outlets sell diesel fuel.
Hotels and Catering
The hotel and catering trades employed
some L2 million people in Great Britain at
the end of 1990 as follows:
• hotels and other residential
establishments, 266,000;
• public houses and bars, 333,000;
• restaurants, cafes and snack bars,
301,000;
• clubs, 150,000; and
• canteens, 148,000.
A large number of self-employed people are
also engaged in hotels and catering.
There were about 29,000 hotels in Great
Britain in 1989-90, with a turnover of
£7,000 million in 1989. Many licensed hotels
as well as most of the numerous guest houses
have fewer than 20 rooms. Of the major
hotel business groups, the biggest is
Trusthouse Forte pic, which runs 800 hotels,
including some 240 in Britain, and has
catering and leisure interests. Among the
largest firms running holiday centres
(including holiday camps with full board,
self-catering centres and caravan parks) are
Butlins, Warner Holidays and Pontin’s.
Britain has a very wide range of restaurants,
CONSTRUCTION AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
of which a substantial number specialise in
Chinese, Italian, Indian and Greek foods.
The Food Safety Act 1990 has contributed to
a raising of food safety standards.
In 1990 there were about 20,000 public
houses (pubs), which mainly sell beer, wines,
soft drinks and spirits for consumption on
the premises. Many pubs are owned by the
large brewing companies, which either
provide managers to run them or offer
tenancy agreements; others, called free
houses, are independently owned and
managed. The Government has acted to
strengthen competition in the sale of beer
and other drinks in pubs.
BUSINESS SERVICES
Business services include advertising, market
research, management consultancy, exhibition
and conference facilities, computing services
and auction houses.
Advertising
Advertising expenditure in 1990 amounted to
£7,900 million. The press accounted for 64
per cent of the total, television for 30 per
cent, posters for nearly 4 per cent, and
commercial radio and cinema for the rest.
The largest advertising expenditure is on
food, retail and mail order services, financial
services, motor cars, drink, household goods
and leisure equipment. Campaigns are
planned mainly by several hundred
advertising agencies which, in some cases,
provide marketing, consumer research and
other services.
Computing Services
The computing services industry comprises
software houses; production of packaged
software; consultancy; facilities management;
processing services; and the provision of
complete computer systems. It also includes
companies providing information technology
education and training, independent
maintenance, contingency planning and
recruitment, and contract staff. The industry
is one of the fastest growing sectors of the
British economy.
The turnover of companies in the
Computing Services Association totalled over
£3,500 million in 1990. Members of the
Association provide employment for over
60,000 people, representing about 75 per
cent of the industry in Britain.
Developments include the adoption of
advanced software engineering techniques,
the design of systems kernels, systems
integration and facilities management.
Management Consultancy
There are about 15,000 management
consultants, of whom 3,800 are individual
practising members of the Institute of
Management Consultants. Among the largest
management consultancy companies are the
32 members of the Management
Consultancies Association, with revenue
earned within Britain comprising £706
million, and overseas revenue amounting to
almost £104 million in 1990. The Association
reports a growing demand for the application
of information technology to all aspects of
business. The Association’s members account
for some 45 to 55 per cent of Britain’s fee¬
paying management consultancy market.
Market Research
Market research is a well-established sector
of the marketing services industry in Britain.
Britain accounts for about 10 per cent of
worldwide expenditure, and spends more on
market research, per head, than any other
European country.
The Association of Market Survey
Organisations (AMSO) is the main trade
organisation. AMSO’s member companies
account for over 70 per cent of all
commercial market research. In 1990 they
accounted for total research revenues of £265
million—a growth in revenues of 11 -4 per
cent over 1989. Research revenues come from
a wide range of clients and industries.
Exhibition and Conference Centres
Britain is one of the world’s three leading
countries for international conferences (the
others being the United States and France).
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
With the steady increase in new and
renovated facilities, some 80 towns and cities
have facilities for conferences and
exhibitions.
Among the most modern purpose-built
conference and exhibition centres are the
International Conference Centre and the
National Exhibition Centre at Birmingham,
the Wembley Conference Centre, the Queen
Elizabeth II Conference Centre and the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences in
London. Others are situated in Brighton
(East Sussex), Harrogate (North Yorkshire),
Bournemouth (Dorset), Manchester,
Nottingham and Torquay. Wales has a
conference centre in Cardiff and in Scotland
Glasgow and Aberdeen both have exhibition
and conference centres.
Other large exhibition facilities are the
Earls Court, Olympia, Alexandra Palace and
Wembley Arena sites in London. New
centres are being constructed in Glasgow and
Cardiff.
Auction Houses
Britain’s chief auction houses are active in
the international auction markets for works
of art, trading on the acknowledged expertise
of British valuers and dealers. The two
largest houses, Sotheby’s and Christie s, are
established worldwide. Sotheby’s handled
sales valued at £121 million in 1990, while
Christie’s handled sales valued at £650
million.
TOURISM AND TRAVEL
Tourism is one of Britain’s most important
industries and is a major and growing source
of employment. It is estimated that about
1-4 million jobs in Great Britain were
supported by tourism spending in 1990.
In 1990 over 18 million overseas visitors
came to Britain and spent nearly £7,800
million. British residents made 31 million
trips abroad and spent £9,900 million, giving
a deficit on the travel account of £2,100
million. Fifty-nine per cent of overseas
visitors to Britain came from Western
Europe and 21 per cent from North
America. Eighty-three per cent of trips
abroad by British visitors were to Western
Europe.
Some 90 per cent of travel agencies
belong to the Association of British Travel
Agents (ABTA). Although most travel agents
are small businesses, there are a few large
firms—for example, Lunn Poly and Thomas
Cook, each of which has hundreds of
branches. Computerised information and
booking systems are used extensively in
travel agencies. There are also 700 tour
operator members of ABTA; about half are
both retail agents and tour operators.
ABTA operates financial protection
schemes to safeguard its members
customers, maintains codes of conduct drawn
up with the Office of Fair Trading, and
offers a free consumer affairs service to help
to resolve complaints against members and
an independent arbitration scheme for tour
operators’ customers.
Tourist Authorities
Official support for tourism is provided by
the British Tourist Authority (BTA) and the
tourist boards for England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland. The BTA promotes
overseas tourism to Britain and is
represented in 32 countries. The tourist
boards improve and promote facilities for
tourism in each area. The English Tourist
Board (ETB) works closely with 12 regional
tourist boards, which are responsible for the
planning, development and marketing of
tourism in their areas. Each board is a
partnership between the ETB, local
government and trade interests in their
region.
Some 17,000 hotels and other serviced
accommodation are inspected and classified
by the tourist boards. The various
classifications—‘listed’ and one to five
crowns—indicate the range of facilities and
services provided. A similar arrangement
applies to self-catering holiday homes. There
is also a ‘Q^ quality grading scheme for
caravans, chalets and camping parks.
Information on tourist facilities and
accommodation is available from official
tourist information centres, most of which
are administered by local government.
258
15 Energy and Natural
Resources
Energy and non-fuel minerals make an
important contribution to the British
economy. The approximate value of minerals
produced in 1989 was £15,880 million
(representing nearly 3 9 per cent of gross
domestic product—GDP), of which crude oil
accounted for 45 per cent, coal 26 per cent
and natural gas 16 per cent.
All minerals in Great Britain are mainly
privately owned, with the exception of gold,
silver, oil and natural gas (which are owned
by the Crown), and coal and some minerals
associated with coal. In Northern Ireland
gold and silver are owned by the Crown,
while rights to exploit petroleum and other
minerals are vested in the Department of
Economic Development.
On the United Kingdom Continental
Shelf the right to exploit all minerals
except coal is vested in the Crown.
The exclusive right to extract coal, or
license others to do so, both on land in
Great Britain and under the sea, is vested in
the British Coal Corporation. Normally,
ownership of minerals belongs to the owner
of the land surface, but in some areas,
particularly those with a long history of
mining, these rights have become separated.
Mining and quarrying, apart from
coalmining, are usually carried out by
privately owned companies.
Energy
Britain has the largest energy resources of
any country in the European Community
and is a major world producer of oil, natural
gas and coal—called primary sources. The
other main primary sources are nuclear
power and some water power; secondary
sources (derived from primary sources) are
electricity, coke and smokeless fuels, and
petroleum products. In 1990 Britain was a
small net importer of energy, amounting to
9 6 million tonnes of oil equivalent. In
financial terms, however, the higher value of
its exports meant that it was a net exporter
of energy, to the value of £471 million.
There are large reserves of coal, which is
expected to continue to supply a significant
proportion of the country’s energy needs.
Nuclear power provided about 19 per cent of
electricity available from the British
electricity companies in 1990.
Private sector companies carry out
offshore oil and gas production and oil
refining, while a publicly owned body is at
present responsible for most coal production.
The electricity supply industry in Great
Britain, apart from nuclear power, has been
privatised. Plans to privatise the electricity
supply industry in Northern Ireland have
been announced. The Secretary of State for
Energy is responsible for energy matters in
Great Britain, except for electricity in
Scotland, which is under the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The Secretary of State
for Northern Ireland is responsible for all
energy matters there.
Energy Policy
Energy policy is designed to ensure the
secure, adequate and economic provision of
energy to meet Britain’s requirements. The
Government encourages the exploitation of
Britain’s diverse energy sources. It seeks to
ensure that all economic forms of energy are
produced, supplied and used as efficiently as
possible, having regard also to the
international application and environmental
implications of the technologies involved.
Central government spending on energy is
planned to decline by about 10 per cent over

the next three years, with an increasing share
of expenditure directed at non-nuclear items
and at energy efficiency.
The Government stresses the importance
of the continued profitable development of
Britain’s oil and gas resources, the
development of a competitive coal industry,
the safe and economic development of
nuclear power, and the most cost-effective
use of energy through the adoption of energy
efficiency measures. It also funds an
extensive research and development
programme into renewable sources of
energy.
Privatisation has already had an impact in
the energy field, with the transfer of British
Gas, Britoil, Enterprise Oil, and the
non-nuclear electricity supply industry in
Great Britain to the private sector. The
Government wishes to privatise the coal
industry during the next Parliament. It
considers that these industries will thus
improve their competitiveness and efficiency,
free of government pressures, and attract
new investment to provide cheaper and
cleaner energy.
Britain is actively engaged in international
collaboration on energy questions, notably
through its membership of the European
Community and of the International Energy
Agency (a body with 23 member countries
attached to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development). In 1990 the
European Community introduced the
THERMIE scheme for the promotion of
energy technology, including support for
demonstration projects in the hydrocarbons
sector.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
During 1979—90, when Britain s GDP rose
by 24 per cent, energy consumption on a
‘heat supplied’ basis declined by 3-8 per
cent. Energy consumption by final users in
1990 amounted to 59,381 million thermsi 0n
a ‘heat supplied’ basis, of which transport
consumed 32-5 per cent, industrial users 27
per cent, domestic users 27 per cent, and
commerce, agriculture and public services 13
per cent.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
The Energy Efficiency Office (EEO),
established in 1983, provides a wide range of
services and programmes designed to
encourage cost-effective energy efficiency
improvements. Its work focuses on major
energy users in industry, commerce and the
public sector, and on low-income house¬
holds. Since 1983, EEO programmes have
cost some j£150 million and have led to
savings now worth over £500 million a year.
The EEO’s budget for 1991-92 is
£42 million. It promotes its programmes
through 11 regional energy efficiency
officers.
Consumers in Britain spent £42,000
million (including taxes) on energy in 1989—
8 3 per cent of GDP. The EEO estimates
that about 20 per cent of this could have
been saved if consumers had invested in
cost-effective energy efficiency measures,
which pay for themselves through reductions
1 1 therm = 105,506 kilojoules.
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
in energy consumption within three years.
The Government stresses that improved
energy efficiency not only saves valuable
energy resources, but also helps to stabilise
carbon dioxide (C02) emissions and reduces
acid rain pollution.
An interdepartmental ministerial group,
chaired by the Secretary of State for Energy,
aims to ensure that energy efficiency
objectives are incorporated into publicity,
policy and management of government
departments, and of public and private sector
organisations. It promotes the environmental
benefits of improved energy efficiency as
well as the savings in fuel bills, and
highlights concern for efficient energy use as
part of a modern lifestyle. It also leads the
Government’s public sector energy efficiency
campaign. The major government
departments and English health authorities
have been set a target to reduce their energy
consumption by 15 per cent over five years.
The EEO’s main programme, Best
Practice, provides information and advice on
energy use and efficiency in industry,
commerce, the public sector and housing.
This includes extensive guidance on energy
efficiency technologies and management
techniques. Best Practice’s current target is to
encourage recurrent energy savings worth a
further £500 million a year by the year 2000.
The EEO’s Home Energy Efficiency
Scheme provides advice and grants to
low-income households for insulation
and draughtproofing. Householders are
eligible if they receive income support,
housing benefit, family credit or
community charge support.
The EEO promotes Combined Heat and
Power (CHP) technology under the Best
Practice programme. CHP plant produces
usable heat as well as electricity. It also has
an overall efficiency of fuel utilisation as high
as 80 to 90 per cent, compared with 30 per
cent for conventional power plant. By using
less fuel for a similar output of energy, CHP
significantly reduces the emissions which
damage the environment. CHP is already
cutting energy costs on about 500 sites in
Britain. It has a total installed capacity of
some 2,000 megawatts (MW). This accounts
for about 3 per cent of electricity generated.
In 1991 the EEO and the Department of
the Environment started a three-year
campaign to promote energy efficiency in the
home and explain the impact of energy use
on the environment. The EEO also runs a
promotional campaign aimed at senior
management of top energy users in Britain.
Britain is also carrying out work with
European Community partners on the
development of effective legislative measures
on appliance labelling. Energy labels for
refrigerators and freezers initially should be
produced before the end of 1992. The
Government is also exploring with retailers
and manufacturers the possibilities for an
interim voluntary scheme in Britain.
OIL AND GAS
Britain’s energy position is strengthened by
substantial oil and gas reserves offshore on
the United Kingdom Continental Shelf
(UKCS). The Government has granted
exploration and production licences as a
result of 12 offshore licensing rounds since
1964. In 1991, it awarded licences for 74
blocks in the twelfth round after receiving
the highest number of applications for ten
years. It also awarded licences for six of the
11 groups of blocks on offer in the first
separate round of offshore licensing for
frontier areas. Expenditure on offshore and
onshore exploration and development
amounted to some £3,500 million in 1990.
By the end of 1990, 4,516 wells had been or
were being drilled in the UKCS: 2,054
development wells, 1,553 exploration wells
and 909 appraisal wells.
Offshore Supplies
Britain’s offshore supplies industry is the
second largest in the world and has headed
considerable technological advance. It is
estimated that British suppliers are winning
orders worth between £7,000 million and
£8,000 million a year worldwide.
The Offshore Supplies Office (OSO) of
the Department of Energy is responsible for
promoting a fair commercial opportunity for
261
BRITAIN 1992. AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British suppliers in the UKCS and
throughout the world. The OSO provides
the secretariat for the Offshore Industry
Advisory Board. The Board, chaired by an
energy minister, is the principal source of
high-level co-ordinated advice on the
development of strategy for Britain’s offshore
supplies industry.
Offshore Safety
In November 1990, the Cullen report into
the destruction by fire of the Piper Alpha
fixed oil production platform in July 1988
resulted in 106 recommendations for a new
regulatory system of offshore safety. The
Government accepted them and is acting
to implement them. Offshore safety
responsibilities have been transferred from
the Department of Energy to the Health and
Safety Executive.
OIL
Before the 1970s Britain was almost wholly
dependent for its oil supplies on imports, the
only indigenous supplies coming from a
small number of land-based oilfields.
However, the first notable offshore discovery
of oil in the UKCS was made in 1969 and
the first oil was brought ashore in 1975.
Output of crude oil in Britain in 1990
averaged over E83 million barrels (about
241,000 tonnes) a day, making Britain the
world’s ninth largest producer.
North Sea Fields
There were 48 offshore fields producing
crude oil at the end of 1990, and the
Secretary of State for Energy approved ten
new offshore development projects during
the year.
The fields with the largest cumulative
production totals are Forties and Brent.
Ninian, Piper, Beryl, Fulmar, Thistle and
Claymore are other high-producing fields.
Production from most large fields is
controlled from production platforms of
either steel or concrete which have been built
to withstand severe weather, including gusts
of wind of up to 260 km/h (160 mph) and
waves of 30 m (100 ft). The Petroleum Act
1987 lays down measures to be taken in
connection with the abandonment of offshore
installations and pipelines.
Output is forecast to decline slowly, but
Britain should remain self-sufficient in oil
well into the 1990s and a significant
producer into the twenty-first century. The

262
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Government’s oil policy encourages
exploration, development and investment,
with the objective of maximising economic
oil production for the foreseeable future.
Remaining recoverable reserves of UKCS oil
in the proven plus probable categories
amount to between 535 and 1,195 million
tonnes, while the total remaining reserves of
the UKCS could be as high as 5,300 million
tonnes.
Structure of the Oil Industry
About 250 companies, including several large
oil firms, operate in Britain or engage in
work in the UKCS. The two leading British
oil companies are British Petroleum (BP)
and Shell Transport and Trading, which are
the two largest industrial companies in
Britain in terms of turnover. Exploration and
development of the UKCS are carried out
by the private sector. The Government takes
all royalty from UKCS oil in cash.
Land-based Fields
Onshore production of crude oil is much less
significant than offshore production. In 1990,
however, it increased by 142 per cent to 1-75
million tonnes, 77 per cent of which came
from Britain’s largest onshore field at Wytch
Farm (Dorset), which started production in
1979. In addition to minor production from
various mining licensees, other onshore fields
include Humbly Grove and Stockbridge
(Hampshire), Palmers Wood (Surrey), and
Nettleham, Scampton North and Welton
(Lincolnshire). Small, independent
companies play an increasingly prominent
role in onshore exploration. At the end of
1990, 215 landward petroleum licences were
in force, covering an area of 35,522 sq km
(13,850 sq miles).
Refineries
At the beginning of 1991 the distillation
capacity of Britain’s 13 oil refineries stood at
92 million tonnes a year. Excess capacity has
largely been eliminated, while existing
refineries have been adapted to the changing
pattern of demand by the construction of
upgrading facilities (‘catalytic crackers’),
which are leading to a higher output of
unleaded petrol and other lighter products at
the expense of fuel oil.
Consumption and Trade
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1990 totalled over 74
million tonnes, including 24-3 million tonnes
of motor spirit, 8 6 million tonnes of
kerosene, 18 7 million tonnes of gas and
diesel oil (including derv fuel used in road
vehicles), and 12 million tonnes of fuel oil.
Exports of crude oil amounted to 54-3
million tonnes in 1990. Virtually all exports
went to Britain’s partners in the European
Community and the IEA, the largest markets
being the Netherlands, France, Germany,
Canada and the United States. Some 21
million tonnes of petroleum products were
also exported. Though self-sufficient, Britain
continues to import other crude oils, to
enable the full range of petroleum products
to be made efficiently and economically.
Oil Pipelines
Oil pipelines brought ashore about 73 per
cent of offshore oil in 1990. Some 1,878 km
(1,174 miles) of major submarine pipeline
bring oil ashore from the North Sea oilfields.
Major crude oil onshore pipelines in
operation from harbours, land terminals or
offshore moorings to refineries include those
connecting Finnart to Grangemouth,
Tranmere to Stanlow, and Cruden Bay to
Grangemouth. Onshore pipelines also carry
refined products to major marketing areas;
for example, a 423-km (263-mile) pipeline
runs from Milford Haven to the Midlands
and Manchester.
Research
The main government research and
development effort in offshore technology is
undertaken by the Department of Energy
through the Offshore Energy Technology
Board. Advice on offshore safety is provided
by the Offshore Safety and Technology
264
 t
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Board. The Petroleum Science and
Technology Institute, set up in Edinburgh in
1989, works in conjunction with Heriot-Watt
and Edinburgh universities, and is funded by
35 oil companies and the OSO. Its activities
are concentrated on exploration, appraisal,
development and production. The Offshore
Technology Park in Aberdeen comprises
several projects and is part-funded by
Scottish Enterprise.
GAS
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain
began in the early nineteenth century in
central London. For many years gas was
produced from coal, but during the 1960s
growing imports of oil brought about
production of town gas from oil-based
feedstocks. Following the first commercial
natural gas discovery in the UKCS in 1965
and the start of offshore gas production in
1967, supplies of offshore natural gas grew
rapidly and by 1977 natural gas had
replaced town gas in the public supply
system in Great Britain. Some £12,000
million has been spent on developing natural
gas resources on the UKCS and over
785,250 million cubic metres have been
produced.
Structure
The gas industry in Great Britain, in state
ownership since 1949, was privatised in 1986.
British Gas pic is the main public gas
supplier, but has an obligation to act as a
common carrier for other companies, and
five now supply gas, in competition with
British Gas, through the company’s transport
network. Its activities are monitored by the
Office of Gas Supply, and the Gas
Consumers Council looks after the interests
of consumers.
British Gas has about 2 3 million private
and institutional shareholders. In 1990-91
the turnover of British Gas and its subsidiary
companies amounted to £9,491 million, of
which gas supply in Britain accounted for
£7,930 million. Current cost operating profit
was £1,655 million. British Gas has nearly
80,000 employees in Britain.
Production
Total production of natural gas from the
33 fields in the UKCS in 1990 amounted
to 49,549 million cubic metres. This
includes gas used for drilling, production
and pumping operations. Gas produced
and used on North Sea production
platforms and at terminals accounted for
3,273 million cubic metres, leaving 46,276
million for general supply. Total sales of
UKCS gas to gas suppliers amounted to
46,000 million cubic metres—11-3 per cent
higher than in 1989. In addition, 7,000
million cubic metres of gas were imported
from Norway. UKCS production comes
mainly from eight major gasfields: Leman,
Indefatigable, North Alwyn, Audrey,
Hewett and Della, Vulcan, Frigg (UK) and
Viking. Gas from the South Morecambe
field in the Irish Sea and from the twin
North Sean and South Sean fields is used
to augment supplies to meet peak demand
in winter. In 1990 two new developments
were approved, Anglia and Pickerill.
Remaining recoverable gas reserves,
including possible gas from existing
discoveries and potential future discoveries,
are estimated to be in the range of 963,000
million to 3-35 million million cubic
metres. Indigenous offshore natural gas
reserves are likely to meet most of the
British demand well into the next century.
Transmission and Storage
The British Gas national and regional
high-pressure pipeline system of some
17,600 km (11,100 miles) transports natural
gas around Great Britain. It is supplied
from four North Sea shore terminals, and
from a terminal in Barrow-in-Furness
(Cumbria). The high-pressure transmission
system is inspected regularly.
Various methods of storage of natural
gas to meet peak demand are used,
including salt cavities and storage facilities
for liquefied natural gas. British Gas has
also developed the partially depleted
Rough field as a major gas store. This, the
first such use of an offshore field, involves
the injection into the Rough reservoir in
265
Gas
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
summer of gas drawn from the national
transmission system for recovery at high
rates during periods of peak winter demand.
Consumption
Sales of gas by the supply industry in Britain
totalled 19,626 million therms in 1990-91.
About 45 per cent of all gas sold by British
Gas to its almost 18 million consumers is for
industrial and commercial purposes, the
remainder being for household use.
Gas is used extensively in industries
requiring the control of temperatures to
a fine degree of accuracy, such as the
pottery industry, and in certain
processes for making iron and steel
products.
In 1990-91, 5,598 million therms of gas
were sold to industry in Britain, and 3,188
million therms to commercial and other non¬
domestic users. An increasingly large part of
domestic demand is for gas for central
heating. In 1990-91, 10,840 million therms
were sold to domestic users.
Research
British Gas has a worldwide reputation for
gas technology, with a research programme
costing £85 million in 1990-91. It is
involved in joint research with overseas gas
companies. Its technology transfer group is
assisting utilities in over 20 countries in
transmission, distribution and other areas.
British Gas is today exploring for and
producing gas and oil in some 20 countries.
COAL
Coalmining in Britain can be traced back to
Roman times. It played a crucial part in the
industrial revolution of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. In its peak year, 1913,
the industry produced 292 million tonnes of
coal, exported 74-2 million tonnes and
employed over 1 million workers. In 1947 the
coalmines passed into public ownership, and
the National Coal Board (now the British
Coal Corporation) was set up. The Govern¬
ment has announced that it will introduce
legislation to privatise the coal industry
during the next Parliament. It has also
reduced the debt under which the industry
was operating and eliminated accumulated
liabilities incurred by British Coal.
British Coal Corporation
British Coal has, with limited exceptions,
exclusive rights over the extraction of coal in
Great Britain. It is empowered to license
private operators to work mines with an
employee limit of 150 and opencast sites with
a production limit of 250,000 tonnes, so that
underground and opencast deposits too small
for British Coal to work can be usefully
exploited. It also has powers to work other
minerals, where discoveries are made in the
course of searching for, or working, coal; and
to engage in certain petrochemicals activities
beneficial to the future of the coal industry.
Production
In 1990-91 total output of 91-6 million
tonnes comprised 72-3 million tonnes of
deep-mined coal, 17 million tonnes from
opencast mines and 2 3 million tonnes from
licensed mines. At the end of March 1991
there were 65 British Coal collieries in
operation. At the same date its workforce
was 74,300, of whom 57,300 were miners.
British Coal Opencast also had 61 sites in
operation at the end of March 1991. Since
1984 British Coal, through its job creation
activity, British Coal Enterprise, has helped
create job opportunities for 71,000 people in
areas where mining was previously the main
source of employment.
Development
Britain’s coal industry is the largest hard-coal
industry in Western Europe, and one of the
world’s most technologically advanced.
British Coal has a substantial investment
programme, which amounted to £368 million
in 1990—91. Technical progress has been
concentrated on equipment capable of
obtaining higher output from fewer faces. By

early 1991 some 75 per cent of all coal faces
were equipped with heavy duty supports
| available in all seam sections. The new
mining complex at Selby in North Yorkshire
(one of the world’s most advanced deep
j mines) is planned to produce up to 10
million tonnes a year. The development of a
new mine at Asfordby within the Vale of
Belvoir (Leicestershire) is in progress.
Significant reserves of lignite (brown coal)
have been discovered in Northern Ireland in
| the clay basins around Lough Neagh and at
I Ballymoney. Companies under government
licence are prospecting to determine their
extent, possibly over 1,000 million tonnes.
Consumption
In 1990-91 inland consumption of coal was
108-7 million tonnes, of which 75 3 per cent
was by power stations, 9-8 per cent by coke
ovens and 5-2 per cent by domestic users.
With a substantial proportion of coal being
used by power stations for electricity
generation, British Coal sales of coal to them
totalled 74 3 million tonnes in 1990-91.
Exports of coal in 1990-91 were 21 million
tonnes, while imports amounted to 16 9
million tonnes.
Research
The Government’s and British Coal’s
principal research objective is to make the
burning of coal more environmentally
acceptable. It aims to reduce emissions of
sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx),
C02 and other gases associated with the
greenhouse effect. Key projects are the
British Coal topping cycle development
programme, designed to improve the
efficiency of combined cycle power
generation to 45 per cent. It offers a 20 per
cent reduction in C02 emissions from coal-
fired power stations. Further studies into
combined cycle power plant worked by coal
gasification have been possible through the
British Coal gasification development
programme. A number of projects aimed at
reducing NOx emissions in pulverised coal
combustion have government support, some
in collaboration with the IEA.
The coal liquefaction plant at Point of
Ayr (Clwyd), opened in 1990 and costing
£40 million, converts 2 5 tonnes of coal a
day into petrol, diesel and other transport
fuels. The Government has also established
a coal task force, to review clean coal
technologies and technologies aimed at
maximising economically recoverable coal
from Great Britain’s coal reserves.
ELECTRICITY
In 1990-91 certain parts of the electricity
supply industry were restructured and
offered for sale. The sales took place
between November 1990 and June 1991.
Electricity from the supply system is
available to all premises in Britain except
for some very remote households.
Restructuring after Privatisation
The privatised electricity supply industry
in England and Wales consists of three
main generating companies, the National
Grid Company (NGC) and 12 regional
electricity companies (RECs). The two
main non-nuclear generators, National
Power and PowerGen, the publicly owned
nuclear generator, Nuclear Electric pic, and
other generators and importers sell
electricity to suppliers through a market
known as the pool. The NGC operates the
transmission system—the bulk transfer of
electricity across the national grid—and
owns the pumped storage stations at
Dinorwig and Ffestiniog. It is owned by
the RECs through a holding company.
Distribution and supply of electricity are
the business of the RECs. Distribution
involves transfer of electricity from the
national grid and its delivery, across local
systems, to consumers. Supply is the sale
of electricity to customers. Each REC is
authorised to supply any premises within
its area. Other companies may obtain a
second-tier licence to supply, although
initially competition is limited to premises
with a maximum consumption of 1 MW.
The Government retains approximately
40 per cent of the issued ordinary share
capital of each of National Power and
269
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
PowerGen, and will not sell, or otherwise
dispose of, this holding before 1 April 1993.
Restructuring in Scotland has created
three companies. Two vertically integrated
companies, ScottishPower pic and Scottish
Hydro-Electric pic, generate, transmit,
distribute and supply electricity. They also
buy it from Scottish Nuclear Ltd, a
government-owned company which operates
the nuclear power stations at Hunterston
(Strathclyde) and Torness (Lothian), and,
under long-term contracts, from each other.
Opportunities exist to export and import
electricity to and from the pool (see above).
The boundary separating the ScottishPower
and Scottish Hydro-Electric supply areas
runs from Loch Long on the Firth of Clyde
to Newburgh on the Firth of Tay.
Certain service and co-ordinating
functions for the industry are carried on by
the Electricity Association, jointly owned by
the electricity companies of Great Britain.
Regulation of the industry is the
responsibility of the Office of Electricity
Regulation, headed by the Director General
of Electricity Supply, whose duties include
the promotion of competition and the
protection of consumer interests.
Details of government proposals to
privatise the electricity supply industry in
Northern Ireland have been published.
Generation, transmission and distribution are
at present carried out by Northern Ireland
Electricity, a public corporation.
Consumption
In 1990 sales of electricity through the
distribution system in Britain amounted to
271,940 gigawatt hours (GWh). Domestic
users took 34 per cent of the total, industry
33 per cent and commercial and other users
the remainder. About 24 per cent of
domestic sales is for space heating, 13 per
cent for water heating and 8 per cent for
cooking. Electricity is used in industry
mainly for motive power, melting, heating
and lighting.
Generation
National Power owns 35 operational fossil-
fuelled power stations which generate
approximately 46 per cent ol the electricity
supplied to the transmission and distribution
networks in England and Wales. PowerGen
owns 19 fossil-fuelled power stations which
generate approximately 30 per cent of this
electricity. The 12 nuclear stations of
Nuclear Electric generate approximately 17
per cent. In 1990-91, about 38 per cent of
electricity supplied in Scotland was produced
by Scottish Nuclear’s two stations. The
power stations operated by ScottishPower

and Hydro-Electric provided most of the
balance. ScottishPower has 15 power
stations and in 1990-91 its three coal-fired
stations produced 52 per cent of the
electricity supplied in its area, with nuclear
power contributing 39 per cent. Hydro-
Electric has 59 stations (mostly hydro, but
one major oil/gas station), and in 1990-91
they produced 65• 5 per cent of the
electricity supplied in its area, with nuclear
power contributing 26 per cent. All of
Scottish Nuclear’s production is sold to
ScottishPower and Hydro-Electric in the
proportions 74 9 per cent and 25-1 per cent
respectively.
Power stations owned by Britain’s major
generating companies consumed 69 8
million tonnes of oil equivalent in 1990, of
which coal accounted for 70 per cent and
oil 9-6 per cent. The declared net capacity
of these stations at the end of March 1991
totalled 69,323 MW.
Independent generators are allowed to
compete on equal terms with the major
generators and have equal access to the grid
transmission and local distribution systems.
To control acid emissions the
Government expects National Power and
PowerGen each to fit flue gas
desulphurisation (FGD) equipment to 4
GW of their existing coal-fired power
stations. Work is in progress towards fitting
FGD equipment to National Power’s Drax
station (North Yorkshire). For its part,
ScottishPower expects to fit FGD as
necessary at the Longannet station. In
addition, a ten-year programme to control
NOx emissions through the installation of
low-NOx burners at the 12 largest power
stations in England and Wales, at a cost of
approximately £185 million, is also in
progress. Both Scottish companies are
expected to fit low-NOx burners at their
main stations.
For new stations the trend is towards
the construction of combined cycle gas
turbines (CCGT). They are less costly to
build than other types of station, and have
shorter construction times. Their use of
natural gas, low in sulphur, also helps to
reduce acid and C02 emissions. The
installation of the more efficient CCGT
plant should also help to stabilise C02
emissions from the electricity supply
industry. In England and Wales, nine
stations over 50 MW have been given
planning consent under the Electricity Act
1989.
The pumped-storage station at
Dinorwig (Gwynedd), the largest of its
type in Europe, has an average generated
output of 1,728 MW. (In pumped-storage
schemes electricity generated in off-peak
periods is used to pump water to high-level
reservoirs, from which it descends to drive
turbines, rapidly providing a large supply
of electricity at peak periods or to meet
sudden increases in demand.)
The National Grid Company, together
with Electricite de France, runs a 2,000-
MW cross-Channel cable link, providing
the capacity for the transmission of
electricity between the two countries.
Transmission lines linking the Scottish and
English grid systems enable cross-border
trading. This interconnector is run jointly
by the NGC and ScottishPower. Its
capacity is planned to be increased from
850 MW to 1,600 MW by 1994-95.
Electrical interconnection, from the mid-
1990s, between Northern Ireland and Great
Britain has been agreed.
Nuclear Power
In 1956, the world’s first industrial-scale
nuclear power station, at Calder Hall
(Cumbria), began to supply electricity to
the national grid. There are 16 commercial
nuclear power stations in Britain: nine
Magnox stations (with capacities ranging
from 200 to 840 MW) and seven Advanced
Gas-cooled Reactor stations (AGRs;
ranging from 1,200 MW to 1,320 MW).
Construction of a pressurised water reactor
(PWR) of 1,182 MW at Sizewell (Suffolk)
is expected to be completed in 1994. Two
of the smaller Magnox stations are now
shut down and undergoing
decommissioning.
The Government wishes to maintain the
role of nuclear power, to increase the
diversity of supply, and thus to help to
maintain security of supply. Nuclear power
272
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
can also play an important part in curbing
acid rain and ameliorating global warming, as
nuclear power stations emit almost no
sulphur dioxide, NOx or C02. The
Government intends to review the prospects
for nuclear power in 1994, when the PWR at
Sizewell will be nearing completion. The
Magnox stations, AGRs and PWR in
England and Wales, owned by Nuclear
Electric, provide between 15 and 20 per cent
of electricity in England and Wales. The two
AGRs in Scotland, owned by Scottish
Nuclear, supplied 37 per cent of the
electricity generated in Scotland in 1990-91.
In England and Wales the RECs are
statutorily required, under the non-fossil fuel
obligation, to buy a minimum amount of
non-fossil-fuelled generating capacity,
including nuclear. Since the price of nuclear
electricity is somewhat higher than that of
fossil-fuelled electricity, a levy may be raised
on all sales from sources which could be
environmentally damaging, including fossil
fuels, so that the additional cost is shared by
all electricity suppliers. The Government has
no plans at present to introduce such an
obligation in Scotland, which already has a
high level of non-fossil-fuel generating
capacity.
British Nuclear Fuels
British Nuclear Fuels pic provides services
covering the whole nuclear fuel cycle. All of
its shares are held by the Government. The
company, with headquarters at Risley
(Cheshire), conducts operations at four
further sites: Springfields (Lancashire),
where fuel is manufactured; Capenhurst
(Cheshire), where uranium is enriched to
provide fuel for nuclear reactors; Sellafield
(Cumbria), where Calder Hall is located and
where spent fuel is reprocessed; and
Chapelcross Magnox power station
(Dumfries and Galloway).
A substantial investment programme,
mainly at Sellafield, includes the thermal
oxide reprocessing plant (THORP), expected
to be completed in 1992, which will take
spent fuel from British and overseas oxide
reactors, and a vitrification treatment plant,
completed in 1991, to turn the high-level
liquid waste left after reprocessing spent
nuclear fuel into stable glass blocks for
storage before eventual disposal.
Nuclear Research
The nuclear research and development
funded by the Department of Energy is
carried out by the UKAEA—nine semi-
autonomous businesses operating as AEA
Technology. The work is carried out at six
sites: Harwell and Culham (Oxfordshire),
Risley, Winfrith (Dorset), Windscale
(Cumbria) and Dounreay (Highland). In
addition, safety research is carried out by
AEA Safety and Reliability at Culcheth
(Cheshire).
Co-operation on nuclear energy between
Britain and other countries takes place within
a framework of intergovernmental
agreements and membership of bodies such
as the International Atomic Energy Agency
and the Nuclear Energy Agency, as well as
through direct links on research between
AEA Technology and equivalent
organisations overseas.
Britain takes part in the co-operative
research programmes of the European
Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). A
major component of this programme is the
Joint European Torus (JET) project at
Culham, which started operating in 1983.
AEA Technology has an agreement with its
French and German counterparts to set out
the terms for European fast reactor research
and development collaboration. The fast
reactor project, sponsored by nuclear utilities
in Britain, France and Germany, is due to
complete the initial design phase of a
commercial demonstration reactor in 1993.
Nuclear Safety
Britain has a rigorous system of nuclear
safety regulation, enforced by the Health and
Safety Executive’s Nuclear Installations
Inspectorate, which ensures that high
standards of safety are incorporated into the
design, construction, operation, maintenance
and eventual decommissioning of all nuclear
plant. While the safety of such plant in
Britain is the ultimate responsibility of the
273
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
nuclear operator, the Inspectorate has
extensive powers and an operator must
satisfy it before a licence is granted.
Operators must protect their workers and
the public by complying with the Health
and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, as well as
with the conditions of their nuclear site
licences under the Nuclear Installations Act
1965. The Inspectorate has the power to
shut down a plant if it is believed to be
unsafe and may also require improvements
to an installation if it thinks the appropriate
safety standards are not being met.
Discharges have to be kept within the
limits and conditions set by authorisations
granted under the Radioactive Substances
Act 1960. In England and Wales
authorisations are granted jointly by the
Secretary of State for the Environment and
the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, and in Scotland by the Secretary of
State for Scotland. Within maximum dose
limits, operators of nuclear facilities are
required to keep discharges as low as
reasonably achievable and failure to do so
makes them liable to prosecution.
Compliance with the legislation is overseen
by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Pollution
in England and Wales, and by Her Majesty’s
Industrial Pollution Inspectorate in Scotland.
On nuclear safety, Britain has a number
of bilateral agreements and arrangements,
with, for example, France, the Soviet Union
and the United States, covering the
exchange of information relating to all
matters affecting nuclear safety. International
conventions have been established on the
early notification of a nuclear accident with
possible transboundary effects, and on the
mutual provision of assistance in the event
of a nuclear accident or radiological
emergency.
Emergency Plans
The precautions taken in the design and
construction of nuclear installations in
Britain, and the high safety standards in
their operation and maintenance, reduce the
chance of accidents which might affect the
public to an extremely low level. However,
all operators are required to prepare
emergency plans, including those for
dealing with an accidental release of
radioactivity, which are regularly tested in
exercises under the supervision of the
Nuclear Installations Inspectorate.
Research on Electricity
Research and development are a matter for
the individual companies, but some
research is carried out jointly. National
Power and PowerGen maintain a joint
environmental programme. Technological
research on generation and main
transmission is undertaken primarily by the
generating companies and by the NGC.
The research establishments comprise:
Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories
(Gloucestershire; Nuclear Electric); the
Technology and Environment Centre at
Leatherhead (Surrey; National Power); the
Marchwood Engineering Laboratories at
Southampton Water (PowerGen); the
Ratcliffe Technology Centre at Ratcliffe-
on-Soar (Nottingham; PowerGen); and the
Research and Development Centre at
Leatherhead.
RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY
The Department of Energy supports
research, development and demonstration
in the renewable energy technologies. It
aims to exploit alternative sources of
energy which have the potential to be
economically viable and environmentally
acceptable. It also encourages industry to
develop both internal and export markets.
Its current programme includes some 300
projects with a financial commitment of
£60 million. Work is at present
concentrated on the most promising
technologies.
The Government is aiming at a figure
of 1,000 MW of electricity generation
capacity from renewable energy by the year
2000. In 1990, the first Order under the
non-fossil fuel obligation identified 75
projects qualifying as non-fossil fuel
electricity capacity, which will increase the
renewable capacity in England and Wales
to 250 MW.
274
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Wind Power
Wind power remains one of the most
promising technologies. The Department of
Energy’s research programme for 1991-92 is
estimated to cost ^7 7 million, with an aim
of 25 new projects initiated and 100 projects
managed. Among the projects supported by
the Department are:
• two vertical-axis wind turbines,
inaugurated in 1986 and 1990 at
Carmarthen Bay (Dyfed);
• a 300-kW turbine also at Carmarthen
Bay;
• a 3-MW, 60-m (200-ft) turbine, in
collaboration with Scottish Hydro-
Electric, on Orkney, inaugurated in
1987;
• a 1-MW, 55-m (180-ft) diameter turbine
at Richborough (Kent), inaugurated in
1990; and
• two 300-kW turbines at the National
Wind Turbine Centre (East Kilbride),
opened in 1991.
Plans for experimental wind farms are
progressing. National Wind Power Limited,
formed in 1991, plans to install complete
wind farm packages on suitable sites.
Geothermal Energy
Under its geothermal hot dry rock
programme, during 1976-91, the
Government investigated, through work
carried out in Cornwall by the Camborne
School of Mines, the economic possibilities
of extracting heat from rocks at a depth of 2
to 6 km (1-25 to 4 miles). It has concluded
that further funding should go largely
towards participating in a joint programme
with France, Germany and the European
Community, which could resolve some of the
technical uncertainties.
Tidal Power
Tidal power is one of the most promising of
the renewable technologies for large-scale
electricity generation. Its exceptionally high
tidal range makes the Severn estuary one of
the best potential sites in the world, and the
Department of Energy has funded, with the
Severn Tidal Power Group and the
electricity supply industry, a ^4 2 million
study into the viability of a Severn tidal
barrage, of which a general report has been
published. The Government has contributed
some £5 million to three phases of studies
on an energy barrage on the Mersey estuary.
Passive Solar Design
The Government continues support for a
solar programme. Passive solar design is
considered the best way to utilise solar
energy in Britain and has already proved
cost-effective in both domestic and non¬
domestic buildings, using their form and
fabric to admit, store and distribute solar
energy for heating and improving daylight.
The Best Practice programme of the EEO
encourages the technology. Recent advances
in photovoltaics—in which treated glass
plates convert sunlight directly into
electricity—have suggested that photovoltaic
materials incorporated into the cladding and
roofing of buildings could provide
competitive electricity generation.
Biofuels
Biofuels offer possibly the largest
contribution from the renewable energy
resources in the medium term. The main
work of the Department’s programme is on
the combustion of wastes, anaerobic
digestion (particularly as applied to the
production and use of landfill gas) and
energy forestry. Britain is the largest user of
landfill gas as an energy source in the
European Community, and is second only to
the United States in its exploitation. Each
year about 30 million tonnes of waste are
produced in Britain. Over 90 per cent is
landfilled.
Wave Energy
The Department of Energy also has a
research and development programme into
wave energy, based on a project on the
island of Islay. The small-scale shoreline
275
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
device has been constructed by the Queen’s
University of Belfast, which is carrying out a
complementary study to assess the potential
for shoreline devices in Britain. A review of
wave energy is expected to be completed by
the end of 1991.
Non-fuel Minerals
Although much of Britain’s requirements for
industrial raw materials is met by imports,
non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make
an important contribution to the economy.
Output of non-fuel minerals in 1989 totalled
over 394 million tonnes, valued at £2,018
million. The total number of employees in
the extraction industry was some 43,500 in
1989.
Exploration
Exploration for, and exploitation of,
indigenous mineral resources to meet the
needs of industry are encouraged by the
Government. The British Geological Survey
is carrying out a long-term programme for
the Department of Trade and Industry
aimed at identifying areas with the potential
for the economic extraction of minerals.
Production
In terms of value, production of sand and
gravel was estimated at £583 million in 1989,
limestone and dolomite £574 million, clays
£284 million, igneous rock £223 million,
sandstone £78 million, potash £60 million,
silica sands £46 million, chalk £46 million,
salt £33 million, gypsum and anhydrite £24
million, tin £19 million, fuller’s earth £15
million and fluorspar £12 million. In 1989
the production of metals in non-ferrous ores
totalled 12,300 tonnes, mainly tin and zinc
from Cornwall. The Cornish mines, one of
the very few sources of tin in the European
Community, produced some 3,800 tonnes in
1989, satisfying about half of Britain’s
demand. Small amounts of copper and silver
were produced in association with tin and
zinc, and some lead and zinc with barytes
and fluorspar. A little gold came from a mine
in north Wales.
Water
Britain’s water supplies are obtained partly
from surface sources such as mountain lakes,
streams impounded in upland gathering
grounds and lowland river intakes, and partly

BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
from underground sources by means of
wells, springs, adits and boreholes. About 99
per cent of the population in Great Britain
and 97 per cent in Northern Ireland are
connected to the public water supply system.
Water for public supply in England and
Wales amounted to about 16,600 megalitres
(Ml) a day in 1989-90 and average daily
domestic consumption per head was 136
litres.
Supplies
Some 33,333 Ml a day were abstracted in
England and Wales in 1989, of which public
water supplies accounted for 17,884 Ml a
day. The electricity generating companies
and other industry took some 15,050 Ml a
day. Agriculture took 398 Ml a day.
England and Wales
The Water Act 1989 privatised the utility
functions of the ten former water authorities
in England and Wales. It provided for the
Secretaries of State for the Environment and
for Wales, the Director General of Water
Services and the National Rivers Authority
(NRA) to be the principal regulators of the
industry. The Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of
State for Wales are responsible for policy
relating to land drainage, flood protection,
sea defence, and the protection and
development of fisheries. The Drinking
Water Inspectorate was set up to regulate
drinking water quality.
Water Companies
The ten water service companies are the
principal operating subsidiaries of the ten
water holding companies. They have
statutory responsibilities for water supply,
sewerage and sewage treatment, and for
ensuring adequate supplies. The 29 supply
only companies, which in 1989 were already
in the private sector, operate as water
undertakers in certain areas. Those which
convert to pic status may also become
sewerage undertakers by agreement with the
relevant water service company or on sites
where no service exists.
The Water Act 1989 allows the water
companies to determine their own methods
of charging. At present most charges are
based on the former rateable value system,
although customers may choose to pay to
have a water meter installed. In general,
companies require new properties to have
metered supplies. An alternative to the
system based on rateable values, however,
must be found by the year 2000. Wide-
scale water metering is one of the choices
being considered.
A system of economic regulation and
guaranteed standards of service is overseen
by the Director General of Water Services.
The Water Supply (Water Quality)
Regulations 1989 define wholesomeness
and incorporate the requirements of the
European Community’s drinking water
directive. They impose physical, chemical
and microbiological standards for water
intended for domestic and food production
purposes. The task of the Drinking Water
Inspectorate is to ensure that drinking
water is wholesome and that companies
comply with the Regulations.
National Rivers Authority
The NRA is the environmental regulatory
arm of the water industry. The Authority
is a non-departmental public body with
statutory duties and powers in relation to
water resources, pollution control, flood
defence, fisheries, recreation, conservation
and navigation in England and Wales. The
water environment for which it has
responsibility includes all rivers, lakes,
reservoirs, estuaries, coastal waters and
water stored naturally underground. The
NRA’s consent is needed for the
abstraction of water and for discharges to
water.
Development Projects
The water industry in England and Wales
is committed to a ten-year investment
programme costing over £26,000 million.
Thames Water is constructing an 80-km
(50-mile) distribution system to meet the
278
ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
growing demand for water in London. This
is due to be completed in 1996. North West
Water has a major 25-year programme of
investment to clean up the polluted rivers of
the Mersey Basin.
Water is seen as an increasingly scarce
resource, but more in demand. The
industry, through contingency planning and
publicity campaigns, aims to encourage the
wise use of water, especially when supplies
run low because of prolonged warm, dry
weather. The NRA has published a survey
of the prospects for public water supplies to
the year 2011 in England and Wales. It is
investigating the strategic development of
water resources, including major new
transfer schemes, and is reviewing the
possibilities of a national grid and
desalination.
Scotland
In Scotland responsibility for public water
supply, sewerage and sewage disposal rests
with the nine regional and three islands
councils. In addition, the Central Scotland
Water Development Board is responsible for
developing new sources of water supply to
provide water in bulk to the regional
councils in an area of 25,900 sq km (10,000
sq miles) in central Scotland. Water is
charged for according to type of consumer:
domestic consumers pay community water
charges; non-domestic consumers pay by
means of non-domestic water rates, or
through metered charges. Charges and rates
are decided by each authority.
Scotland has a relative abundance of
unpolluted water from upland sources. An
average of 2,248 Ml a day was supplied in
Scotland in 1989-90. The Secretary of State
for Scotland is responsible for the promotion
of the conservation of water resources and
the provision by water authorities of
adequate water supplies, and has a duty to
promote the cleanliness of rivers and other
inland waters, and the tidal waters of
Scotland. River purification authorities have
a statutory responsibility for water pollution
control.
Northern Ireland
The Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland is responsible for public
water supply and sewerage throughout
Northern Ireland. It is also responsible for
the conservation and cleanliness of water
resources and, with the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland, may
prepare a water management programme
with respect to water resources in any area.
There is a domestic water charge which is
contained in the regional rate, while
agriculture, commerce and industry pay
metered charges. There are abundant
potential supplies of water for both domestic
and industrial use. An average of 666 Ml of
water a day was supplied in 1989-90.
Research
Several organisations and centres of expertise
provide water research services to
government, the NRA, water companies and
the Scottish river purification boards. The
Water Research Centre has main laboratories
at Medmenham (Buckinghamshire) and at
Swindon (Wiltshire). Research undertaken
includes environmental issues. Other
organisations conducting research include
Hydraulics Research Limited, universities,
the Meteorological Office, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and several
institutes of the Natural Environment
Research Council.

16 Agriculture, Fisheries
and Forestry
Agriculture
British agriculture is noted for its high level
of efficiency and productivity. In 1990 it
employed 21 per cent of the total workforce
and Britain was self-sufficient in 56 per cent
of all types of food and animal feed. It was
self-sufficient in about 73 per cent of
indigenous-type food and feed. Food, feed
and beverages accounted for just over 10 per
cent of Britain’s imports by value in 1990,
compared with about a quarter in the 1960s.
The agricultural contribution to gross
domestic product was £6,378 million in
1990, about T4 per cent of the total. Britain
is also a major exporter of agricultural
produce and food products, agrochemicals
and agricultural machinery.
The Government aims to foster an
efficient and competitive agriculture industry
through the provision and sponsorship of
research, development and advisory services,
the provision of financial support where
appropriate, measures to control disease,
pests and pollution, and improved marketing
arrangements for food and food products. It
also insists on high standards of animal
welfare. Agriculture ministers must balance
the needs of an efficient agricultural industry
with other interests in the countryside.
These include conservation of its natural
beauty and promotion of its enjoyment by
the public.
Land Use
The area of agricultural land has been
declining, although there has been a
reduction in the net rate of loss in recent
years. In 1990 there were just under 12
million hectares (29-4 million acres) under
crops and grass. Just under 6 million
hectares (14-3 million acres) were used for
rough grazing, most of it in hilly areas. Soils
vary from the thin poor ones of highland
Britain to the rich fertile soils of low-lying
areas such as the fenlands of eastern
England. The temperate climate and the
relatively even distribution of rainfall over
the year ensure a long growing season;
streams rarely dry up and grassland normally
remains green throughout the year.
Farming
In 1990 there were some 237,400 farm
holdings in Britain (excluding minor
holdings), of which about 63 per cent in
England, Scotland and Wales were wholly or
mainly owner-occupied. Virtually all the
farms in Northern Ireland are owner-
occupied. The average farm size (including
rough grazing) is 100-7 hectares (249 acres),
again excluding minor holdings. It is
estimated that just under 13 per cent of
holdings are in the largest-size group, which
accounted for 57 per cent of activity, while
the smallest-size group (41 per cent of farms)

accounted for only 2 5 per cent of activity.
In Wales and Northern Ireland output
from smaller farms is more significant than
in the rest of Britain.
The number of people (excluding
spouses) engaged in agriculture in 1990 was
about 566,000. Labour productivity has
increased by 72 per cent since 1979. Total
income from farming (that of farmers,
partners, directors and their spouses) was
/2,113 million in 1990, 7 per cent less than
in 1989.
There are over 500,000 tractors and over
60,000 combine harvesters in use. Most
farms have a direct electricity supply, the
remainder having their own generators.
Horticultural crops such as blackcurrants
and brussels sprouts are frequently
harvested by machine, and milking
machines are used on the vast majority of
dairy farms.
Most farms in Britain produce a range
of commodities. In choosing both their
products and their inputs, farmers may be
assisted by computer models.
PRODUCTION
Home production of the principal foods is
shown in Table 16.1 as a percentage by
weight of total supplies (that is,
production plus imports minus exports).
Livestock
Over half of full-time farms are devoted
mainly to dairying or beef cattle and
sheep. The majority of sheep and cattle
are reared in the hill and moorland areas
of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and
northern and south-western England. Beef
fattening occurs partly in better grassland
areas, as does dairying, and partly on
arable farms. British livestock breeders
have developed many of the cattle, sheep
and pig breeds with worldwide
reputations, for example, the Hereford
and Aberdeen Angus beef breeds, the
Jersey, Guernsey and Ayrshire dairy
breeds, Large White pigs and a number of
sheep breeds. Because of developments in
artificial insemination and embryo
transfer, Britain is able to export semen
and embryos from high-quality donor
animals.
Cattle and Sheep
Most dairy cattle in England and Wales
and a significant proportion in Scotland
and Northern Ireland are bred by artificial
insemination. In 1990 the average size of
dairy herds in Britain was 63, while the
average yield of milk per dairy cow was
5,137 litres (1,130 gallons). Average
household consumption of liquid

(including low-fat) milk per head in 1990
was 1-3 litres (2-2 pints) a week.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef
production derives from the national dairy
herd, in which the Friesian breed is
predominant. The remainder is derived
from suckler herds producing high-quality
beef calves in the hills and uplands,
where the traditional British beef breeds,
such as Hereford and Aberdeen Angus,
continue to be important. Imported
breeds which have established themselves
include the Charolais, Limousin,
Simmental and Belgian Blue. In 1990 the
size of the beef-breeding herd continued
to expand and reached its highest level
since 1977.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep
production, with more than 40 breeds and
many crosses between them. Research has
provided vaccine and serum protection
against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
Although lamb production is the main source
of income for sheep farmers, wool is also
important.
Grass supplies 60 to 80 per cent of the
feed for cattle and sheep. Grass production
has been enhanced by the increased use of
fertilisers, irrigation and methods of grazing
control, and improved herbage conservation
for winter feed. Rough grazings are used for
extensively grazed sheep and cattle,
producing young animals for fattening
elsewhere.

BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Pigs and Poultry
Pig production occurs in most areas but is
particularly important in eastern and
northern England. There is an increasing
concentration into specialist units and
larger herds.
Output of poultry meat has continued
to benefit from better husbandry and
genetic improvements. Since 1979 British
production has increased by just over a
third to over 1 million tonnes in 1990.
Production of broilers from holdings of
over 100,000 birds accounts for over a half
of total production. In 1990 British egg
production continued to recover following
stringent government measures to deal
with salmonella. Over two-thirds of laying
birds are on holdings with 20,000 or more
birds. Britain remains broadly self-sulficient
in poultry meat and eggs.
Animal Welfare
The welfare of farm animals is protected by
legislation and it is an offence to cause
unnecessary pain or distress to commercially
reared livestock. For example, there are
regulations requiring owners of intensive units
to arrange for the daily inspection of their
stock and the equipment on which it depends.
There is increased protection for all livestock,
poultry, rabbits and horses at markets, and
specific controls on the marketing of foals and
calves. There are laws which ban close
confinement crates for keeping veal calves,
phase out tether and close confinement
systems for keeping pigs and protect animals

AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
at slaughter from unnecessary pain or
distress. The Farm Animal Welfare Council,
an independent body set up by the
Government, advises on any legislative or
other changes it considers necessary. The
Government’s proposed charter on animal
welfare in the European Community aims to
raise welfare standards in Europe.
Crops
The farms devoted primarily to arable
crops are found mainly in eastern and
central- southern England and eastern
Scotland. In Britain in 1990 cereals were
grown on 3 7 million hectares (91 million
acres). Production of cereals, at 22 6
million tonnes, was similar to that in 1989.
Between 40 and 50 per cent of available
wheat supplies (allowing for imports and
exports) are normally used for flour
milling, and about half for animal feed.
About a quarter of barley supplies are used
for malting and distilling, and the
remainder for animal feed. There was an
increase of 24 per cent in 1990 in the
production of oilseed rape, the increase in
area reflecting the relatively high price paid
for the 1989 crop.
Large-scale potato and vegetable
production is undertaken in the fens (in
Cambridgeshire and south Lincolnshire),
the alluvial areas around the rivers Thames
and Humber and the peaty lands in south
Lancashire. Early potatoes are an important
crop in Pembrokeshire (Dyfed), Kent and
Cornwall. High-grade seed potatoes are
grown in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet
provides just under 50 per cent of
requirements, most of the remainder being
refined from raw cane sugar imported levy-
free from developing countries under the
Lome Convention.
Horticulture
In 1990 the land utilised for horticulture
was about 208,000 hectares (514,000 acres).
Vegetables grown in the open (excluding
potatoes) accounted for 68 per cent,
orchards for 16-6 per cent, soft fruit for 7 4
per cent and ornamentals (including hardy
nursery stock, bulbs and flowers grown in
the open) for 6-6 per cent. More than one
vegetable crop is, in some cases, taken from
the same area of land in a year, so that the
estimated area actually cropped in 1990 was
259,000 hectares (639,000 acres).
Field vegetables account for about one-
third of the value of horticultural output
and are widely grown throughout the
country. Most horticultural enterprises are
increasing productivity with the help of
improved planting material, new techniques
and the widespread use of machinery.
Some field vegetables, for example, are
raised in blocks of compressed peat or
loose-filled cells, a technique which reduces
root damage and allows plants to establish
themselves more reliably and evenly.
Glasshouses are used for growing
tomatoes, cucumbers, sweet peppers,
lettuces, flowers, pot plants and nursery
stock. Widespread use is made of automatic
control of heating and ventilation, and
semi-automatic control of watering. Energy-
efficient glasshouses use thermal screens,
while low-cost plastic tunnels extend the
season for certain crops previously grown in
the open. Government grants are available
for replacing heated glass and heating
systems.
The Government also provides grants
for replanting apple and pear trees.
Under the European Community’s
Common Agricultural Policy (see p 287), a
wide range of horticultural produce is
subject to common quality standards.
Under Community rules, Britain has a
production limit of 2 5 million litres of
wine a year. It is produced in southern
England and south Wales.
Organic Farming
The Government aims to establish a frame¬
work in which organic farming in Britain
can respond to consumer demand. The
organic sector is eligible for the support
given to all farmers under a number of
general schemes. Other support includes a
significant commitment to research and
development.
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The United Kingdom Register of
Organic Food Standards is an independent
body set up in 1987 with government
support. It has established national
voluntary standards for organic food
production tied to a certification and
inspection scheme. It will also be
responsible for enforcing the Community
regulation on organic foodstuffs, adopted in
June 1991.
FOOD SAFETY
The Food Safety Directorate within the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food focuses ministry resources on
ensuring adequate supplies of the right
kinds of food, and its safety,
wholesomeness and proper labelling,
through regulations and guidelines. Food
safety responsibilities are separated from
food production and agriculture
responsibilities within the Ministry. The
Government’s commitment to food safety
was emphasised by the Food Safety Act
1990, which ensures food safety and
consumer protection throughout the food
chain. It combines basic provisions with
wide enabling powers, so that detailed
regulations made under the Act can adapt
to technological change and innovation. It
also introduces more effective enforcement
powers and greatly increased penalties for
offenders. A number of independent
advisory committees consisting ot
recognised experts advise the Government.
The Food Advisory Committee advises
ministers on the exercise of powers under
the Food Safety Act relating to the
labelling, composition and chemical safety
of food. The Advisory Committee on
Novel Foods and Processes advises on any
matter relating to the irradiation ot food or
to the manufacture of novel foods or foods
produced by novel processes. The Steering
Group on the Chemical Aspects of Food
Surveillance is charged with keeping
under review possible chemical
contamination of the national food supply
and monitoring the intakes of food
additives and nutrients. It is assisted by 11
working parties covering detailed aspects of
its work. The Advisory Committee on the
Microbiological Safety of Food advises on
matters relating to this topic and there is
also a Steering Group on the
Microbiological Safety of Food.
In addition, a consumer panel—nine
consumer members nominated by the main
consumer organisations, but appointed to
serve as individuals—gives consumers a
direct means of conveying their views on
food safety and consumer protection issues
to the Government.
EXPORTS
The Government encourages the growth of
exports related to agriculture. The volume
of these exports rose in 1990, when their
value amounted to £6,334 million, the
main markets being Western Europe,
North America and the Middle East.
Exports include speciality products
such as fresh salmon, Scotch whisky,
biscuits, jams and conserves, as
well as beef and lamb carcases and
cheese.
Food From Britain is a national
organisation which promotes the marketing
of food and agricultural produce in the
domestic and overseas markets. Food From
Britain and its export arm, the British
Food Export Council, receive support for
their export activity jointly from the
Government and from the food and drink
industry, while the British Agricultural
Export Committee of the London Chamber
of Commerce represents exporters of
technology, expertise and equipment. The
Agricultural Engineers’ Association
represents exporters of agricultural and
horticultural machinery. In 1990 Britain
exported £1,011 million of farm machinery
and spares.
One of the world’s largest agricultural
events, the annual Royal International
Agricultural Exhibition, held at
Stoneleigh in Warwickshire, provides an
opportunity for visitors to see the latest
techniques and improvements in British
agriculture. Over 201,000 visitors attended
286
i
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
in 1991, of whom 26,500 were from
overseas. Virtually every British agricultural
machinery manufacturer is represented at
the exhibition, which is also the most
important pedigree livestock event in the
country. Other major agricultural displays
include the annual Royal Smithfield Show,
held in London, which exhibits agricultural
machinery, livestock and carcases; the Royal
Highland Show; the Royal Welsh Show;
and the Royal Ulster Agricultural Show.
There are also important regional shows.
MARKETING
Agricultural products are marketed by
private traders, producers’ co-operatives
and marketing boards. The latter are
producers’ organisations (each including a
minority of independent members
appointed by agriculture ministers) with
certain statutory powers to regulate the
marketing of milk, wool and potatoes. For
the most part the boards buy from
producers or control contracts between
producers and first-hand buyers; the Potato
Marketing Board, however, maintains only
a broad control over marketing conditions,
leaving producers free to deal individually
with buyers. For home-grown cereals, meat
and livestock, apples and pears, there are
marketing organisations representing
producer, distributor and independent
interests.
Food From Britain is responsible for
improving the marketing of food and
agricultural products, both in the domestic
market and abroad. Its quality assurance
schemes guarantee a repeatable quality in a
number of product sectors.
Co-operatives
A substantial amount of agricultural and
horticultural produce, such as grain, fruit
and vegetables, is handled by marketing co¬
operatives, whose turnover exceeds £1,600
million a year. They have been formed to
meet the demand from retailers for a
continuous supply of fresh, quality produce.
Food From Britain provides a range of
advisory services for co-operatives.
ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT
Four government departments have joint
responsibility—the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food; the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department; the
Welsh Office; and the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland.
Common Agricultural Policy
The European Community’s Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) accounts for
about two-thirds of the Community’s
budget and aims to ensure stable
agricultural markets and a fair standard of
living for agricultural producers, and to
guarantee regular supplies of food at
reasonable prices. For many commodities
minimum prices are set annually at which
agencies of the member states will purchase
products, and there are levies on imports to
maintain internal support prices. Surpluses
are bought by intervention boards (the
Intervention Board executive agency in
Britain) to be stored and sold when
appropriate. Intervention stocks can be
disposed of within the Community where
this can be done without disrupting
internal markets. Exports are facilitated by
the provision of export refunds to bridge
any gap between Community prices and
world prices. In some cases, in particular in
the beef and sheep sectors, there are also
direct payments to producers—the suckler
cow premium and the annual premium on
ewes.
The support prices, as well as rates of
levy, export refunds and other aids, are set
in European Currency Units and are
converted into the currencies of the
member states at fixed rates of exchange—
‘green rates’—which can be out of line
with the market rate of exchange between
each currency and the European Currency
Unit. Monetary compensatory amounts,
based on the percentage difference between
the green and market rates of each
currency, are applied to prevent distortions
in trade. They operate as import subsidies
and export levies for countries whose
currencies’ market rates are below the
287
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
green rates, and as import levies and export
subsidies for countries whose currencies’
market rates are above the green rates.
Nearly all the Community’s agricultural
expenditure (£20,622 million in 1990) is
channelled through the European
Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee
Fund. The Fund’s guarantee section
finances market support arrangements,
while the guidance section provides funds
for structural reform—for example, farm
modernisation and investment—and
payments to assist certain farmers to
change to alternative enterprises.
Agricultural production under the CAP
has increased considerably in recent years,
partly in response to rapid technical
progress and farming efficiency, but also
reflecting the high level of price support
under the CAP. As consumption has
remained relatively stable, this has resulted
in the emergence of surpluses.
Britain has consistently pressed for CAP
reform, to bring supply and demand into
better balance, to increase the role of
market forces in agriculture and to make
environmental considerations an integral
part of the CAP. Britain has therefore
welcomed the Community’s recognition of
the urgent need for radical reform,
resulting in the publication in July 1991 of
detailed proposals for consideration by
Public Expenditure under the CAP

Agricultural Departments

member states. Considerable progress has
already been made. Average effective
Community support levels have been
reduced in real terms each year since 1984.
Since 1988 there has been a legally binding
limit on CAP market support expenditure.
Stabilisers have been brought in or extended
for most CAP commodities. Stabilisers
ensure that CAP support is automatically cut
if production exceeds specified quantities.
Significant price cuts of up to 20 per cent
have already been made in a number of
sectors.
Each annual price-fixing settlement since
1988 has consolidated this reform process,
the cost being within the guidelines
established by the Council of Ministers, and
the stabiliser mechanisms have remained
intact. The settlements have also helped to
improve the competitive position of British
farmers. Green pound devaluations have
been agreed which represent a significant
step in the process of meeting the
Community’s commitment to phasing out
the differences between ‘green’ and market
rates of exchange by the end of 1992.
GATT Uruguay Round
Agriculture was identified as a major issue
for the GATT round of multilateral trade
negotiations launched in 1986 (see p 370).
These aimed to achieve a freer and more
market-oriented agricultural trading system, j
and to agree cuts in production—and
exemptions from them. The Community
proposed reform on an aggregate measure of
support, which would be reduced by 30 per
cent between 1986 and 1996, with credit
for reforms already made. Tariffs would
replace other restrictions on market access,
and be reduced over the next five years,
with a corrective mechanism reflecting
changes in world markets. Britain hopes the
round can be completed before the end of
1991.
Price Guarantees, Grants and
Subsidies
Expenditure in Britain in 1990-91 on price
guarantees, grants and subsidies and on CAI
288
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
market regulations was estimated to be
£293 million and £1,665 million
respectively. About £1,615 million is to
be reimbursed from the Community
budget.
Potatoes and wool are not covered by
the CAP; potato market support measures
are operated through the Potato
Marketing Board and the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland, and a
price stabilisation fund for wool is
administered by the British Wool
Marketing Board. The Government
intends to end the guarantee arrangements
when parliamentary time permits.
Farmers are eligible for grants aimed at
environmental enhancement of their farms
and pollution control. Hill and upland
farmers can also benefit from headage
payments on cattle and sheep, known as
compensatory allowances. Launching aid
is available to production and marketing
groups in the horticultural sector.
In 1990 a further 36,000 hectares
(88,950 acres) in Britain were designated
Less Favoured Areas by the Community.
In these districts, where land quality is
poor, farmers benefit from enhanced
rates of grant and special payments on
livestock.
Smallholdings and Crofts
Local authorities provide some 5,650
statutory smallholdings in England and
920 in Wales. They make loans of up to
75 per cent of required working capital to
their tenants. Land settlement in Scotland
has been carried out by the Government,
which, while now seeking to dispose of
holdings to its sitting tenants, still owns
and maintains 121,461 hectares (300,000
acres) of land settlement estates,
comprising 1,479 crofts and holdings.
In the crofting areas of Scotland (in
Strathclyde, Highland, Western Isles,
Orkney and Shetland) much of the land is
held by tenants known as ‘crofters’.
Crofting is administered by the Crofters
Commission, and benefits from
government grants for land improvements
and some other agricultural work.
Tenancy Legislation
Approximately 36 per cent of agricultural
land in England and Wales is tenanted.
The agricultural holdings legislation
protects the interests and rights of
landlords and tenants, with provision for
arbitration in the event of a dispute. Most
agricultural tenants have the right to
contest a notice to quit, which is then
ineffective unless the landlord obtains
consent to its operation from an
independent body (in England and Wales,
the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in
Scotland, the Scottish Land Court). On
termination of tenancy, the tenant is
entitled to compensation in accordance
with a special code. Practically all farms in
Northern Ireland are owner-occupied, but,
under a practice known as ‘conacre’,
occupiers not wishing to farm all their
land let it annually to others. About
one-fifth of agricultural land is let under
this practice and is used mainly for
grazing.
Agriculture and Protection of the
Countryside
Agriculture ministers have a general duty,
under the Agriculture Act 1986, to seek to
achieve a reasonable balance between the
needs of an efficient and stable agriculture
industry and other interests in the
countryside, including the conservation of
its natural beauty and amenity and the
promotion of its enjoyment by the public.
In addition, they are required to further
conservation of the countryside in the
administration of farm capital grant
schemes both in National Parks and in
Sites of Special Scientific Interest
designated by the nature conservancy
bodies.
Environmentally Sensitive Areas
Under the Environmentally Sensitive
Areas (ESA) Scheme, a British idea which
other European Community members are
following, 19 areas in Britain—ten in
England, five in Scotland, two in Wales
289
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and two in Northern Ireland—have been
designated. They are notable for the
quality of their landscape, the wealth of
their flora and fauna, and their
vulnerability to change in farming
practices.
The areas are diverse in character and
include low-lying wetland grazing marshes,
chalk downs and upland tracts of heather—
for example, the Somerset Levels in
England; Loch Lomond in Scotland; the
Cambrian Mountains in Wales; and
Mourne in Northern Ireland. The scheme
is voluntary and farmers in ESAs are
offered agreements under which they
receive payments (partly funded by the
European Community) for farming along
environmentally beneficial lines intended to
conserve the special character of the area.
Monitoring and evaluation of those areas in
operation since 1987 have confirmed the
achievements of the scheme.
A ministerial review of ESA policy
concluded that ESAs should continue, with
the aim of securing further environmental
protection and enhancement. Some 115,960
hectares (286,500 acres) in the English
ESAs were covered by the agreements in
summer 1991—92 per cent of the target
area or 47 per cent of the potentially
available agricultural land. In the Scottish
ESAs, 104,725 hectares (258,785 acres)
were covered—60 per cent of eligible land.
Agricultural Buildings
The Government also intends to allow the
extension to all areas of England and
Wales of arrangements similar to those
which apply in National Parks. These
arrangements give local planning
authorities discretion to examine and
approve the siting, design and external
appearance of new agricultural and forestry
buildings. Authorities will also have to
consider the desirability of preserving
ancient monuments and their settings,
known archaeological sites, the settings of
listed buildings, and sites of recognised
nature conservation. Full development
control is to be extended to all farm
holdings of less than 5 hectares (12 acres).
Other Schemes
Farmers are encouraged to develop new
sources of income as an alternative to surplus
production through grants to diversify into
tourism and other non-agricultural activities
on the farm. The Farm Woodland Scheme
assists the planting of woodlands on
agricultural land, with incentives for
broadleaved trees and a planting limit of
36,000 hectares (88,950 acres) over three
years. The European Community set-aside
scheme, introduced in Britain in 1988, offers
annual payments to farmers to take at least
20 per cent of their arable land out of
agricultural production for five years.
Another, temporary (one-year), set-aside
scheme is available to producers who set
aside at least 15 per cent of the 1991 arable
area for 1991-92 and also reduce their cereals
area by 15 per cent in the same period.
Additional payments for managing five-year
set-aside land for the benefit of wildlife,
landscape and the local community are
available under the Countryside Premium
Scheme (at present limited to eastern
England). Under pilot Beef and Sheep
Extensification Schemes, farmers receive
annual compensation payments to reduce
output by at least 20 per cent and to
maintain this reduction over a five-year
period. The Government has also designated
ten nitrate-sensitive areas in England, where
payments are being made to farmers who
voluntarily undertake to restrict their
agricultural practices and thus prevent
unacceptable levels of nitrate leaching from
farmland into water sources. Applications
covering 87 per cent of the eligible
agricultural land had been received by the
scheme’s closing date of 31 May 1991.
In the Highlands and Islands of Scotland,
considered vulnerable to changes in the
CAP, the Rural Enterprise Programme offers
special funding, with Community support, to
encourage farmers and crofters to develop
new businesses.
Agricultural Training
The Agricultural Training Board receives
government grant to arrange training for the
290
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
agricultural industry. A recent report,
which envisaged the Board evolving a
more strategic role, as a broker for training
provision rather than as a direct course
provider, has led to considerable change. A
network of employer-led local boards has
been set up, to identify and arrange local
training needs in co-operation with
existing training providers (primarily
agricultural colleges) and in liaison with
Training and Enterprise Councils.
Training provision is arranged through
some 600 autonomous training groups
throughout Great Britain.
Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services
In England and Wales the Government’s
Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) provides a wide range of
professional, scientific and technical
services for agriculture and its ancillary
industries. Most types of advice and
servicing are on a fee-paying basis,
although initial advice to farmers on
conservation, rural diversification
(including use of land for woodlands) and
animal welfare is available free. Similar
services are provided in Scotland by the
Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries
Department and the Scottish Agricultural
College. In Northern Ireland these services
are available from the Department of
Agriculture’s advisory and scientific
services.
These organisations also advise the
Government on the scientific, technical
and business implications of policy
proposals and assist in implementing
policies concerning disease and pest
eradication, food hygiene, animal welfare,
land drainage and other capital grant
schemes, and safeguarding agricultural
land in relation to other land uses.
ADAS carries out research and
development work under commission from
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, and works under contract directly
for others and for levy-funded bodies.
These undertakings are carried out at a
range of experimental husbandry farms
across England and Wales, and through
regional centres or on clients’ premises.
The Central Science Laboratory also
carries out research and development work
commissioned by the Ministry.
CONTROL OF DISEASES AND
PESTS
Farm Animals
Britain is free from many serious animal
diseases. If they were to occur, diseases
such as foot-and-mouth disease and
classical swine fever would be combated
by a slaughter policy applied to all animals
infected or exposed to infection, and by
control over animal movements during the
outbreaks.
The Government has taken
comprehensive measures to tackle the
cattle disease bovine spongiform
encephalopathy and to ensure that
consumers are protected from any remote
risk. It has:
• banned the feeding of ruminant
protein to ruminants;
• ordered the destruction of the milk
and carcases of affected animals;
• banned from human or animal use
those offals from other cattle which
might be harbouring the agent; and
• committed significant funding for
research.
It has also established an expert
committee to advise on matters relating to
spongiform encephalopathies.
The Government has also ordered
restrictions on the movement of pigs to
prevent the spread of blue-eared pig
disease.
Strict controls are exercised on the
import of animals, birds, meat, and meat
products so as to prevent the introduction
of animal or avian diseases. Special
measures apply to prevent the introduction
of rabies, and dogs, cats and certain other
mammals are subject to import licence and
six months’ quarantine. There are severe
penalties for breaking the law. There have
291
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
been no cases of rabies outside quarantine
in Britain since 1970.
It is the responsibility of the livestock
sector to dispose of its waste, including the
carcases of dead animals, within the
framework of health and environmental
restrictions. Research is in progress to find
ways of minimising the cost of waste
disposal.
Professional advice and action on the
control of animal disease and the welfare of
farm livestock are the responsibility of the
government State Veterinary Service. Its
laboratory facilities and investigation
centres perform specialist research work
and advise private practitioners responsible
for treating animals on the farm.
Fish
The fisheries departments operate statutory
controls to prevent the introduction and
spread of serious diseases of fish and
shellfish. These controls include the
licensing of live fish imports, the licensing
of deposits of shellfish on the seabed, and
movement restrictions on sites where
outbreaks of notifiable diseases have been
confirmed.
Plants
The agriculture departments are
responsible for limiting the spread of plant
pests and diseases and for preventing the
introduction of new ones. They also issue
the health certificates required by other
countries to accompany plant material
exported from Britain. Certification
schemes encourage the development of
healthy and true-to-type planting stocks.
Pesticides
There are strict controls on the supply and
use of pesticides, and their maximum
residue levels. All pesticides supplied in
Britain must be approved for their safety
and efficacy in use. Controls on pesticides
are the joint responsibility of six
government departments on the basis of
advice from the independent Advisory
Committee on Pesticides. The Government
is currently reviewing pesticides approved
before 1981.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The manufacture, sale and supply of
veterinary medicinal products are prohibited
except under licence. Licences are issued by
the agriculture ministers, who are advised on
safety, quality and efficacy by the Veterinary
Products Committee, which comprises
independent experts.
Fisheries
Britain, one of the European Community’s
leading fishing nations, plays an active role
in the implementation and development of
the Community’s Common Fisheries Policy
(CFP) agreed in 1983. The CFP covers
access to coastal waters, the conservation and
management of fish stocks, fisheries
arrangements with third countries, the
allocation of catch quotas among member
states, the trade in and marketing of fish and
fish products, and financial aid to promote
the adaptation and development of the
Community’s fishing fleet.
The fishing industry provides 59 per
cent by quantity of British fish supplies,
and is an important source of
employment and income in a number
of ports.
Cod, haddock, whiting, herring, plaice

mackerel, together with cod and other
demersal fish, off the west coast of Scotland,
sole, plaice, cod, herring and whiting in the
Irish Sea; and mackerel, sole and plaice off
the south-west coast of England. Nephrops,
crabs, lobsters and other shellfish are found
in the inshore waters all around the coast. At
the end of 1989 there were 17,825 fishermen
in regular employment and 5,137 occasionally
employed. The Government aims to
encourage the development of a viable,
efficient and market-oriented fisheries
industry within the CFP framework.

vessels under 24 4 m (80 ft) in length and
204 deep-sea vessels longer than 24 4 m.
Among the main ports from which the
fishing fleet operates are Aberdeen,
Peterhead, Fraserburgh (Grampian),
Lerwick (Shetland), Kinlochbervie,
Ullapool (Highland), North Shields (Tyne
and Wear), Grimsby (Humberside),
Lowestoft (Suffolk), Brixham (Devon),
Newlyn (Cornwall), and Kilkeel, Ardglass
and Portavogie (Northern Ireland). With
the extension of fishery limits to 200 miles,
Britain’s distant water fleet was
considerably reduced. A much smaller fleet
has, however, continued to maintain its
activities in distant waters.
Fish Caught
In 1990 demersal fish (caught on or near
the bottom of the sea) accounted for 43 per
cent by weight of total British landings,
pelagic fish (caught near the surface) for 42
per cent and shellfish for 15 per cent.
Landings of all types of fish (excluding
salmon and trout) by British fishing vessels
totalled 621,010 tonnes. Cod and haddock
represented 23 and 18 per cent respectively
of the total value of demersal and pelagic
fish landed, while anglerfish (8 per cent),
whiting (8 per cent), plaice (7 per cent),
mackerel (5 per cent), and sole (4 per cent)
were the other most important sources of
earnings to the industry. Landings of
nephrops represented 11 per cent of the
total value of all British landings of fish
and shellfish in 1990.
Imports of fresh, frozen, cured and
canned salt-water fish and shellfish in 1990
totalled 439,720 tonnes, those of freshwater
fish 43,328 tonnes, those of fish meal
274,358 tonnes and those of fish oils
164,186 tonnes. Exports and re-exports of
salt-water fish and fish products amounted
to 343,663 tonnes and those of freshwater
fish to 17,722 tonnes.
The Fishing Fleet
At the end of 1989 the active British
fishing fleet consisted of 8,079 inshore
Fish Farming
Fish farming production is centred on
Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, which
are particularly suited to Britain’s climate
and waters. Production of salmon and
trout has grown from less than 1,000
tonnes in the early 1970s to some 32,400
tonnes of salmon and 15,000 tonnes of
trout in 1990. Scotland produces the
largest amount of farmed salmon (32,000
tonnes in 1990—with a first-sale value of
£120 million) in the European
Community. Shellfish farming concentrates
on molluscs such as oysters, mussels, clams
and scallops, producing an estimated 5,000
tonnes a year.
The fish and shellfish farming
industries make an important contribution
to rural infrastructure, especially in remote
areas such as the Highlands and Islands of
Scotland. In 1990 the industries were
estimated to have a combined wholesale
turnover of some £140 million. Production
is based on almost 1,200 businesses
operating from some 1,800 sites and
employing more than 5,000 people.
Administration
The fisheries departments are responsible
for the administration of legislation
concerning the fishing industry and for
fisheries research. The safety and welfare
of crews of fishing vessels and other
293
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
matters common to shipping generally are
provided for under legislation administered
by the Department of Transport.
The Sea Fish Industry Authority is
concerned with all aspects of the industry,
including consumer interests. It
undertakes research and development,
provides training, and encourages quality
awareness. It also administers a
government grant scheme for fishing
vessels, to promote a safe, efficient and
modern fleet.
Fishery Limits
Only British vessels may fish within 6
miles of the coast; certain other
Community member states have
traditional fishing rights between 6 and 12
miles, as British vessels have in other
member states’ coastal waters. Outside 12
miles the only non-Community countries
whose vessels may fish in Community
waters are those (for example, Norway)
with which the Community has reciprocal
fisheries agreements.
Common Fisheries Policy
The CFP’s system for the conservation
and management of the Community’s
fishing resources means that total
allowable catches—with these decisions
based partly on independent scientific
advice—are set each year in order to
conserve stocks. These catch levels are
then allocated between member states on a
fixed percentage basis, taking account of
traditional fishing patterns. Activity is also
regulated by a number of technical
conservation measures, including
minimum mesh sizes, minimum landing
sizes and closed areas designated mainly to
protect young fish. Each member state is
responsible for ensuring that its fishermen
abide by the various fisheries regulations
and their performances are monitored by
the Community’s inspectors.
The 1983 settlement also covered the
common organisation of the market in fish
and fish products, and a policy for
restructuring the Community fleet during
1987-97, designed to address the current
problem of over-capacity. The measures
include financial assistance for the building
and modernisation of fishing vessels.
Fishery relations between the European
Community and other countries are
extensive and are governed by different
agreements. Those of most importance to
Britain are with Norway, Greenland, the
Faroe Islands and Sweden. Annual
Community quotas have also been
established in international waters in the
north-west Atlantic and around Svalbard.
Fish Hygiene Directive
The single European market aims to
facilitate trade among Community members
and to protect public health by
harmonising measures for the handling and
treatment of all fish and shellfish (including
aquaculture products) at all stages up to,
but excluding, retail level. It will take effect
from 1 January 1993, and lays down rules
to ensure the safe and hygienic handling of
fish and fish products. This includes the
conditions on board factory vessels;
requirements during and after landing,
including auction markets on shore; and
establishments on land, primarily
processors. The single market provisions
also lay down the conditions for processed
products, as well as hygiene rules for those
who come into contact with fish and fish
products.
Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
Salmon and sea-trout are fished
commercially in inshore waters around the
British coast. Eels and elvers are also taken
commercially in both estuaries and
freshwater. Angling for salmon and sea-
trout (game fishing) and for other
freshwater species (coarse fishing) is
popular throughout Britain. In England
and Wales fishing is licensed by the
National Rivers Authority; in Scotland
salmon fishing is administered by salmon
district fishery boards. In Northern Ireland
fishing is licensed by the Fisheries
Conservancy Board for Northern Ireland

Agriculture, Fisheries and
Research
The total government-funded programme
of research and development in agriculture,
fisheries and food in 1991-92 amounts to
some £250 million, including funding by
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, the Scottish Office Agriculture and
Fisheries Department, the Department of
Agriculture for Northern Ireland and the
Department of Education and Science
science budget.
The agriculture departments, the
Agricultural and Food Research Council
(AFRC) and private industry share
responsibility for research, which is carried
out in a network of research institutes,
specialist laboratories and experimental
husbandry farms, and with Horticulture
Research International (HRI; established in
1990) and in higher education institutions.
Agriculture and Food Research
The research aims to maintain an efficient
and competitive industry in Britain
consistent with high standards of animal
welfare and care for the environment. The
work of the AFRC and the agriculture
departments is co-ordinated into national
programmes, primarily on the recommen¬
dations of the Priorities Board for Research
and Development in Agriculture and Food.
The Board advises on the research needs
and on the allocation of available resources
between and within areas of research.
The AFRC (see p383), a non-
departmental public body, receives funds
from the science budget through the
Department of Education and Science, and
income from work commissioned by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, by industry and by other bodies.
The Council is responsible for research
carried out in its seven institutes and in
British higher education institutions
through its research grants scheme. In
addition to commissioning research with
the AFRC and other organisations, such as
HRI, the Ministry commissions research
and development at its Food Science
Laboratories, at the Central Veterinary
Laboratory and at the Central Science
Laboratory, and with ADAS.
The five Scottish Agricultural Research
Institutes, funded by the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department,
cover areas of research complementary to
those of the AFRC institutes, while
including work relevant to the soils, crops
and livestock of northern Britain.
Development work in Scotland is carried
out by the Scottish Agricultural College,
which operates from three centres.
In Northern Ireland research is carried
out by the Department of Agriculture in a
number of research divisions and at the
three agricultural colleges. Links with the
Queen’s University of Belfast and the
Agricultural Research Institute of Northern
Ireland include basic and strategic research.
Agricultural research is also conducted
or sponsored by private industry, in
particular by related industries such as
agrochemicals and agricultural machinery.
In addition, the food industry funds or
undertakes relevant research. The
Government funds strategic research
essential for the public good, for example,
into food safety, human health, animal
welfare and flood protection, but has
withdrawn funding from research which
promises commercial application or
exploitation within a reasonable timescale—
for which it looks to industry to take on a
greater degree of funding.
The Ministry spends £50 million of its
£120 million annual research budget on
research relevant to the environment. This
includes the protection of the countryside,
water supplies and rivers; ensuring that
straw and other crop residues are disposed
of other than by burning—a practice to be
banned after the 1992 harvest; reducing the
use of pesticides to the minimum
compatible with efficient production; flood

and coastal defences; and care of the marine
environment. By the end of 1992—93 the
Ministry will have spent £\2 million on
research into bovine spongiform
encephalopathy.
Fisheries and Aquatic Environment
Research
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food laboratories deal with marine and
freshwater fisheries, shellfish, marine
pollution, fish farming and disease.
Research work is also commissioned by the
Ministry with the Natural Environment
Research Council, with the Sea Fish
Industry Authority and with a number of
universities and polytechnics. The Ministry
has two seagoing research vessels. In
Scotland, the Scottish Office Agriculture
and Fisheries Department undertakes a
similar, and complementary, range of
research and also has two seagoing vessels.
The Department of Agriculture laboratories
in Northern Ireland undertake research on
marine and freshwater fisheries, and also
have a seagoing research vessel.
Forestry
Woodland covers an estimated 2-38 million
hectares (5-88 million acres) in Britain:
about 7 per cent of England, 13 per cent of
Scotland, 12 per cent of Wales and 5 per
cent of Northern Ireland. The Government
supports the continued expansion of
forestry in order to reduce dependence on
imports of timber and to provide
employment in forestry and related
industries.
The area of productive forest in Great
Britain is 2-13 million hectares (5 26 million
acres), 40 6 per cent of which is managed
by the Forestry Commission and the rest
by private owners. The rate of new
planting in 1989-90 was 4,081 hectares
(10,084 acres) by the Commission and
18,892 hectares (46,682 acres) by private
woodland owners, with the help of grants
from the Commission, mainly in Scotland.
Most planting is of conifers in upland
areas, though the planting of broadleaved
trees is encouraged on suitable sites. An
increasing proportion of new planting is by
private owners.
The Commission’s expanded Woodland
Grant Scheme pays establishment grants to
help in the creation of new woodlands and
forests and for the regeneration of existing
ones. It highlights such features as native
tree species, woody shrubs, short-rotation
coppice and agroforestry. Management
grants under the scheme contribute to the
cost of managing woodlands to provide
silvicultural, environmental and social
benefits.
Total employment in state and private
forests in Great Britain was estimated at
40,245 in 1989-90, including about 10,000
people engaged in processing home-grown
timber.
British woodlands meet 12-7 per cent of
the nation’s consumption of wood and
wood products. The volume of timber
harvested on Commission lands in 1989-90
totalled 3 55 million cubic metres (125 37
million cubic feet).
The Forestry Commission and
Forestry Policy
The Forestry Commission is the national
forestry authority in Great Britain. The
Commissioners give advice on forestry
matters and are responsible to the
Secretary of State for Scotland, the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the Secretary of State for Wales.
Timber production, landscape amenity,
environmental protection and employment
are all forestry policy objectives. The
Commission’s activities also include
wildlife and flora conservation, plant
health, research, and the provision of
facilities for recreation. The Commission
has sold 76,737 hectares (189,624 acres) of
plantation and plantable land since 1981
and has been asked by the Government to
dispose of a further 100,000 hectares
(247,000 acres) by the end of the century.
The Commission is financed partly by the
Government and partly by receipts from
sales of timber and other produce and
from rents.
296
AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY
Forestry Initiatives
The Countryside Commissions and the
Forestry Commission plan the creation of
12 community forests (covering between
10,000 and 20,000 hectares each—40 to 80
sq miles) on the outskirts of major cities in
England and Wales. These include the
Great North Forest (Tyne and Wear), the
Forest of Mercia (Staffordshire) and
Thames Chase, east of London. As part of
its rural initiative for Wales, the
Government plans to give local
communities greater involvement in the
development of 35,000 hectares (135 sq
miles) of forest in the coalfield valleys of
south Wales—about 20 per cent of the
land area—owned by the Forestry
Commission.
Forestry Research
The Forestry Commission maintains two
principal research stations, at Alice Holt
Lodge near Farnham (Surrey) and at Bush
Estate near Edinburgh, for basic and
applied research into all aspects of forestry.
Aid is also given for research work in
universities and other institutions.
The Commission conducts an annual
forest health survey which monitors the
effects of air pollution and other stress
factors on a growing range of broadleaves
and conifers. It has increased research into
wildlife conservation and farm forestry,
including an evaluation of agroforestry
systems combining wide-spaced conifers and
broadleaves with sheep grazing. The
Government has set up an expert scientific
review group on tree health in Britain.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
The Department of Agriculture may acquire
land for afforestation and give financial and
technical assistance for private planting. The
state forest area has grown steadily since
1945. By 1991, 60,000 hectares (150,000
acres) of plantable land had been acquired, of
which 59,000 hectares (147,500 acres) were
planted. There were 15,500 hectares (38,750
acres) of privately owned forest. Some 500
professional and industrial staff work in state
forests.
17 Transport and
Communications
Major improvements in transport have
resulted from the construction of a network of
motorways, the extension of fast inter-city rail
services and expansion schemes at many
airports. Transport policy rests on the
fundamental aims of:
• promoting economic growth and higher
national prosperity;
• ensuring a reasonable level of personal
mobility;
• improving safety;
• conserving and enhancing the
environment; and
• using energy economically.
Britain is taking an active part in the
European Community’s development of a
common transport policy.
Users’ expenditure on transport, including
taxation, in Britain totalled an estimated
£86,600 million in 1988, of which £71,500
million represented expenditure on road
transport (including buses).
Inland Transport
There has been a considerable increase in
passenger travel in recent years. Travel in
Great Britain rose by 39 per cent between
1979 and 1989. Travel by car and taxi rose by
42 per cent and air travel expanded rapidly.
However, recently, travel by motor cycle has
been declining, and travel by bus and coach
and by pedal cycle has changed little.
Car and taxi travel accounts for 85 per
cent of passenger mileage within Great
Britain, buses and coaches for about
6 per cent, rail for 6 per cent and air less
than 1 per cent.
Car ownership has also risen substantially,
and 66 per cent of households in Great Britain
have the regular use of one or more cars, with
22 per cent having the use of two or more cars
in 1989. At the end of 1990 there were 24-7
million vehicles licensed for use on the roads
of Great Britain, of which 20 2 million were

a In addition, there were 68 km (42 miles) of local authority motorway in England and 24 km (15 miles) in Scotland, in April 1990, 108 km
(67 miles) of trunk motorway were under construction in England and 11 km (7 miles) in Scotland.

cars (including over 2 5 million cars registered
in the name of a company); 2-2 million light
goods vehicles; 482,000 other goods vehicles;
833,000 motor cycles, scooters and mopeds;
and 115,000 public transport vehicles
(including taxis).
ROADS
Total traffic for 1990 was 404,000 million
vehicle-km. The total road network in Great
Britain in 1990 was 358,000 km (222,000
miles). Trunk motorways accounted for 2,993
km (1,860 miles) of this length, less than 1 per
cent, and trunk roads for 12,700 km (7,900
miles), or about 3 5 per cent. However,
motorways carry over 15 per cent of all traffic
and trunk roads over 17 per cent. Combined,
they carry over half of all heavy goods vehicle
traffic in Great Britain.
Administration
Responsibility for trunk roads, including most
motorways, in Great Britain rests in England
with the Secretary of State for Transport, in
Scotland with the Secretary of State for
Scotland and in Wales with the Secretary of
State for Wales. The costs of construction and
maintenance are paid for by central
government. The highway authorities for
non-trunk roads are:
• in England, the county councils, the
metropolitan district councils, the
London borough councils and the
Common Council of the City of London;
• in Wales, the county councils; and
• in Scotland, the regional or islands
councils.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland
Department of the Environment is
responsible for the construction, improvement
and maintenance of all public roads.
Research into all aspects of road transport
is carried out by the Transport and Road
Research Laboratory, which is part of the
Department of Transport. It provides the
technical help and advice which enables the
Government to set standards for highway and
vehicle design and to formulate transport,
environmental and road safety policies.
Through the Overseas Development
Administration, the Laboratory also helps
developing countries with research to help
solve their particular road transport problems.
Private Finance
The Government encourages greater private
sector involvement in the design,
construction, operation and funding of roads.
A framework for encouraging privately
funded schemes is provided in the New Roads
and Street Works Act 1991. Privately funded
schemes being undertaken include:
• a crossing of the River Thames at
Dartford, which will open to traffic in
autumn 1991 and link into the M25
London orbital motorway;
• a second crossing of the River Severn,
which is expected to be completed by late
1995;
• a relief road north of Birmingham, which
will be the first overland toll route in
Britain; and
• a bridge between the mainland of
Scotland and Skye, for which a tenderer
has been chosen.
The Government is considering how the
private sector can help provide longer term
additional motorway capacity between
Birmingham and Manchester. It also proposes
to hold a competition for an orbital route to
complete the motorway box around the West
Midlands conurbation. A new crossing of the
Tamar estuary at Plymouth and a link
between the M25 and Chelmsford (Essex)
have also been identified as suitable for
private finance.
Other Developments
The Government has a major programme to
improve motorways and other trunk roads. In
mid-1991, some 80 trunk road and motorway
schemes were under construction in England,
costing nearly £1,300 million, while over 400
schemes were in preparation. Bypasses and
relief roads account for nearly one-third of th<
programme, which also includes projects
intended to increase the traffic capacity of
major through routes and to improve
300
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
junctions on heavily used roads. In 1991-92
the Department of Transport is supporting
306 major local authority road schemes, the
majority of which are bypasses or relief roads.
Road communications in Wales are
expected to benefit from the second Severn
crossing and improvements to the M4
motorway. Other priorities in Wales are
improvements to the coast road in north
Wales (including the construction under the
Conwy estuary of the first immersed tube
road tunnel to be built in Britain, due to be
opened in October 1991) and the upgrading of
roads which are important for industrial
redevelopment.
The key priorities within the programme
in Scotland include the upgrading of the A74
to three-lane motorway standard and
completion of the central Scotland motorway
network. These routes provide links for
commerce and industry to the south and
Europe. The programme also includes
completion of the dual-carriageway
improvement between Stirling and Aberdeen.
Other planned improvements include a series
of ‘route action plans’ designed to improve
substantially safety and journey times on
specific major routes.
In Northern Ireland the emphasis is on
improving arterial routes, constructing more
bypasses, and improving roads in the Belfast
area, including the construction of a new
cross-harbour link planned for the mid-1990s.
Licensing and Standards
Official records of drivers and vehicles are
maintained by the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency. It holds records on 33
million drivers and 24.2 million licensed
vehicles in Great Britain. In April 1990 the
Agency began to issue a new harmonised
European Community driving licence. New
drivers of motor vehicles are required to pass
a driving test before being granted a full
licence to drive. The Driving Standards
Agency is the national driver testing
authority. It also supervises professional
driving instructors and is responsible for the
compulsory basic training scheme for
motorcyclists. Minimum ages for driving are:
• 16 for riders of mopeds and disabled
drivers of specially adapted vehicles;
• 17 for drivers of cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver), motor
cycles and goods vehicles not over 3-5
tonnes permissible maximum weight;
• 18 for goods vehicles over 3-5 but not
over 7-5 tonnes; and
• 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine
seats and goods vehicles over 7 5 tonnes.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles
are allowed on the roads, they are required to
meet a number of safety and environmental
requirements, based primarily on standards
drawn up by the European Community. This
form of control, known as type approval, is
operated by the Vehicle Certification Agency.
The Secretary of State for Transport has a
statutory responsibility for ensuring the
roadworthiness of vehicles in use on the
roads. The Vehicle Inspectorate is the
national testing authority. It meets this
responsibility mainly through:
• annual testing and certification of heavy
goods vehicles, buses and coaches;
• administration of the car and motor cycle
testing scheme, under which vehicles are
tested at private garages authorised as test
stations; and
• means such as vehicle ‘spot checks’ and
inspection of operators’ premises.
In Northern Ireland private cars five or more
years old are tested at official vehicle
inspection centres.
Road Safety
Although Great Britain has one of the
highest densities of road traffic in the
world, it has a good record on road safety,
with one of the lowest road accident death
rates in the European Community. In 1990
some 5,100 people were killed on the roads,
60,400 seriously injured and 274,600
slightly injured. This compares with over
8,000 deaths a year in the mid-1960s. A
number of factors, such as developments in
vehicle safety standards and improvements
in roads, the introduction of legislation
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on seat belt wearing and drinking and driving,
plus developments in road safety training,
education and publicity, have contributed to
the long-term decline in casualty rates.
The Government’s aim is to reduce road
casualties by one-third by the end of the
century, compared with the 1981—85 average.
To achieve this, resources are being
concentrated on measures which are
demonstrably cost-effective in terms of
casualty reduction. Priority is given to
reducing casualties among vulnerable
road-users (pedestrians, cyclists and motor
cyclists), particularly in urban areas, where
some 70 per cent of road accidents occur.
Other areas for achieving lower casualties
are improvements in highway design,
better protection for vehicle occupants
and measures to combat drinking and driving.
Road Traffic Act
The Road Traffic Act 1991 introduces several
additional measures to improve road safety,
including:
• a new offence of dangerous driving;
• mandatory retesting of drivers convicted
of the most serious driving offences;
• a new offence, in England and Wales, of
endangerment, to deal with vandals who
put lives at risk by damaging road signs
or dropping objects onto roads;
• tougher measures to deal with drink-drive
offenders;
• the use of new technology, such as
remote-operated cameras and radar
speed-detectors, to improve the detection
of speeding and traffic-light offences;
• new powers to prohibit dangerous
vehicles; and
• measures to reduce the impact of
congestion through the introduction of
better facilities for cyclists and
pedestrians and traffic calming measures
near busy routes.
Traffic in Towns
Traffic management schemes are used in
many urban areas to reduce congestion, create
a better environment and improve road safety.
Such schemes include, for example, one-way
streets, bus lanes, facilities for pedestrians and
cyclists, and traffic calming measures such as
road humps to slow traffic in residential areas, j
Many towns have shopping precincts which
are designed for the convenience of
pedestrians and from which motor vehicles
are excluded for all or part of the day.
Controls over on-street parking are enforced
through excess charges and fixed penalties,
supported where appropriate by powers to
remove vehicles. In parts of London wheel
clamping to immobilise illegally parked
vehicles is also used.
In London the Road Traffic Act 1991
authorises a network of ‘red routes’, on which
special parking controls and other traffic
management measures, rigidly enforced, will
improve traffic movement. Monitoring of a
pilot scheme introduced in north and east
London in January 1991 has so far shown
significant falls in journey time and greater
reliability, especially for buses. The Act also
allows for more effective parking enforcement
shared between the police and local
authorities, with London-wide powers to
clamp or remove offenders’ vehicles.
A pilot electronic driver information
system called ‘Autoguide’ will be introduced
in the London area in 1992. It uses roadside
beacons to transmit route information to
vehicles equipped to receive it; data can be
updated continuously to take account of
changing traffic conditions.
ROAD HAULAGE
Road haulage traffic by heavy goods vehicles
amounted to 130,600 million tonne-km in
1990, 1 per cent more than in 1989. There has
been a move towards larger and more efficient
vehicles carrying heavier loads—about 78 per
cent of the traffic, in terms of tonne-km, is
carried in vehicles of over 25 tonnes gross
laden weight. Much of the traffic is moved
over short distances, with 75 per cent of the
tonnage being carried on hauls of 100 km (62
miles) or less. Public haulage (private road
hauliers carrying other firms’ goods) accounts
for 72 per cent of freight carried in Great
Britain in terms of tonne-km. In 1990 the
302
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
main commodities handled by heavy goods
vehicles were:
• crude minerals (354 million tonnes);
• food, drink and tobacco (299 million
tonnes); and
• building materials (178 million tonnes).
Road haulage is predominantly an industry
of small, privately owned businesses. There
were some 132,000 holders of an operator’s
licence in 1990. About half the heavy goods
vehicles are in fleets of ten or fewer vehicles.
The biggest operators in Great Britain are
NFC pic, Transport Development Group pic,
TNT Express (UK) Ltd and United Carriers
International Ltd.
Licensing and Other Controls
In general, those operating goods vehicles
over 3-5 tonnes gross weight require an
operator’s licence. Licences are divided into
restricted licences for firms carrying their own
goods, and standard licences for hauliers
operating for hire or payment. Proof of
professional competence, financial standing
and good repute is needed to obtain a
standard licence. Regulations lay down limits
on the hours worked by drivers of goods
vehicles, as well as minimum rest periods.
Tachographs (which automatically record
speed, distance covered, driving time and
stopping periods) must be fitted and used in
most goods vehicles over 3-5 tonnes gross
weight in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland
operators carrying their own goods do not
require a licence. The Government has
announced a proposal to fit speed limiters to
heavy lorries, preventing them from travelling
above 60 mph (97 km/h).
International Road Haulage
International road haulage has grown rapidly
and in 1990 over L3 million road goods
vehicles were ferried to the continent or the
Irish Republic. Of these, 347,000 were
powered vehicles registered in Britain; they
carried over 9 million tonnes to and from
continental Europe. The average length of
haul by these vehicles was 1,167 km (725
miles) outwards and 1,097 km (683 miles)
inwards, compared with 79 km (49 miles) for
national road haulage. In addition, much
traffic crossed the Irish land boundary.
International road haulage has been
constrained by the need for permits issued
under bilateral agreements with the 26
countries concerned. Many countries place no
restriction on the number of British lorries
entering the country concerned, but some
agreements specify an annual quota of permits.
Quotas of European Community permits are
also available which allow international haulage
or cabotage anywhere within the Community.
Full liberalisation of international road haulage
within the Community without permits will
apply from January 1993.
PASSENGER SERVICES
Major changes in the structure of the
passenger transport industry have occurred in
recent years. Privatisation of the National Bus
Company (which was the largest single bus
and coach operator in Britain, operating
through 72 subsidiaries in England and
Wales) was completed in 1988. Each
subsidiary was sold separately, and
encouragement was given for a buy-out by the
local management or employees. Under the
Transport (Scotland) Act 1989 the Scottish
Bus Group, the largest operator of bus
services in Scotland, is being privatised as ten
separate companies. It had some 3,000
buses. Legislation also facilitated the
privatisation of bus services run by municipal
authorities.
London Transport (LT) is a statutory
corporation, with its board members
appointed by the Secretary of State for
Transport. Within LT the main wholly
owned operating subsidiaries are London
Underground Ltd, London Buses Ltd and
Docklands Light Railway Ltd. Financial
support—almost entirely for capital projects
—is provided by central government. LT is
required to involve the private sector in the
provision of services where this is more
efficient, and has been set objectives on safety,
the quality of services and on its financial
performance. Many London bus routes are
now run by private firms operating under
contract to LT.
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Northern Ireland almost all road
passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the publicly owned Northern
Ireland Transport Holding Company. Citybus
Ltd operates services in the city of Belfast and
Ulsterbus Ltd operates most of the services in
the rest of Northern Ireland. These companies
have some 300 and 1,000 vehicles respectively.
As well as the major bus operators, there
are also a large number of small, privately
owned undertakings, often operating fewer
than five vehicles. Double-deck buses are the
main type of vehicle used for urban road
passenger transport in Britain, with some
23,000 in operation. However, there has been
a substantial increase in the number of
minibuses and midibuses in recent years, with
some 19,000 now in use. In addition, there are
some 31,000 other single-deck buses and
coaches. Blackpool and Llandudno have
Britain’s only remaining tramway systems.
Deregulation
Local bus services in Great Britain (except in
London) were deregulated in 1986. Bus
operators are now able to run routes without
needing a special licence. Local authorities
can subsidise the provision of socially neces¬
sary services after competitive tendering. Six
weeks’ notice of the introduction, variation or
cancellation of a service has to be given to the
appropriate traffic commissioner (one for each
of the nine traffic areas of Great Britain).
Deregulation led to an increase of 19 per
cent in local bus mileage outside London
between 1985-86 and 1989-90, with some 83
per cent of services operated without subsidy.
Over the same period the number of
passengers has fallen by 14 per cent outside
London, in line with long-term trends. De¬
regulation also had a noticeable effect during
the 1980s on long-distance express coach
services, bringing about reductions in fares,
the provision of more services and an increase
in passengers. The Government is proposing
the deregulation of bus services in London.
Taxis
There are about 51,000 licensed taxis in Great
Britain, mainly in urban areas; London has
some 16,000. In London and a number of
other cities taxis must be purpose-built to
conform to very strict requirements and
drivers must have passed a test of their
knowledge of the area. Private hire vehicles
with drivers may be booked only through the
operator and not hired on the street; in most
areas outside London private hire vehicles are
licensed.
A local authority can refuse to grant a taxi i
licence only if it is satisfied that there is no
unfulfilled demand for taxis in its area. Taxi
operators are able to run regular local services
and can tender in competition with bus
operators for services subsidised by local
authorities. To do this, they may apply for a
special ‘restricted’ bus operator’s licence,
allowing them to run local services without
having to obtain a full bus operator’s licence.
Taxis and licensed private hire vehicles may
also offer shared rides to passengers paying
separate fares.
In Northern Ireland there are some 4,000
licensed taxis. Licences are issued by the
Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland on a basis broadly similar to that in
Great Britain.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in
1825, was the first public passenger railway in
the world to be worked by steam power. The
main railway companies in Great Britain were
nationalised in 1948. In Northern Ireland the
Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd, a
subsidiary of the Northern Ireland Transport
Holding Company, operates the railway
service on some 320 km (200 miles) of track.
Organisation
The British Railways Board, set up in 1962,
controls most of the railway network in Great
Britain. Of its five business sectors, InterCity,
Network SouthEast and Regional Railways
services are responsible for the passenger
services. The other two sectors are Railfreight
Distribution and Trainload Freight. A
subsidiary company, European Passenger
Services Ltd, has been set up to operate
304
TRANSPOR T AND COMMUNICATIONS
international rail services through the Channel
Tunnel. Other subsidiary businesses are
British Rail Maintenance Ltd, which is
responsible for maintenance and light repair
of British Rail rolling stock; Transmark,
which provides consultancy services overseas
on railway and associated operations; and BR
Telecommunications, a new company
marketing communications services.
British Rail is currently developing its
sector structure further to devolve decision¬
making from the Board’s headquarters. The
aim is to make the sectors more responsive to
customer requirements.
The Government has decided to privatise
British Rail and is considering how best this
can be achieved.
Operations
In 1990-91 the Board’s turnover, including
financial support and income from other
activities but excluding internal transactions,
was £3,711 million, of which £2,825 million
was derived from rail passenger services and
£682 million from freight services. It received
grants of £602 million as compensation for
the public service obligation to operate
sections of the passenger network in the
Regional sector and Network SouthEast
which would not otherwise cover their cost.
New objectives for British Rail were
announced in December 1989. Safety remains
a high priority, including the implementation
of the safety recommendations of the inquiry
into a major railway accident at Clapham
Junction (south London) in December 1988.
British Rail has a substantial investment
programme. Investment totalled £858 million
in 1990-91 and is expected to rise to over
£1,000 million in each of the three years from
1991-92.
Major areas of expenditure in British Rail’s
investment programme include:
• rolling stock and facilities for Channel
Tunnel traffic from 1993 (see p 308);
• new rolling stock and infrastructure
improvements in Network SouthEast;
and
• investment in new diesel multiple-unit
trains in the Regional Railways sector.
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map, p 307)
comprises a fast inter-city network, linking the
main centres of Great Britain; local stopping
services; and commuter services in and around
the large conurbations, especially London and
south-east England. British Rail runs over 700
InterCity expresses each weekday, serving
about 90 business and leisure centres.
InterCity 125 trains, travelling at maximum

a In addition, a number of privately owned wagons and locomotives are operated on the railway network for customers of British Rail.
Some 13,640 freight vehicles and 15 diesel locomotives were authorised for working on the network at the end of March 1991.

BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
sustained speeds of 125 mph (201 km/h),
provide over 40 per cent of InterCity train
mileage and are the world’s fastest diesel
trains. They operate from London:
• to the west of England and south Wales;
• to the East Midlands; and
• on cross-country services through the
West Midlands, linking south-west
England or south Wales with north-west
England or north-east England and
Edinburgh.
About 28 per cent of route-mileage is
electrified, including British Rail’s busiest
InterCity route, linking London, the West
Midlands, the North West and Glasgow. The
most recent major electrification scheme is
that for the east-coast main line between
London and Edinburgh (including the line
from Doncaster to Leeds). This scheme,
covering some 644 km (400 miles) and costing
£450 million at 1990-91 prices, commenced
full passenger services between London
King’s Cross and Edinburgh in July 1991,
using InterCity 225 electric trains.
A new generation of diesel multiple-unit
trains is being introduced on regional services,
while many of the older electric multiple units
used for commuting services in London and
south-east England are being replaced by
more efficient rolling stock. The first of a new
generation of ‘Networker’ trains is due to
enter service in Kent early in 1992. Some 400
coaches will be progressively introduced, with
a further 274 on order. A diesel version is
being brought into service on lines to the west
of London, with 180 vehicles due to be
delivered between 1992 and 1994. Three
major new rail links to airports have been
built or are planned:
• a new link between Stansted airport and
London Liverpool Street, which was
opened in January 1991;
• a joint venture with BAA pic for a
£235 million project (to be financed
largely by BAA) between Heathrow
airport and London Paddington; and
• a link to connect Manchester airport to
the Manchester to Wilmslow (Cheshire)
line, currently under construction.
Freight
Over 90 per cent of rail freight traffic is of
bulk commodities, mainly coal, coke,
iron and steel, building materials and
petroleum.
The opening of the Channel Tunnel (see
p 308) will present an important opportunity
for non-bulk freight movement. Freight
routes in Kent and Sussex are being upgraded
in preparation for the traffic, and new
locomotives are being purchased. Container
traffic to the continent of Europe and further
afield is being developed and new container¬
carrying wagons have been ordered.
Intermodal services are being developed to
give easy transfer of loads between road and
rail vehicles.
Railways in London
London Underground Ltd operates services
on 408 km (254 miles) of railway, of which
about 169 km (105 miles) are underground.
The system has 272 stations, with 478 trains
operating in the peak period. Some 770
million passenger journeys were made on
London Underground trains in 1990-91.
Major investment in the Underground is
planned, including:
• an extension of the Jubilee Line to
Stratford (east London) via
Docklands and the north Greenwich
peninsula;
• the East-West Crossrail linking
Paddington with Liverpool Street, the
tunnel of which would be used by British
Rail as well as Underground trains; and
• a new line running through central
London from Chelsea in the west to
Hackney in the north-east.
The Docklands Light Railway, a 12-km
(7-5-mile) route with 15 stations, is being
upgraded. An extension westward to the City
of London was opened in July 1991, and
another eastward to Beckton is under
construction. Engineering studies are in
progress for a new light railway network
planned by London Transport and the
London Borough of Croydon for the Croydor
area of south London.

Other Urban Railways
Other urban railways in Great Britain are the
Glasgow Underground and the Tyne and
Wear Metro, a 56-km (35-mile) light rapid
transit system with over 40 stations. The
first stage of the Manchester Metrolink
project, to be designed, built and operated
by the GMA Group (a private sector
consortium), will from 1991-92 link
Manchester’s main railway termini and
provide improved services to Bury and
Altrincham as a result of conversion of
existing British Rail services to light rapid
transit. In the West Midlands work is
planned on another major light rail project,
while light rapid transit systems are also
being considered in a number of other areas,
including Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow,
Sheffield and Southampton.
Private Railways
There are over 70 small, privately owned
passenger-carrying railways in Great
Britain, mostly operated on a voluntary basis
and providing limited services for tourists
and railway enthusiasts. The main aim of
most of these railways is the preservation
and operation of steam locomotives. They
are generally run on old British Rail branch
lines, but there are also several narrow-
gauge lines, mainly in north Wales.
Channel Tunnel
Construction work is well under way on the
Channel Tunnel, the largest civil
engineering project in Europe to be financed
by the private sector. Services in the twin
single-track rail tunnels between Britain and
France are due to start in June 1993. The
project, with a total financing requirement
of £8,500 million, is being undertaken by
Eurotunnel, a British-French company. A
concession agreement between the British
and French governments and the
Eurotunnel partners gives Eurotunnel the
right to operate the tunnel for 55 years.
Construction is being carried out for
Eurotunnel by Transmanche Link, a
consortium of ten British and French
construction companies. The first link-up
under the Channel, that of the subsidiary
service tunnel, took place in December 1990,
and break-through of the two running tunnels
was achieved in summer 1991.
Eurotunnel Services
Eurotunnel will operate shuttle trains through
the tunnel between the terminals at Cheriton
(near Folkestone) and Coquelles (near Calais),
with the journey taking about 35 minutes
from terminal to terminal. Eurotunnel trains
will provide a drive-on, drive-off service, with
separate shuttle trains for cars, coaches and
freight vehicles. Car and coach passengers will
stay with their vehicles during the journey
through the tunnel. Initially Eurotunnel is
planning to run passenger shuttle services
every 15 minutes during peak periods and
freight shuttle services every 20 minutes. As
traffic grows, the frequency of services will be
increased.
Through Rail Services
Some 30 high-speed through passenger
services are planned to run each day between
London Waterloo and Paris, and London and
Brussels. Through day passenger services
from the Midlands, northern England and
Scotland to the continent are planned; these
will require a specially adapted version of the
international rolling stock, but these will not
be ready before 1994. New regional depots are
planned to handle freight traffic to the
continent. British Rail plans to invest some
£1,400 million in new passenger and freight
rolling stock and infrastructure; over £800
million has already been approved by the
Secretary of State for Transport.
To meet the forecast growth in demand for
through rail services, additional capacity will
eventually be required between London and
the Channel Tunnel. British Rail believes that
the construction of a new high-speed rail link
is the best solution. The route between the
Channel Tunnel and the North Downs is
broadly agreed and British Rail is reviewing
the options for the route into London to
maximise the benefits for international
passengers and commuters.
308
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
INLAND WATERWAYS
The inland waterways of Great Britain are
popular for recreation, make a valuable
contribution to the quality of the environ¬
ment, play an important part in land drainage
and water supply, and are used to a limited
extent for freight-carrying. An official survey
of inland waterway freight traffic reported
that in 1989, 68 million tonnes of freight were
carried on inland waterways and estuaries,
amounting to some 2,400 million tonne-km
moved. The publicly owned British Waterways
Board is responsible for some 3,200 km (2,000
miles) of waterways in Great Britain. The
majority of waterways are primarily for leisure
use, but about 620 km (385 miles) are
maintained as commercial waterways. The
Board is taking steps to develop its business
more commercially with greater
responsiveness to market needs and waterway
users. In 1990-91 the Board’s turnover
amounted to £27-1 million and it received a
government grant of £49-7 million to
maintain its waterways to statutory standards.
Ports
There are about 100 ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, but in addition
there are many small harbours which handle
small amounts of cargo or mainly serve fishing
or recreational interests. Port authorities are
of three broad types—trusts, local authorities
and companies—and most operate with
statutory powers under private Acts of
Parliament. Major ports controlled by trusts
include Clyde, Dover, Forth, London,
Medway, Milford Haven, and Tees and
Hartlepool. Local authorities own many small
ports and the much larger ports of Bristol and
Portsmouth, and the oil ports in Orkney and
Shetland.
Associated British Ports Holdings PLC (a
private sector company) operates 22 ports,
including Southampton, Grimsby and
Immingham, Hull, Newport, Cardiff and
Swansea. Other major ports owned by
companies include Felixstowe, Liverpool and
Manchester, and a group of ferry ports,
including Harwich (Parkeston Quay) and
Stranraer.
The Government has suggested that ports
not already owned by companies may wish to
consider whether company status would be
advantageous. The Ports Act 1991 will
facilitate the transfer of trust ports to the
private sector; before its passage any trust
port which wanted a transfer required a
private Act of Parliament.
Port Traffic
In 1990 traffic through the ports of Great
Britain amounted to 473 million tonnes,
comprising 136 million tonnes of exports, 181
million tonnes of imports and 156 million
tonnes of domestic traffic (which included
offshore traffic and landings of sea-dredged
aggregates). About 53 per cent of the traffic
was in fuels, mainly petroleum and petroleum
products. Traffic through Northern Ireland
ports totalled 17 million tonnes.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total
tonnage handled, are given in Table 17.3.
Sullom Voe (Shetland), Milford Haven and
Forth mostly handle oil, while the main ports
for non-fuel traffic are London, Tees and
Hartlepool, Grimsby and Immingham,
Felixstowe and Dover. Ports on the south and
east coasts have increasingly gained traffic at
the expense of those on the west coast as the
emphasis of Britain’s trade has switched
towards the continent of Europe, and with the
worldwide switch from conventional handling
methods to container and roll-on, roll-off
traffic.
Container and roll-on, roll-off traffic in
Great Britain has almost trebled since 1975 to
80 million tonnes in 1990 and now accounts
for about 71 per cent of non-bulk traffic. The
leading ports for container traffic are
Felixstowe, London and Southampton. Those
for roll-on, roll-off traffic are Dover (Britain’s
leading seaport in terms of the value of trade
handled), Felixstowe, Portsmouth, Grimsby
and Immingham, and Harwich.
Development
Most recent major port developments have
been at east- and south-coast ports. For
example, at Felixstowe a £50 million
extension to the terminal was completed in

a Belfast and Larne are the main ports in Northern Ireland and handled 8 million tonnes and 4 million tonnes respectively in 1990.
1990. New facilities are being developed for
bulk and containerised cargoes on the
Medway, and there are plans for bulk and
roll-on, roll-off cargoes on the Humber.
Purpose-built terminals for oil from the
British sector of the North Sea have been
built at Hound Point on the Forth, on the
Tees, at Flotta and at Sullom Voe (one of the
largest oil terminals in the world). Supply
bases for offshore oil and gas installations have
been built at a number of ports, notably
Aberdeen, Great Yarmouth and Heysham.
Shipping
In April 1991 British companies owned 787
trading vessels of 15 4 million deadweight
tonnes.
Among the ships owned by British
companies were 205 vessels totalling 9 5
million deadweight tonnes used as oil,
chemical or gas carriers and 554 vessels
totalling 5-7 million deadweight tonnes
employed as dry bulk carriers, container
ships or other types of cargo ships.
Some 80 per cent of British-owned vessels
are registered in Britain or British dependent
territories such as Bermuda.
The tonnage of the British-registered
trading fleet has been declining in recent
years. To help address this, in September
1990 a joint working party of the
Government and the General Council of
British Shipping produced a report on the
merchant shipping industry which contained
an agreed analysis and made a number of
recommendations. These are being taken
forward; some have already been completed.
Cargo Services
About 94 per cent by weight (76 per cent by
value) of Britain’s overseas trade is carried
by sea. In 1990 British seaborne trade
amounted to 300 million tonnes (valued at
£173,000 million) or 1,153 million tonne-km
(716,500 million tonne-miles). British-
registered ships carried 18 per cent by
weight and 34 per cent by value. Tanker
cargo accounted for 45 per cent of this trade
by weight, but only 8 per cent by value;
foodstuffs and manufactured goods
accounted for 83 per cent by value.
Virtually all the scheduled cargo liner
services from Britain are containerised. The
British tonnage serving these trades is
dominated by a relatively small number of
private sector companies and, in deep sea
trades, they usually operate in conjunction
with other companies on the same routes in
organisations known as ‘conferences’. The
object of these groupings is to ensure regular
and efficient services with stable freight
rates, to the benefit of both shipper and
310
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
shipowner. In addition to the carriage of
freight by liner and bulk services between
Britain and Europe, there are many roll-on,
roll-off services to carry cars, passengers and
commercial vehicles.
Passenger Services
In 1990 there were 30 million international sea
passenger movements between Britain and the
rest of the world, compared with some 78
million international air movements. Almost
all the passengers who arrived at or departed
from British ports in 1990 travelled to or from
the continent of Europe or the Irish Republic.
In 1990 some 79,000 embarked on pleasure
cruises from British ports. Traffic from the
southern and south-eastern ports accounts for
a substantial proportion of traffic to the
continent of Europe. The main British
operators are Sealink Stena Line, P & O and
Hoverspeed, although not all of their vessels
are under the British flag. Services are
provided by roll-on, roll-off ferries,
hovercraft, hydrofoils and high-speed
catamarans. Passenger and freight ferry
services also run to many of the offshore
islands, such as the Isle of Wight, the Orkney
and Shetland islands, and the islands off the
west coast of Scotland. It is estimated that in
1989 there were some 45 million passengers
on such internal services.
Merchant Shipping Legislation and
Policy
The Government’s policy is one of minimum
intervention and the encouragement of free
and fair competition. However, regulations,
administered by the Department of
Transport, provide for marine safety and
welfare, the investigation of accidents and the
prevention and cleaning up of pollution from
ships. The Government also has certain
reserve powers for protecting shipping and
trading interests from measures adopted or
proposed by overseas governments.
The first stage of a European Community
shipping policy involved agreement in 1986
on regulations designed to:
• liberalise the Community’s international
trade;
• establish a competitive regime for
shipping; and
• enable the Community to take action to
combat protectionism from other
countries and to counter unfair pricing
practices.
Under the second stage, now under
consideration, a range of measures have been
proposed to harmonise operating conditions
and strengthen the competitiveness of
Community members’ merchant fleets. One
such measure, facilitating the transfer of ships
between member states’ registers, has already
been agreed.
The Government has made funds available
for Merchant Navy officer training, the
repatriation of crews in the deep-sea trades
and a Reserve of ex-seafarers willing to serve
in the Merchant Navy in an emergency.
Safety at Sea
HM Coastguard Service, part of the
Department of Transport, is responsible for
co-ordinating civil maritime search and rescue
operations around the coastline of Britain. In
a maritime emergency the Coastguard calls on
and co-ordinates facilities such as lifeboats of
the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (a
voluntary body), and Ministry of Defence
aircraft, helicopters and ships, as well as
merchant shipping, commercial aircraft, its
own aircraft and rescue companies. In 1990
the Coastguard Service co-ordinated action in
some 7,100 incidents (including cliff rescues),
in which 13,500 people were assisted.
The lighthouse authorities, which between
them control about 370 lighthouses and many
minor lights and buoys, are:
• the Corporation of Trinity House, which
covers England and Wales;
• the Northern Lighthouse Board, for
Scotland; and
• the Commissioners of Irish Lights for
Ireland.
Responsibility for pilotage rests with harbour
authorities under the Pilotage Act 1987.
Compliance with rules of behaviour when
navigating in traffic separation schemes
around the shores of Britain is mandatory for
311
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
all vessels of countries party to the
Convention on the International Regulations
for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972. The
most important scheme affecting British
waters is in the Dover Strait, the world’s
busiest seaway. Britain and France jointly
operate the Channel Navigation Information
Service, which provides navigational
information and also monitors the movement
of vessels in the strait.
Among measures to improve the safety of
roll-on, roll-off ferries introduced following
the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise in
1987 is a duty on shipowners to ensure the
safe operation of their vessels. Most measures
introduced by Britain have been incorporated
in the relevant international maritime safety
convention.
Civil Aviation
The demands of passengers, both domestic
and international, are responded to by an
innovative British air transport industry.
Airlines are seeking opportunities for
modernisation, and this is complemented by
the work of the aviation authorities in
negotiating new international rights and
improving facilities such as air traffic control.
British airlines are entirely in the private
sector.
Role of the Government
The Secretary of State for Transport is
responsible for aviation matters, including:
• negotiation of air service agreements with
more than 100 other countries;
• control of air services into Britain by
overseas airlines;
• British participation in the activities of
international aviation bodies;
• aviation security policy;
• amenity matters, such as aircraft noise
and other environmental matters;
• investigation of accidents; and
• airports policy.
The Government’s civil aviation policy aims
to maintain high standards of safety and
security and to achieve environmental
improvements through reduced noise and
other emissions from aircraft. It is concerned
to promote the interests of travellers by
encouraging a competitive British industry.
The Government has taken the lead in the
European Community and with bilateral
partners in negotiating freer arrangements
within which airline competition can flourish.
New arrangements with an increasing number
of countries are resulting in better provision
of services at more competitive fares.
Civil Aviation Authority
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an
independent statutory body, responsible for
the economic and safety regulation of the
industry and, jointly with the Ministry of
Defence, for the provision of air navigation
services. The CAA’s primary objectives are to
ensure that British airlines provide air services
to satisfy all substantial categories of public
demand at the lowest charges consistent with
a high standard of safety and to further the
reasonable interests of air transport users.
Air Traffic
Total capacity offered on all services by
British airlines amounted to 20,377 million
available tonne-km in 1990: 15,274 million
tonne-km on scheduled services and 5,103
million tonne-km on non-scheduled services.
The airlines carried 38 4 million passengers
on scheduled services and 21 6 million on
charter flights; some 77-6 million passengers
travelled by air (international terminal
passengers) to or from Britain, a 3 per cent
increase on 1989.
The value of Britain’s overseas trade
carried by air in 1990 was some £21,957
million—20 per cent of the value of exports
and 18 per cent of imports. Air freight is
important for the carriage of goods with a
high value-to-weight ratio, especially where
speed of movement is essential.
British Airways
British Airways pic is one of the world s
leading airlines. In terms of international
312
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
scheduled services it is the largest in the
world. During 1990-91 British Airways’
turnover was £4,937 million (including
£4,834 million from airline operations), and
the British Airways group carried 25-6
million passengers on scheduled and
charter flights.
The British Airways scheduled route
network serves over 160 destinations in
some 75 countries. Its main operating base
is London’s Heathrow airport, but services
from Gatwick and regional centres such as
Manchester and Birmingham have been
expanding. Scheduled Concorde supersonic
services are operated from London
(Heathrow) to New York, Washington and,
in the summer, Toronto, crossing the
Atlantic in about half the time taken by
subsonic aircraft. In March 1991 British
Airways had a fleet of 230 aircraft, the
largest fleet in Western Europe, comprising
7 Concordes, 50 Boeing 747s, 8
McDonnell-Douglas DC 10s, 13 Lockheed
TriStars, 37 Boeing 757s, 10 Airbus A320s,
48 Boeing 737s, 9 Boeing 767s, 31 BAC
One-Elevens, 8 British Aerospace
Advanced Turboprops and 9 British
Aerospace 748s. A further 68 aircraft were
on order.
Other Airlines
About 570 aircraft are operated by other
airlines. Dan-Air Services is a major
operator of both scheduled and charter
services, and had a fleet of 51 aircraft in
May 1991. British Midland and Air UK are
both major domestic airlines and also
operate a number of international and
charter services. Virgin Atlantic began
scheduled services between Gatwick and
New York (Newark) in 1984 and is also
continuing to extend its services to other
long-haul routes. It has eight aircraft.
Britannia Airways carried over 6 million
passengers in 1989 and is one of the
largest charter operators in the world. It
has charter flights from 20 British airports
to more than 100 destinations in Europe
and elsewhere, mostly operated for its
associated company, Thomson Holidays. It
has 39 aircraft.
Helicopters and Other Aerial Work
Helicopters are engaged on a variety of work,
especially operations connected with Britain’s
offshore oil and gas industry. The three main
operators in Britain are Bristow Helicopters,
Bond Helicopters and British International
Helicopters, with 76, 48 and 26 helicopters
respectively. Light aircraft and helicopters are
also involved in other activities, such as
charter operations, search and rescue services,
medical evacuation, crop-spraying, aerial
survey and photography, and police
operations.
Air Safety
The CAA is responsible for both technical
and operational air safety. Its Safety
Regulation Group deals with the development
and application of safety requirements for all
civil aviation operations. It licenses flight
crew, ground engineers and air traffic control
officers, as well as aerodromes and fire and
rescue services. Training of air traffic
controllers is also provided by the CAA.
Every company operating aircraft used for
commercial purposes must possess an Air
Operator’s Certificate, which is granted by the
CAA when it is satisfied that the operator is
competent to secure the safe operation of its
aircraft. The CAA’s flight operations
inspectors, all of whom are experienced airline
pilots, and airworthiness surveyors check that
satisfactory standards are maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a
British-registered aircraft and every licensed
ground engineer must hold the appropriate
official licence issued by the CAA. Except for
those with acceptable military or other
qualifying experience, all applicants for a first
professional licence must have undertaken a
full-time course of instruction which has been
approved by the CAA.
Air Traffic Control and Navigation
Services
Responsibility for civil and military air traffic
control over Britain and the surrounding seas
rests with the National Air Traffic Services
(NATS), jointly operated by the CAA and the
313
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Ministry of Defence. At 13 civil aerodromes,
including most of the major British airports,
the NATS provides the navigation services
necessary for aircraft taking off and landing,
and integrates them into the flow of traffic
within British airspace.
Britain is one of 13 members of
Eurocontrol, a European air traffic control
body. In recent years Britain has put forward
a number of initiatives, including the Central
Flow Management Unit, which will be fully
operational in 1993, and an initiative agreed in
1990 to increase airspace capacity by
integrating air traffic control systems and
optimising the air traffic route network. For
Britain the CAA has a substantial annual
investment programme of about £80 million,
which includes the construction of a new
air traffic control centre for England and
Wales.
Aircraft and the Environment
The replacement of older aircraft with new
quieter types has done much to reduce the
problem of noise near airports, as have noise
abatement measures such as noise-preferential
routes, night restrictions and house insulation.
Research is in hand on the effect of aircraft
emissions on the upper atmosphere, and in
the mean time consideration is being given
internationally to tightening the emission
standards for aircraft.
Airports
Of the 141 licensed civil aerodromes in
Britain, about one-fifth handle more than
100,000 passengers a year each. Twelve
handle over 1 million passengers a year each
(see Table 17.4).
In 1990 Britain’s civil airports handled
a total of 1041 million passengers
(102-4 million terminal passengers and
T7 million in transit), and T2 million
tonnes of freight.
Heathrow airport is the world’s busiest
airport for international travel and is Britain’s
most important airport for passengers and air
freight, handling 43 0 million passengers
(including transit passengers) and 695,300
tonnes of freight in 1990. Gatwick is one of
the world’s busiest international airports.
Ownership and Control
Eight airports—Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted
and Southampton in south-east England, and
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prestwick and Aberdeen
in Scotland—are owned and operated by BAA
pic. Together they handle about 70 per cent
of air passengers and 85 per cent of air cargo
traffic in Britain.
Many of the other public airports are
controlled by local authorities. A total of 15
major local authority airports now operate as
Companies Act companies. The Government
is encouraging the introduction of private
capital into these new companies.
The CAA has responsibility for the
economic regulation of major airport
companies. It has powers to take action to
remedy practices considered to be against the
public interest, in particular any abuse of an
airport’s monopoly position. All airports used
for public transport and training flights must
be licensed by the CAA. Stringent
requirements, such as the provision of
adequate fire-fighting, medical and rescue
services, must be satisfied before a licence is
granted. Strict security measures are in force, ;
and the Aviation and Maritime Security Act
1990 provides for greater powers to enforce
such requirements.
Development
The Government’s policy is to promote a
strong and competitive British airline industry
by providing airport capacity where it is
needed and by making effective use of existin;
capacity, including regional airports.
Major expansion is under way at Stansted.
A new terminal was opened in March 1991,
with an initial capacity of 8 million passenger:
a year. After further expansion it will cater fo
15 million passengers a year. Under major
expansion plans at Manchester, the first phas<
of a second terminal is under construction an
is expected to open in 1993, increasing
capacity by one-half to 18 million passengers
year. A second terminal at Birmingham was

officially opened in 1991, increasing capacity
to 6 million passengers a year. Construction of
a new airport at Sheffield is planned to start
in 1992. Facilities are also being improved at
other regional airports.
Communications
The telecommunications services sector is one
of the most rapidly growing in the economy.
Major changes occurred in the 1980s with the
privatisation of British Telecommunications
pic (BT) and the abolition of its monopoly on
the provision of basic telecommunications
over fixed links. A second major
telecommunications carrier, Mercury
Communications, started services in 1986,
while, following a government review of
policy announced in March 1991, others will
be able to apply for licences to run services.
t
Licensing
Those running telecommunications systems,
including BT and Mercury, need to be
licensed by the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry. The Government has hitherto
5 licensed only BT and Mercury to provide
1 fixed services—the so-called ‘duopoly’ policy.
This was reviewed in a White Paper
published in March 1991. Important
proposals include:
• the right for other companies to apply for
licences to run new telecommunications
networks within Britain;
• the introduction of ‘number portability’,
so that people can move from one
network to another without changing
their number, subject to a cost-benefit
study;
• the introduction of telecommunications
‘retailers’, who would deal with the public
to arrange, but not themselves provide,
telecommunications services;
• greater freedom for existing mobile
telecommunications companies and cable
operators to provide telecommunications
services in their own right;
• the early introduction of ‘equal access’, by
which customers can exercise a choice
over the trunk operator that carries their
calls; and
• the introduction of class licences to allow
companies to provide telecommunications
circuits for their own use, and for the
development of a wide range of new
satellite services catering for specialist
markets.
The Government concluded that it would be
unlikely to license any new international
operators in the short term, but would keep
this under review.
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Office of Telecommunications
The Office of Telecommunications
(OFTEL), a non-ministerial government
department, is the independent regulatory
body for the telecommunications industry. It
is headed by the Director General of
Telecommunications, among whose functions
are:
• to ensure that licensees comply with the
conditions of their licences;
• to promote effective competition in the
telecommunications industry;
• to provide advice to the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry on
telecommunications matters; and
• to investigate complaints.
The Director General also has a duty to
promote the interests of consumers in respect
of prices, quality and variety in
telecommunications services.
BT
In 1984 BT was reconstituted as a public
limited company and a majority of the
ordinary voting shares were sold to private
investors. It has about 1 million registered
shareholders. Some 90 per cent of its 230,000
employees own shares and nearly 44 per cent
are members of the Employee Share Save
Scheme. The Government intends to sell its
remaining shares.
BT runs one of the world’s largest public
telecommunications networks, including:
• 19-6 million residential lines;
• 6 4 million business lines;
• 78,200 telex connections;
• 98,200 public payphones; and
• a wide range of specialised voice, data,
text and visual services.
The inland telephone and telex networks are
fully automatic. International direct dialling
is available from Britain to 201 countries,
representing 99 per cent of the world’s
telephones. Automatic telex service is
available to more than 200 countries.
Network Modernisation
BT is investing some £11 million per working
day in the modernisation and expansion of its
network to meet the increasing demand for
basic telephone services and for more
specialised services. The company has more
than 1-4 million km (870,000 miles) of optical
fibre laid in its network in Britain, a higher
proportion than any other world operator.
There are more than 3,650 digital exchanges
serving some 73 per cent of telephone lines.
The combination of digital exchange
switching and digital transmission techniques,
using optical fibre cable and microwave radio
links, is substantially improving the quality of
telephone services for residential and business
customers, as well as making possible a wider
range of services through the company’s main
network.
General Services
BT’s services include:
• a free facility for emergency calls to the
police, fire, ambulance, coastguard,
lifeboat and air-sea rescue services;
• directory enquiries;
• various chargeable operator-connected
services, such as reversed-charge calls and
alarm calls;
• an operator-handled Freefone service and
automatic ‘LinkLine’ facilities that enable
callers to contact organisations anywhere
in Britain, either free or at local call rates;
• a number of Callstream services, which
allow callers to obtain information by
paying a premium call rate; and
• network services such as three-way
calling, call waiting and call diversion,
which are available to customers on
digital exchanges.
Other premium-rate services are offered by
independent service providers using the BT
network. In 1988 the company opened a £70
million optical fibre flexible access system, for
intensive voice and data traffic, to serve the
financial organisations of the City of London.
316
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Under a public payphone service
modernisation programme, a total of £165
million is being spent on modernisation and
additional provision on sites convenient for
travellers, such as railway stations and
motorway service areas. A number of cashless
call developments are being carried out,
including the Phonecard service, using
prepaid encoded cards; Phonecard payphones
account for 19,000 of the total of 98,200
payphones. There are about 280,000 private
rented payphones on premises to which the
public has access and these are also being
upgraded with push-button equipment.
Prestel, BT’s videotex service, and
Telecom Gold (an electronic mail and
information service) form part of the
company’s data services division, BT Tymnet
Europe. Prestel was the first service of its
kind to enable a wide variety of computer-
stored information to be called up via the
telephone on a computer, a terminal or an
adapted television. Some 100,000 terminals
are attached to Prestel, primarily in
businesses. Through its ‘gateway’ links with
other databases, a wide range of other
services, such as home shopping and banking
services, holiday booking and reservation
facilities, and insurance and financial markets
information, is available.
International Services
BT has much experience as an international
network and service provider. It is the second
largest shareholder in the International
Telecommunications Satellite Organisation
(of which 120 countries are members) and in
the European Telecommunications Satellite
Organisation. It is also a leading shareholder
in the International Maritime Satellite
Organisation, with interests in a number of
other consortia.
A substantial proportion of the
intercontinental telephone traffic to or from
Britain is carried by satellite. BT operates
satellite earth stations at Goonhilly Downs
(Cornwall), Madley (near Hereford), London
Docklands and Aberdeen. Its range of digital
transmission services includes a number
available overseas, including ‘Satstream’
private circuit digital links covering North
America and Western Europe using small-
dish aerials, and an ‘International Kilostream’
private circuit service available to the United
States, Australia and most major business
centres in Asia and the rest of Europe.
Extensive direct-dial maritime satellite
services are available for vessels worldwide.
In-flight operator-controlled telephone call
facilities are available via Portishead radio
station near Bristol. Digital transmission
techniques have been introduced for
services to the United States, Japan, Hong
Kong and Australia via the Madley and
Goonhilly stations. The London-Tokyo link,
which was set up in 1986, includes the first
all-digital telephone link between two
continents.
Recent improvements in submarine cable
design (including the use of optical fibre
technology) have helped to increase capacity
and reduce pressure on satellite systems. A
second high-capacity transatlantic optical fibre
cable (TAT 9), which will cost about £250
million and be able to carry about 75,000
telephone calls simultaneously, is scheduled to
be in operation by the end of 1991 to
supplement an earlier link.
British Telecom’s overseas consultancy
service, Telconsult, has so far completed 270
projects in more than 60 countries.

owned subsidiary of Cable and Wireless pic, is
licensed as a public telecommunications
operator in Britain. Mercury has constructed
its own long-distance network comprising
optical fibre cables and digital microwave
links. The network runs from the north of
Scotland to the south coast, serving some 85
cities and towns across Britain. Coverage is
enhanced through Mercury’s own city cable
networks as well as partnerships with local
cable television operators.
Mercury offers a full range of long¬
distance and international telecommunications
services for both business and residential
customers. In addition to voice and data
transmission, the company supplies
sophisticated messaging systems, mobile
telecommunications and a range of equipment
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for customers’ premises. Major customers can
have a direct digital link between their
premises and the Mercury network. A
number of routeing devices have also been
developed to enable customers to use Mercury
indirectly via their existing exchange lines.
Residential customers can buy a Mercury-
compatible phone and access the network at
the touch of a button.
International services are provided by
satellite communications centres in London’s
docklands and in Oxfordshire, as well as by
submarine cable links to Europe and the
United States.
Mobile Communications
The Government encourages the expansion of
mobile radio telecommunications services. It
has licensed Vodafone Ltd and Telecom
Securicor Cellular Radio Ltd (a joint venture
between BT and Securicor) to run competing
national cellular radio telephone systems.
Considerable investment has been made in
establishing their networks to provide
increased capacity for the growing number of
cellular radio telephone users, estimated at
over 1 million in mid-1990.
In 1989 the Government announced an
increase in the number of channels available
for cellular radio and the issue of licences for
‘Telepoint’ systems, which allow subscribers
to make outgoing telephone calls from
Telepoint base stations in public places using
their own portable digital cordless handsets.
Britain will be the first country to
offer personal communications network
(PCN) services, which would allow the same
telephone to be used at home, at work
and in a mobile capacity. In 1989 the
Government allocated licences to three
operators—Mercury PCN Ltd, Microtel
Communications Ltd and Unitel Ltd to run
PCNs in the frequency range L7 to L9
gigahertz. The first service is expected to start
in late 1992.
Two national operators (GEC National
One and Band 3 Radio Ltd) have been
licensed to offer a nationwide trunked mobile
radio service, while a number of licences have
been awarded for London and regional
services.
Other Services
The Department of Trade and Industry has
licensed 116 companies which have been
awarded franchises by the Cable Authority to
run local broadband cable telecommunications
systems. At present they mainly provide
television programmes, but some are already
offering interactive services, including local
voice telephony. The duopoly review (see
p 315) will encourage them to provide a wider
range of services. Home banking services,
accessed by multi-frequency telephone, are
being developed by a number of banks.
Cable & Wireless
Cable and Wireless pic provides a wide
range of telecommunications in some 50
countries worldwide. Its main business is
the provision and operation of public
telecommunications services in 37 countries
and territories, including the United States,
Japan and Hong Kong, under franchises and
licences granted by the governments
concerned. It also provides and manages
telecommunications services and facilities for
public and private sector customers, and
undertakes consultancy work. It operates a
fleet of ten ships and three submersible
vehicle systems for laying and maintaining
submarine telecommunications cables. The
company’s strategy is the construction and
operation of a broadband digital network
linking major world economic and financial
centres in Europe, north America and the
Pacific rim. The first leg of this ‘Global
Digital Highway’, the private transatlantic
optical fibre cable linking Britain, the Irish
Republic, the United States and Bermuda,
entered service in 1989, and the North Pacific
Cable, the first direct cable between the
United States and Japan, entered service in
1991, connecting to other optical fibre cables
in the Pacific rim region.
Postal Services
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail.
318
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
The Post Office has a monopoly on the
conveyance of letters, but the Secretary of
State for Trade and Industry has the power to
suspend the monopoly in certain areas or for
certain categories of mail and to license others
to provide competing services. The Secretary
of State has suspended the monopoly on
letters subject to a minimum fee of £1, and
has issued general licences enabling mail to be
transferred between document exchanges and
allowing charitable organisations to carry
Christmas and New Year cards. As part of the
Government’s Citizen’s Charter proposals, it
is intended to reduce the monopoly from the
£1 level to one much nearer the present cost
of a first-class stamp (24p).
The Royal Mail provides deliveries to 24
million addresses and handles over 60
million letters and parcels each working
day (over 14,000 million items a year).
Mail is collected from over 100,000
posting boxes, as well as from post
offices and large postal users.
Mail sorting was traditionally done by
hand at some 600 offices of varying size and
capacity. During the past 20 years, however,
much of the process has been mechanised and
concentrated into larger offices. Some 80 such
mechanised letter offices are now in operation.
The British postcode system is the most
sophisticated in the world, allowing
mechanised sorting down to part of a street on
a postman’s round and, in some cases, to an
individual address. The Post Office’s parcels
operation, Royal Mail Parcelforce, has a
programme of modernisation including the
establishment of 150 local collection and
delivery depots throughout Britain.
Post Office Counters Ltd handles a wide
range of transactions; it acts as an agent for
the letters and parcels businesses, government
departments, local authorities and Girobank,
which was transferred to the private sector in
July 1990. There are 20,900 post offices, of
which some 1,300 are operated directly by the
Post Office. The remainder are operated on
an agency basis by sub-postmasters.
Post Office Specialist Services
The Post Office provides a range of specialist
services. ‘Datapost’, a door-to-door delivery
service, has overnight links throughout Britain
and provides an international service to over
160 countries. ‘Datapost Sameday’ provides a
rapid delivery within or between more than
100 cities and towns in Britain and between
London and Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin.
The Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh handles
about one-third of the Post Office’s philatelic
business, much of it involving sales to
overseas collectors or dealers. The British
Postal Consultancy Service offers advice and
assistance on all aspects of postal business to
overseas postal administrations, and nearly 40
countries have used its services since 1965.
Private Courier and Express Service Operators
Private sector couriers and express operators
are able to handle time-sensitive door-to-door
deliveries, subject to a minimum fee of £1.
The courier/express service industry has
grown rapidly, by about 20 per cent a year,
and the revenue created by the carriage of
these items is estimated at over £1,500 million
a year. Britain is one of the main providers of
monitored express deliveries in Europe, with
London an important centre for air
courier/express traffic.
18 Employment
Employment in Britain has risen
substantially since the mid-1980s, and
remains at a high level. There was also a
considerable decline in unemployment during
the late 1980s. This represented the longest
period of falling unemployment since the
second world war, although in common with
many other industrialised countries
unemployment has recently been rising
again.
The Government has taken a number of
steps to improve the labour market, with the
aim of creating an economic climate in which
business can flourish and create more jobs.
These include:
• increasing the flexibility of the labour
market;
• removing burdens on employers,
including regulatory barriers which
hinder recruitment; and
• encouraging better training, especially by
setting up Training and Enterprise
Councils and, in Scotland, Local
Enterprise Companies (see pp 323^-).
However, Britain has expressed concern
about the operation of the European
Community’s draft Social Charter, covering
various aspects of employment. The
Government has indicated its willingness to
accept some of the proposed regulations,
such as on health and safety, but opposes a
number of other proposals which it believes
would add to labour costs and discourage
employment.
TRENDS IN THE LABOUR MARKET
The total workforce in June 1990 was 28-5
million, of whom 22 9 million (121 million
men and 10 8 million women) were classed
as employees in employment. Major trends
have included the growth in the proportion
of the workforce accounted for by women, as
more married women have sought work,
especially in part-time employment; and a
substantial increase in self-employment. By
June 1990, the number of self-employed
people is estimated to have risen to 3-3
million, representing 12-3 per cent of the
employed workforce.

BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Patterns of Employment
As in other industrialised countries, there has
been a marked shift in jobs from
manufacturing to service industries.
Between 1955 and 1990 the proportion of
employees in employment engaged in
service industries rose from 36 per cent
to 69 per cent as higher living standards
and technological developments
stimulated the growth of many service
industries.
During the period 1980 to 1990 the
number of employees in service industries in
Great Britain rose by 21 million (16 per
cent) to 15-5 million. Employment in most
service industries, with some exceptions such
as transport, has grown considerably. The
largest rise in this period was in the banking,
finance and insurance sector (by 62 per cent
to 2-7 million), while there was also a
substantial increase in hotels and catering (31
per cent). Manufacturing industry accounted
for 43 per cent of employees in employment
in 1955, but by 1990 the proportion had
fallen to 23 per cent. Nearly all
manufacturing industries experienced a
decline in employment as markets for
manufactured goods changed and as new
technology brought greater efficiency.
Unemployment
Unemployment reached a peak in July 1986
when, on a seasonally adjusted basis
(excluding school-leavers), it totalled over 31
million, 11-2 per cent of the workforce.
Subsequently it declined significantly, and in

EMPLOYMENT
the first seven months of 1990 it was about
1-6 million (5-7 per cent of the workforce),
one of the lowest rates in the European
Community. Unemployment fell in all
regions, with reductions being greatest in
some of the regions with above-average
unemployment. Unemployment began to rise
again in April 1990, but still remains below
1986 levels. In August 1991 it totalled 2 4
million, 8 5 per cent of the workforce. The
Government believes that an increase on the
scale of the early 1980s is avoidable,
depending in part upon the moderation of
pay settlements.
Extra help for unemployed people to find
work was announced in March 1991,
including up to 100,000 extra Jobclub places
(see p 327) and a guaranteed offer of an
interview for all those who do not find work
within 13 weeks to help them consider their
options for getting back to work. Further
help was announced in June 1991, including
a new £180 million programme, Employment
Action, which will offer unemployed people
the chance to keep their skills up to date by
work experience on local projects.
TRAINING
Employers in Britain spend over £20,000
million a year on employee training and
development. A wide-ranging survey of
training in 1986-87 found that the health
sector provided most training in terms of the
number of days per employee. Overall, the
1990 Labour Force Survey found that the
number of employees who had received
recent training was 85 per cent higher than it
had been six years previously. Individuals are
also being encouraged to train by means of
tax reliefs and loan schemes.
Government Policy
The Government’s major aims for the 1990s
are that:
• employers should invest more effectively
in the skills their businesses need;
• young people should have the motivation
to achieve their full potential and to
develop skills the economy needs;
• individuals should be persuaded that
training is worthwhile and that they
should take more responsibility for their
own development;
• people who are unemployed or at a
disadvantage in the job market should be
helped to get back to work and to
develop their abilities to the full;
• those who give education and training
should offer flexible provision which
meets the needs of individuals and
employers; and
• enterprise should be encouraged
throughout the economy, particularly
through the continued growth of small
business and self-employment.
Training and Enterprise Councils
A network of 82 Training and Enterprise
Councils (TECs) has been set up throughout
England and Wales. Of these, 77 are now
operational, a little over two years since
TECs were first announced. Their main
functions are:
• to promote more effective training by
employers and individuals;
• to provide practical help to employers
through Business Enterprise Training;
• to deliver and develop Youth Training
and Employment Training (see p 324);
and
• to stimulate enterprise and economic
growth by providing support to new and
existing small firms.
In November 1990 the Government
announced changes in the funding
arrangements for TECs to allow them
greater discretion in adapting their
programmes to meet local needs. TECs now
have one single budget to cover all their
enterprise activities, and so have considerable
flexibility in deciding how to use it. It is also
planned to give TECs a wider role in
education, especially in the development of
the Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative (see p 153). TECs have also taken
charge of the money that the Department of
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Employment previously spent on work-
related further education; this amounts to
some £105 million in 1991-92. They have
thus become able to work directly with
further education colleges and local
education authorities. Total government
funding to TECs in 1991-92 will be some
£1,600 million.
A separate network of 22 Local
Enterprise Companies (LECs) exists in
Scotland. These have wider-ranging
responsibilities than the TECs, covering
economic development and environmental
improvement. LECs operate the same
programmes as TECs, but, unlike them,
have no responsibility for work-related
further education. They run in conjunction
with two new enterprise bodies, Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise (see p 326).
National Training Task Force
The National Training Task Force was
established in 1989. Its members are drawn
from a wide spectrum, including
employers, trade unions, local authorities
and education. Its most important job is to
assist in the establishment and development
of TECs.
In addition, it is helping to promote to
employers the importance of investing in
the skills of their workforce.
Industry Training Organisations
Industry Training Organisations (ITOs)
have a major role in developing
occupational standards and reviewing
future skill requirements for their sectors
in Great Britain. The Government’s
preference is for them to be independent
employer-led bodies. Accordingly, most
statutory training boards are being phased
out.
There are over 100 independent ITOs,
many of which superseded former statutory
boards, covering sectors employing about
80 per cent of the civilian workforce. The
National Council of Industry Training
Organisations, a voluntary body set up to
represent the interests of ITOs, aims to
improve the effectiveness of these bodies,
for example, by encouraging good practice.
Employment Training
Employment Training provides a flexible
and individually adapted training
programme for the longer-term
unemployed. An individual’s training
needs are identified and an agreed action
plan is drawn up. Training is carried out
by training managers under contract with
the local TEC or LEC. For 1991-92
Employment Training has a budget of
£900 million to provide training
opportunities for up to 250,000 trainees.
Entry to the programme can be through
a variety of routes, including a Restart
interview (see p 327) or by application at a
jobcentre. Trainees receive a training
allowance of £10 a week more than their
benefit entitlement, and they may also
receive help towards fares and other
expenses.
#
Youth Training
Youth Training gives all eligible young
people the opportunity of a broad-based
vocational education and to achieve a
vocational qualification or a credit towards
one. It puts an emphasis on raising the
level of qualifications of new entrants to
the workforce and on results, such as
vocational qualifications, rather than on
time spent in training. It offers the chance
to gain specific skills of relevance to work
and to improve the employment prospects
of young people.
The new Training Credits scheme gives
young people who have left full-time
education to join the labour market an
entitlement to train to approved standards.
Ten TECs and one LEC started pilot
projects in April 1991. Some 45,000 young
people now enjoy the greater opportunity
that the scheme brings. The Government
has announced the expansion of the credits
pilot to a further 10 per cent of eligible
young people in 1993. The eventual aim is
to offer Training Credits to all young
people by 1996.
324
EMPLOYMENT
Enterprise Development
TECs and LECs are taking over the
running and development of business and
enterprise training to meet the needs of
local employers. They now have a
combined budget covering all their
enterprise development activities which
includes training and financial support to
new entrepreneurs.
The TECs offer a range of flexible
programmes designed to help small- to
medium-sized businesses to improve their
planning, and to develop the business skills
of owner-managers. Training advice,
information and financial support are also
available for people wishing to set up in
business.
Education Initiatives
In May 1991 the Government published a
White Paper containing its proposals for
education and training. The main aims
are to:
• ensure that high-quality further
education or training becomes the norm
for all 16- and 17-year-olds who can
benefit from it;
• increase the all-round levels of
attainment by young people; and
• increase the proportion acquiring higher
levels of skill and expertise.
The White Paper sets out proposals to
achieve a fully-integrated system of
education and training; to fulfil the
potential of more young people who would
otherwise miss out on education and
training after 16; to equip everyone with
stronger basic skills and more with higher-
level skills; to bridge the traditional
academic-vocational divide; and to build up
a partnership between employers and the
education system.
Specific government initiatives to make
education more relevant to the needs of
working life include:
• the Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative, which aims to equip all 14-
to 18-year-olds in full-time education
for the demands of working life;
• Work-Related Further Education,
which aims to link vocational education
to the needs of employers;
• the Enterprise in Higher Education
Initiative, which aims to make higher
education more relevant to the world of
work;
• Compacts, where employers guarantee
jobs with training, or further education
followed by a job, to young people in
inner-city areas, provided they reach
agreed targets; and
• Education Business Partnerships, which
aim to encourage a range of activities to
help young people reach their highest
potential and prepare them better for
work.
Vocational Qualifications
The National Council for Vocational
Qualifications (NCVQ) was set up in 1986
to reform and rationalise the vocational
qualifications system in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. It aims to make
qualifications more accessible and more
relevant by basing them on standards of
competence set by industry, and to
establish a coherent framework—the
National Vocational Qualification (NVQ)—
based on defined levels of achievement to
which qualifications in all sectors can be
assigned or accredited. The immediate
aim is to have the framework for levels I
to IV (from the most basic level to the
management supervisory level) in place
and available by the end of 1992.
Eventually it is expected to cover all
occupational levels up to and including the
professions. Work is under way to develop
broader-based NVQs to allow young people
to keep their career options open and assist
older adults wishing to make a career
change.
Scotland has not been covered by the
NCVQ^as it already had its own modular
system, but in 1989 the Government
announced that a system of Scottish
Vocational Qualifications would be
introduced, which would be compatible
with the framework elsewhere in Britain.
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Other Training Measures
Open learning opportunities have been
increased by the creation of the Open
College, an independent company which
promotes the acquisition of skills through
the method of open learning. Over 165,000
people have taken its courses since 1987.
Further funds were announced in 1989: a
maximum of £12 million for its commercial
activities over the three years to 1992, and a
further £6 million for its broadcasting
activities. The Government’s aim is for the
College to be self-financing by March 1992.
In 1988 the Government, in partnership
with three major banks, made Career
Development Loans available throughout
Great Britain. Loans of £300 to £5,000 can
help to pay for vocational training courses
between a week and a year in length. Loans
may cover up to 80 per cent of course fees,
plus the cost of books and materials. A
contribution towards living expenses may
be available for full-time courses. The
Government pays the interest on the loan
during training and for up to three months
thereafter. The individual then begins
repaying the loan, and any further interest
due, over a period that has been agreed
with the bank.
Scotland
Two new bodies have been set up under
recent legislation—Scottish Enterprise for
the lowlands of Scotland, and Highlands
and Islands Enterprise for the highlands
and islands area. They assumed
responsibility for the functions of economic
development and training previously
exercised by the Scottish Development
Agency, the Highlands and Islands
Development Board and the Training
Agency in Scotland. Their main duties are
to:
• stimulate self-sustaining economic
development;
• maintain and safeguard employment;
• enhance employment skills; and
• promote industrial efficiency and
international competitiveness.
The new bodies contract out much of their
work to a network of Local Enterprise
Companies led by the private sector (see
p 324). This network is complete, with 22
companies now fully operational throughout
Scotland.
Northern Ireland
The Training and Employment Agency, an
executive agency within the Department of
Economic Development for Northern
Ireland, has primary responsibility for
training and employment services. Its overall
aim is to assist economic growth by ensuring
the provision and operation of training and
employment services that contribute to
Northern Ireland firms becoming more
competitive and individuals obtaining the
skills required. The Agency works closely
with employers and is encouraging each of
the key sectors of industry to form a Sector
Representative Body to represent the
opinions of employers, and others, on
individual sectoral training needs. It has also
established Sectoral Working Groups to
develop training strategies for individual
sectors.
Northern Ireland has its own training and
work experience schemes, including:
• the Action for Community Employment
programme, which provides training and
jobs for long-term unemployed people;
• the Job Training programme, which
parallels Employment Training in Great
Britain; and
• the Youth Training programme.
Management training and development is
an important area for the Training and
Employment Agency, which provides a range
of schemes designed to improve and develop
management skills both for existing managers
and for graduates seeking to follow
managerial careers. The Agency’s
Consultancy and Advisory Service promotes
the benefits of training and offers advice
suited to the needs of individual companies
and industrial sectors. The Manpower
Training Scheme offers financial support to
companies seeking to introduce
comprehensive training programmes and
EMPLOYMENT
aims to improve the overall competitiveness
of Northern Ireland industry.
EMPLOYMENT SERVICES
The main priorities of the Employment
Service, an executive agency within the
Department of Employment, are to help
unemployed people back to work and to
maintain the accurate and prompt payment
of benefit to unemployed people, while
ensuring that payment is made only to those
entitled to it.
The Employment Service has a number
of ways of helping the unemployed to find
work:
• by placing people directly into jobs;
• by offering advice and guidance, so that
I people can find the best route to return
to employment, for example, by
training; and
• through special programmes such as
Jobclubs and the Job Interview
Guarantee.
The jobcentre network handles about
one-third of vacancies in the economy, and
81 per cent of the 1-85 million people
whom
it placed in jobs in 1989-90 were
unemployed.
Advisory Services
As part of the Employment Service
programme of individual interviews,
advisers provide unemployed people with
information on employment and training
opportunities available to them locally. New
i client advisers interview newly unemployed
people to check their eligibility for benefit.
Together with the unemployed person, they
agree a ‘Back to Work Plan’ which shows
them the best course of action to follow to
get back to work. These plans are reviewed
at every advisory interview.
Under the Restart programme, everyone
who has been unemployed six months or
more is asked to attend a Restart interview
with a claimant adviser. The adviser and
unemployed person discuss that person’s
circumstances, with the aim of helping him
or her back into work as soon as possible.
This could include:
• advice on job vacancies;
• enrolment on a training programme;
• a place in a jobclub, where participants
are given training and advice in job-
hunting skills and have access to
facilities to help an intensive job search;
• help through the Job Interview
Guarantee programme, whereby
employers guarantee interviews to
everyone submitted for their vacancies
through the programme;
• a Restart course, usually over five days,
designed to rebuild self-confidence and
motivation and including help with job-
hunting skills; or
• the chance of self-employment with
direct financial help through the
Enterprise Allowance Scheme, which
gives financial support to unemployed
people to enable them to start their
own business.
Other Functions
The Employment Service also aims to help
people with disabilities to find work. All
Employment Service programmes make
provision for people with disabilities.
Disablement Resettlement Officers offer
practical help and counselling, and a wide
range of programmes, such as one offering
sheltered employment opportunities, is
available for people with disabilities who
need specialist help.
Incentives to Work
The Government has taken action to
improve incentives to work, such as raising
personal tax allowances and reducing the
standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent,
while improving benefits for people in
work. These measures, together with
reforms in the social security system in
1988, have helped to ensure that most
people are better off in work than
remaining unemployed.
327
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Employment Service’s claimant
advisers are able to give individual
calculations which take account of the
benefits people in work are entitled to, to
show the extent to which someone is better
off in work.
Careers Service
Local education authorities provide a careers
service for people attending educational
institutions (apart from universities, which
normally have their own careers service) and
an employment service for those leaving
them. The careers services in Wales and
Scotland are the responsibility of the
respective Secretaries of State, while in
Northern Ireland responsibility rests
with the Training and Employment
Agency.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
The structure of industrial relations in
Britain has been established mainly on a
voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly
on the organisation of employees and
employers into trade unions and employers’
associations, and on freely conducted
negotiations at all levels.
Collective Bargaining and Joint
Consultation
In many industries terms and conditions of
employment and procedures for the conduct
of industrial relations have traditionally been
settled by negotiation between employers
and trade unions. Trade unions are widely
recognised by employers, especially in the
public sector and in large firms and
establishments. Agreements may be industry¬
wide, as has generally been the case in the
public sector, but they are often
supplemented by local agreements in
companies or factories (plant bargaining).
Individual companies may have their own
agreements, either for the whole company or
for each plant.
In some industries or companies,
negotiations are conducted by meetings held
when necessary. In others, joint consultative
committees have been established on a
permanent basis. Joint committees are fairly
widespread, especially in large firms. The
scope of the various bodies (from national
joint industrial councils for whole industries
to works committees in individual
workplaces) varies widely. It can cover
matters other than pay and conditions, such
as:
• production plans;
• training;
• welfare; and
• safety.
Such committees often also act as a forum
for more general consultation between
workers and employers. Day-to-day
negotiations on various aspects of pay (such
as bonuses or performance pay) are normally
handled at plant level. Arrangements for
collective bargaining usually suffice to settle
all questions which are raised, but there is
often provision for matters which cannot be
settled in this way to be referred to
independent conciliation or arbitration. The
law provides for information needed for
collective bargaining purposes to be disclosed
by employers to trade unions, subject to
certain safeguards.
Developments
In recent years there have been a number
of developments which have affected
Britain’s industrial relations system. There
has been a continuing shift towards part-
time, temporary and sub-contracting
employment. Together with the growth of
self-employment, this has encouraged
greater labour market flexibility. Many
employers have sought greater flexibility
through a closer relationship between pay
and performance, particularly through
performance-related pay schemes. In many
sectors job demarcation (for example,
between manual, technical and clerical skills)
has been relaxed. Other developments have
included the introduction of new
technology and related organisational
changes.
328
EMPLOYMENT
There has been a trend away from
national bargaining machinery towards
negotiation at a more local level; the
proportion of the workforce covered by
multi-employer national agreements
declined from 60 per cent in 1978 to 35 per
cent in 1989. The Government has
favoured moves away from national pay
bargaining towards systems where pay
increases are dependent primarily on
performance, merit, company profitability,
and local labour market conditions. Areas in
which national industry-wide pay bargaining
has recently been ended include merchant
shipping, the printing of national
newspapers, commercial broadcasting and
the London clearing banks. Where industry¬
wide bargaining remains important,
employers often seek a degree of flexibility
to permit modifications to national
agreements.
Another recent feature has been the
development of ‘new style’ agreements, often
associated with overseas-owned companies,
although they are also found in British-
owned firms. These agreements often
involve:
• the recognition of a single union for all
of a company’s employees (particularly
for companies recognising unions for the
first time);
• ‘single status’, involving the elimination
of the traditional distinction between
managers, supervisors and other
employees;
• a greater emphasis on employee
participation; and
• flexibility in working practices.
Employee Involvement
Employers practise a wide variety of methods
of informing and consulting their employees,
not only through committees but also
through direct communication between
management and employees. These methods
include:
• employee bulletins and reports;
• briefing systems;
• quality circles; and
• financial participation schemes.
Arrangements of this sort, voluntarily
introduced by employers and employees
according to their own priorities, needs and
circumstances, are seen by the Government
as a key factor in increasing employee
commitment and improving business
productivity and performance.
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. As well as negotiating pay and
other terms and conditions of employment
with employers, they provide benefits and
services such as educational facilities,
financial services, legal advice and aid in
work-related cases. In recent years several
unions have extended considerably the range
of services they offer to members. Trade
unions vary widely in the composition of
their membership, and may be organised
either by occupation (for example, they may
recruit clerical staff or managers wherever
employed) or by industry, while some are
based on a combination of both. Staff
associations represent the employees of a
particular company.
There has been a decline in trade union
membership, and by the end of 1989 total
union membership was about 10 million, of
whom 81 per cent were in the 23 largest
unions. The decline reflects the moves away
from manufacturing and public services, both
of which have a relatively high level of
membership.
The number of unions has also fallen,
reflecting a number of mergers and the
absorption by larger unions of small unions
and of long-established craft unions. For
example, in 1990 the National Union of
Railwaymen merged with the National Union
of Seamen to form the National Union of
Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers.
Several other unions are discussing possible
mergers. At the end of 1990 there were 323
trade unions on the list maintained by the
Certification Officer. To be eligible for entry
on the list a trade union must show that it
consists wholly or mainly of workers and that
329
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
its principal purposes include the regulation
of relations between workers and employers
or between workers and employers’
associations.
Six unions had over 500,000 members at
the end of 1989:
• the Transport and General Workers’
Union (1'3 million);
• the GMB (823,000);
• the National and Local Government
Officers’ Association (751,000);
• the Amalgamated Engineering
Union (742,000);
• the Manufacturing, Science and
Finance Union (653,000); and
• the National Union of Public
Employees (605,000).
Trade union organisation varies widely,
but the central governing body usually
consists of a national executive council or
committee, elected by a secret ballot of the
individual members and responsible to the
conference of delegates from local branches,
normally held annually. Many unions also
have regional and district organisations. At
the level of the individual member there are
local branches, covering one or more
workplaces. The organising of members in
individual places of work and the negotiation
of local pay agreements with management at
the workplace may be done by full-time
district officials of the union or, in many
cases, by elected workplace representatives,
often called ‘shop stewards’. Where two or
more unions have members in the same
workplace, shop stewards’ committees may
discuss matters of common concern.
Trades Union Congress
In Britain the national centre of the trade
union movement is the Trades Union
Congress (TUC), founded in 1868. Its
affiliated membership comprises 74 trade
unions which together represent some 8 2
million people, or about 85 per cent of all
trade unionists in Britain. It has more
members than any other trade union centre
in Western Europe. The TUC’s objectives
are to promote the interests of its affiliated
organisations and to improve the economic
and social conditions of working people. The
TUC deals with all general questions which
concern trade unions, both nationally and
internationally, and provides a forum in
which affiliated unions can collectively
determine policy. There are eight TUC
regional councils for England and a Wales
Trades Union Council.
The annual Congress meets in September
to discuss matters of concern to trade
unionists. A General Council represents the
TUC between annual meetings by:
• carrying out Congress decisions;
• watching economic and social
developments;
• providing educational and advisory
services to unions; and
• presenting in national debate the trade
union viewpoint on economic, social and
industrial issues.
The TUC organises extensive education
services relating to many aspects of trade
unionism and other subjects, such as health
and safety.
The TUC plays an active part in
international trade union activity, through its
affiliation to the International Confederation
of Free Trade Unions and the European
Trade Union Confederation. It also
nominates the British workers’ delegation
to the annual International Labour
Conference.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
Trade unions in Scotland also have their
own national central body, the Scottish
Trades Union Congress, which in many
respects is similar in constitution and
function to the TUC. Trade unions in
Northern Ireland are represented by the
Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish
Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU). Most
trade unionists in Northern Ireland are
members of organisations affiliated to the
ICTU, while the majority also belong to
unions based in Great Britain which are also
affiliated to the TUC. The Northern Ireland
330
EMPLOYMENT
Committee of the ICTU enjoys a high
degree of autonomy.
Legal Framework
The Government’s reforms of employment
and trade union law have helped obtain a
better balance of power between trade unions
and employers, and between trade unions
and their own members. This has played a
key role in transforming Britain’s industrial
relations. The Government believes that the
Employment Acts of 1980, 1982, 1988 and
1990, and the Trade Union Act of 1984 have
helped to make union leaders more
accountable to their members and to promote
an acceptance of the role of the law in
industrial relations. In 1990 industrial
disputes reached their lowest recorded level
since 1935.
Trade Union Recognition and
Responsibilities
The previous statutory recognition procedure
was repealed in 1980. Employers are now
free to decide whether or not they wish to
recognise a particular union, or unions, for
collective bargaining purposes.
The law now makes a trade union
responsible if industrial action is called for or
organised by any of its officials. This means
that if a trade union acts unlawfully, for
example, by calling for industrial action
without a proper secret ballot, legal
proceedings can be taken against the union
itself.
The law also means that if a union defies
a court order, for example, an order to
withdraw an unlawful call for industrial
action, it can be held to be in contempt of
court. In such circumstances severe penalties
can be imposed, including sequestration of
the union’s assets.
Industrial Action
Under common law, it is unlawful to induce
workers to break a contract or to threaten to
do so. Thus, without special protection,
trade unions would face the possibility of
legal action for inducing breaches of contract
every time they called a strike or other form
of industrial action. To prevent this,
‘statutory immunities’ were introduced,
which provide that trade unions and
individuals can, in certain circumstances,
organise industrial action without fear of
being sued in the courts. These immunities
only protect those who call for or organise
industrial action. They do not protect
individuals who choose to take industrial
action from being dismissed, or from legal
action by their employer.
Prior to the 1980s, the circumstances in
which these immunities applied were very
wide, so that the organisation of almost any
industrial action was protected. The
legislative reforms of the past decade have
restricted the scope of these immunities in a
number of ways. To have the benefit of
statutory immunity, the organisation of
industrial action must now:
• be in contemplation or furtherance of a
trade dispute between workers and their
own employer;
• not involve workers who have no dispute
with their own employer (so-called
‘secondary’ action);
• not involve unlawful picketing;
• not be done to establish or maintain a
union-only labour agreement (the ‘closed
shop’); and
• not be done in support of any employee
dismissed while taking unofficial
industrial action.
Before calling for industrial action, a trade
union must first obtain the support of its
members in a properly-conducted secret
ballot. Moreover, any trade union member
has the right to restrain his union from
calling on him, and other members, to take
action unless a ballot has supported the
action.
Trade Union Elections
The law requires a trade union to elect every
member of its governing body, its general
secretary and its president. Elections must be
held at least once every five years and be
carried out by secret postal ballot of the
331
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
union’s members. The election must be held
under independent scrutiny. Any union
member who believes that the union has not
complied with the statutory requirements
may complain to the courts or to the
Certification Officer.
Members ’ Rights
All individuals have the right under the law
not to be dismissed or refused employment
because they are not or will not become
trade union members. They also have the
right not to be refused any of the services of
an employment agency because they are, or
are not, members of a union. Individuals
who believe that they have been dismissed or
refused employment on grounds related to
their union membership or non-membership
may complain to an industrial tribunal.
Other rights include:
• a statutory remedy for workers who have
been unjustifiably disciplined by their
union;
• inspection of their union’s accounting
records; and
• the right to have automatic deduction of
their union subscription from their pay
stopped if they leave the union.
The Government has established a
Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union
Members to help ensure that members need
not be disadvantaged in bringing legal
proceedings against their union to enforce
certain rights and duties.
Political Funds
A trade union may establish a political fund
if it wishes to use its money for what the law
defines as ‘political objects’—the support of
party political activities. If a union wishes to
set up a political fund, its members must
first agree in a secret ballot a resolution
adopting those political objectives as an aim
of the union. The union must also ballot its
members every ten years to maintain the
fund. Where a political levy from union
members is deducted from pay, the law
provides that an individual member may
choose to opt out of paying.
Government Proposals
Further proposals were included in a Green
Paper, Industrial Relations in the 1990s,
published in July 1991. These include:
• provision that seven days’ notice should
be given before strikes and other
industrial action;
• a right for members of the public to seek
injunctions to halt unlawful industrial
action affecting public services;
• the right for employees to join the union
of their choice;
• the right to a postal ballot on union
mergers;
• a proposal that collective agreements
should have the status of contracts
binding upon both parties unless they
include specific provisions making them
unenforceable; and
• new powers for the Certification Officer
to investigate mismanagement of union
finances.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in Britain are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters,
although others are also concerned with
commercial matters or trade associations.
The primary aims of such organisations are:
• to help to establish suitable terms and
conditions of employment;
• to promote good relations with
employees and the efficient use of
manpower; and
• to provide means of settling any disputes
which may arise.
Combined employers’ organisations and
trade associations may also represent
members’ points of view as manufacturers or
traders on commercial matters.
Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely
local in character or deal with a section of an
industry or, for example, with small
332
EMPLOYMENT
businesses; most are national and are
concerned with the whole of an industry. In
some of the main industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national
federations. In others, within which different
firms are engaged in making different
principal products, there is a complex
structure with national and regional
federations for parts of an industry as well as
for the industry as a whole. At the end of
1990, 135 listed and 162 unlisted employers’
associations were known to the Certification
Officer. Those which are national
organisations negotiate the national collective
agreements for their industry with the trade
unions concerned; most of these national
organisations belong to the Confederation of
British Industry.
Confederation of British Industry
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
is the largest central employers’ organisation
in Britain, representing directly or indirectly
some 250,000 businesses which together
employ about half the working population. It
aims primarily to ensure that government,
national and international institutions and
the public understand the needs, intentions
and problems of business. Membership
ranges from the smallest to the largest
companies, private sector and nationalised,
and covers a broad spectrum, including
manufacturing, agriculture, construction,
distribution, mining, finance, retailing and
insurance. Most national employers’
organisations, trade associations and some
chambers of commerce are members. Policy
is determined by a council of 400 members,
and there is a permanent staff of 295; there
are 13 regional offices and an office in
Brussels. The CBI is the British member of
the Union of Industries of the European
Community.
Terms and Conditions of
Employment
Basic rates of pay vary widely, and in private
industry rates are frequently determined
locally, with less importance attached to
national agreements. Higher rates are usually
paid for overtime and shift work,
and weekly earnings may be further
increased by incentive bonus schemes or
other performance-related arrangements.
Earnings
According to the Department of
Employment’s New Earnings Survey, the
average weekly earnings, unaffected by
absence and including overtime payments, in
April 1990 of full-time employees on adult
rates were £263. Earnings were higher for
non-manual employees (£291) than for
manual employees (£221). Some 51 per cent
of manual employees and 19 per cent of non-
manual employees received overtime
payments. In the year to April 1991 the
underlying average increase in earnings was
about 8-8 per cent.
Remuneration in commercial, technical
and professional careers is normally by
annual salary paid monthly, often on a scale
carrying annual increments. Many of the top
posts in leading commercial and industrial
companies carry salaries which are
performance-related, and the majority are
between £100,000 and £300,000 a year
before tax, reflecting increasing competition
for top management. Senior management
salaries are generally in the range of £40,000
to £100,000 a year, while middle
management salaries typically fall between
£20,000 and £40,000 a year.
There has been a move towards
performance-related pay, which has been
encouraged by the Government. Since 1987
income tax relief has been available for
employees receiving profit-related pay under
schemes registered by the Inland Revenue.
The 1991 Budget doubled this tax relief to
cover all profit-related pay within certain
existing limits. By the end of June 1991,
there were 1,329 live schemes covering over
350,000 employees.
Employee Share Schemes
The Government has taken a number of
steps to encourage direct ownership by
employees of shares in the businesses for
which they work. The number of profit-
333
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
sharing and savings-related share option
schemes, which must be open to all eligible
employees in a company, has risen from 78
in 1979 to over 1,898 in 1990, benefiting
over 2 million employees.
Other Benefits
Additional benefits exist in varying degrees.
About half of employees in employment are
covered by pension schemes provided by
their employers. Many employees are also
covered by occupational sick-pay schemes
which are additional or complementary to
the state schemes, and by schemes to provide
private medical treatment. Such benefits are
more usual among clerical and professional
employees than among manual workers. The
provision of low-priced meals at the place of
employment is usual in large undertakings
and quite common in smaller ones. Many
offices and shops which are unable to
provide ganteen facilities for their staff have
adopted luncheon voucher schemes.
Company cars are provided for directors and
employees in a wide variety of circumstances.
Other fringe benefits available include life
assurance and low-interest loans.
Hours of Work
The basic working week in Great Britain is
in the range 37 5 to 40 hours for manual
work and 35 to 38 for non-manual work; a
five-day week is usually worked. While the
basic working week has been gradually
shortening, the general trend in total hours
worked has been rising since 1981. In spring
1990 total hours a week actually worked
(including overtime) for full-time employees
were 45 6 for men, compared with 40-1 for
women. Men and women in non-manual
occupations generally work less overtime
than manual employees.
In general, there are no limits on hours
worked by adults except in a few occupations
(such as for drivers of goods vehicles and
public service vehicles). Restrictions on
working hours for women and for school-
leavers aged under 18 were repealed by the
Sex Discrimination Act 1986 and the
Employment Act 1989.
Holidays with Pay
There are no general statutory entitlements
to holidays, and holiday entitlements are
frequently determined by collective
agreements. These generally provide for at
least four weeks’ paid holiday a year, and
nearly all manual employees covered by
national collective agreements have
entitlements of four weeks or more, with
nearly 25 per cent having five weeks or
more. Non-manual workers tend to have
longer holidays than manual workers.
Holiday entitlements may also be dependent
upon length of service.
Office of Manpower Economics
The Office of Manpower Economics is an
independent non-statutory organisation
responsible for servicing independent review
bodies which advise on the pay of various
public-sector groups. These are:
• the Top Salaries Review Body;
• the Armed Forces’ Pay Review Body;
• the Doctors’ and Dentists’ Review Body;
and
• the Review Body for Nurses and other
National Health Service professions.
The Office also provides services for the
Pharmacists’ Review Panel, the Police
Negotiating Board and the Civil Service
Arbitration Tribunal. It is responsible for
research into pay and associated matters as
requested by the Government. A review body
for teachers’ salaries was established in 1991.
Wages Councils
Wages councils fix statutory minimum pay
for 2 5 million workers aged 21 and over,
primarily in service industries such as
retailing, catering and hairdressing. There
are 26 such councils in Great Britain, each
consisting of equal numbers of
representatives of employers and employees
in the industry concerned, and up to five
independent members. Councils are
empowered to fix a minimum hourly rate, an
overtime rate and a limit on the amount an
EMPLOYMENT
employer can charge for accommodation
provided. However, the Government is
concerned about the continued relevance of
the system, and is keeping it under review.
In Northern Ireland there are nine wages
councils, which fix statutory minimum pay
for some 36,000 workers.
Employment Protection
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For
example, most employees are entitled to
receive from their employers written
information on their main terms and
conditions of employment, while minimum
periods of notice when employment is to be
terminated are laid down for both employers
and employees. Employees with the
necessary period of continuous employment
with their employer (currently two years for
those working 16 hours a week or more) are
entitled to lump-sum redundancy payments
if their jobs cease to exist (for example,
because of technological improvements or a
fall in demand) and their employers cannot
offer suitable alternative work. Where
employers are insolvent, the cost is partly
met from the National Insurance fund, and
direct payments are made by the Department
of Employment. Most employees who believe
they have been unfairly dismissed have the
right to complain to an industrial tribunal,
provided they have the necessary qualifying
period of employment. If the complaint is
upheld, the tribunal may make an order for
reinstatement or award compensation. Most
pregnant women who have the necessary
qualifying period of continuous employment
have the right to return to their former job,
or a suitable alternative, after maternity
absence. Legislation forbids any employment
of children under 13 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of
children who have not reached the statutory
minimum school-leaving age, with some
exceptions for family undertakings.
The Government is keeping under review
the legislation affecting terms and conditions
of employment. Its aim is to ensure that the
obligations placed on employers do not
involve significant costs which discourage
recruitment. The Employment Act 1989
contained a number of provisions designed to
reduce burdens on employers. For example,
employers with fewer than 20 employees
have become exempt from the requirement
to provide employees with a separate note of
disciplinary rules in the written statement of
their main terms and conditions of
employment. In addition, the Act extended
the qualifying period for the right to receive
a written statement of reasons for dismissal
from six months to two years, to bring it
into line with the qualifying period for unfair
dismissal.
Equal Opportunities
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it
unlawful to discriminate on grounds of
colour, race, nationality (including
citizenship) or ethnic or national origin, in
employment, training and related matters.
The Department of Employment operates a
nationwide Race Relations Employment
Advisory Service. Its objective is to promote
the Government’s policies aimed at
eliminating racial discrimination in
employment and promoting fair treatment
and equality of opportunity in employment.
Advisers provide employers with advice and
practical help in developing and
implementing equal opportunity strategies.
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, as
amended, makes it generally unlawful in
Great Britain to discriminate on grounds of
sex or being married when it comes to
recruiting, training, promoting, dismissing or
retiring staff. It also provides redress against
victimisation and may also, in certain
circumstances, do so against sexual
harassment. The Equal Pay Act 1970 makes
it generally unlawful to discriminate between
men and women in pay and other terms and
conditions of employment. The Act was
significantly extended in 1984 to meet
European Community requirements by
providing for equal pay for work of equal
value. There is equivalent legislation in
Northern Ireland.
Practical advice to employers and others
on the best arrangements for implementing
equal opportunities policies in Great Britain
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is given in codes of practice from the
Commission for Racial Equality and from
the Equal Opportunities Commission (see
pp 24 and 25).
Northern Ireland
Similar legislation to that in Great Britain
on equal pay and sex discrimination applies
in Northern Ireland, but there is no
legislation on race relations. Discrimination,
both direct and indirect, in employment on
grounds of religious belief or political
opinion is unlawful. The Fair Employment
Commission has the task of promoting
equality of opportunity and investigating
employment practices, with powers to issue
legally enforceable directions. The Fair
Employment Tribunal adjudicates on
individual complaints of religious or
political discrimination and enforces the
Commission’s directions. All but the
smallest employers are required to monitor
the religious composition of their workforce
and periodically to review their employment
practices. Where fair participation is not
being enjoyed by both Protestants and
Roman Catholics, the introduction of
‘affirmative action’ measures must be
considered.
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body with the general duty of promoting
the improvement of industrial relations.
ACAS is directed by a council consisting of
a full-time chairman and employer, trade
union and independent members
experienced in industrial relations. The
Service conciliates in industrial disputes in
both the public and private sectors. ACAS
assistance was sought in nearly 1,260
disputes in 1990. In addition, there were
200 further requests for ACAS to provide
arbitration. It may do this either by
appointing single arbitrators or boards of
arbitration, or by referring cases to the
Central Arbitration Committee (see below).
Although ACAS has prime responsibility
for helping to resolve disputes, and has also
set up major committees of inquiry, the
Secretary of State for Employment retains
powers to appoint a court of inquiry or
committee of investigation into a dispute.
However, these are rarely used.
ACAS gives advice on all aspects of
industrial relations and employment policies
to employers, managers, trade unions,
employee representatives and individuals. It
handled over 418,000 enquiries in 1990.
Specialist staff made nearly 7,000 advisory
visits. ACAS also carries particular
responsibility for attempting conciliation on
complaints of infringement of individual
employee rights. These include individual
complaints of unfair dismissal; complaints
under the equal pay legislation; and
complaints on employment matters under the
sex discrimination and race relations
legislation. There were over 52,000
individual conciliation cases in 1990. Its
Work Research Unit aims to encourage
industry and commerce to adopt measures
that can lead to improvements in the quality
of working life and so to improvements in
economic performance.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations
Agency, an independent statutory body,
provides services similar to those provided
by ACAS in Great Britain.
Central Arbitration Committee
The Central Arbitration Committee is an
independent standing arbitration body. It
provides boards of arbitration for the
settlement of trade disputes referred to it
with the consent of the parties concerned. It
also adjudicates on claims made under the
disclosure of information provisions of the
Employment Protection Act 1975.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Recent statistics indicate a reduction in the
rate of major and other reported injuries to
employees, although a high rate of injuries
remains in certain industries, such as
construction and agriculture. Employers have
a duty in law to take reasonable care of their
staff, as well as others affected by their work
336
*
EMPLOYMENT
activities. Employees have a duty to take care
| of their own safety and that of their fellow
j workers. The principal legislation is the
i Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It
| places general duties on everyone concerned
| with work activities, including employers, the
! self-employed, employees, and manufacturers
I and suppliers of materials for use at work.
Supporting Acts and regulations deal with
| particular hazards and types of work.
Employers with five or more staff must
prepare a written statement of health and
safety policy and inform their staff of it.
The Act requires the Health and Safety
Commission to develop workable proposals
to update earlier legislation, much of which
was not adaptable to technical innovation.
Reforms have since been completed in many
areas. Much of the old law has been replaced
by modern provisions, supported by codes of
practice and other guidance material.
The Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health Regulations 1988 are some of the
most important regulations made under the
1974 Act. They replaced a range of inflexible
and outdated legislation by a comprehensive
and systematic approach to the control of
exposure to virtually all substances hazardous
to health. These include chemicals, fumes,
dust and micro-organisms.
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC),
which is accountable to Parliament through
the Secretary of State for Employment, 'has
responsibility for developing policies,
including guidance, codes of practice, or
proposals for regulations. In the case of
proposals for changes in legislation, the HSC
consults those who would be affected and
makes recommendations to the Secretary of
State concerned.
The HSC has seven advisory committees
covering subjects such as toxic substances,
genetic manipulation and the safety of
nuclear installations. There are also 12
industry advisory committees, each of which
deals with a specific industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is
the primary instrument for carrying out the
HSC’s policies and has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, except where other bodies, such as local
authorities, are responsible. The HSE’s field
services and inspections over the country as a
whole are carried out by the Field
Operations Division. This incorporates the
Factory, Agricultural and Quarries
inspectorates; the regional staff of the
Employment Medical Advisory Service
(which advises on medical aspects of
employment problems), and the Field
Consulting Groups, which provide technical
support to the inspectorates. The HSE also
includes:
• the Health Policy Division;
• the Technology Division, which provides
technical advice on industrial health and
safety matters; and
• the Research and Laboratory Services
Division, which provides scientific and
medical support and testing services, and
carries out research.
In premises such as offices, shops,
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, health
and safety legislation is enforced by
inspectors appointed by local authorities,
working under guidance from the HSC.
Some other official bodies work under
agency agreement with the HSC.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the Health and Safety
Agency, roughly corresponding to the HSC,
and an Employment Medical Advisory
Service were set up by the Health and Safety
at Work (NI) Order 1978. The general
requirements of the Northern Ireland health
and safety legislation, similar to those for
Great Britain, are enforced mainly by the
Department of Economic Development
through its Health and Safety Inspectorate.
337
19 Public Finance
Public finance is concerned with taxation,
expenditure and borrowing (or debt
repayment) by central and local government,
management of the public sector’s assets and
liabilities and the financing of public
corporations. Central government raises
money from individuals and companies by
direct and indirect taxation and from
National Insurance contributions. It spends
money on goods and services, such as health
and defence, and in payments to people,
such as social security and pensions. Local
government receives substantial grants from
central government and raises revenue
mainly through the community charge and
rates (local property taxes, which may be
levied on domestic and business properties).
Domestic rates have been abolished in Great
Britain but not in Northern Ireland. Business
rates apply throughout Britain. Local
government provides services such as
education, police and fire services, and refuse
collection. The diagram (see p 346) shows
the relative importance of the various items
of receipts (including borrowing) and
expenditure for general government.
The government department responsible
for broad control of public finance and
expenditure is HM Treasury. The Bank of
England (the central bank) advises the
Government on financial matters, executes
monetary policy and acts as banker to the
Government.
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE
The three main definitions of public
expenditure are general government
expenditure, the planning total and Supply
expenditure.
General government expenditure is the
spending of central and local government,
excluding transfers between them such as
central government grants to local
authorities. It is the key public spending
aggregate and is used in the medium-term
financial strategy (see below), where public
spending is set in the context of
macroeconomic policy. It is more appropriate
than the other measures for making
international comparisons as it is usually less
affected by institutional differences.
The planning total is used by the
Government for the purposes of planning
and control. The Government seeks to
achieve its wider medium-term objective
(expressed in terms of general government
expenditure) by controlling spending within
this total. The planning total covers:
• expenditure for which central
government is itself responsible;
• the support it provides or approves for
local authority expenditure;
• the financing requirements of public
corporations (including nationalised
industries);
• privatisation proceeds; and
• a reserve to cover unanticipated
expenditure.
Supply expenditure is financed out of
money voted by Parliament in the Supply
Estimates (see below). Practically all of
Supply expenditure counts in the planning
total, and accounts for about three-quarters
of it. The main element of the planning total
not funded through Supply Estimates is
expenditure financed from the National
Insurance Fund.
The background to the present
Government’s planning of public expenditure
is the medium-term financial strategy,
introduced in 1980. The Government’s aim
is to preserve a firm financial framework in
order to defeat inflation and to ensure the
339
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
continuation of the conditions for sustainable
growth. With commitments also to reduce
taxation and curb the role of the State, the
Government therefore seeks to reduce public
expenditure as a proportion of national
income as well. For 1991—92 taxes and social
security contributions are forecast to amount
to 37 per cent of gross domestic product
(GDP).
General government expenditure
(excluding privatisation proceeds) as a
proportion of gross domestic product
fell from over 47 per cent in the early
1980s to some 40-5 per cent in 1990-91.
The Government expects small variations on
a public expenditure level of 40 5 per cent of
GDP in the next few years.
Table 19.1 gives projections for
government expenditure and receipts and the
borrowing requirement for the years up to
1994-95.
The Planning Cycle
Each year the Government conducts a review
of its expenditure plans for the forthcoming
three years (the ‘public expenditure survey’)
and publishes the resulting totals, together
with any changes in National Insurance, in
the Autumn Statement in November. Details
of these plans are published early in the
following year in a series of departmental
reports. Detailed summary analyses are
published in a statistical supplement to
the Autumn Statement.
The Government’s updating of the
medium-term financial strategy and
consequent plans for the public finances
over the following year, including any tax
changes, are set out in the Financial
Statement and Budget Report, published
with the Budget around the end of the
financial year (31 March). Details of the
tax changes are included in the Finance
Bill, which is presented to Parliament
shortly after the Budget and becomes law
during the summer.
Public Expenditure Totals
Public expenditure totals are analysed in
Table 19.2. The largest departmental
programmes are those of the Department
of Social Security (37 per cent of central
government expenditure in 1990-91), the
Department of Health and the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys, and
the Ministry of Defence (both 16 per
cent).
About half of local authority spending
is financed by grants from central
government. The rest is met from the
community charge and rates, surpluses on
trading, rents and borrowing. Education
accounts for over one-third of local
authority spending; law and order,

housing and other environmental services,

for most of the remainder.
Reserve
Planned expenditure includes an unallocated
reserve for each year of the plans to cover
additions to departmental spending, whether
arising from policy changes, new initiatives
or revisions to the estimated costs of
demand-led programmes. For the current
year the reserve is used as a control
mechanism. The reserve has been set at
higher levels for each of the next two years
but some will normally be allocated to
departments as spending forecasts are made
firmer within the public expenditure
planning total. The balance will be retained
for contingencies which might arise during
the current year.
The Estimates
The annual public expenditure survey
conducted by HM Treasury provides the
basis for the Estimates which each
government department submits to HM
Treasury in December, giving details of its
cash requirements for the financial year
beginning in the following April. After
Treasury approval, these Supply Estimates
are presented to Parliament in March,
usually about the same time as the Budget
(see p 342). Parliament approves them in
July as part of the Annual Appropriation
Act; expenditure between 1 April and this
date is covered by Votes on Account
approved before the start of the financial
year. Supplementary Estimates may also be
presented to Parliament during the course of
the year.
If any Supply Estimate is overspent, the
Public Accounts Committee (see p 342) may
investigate fully before Parliament is asked to
approve any Excess Vote to balance the
account. In each parliamentary session, up to
three ‘Estimates days’ are available for
debates on the Supply Estimates, following
scrutiny by select committees of the House
of Commons.
Cash Limits
The Government sets cash limits on about
60 per cent of Supply expenditure. The
imposition of cash limits indicates that the
Government intends to avoid extra provision
for programmes even in the event of
unexpected increases in costs. It is
government policy to extend the coverage of
cash limits wherever possible. They cover
the major part of grants to local authorities,
which are financed out of Supply
expenditure. Cash limits also apply to some
expenditure not voted in the Estimates.
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Running cost limits are imposed on the
administrative costs of central government,
which are separately identified in the
Estimates.
There is a limited facility for carrying
forward underspending on the capital
components of cash limits and on running
cost limits. Any overspending of cash or
running cost limits leads to an investigation
into the causes and, where appropriate, a
reduction in the limits in the following year.
Those Estimates that are not subject to
cash limits mainly finance demand-led
services such as income support. In such
cases, once policy and rates of payment are
determined, expenditure depends on factors
beyond the direct control of government,
such as the number of eligible recipients.
Examination and Audit of Public
Expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried
out by select committees of the House of
Commons, which study in detail the
activities of particular government
departments and require the attendance of
ministers and officials for cross-examination.
The audit of the Government’s spending
which follows up the control inherent in
parliamentary approval of the Estimates is
exercised through the functions of the
Comptroller and Auditor General and the
Public Accounts Committee.
Comptroller and Auditor General
The Comptroller and Auditor General, an
officer of the House of Commons appointed
by the Crown, has two distinct functions.
The duty of Comptroller General is to
ensure that all revenue and other public
money payable to the Consolidated Fund and
the National Loans Fund (see below) is duly
paid and that all payments out of these funds
are authorised by statute. The duty of the
Auditor General is to certify the accounts of
all government departments and those of a
wide range of other public sector bodies; to
examine revenue accounts and inventories;
and to report the results of these
examinations to Parliament.
Public Accounts Committee
The Public Accounts Committee considers
the accounts of government departments and
the Comptroller and Auditor General’s
reports on them and on departments’ use of
their resources. The Committee takes
evidence from the official heads of
departments and relevant public sector
bodies and submits to Parliament reports
which carry considerable weight; its
recommendations are taken very seriously by
the departments and organisations that it
examines. The Government’s formal replies
to the reports are presented to Parliament by
HM Treasury in the form of Treasury
minutes, and the reports and minutes are
usually debated annually in the Commons.
Central Government Funds
The Government’s sterling expenditure is
largely met out of the Consolidated Fund, an
account at the Bank of England into which
tax receipts and other revenues are paid. Any
excess of expenditure over receipts is met by
the National Loans Fund, which is another
official sterling account at the Bank of
England and is the repository for funds
borrowed by the Government. The National
Insurance Fund, into which contributions are
paid by employers and employed people, is
used mainly to pay for social security
benefits; a small proportion of National
Insurance contributions is paid direct to the
Consolidated Fund in order to help finance
the National Health Service.
THE BUDGET
The Budget, which usually takes place in
March, sets out the Government’s proposals
for changes in taxation and is the main
occasion for an annual review of economic
policy. The proposals are announced to the
House of Commons by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in the Budget statement and are
published in the Financial Statement and
Budget Report. This report also contains a
review of recent developments in the
economy, together with an economic
forecast, and sets out the fiscal and monetary
342
PUBLIC FINANCE
framework within which economic policy
operates. This is the medium-term financial
strategy (see p 339).
The Budget statement is followed by the
moving of a set of Budget resolutions in
which the proposals are embodied. These
resolutions are the foundation of the Finance
Bill, in which the proposals are set out for
detailed consideration by Parliament. Some
of the resolutions give temporary effect,
under the Provisional Collection of Taxes
Act 1968, to certain of the tax proposals in
the Budget. This enables the Government to
collect certain taxes provisionally, at the
levels provided by the Budget proposals,
pending enactment of the Finance Bill.
For two taxes—income tax and
corporation tax—annual Ways and Means
resolutions followed by Finance Bill clauses
are required to maintain their existence,
since they are annual rather than permanent
taxes. Thus, a Budget and a Finance Bill are
necessary at or about the beginning of each
financial year. Following completion of its
parliamentary stages, the Finance Bill
becomes an Act, usually around the end of
July. Tax changes can be made at other
times, however, either by specific legislation
or by the use of the regulator, which permits
limited changes between Budgets in value
added tax (by up to 25 per cent) and the
main excise duties (by up to 10 per cent).
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
The main sources of revenue are:
• taxes on income (including profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue
tax;
• taxes on capital, which comprise
inheritance tax and capital gains tax; and
• taxes on expenditure, which include
value added tax (VAT) and customs and
excise duties.
Other sources of revenue are National
Insurance contributions, which give
entitlement to a range of benefits, and the
community charge and business rates.
Thresholds and rate bands for income tax,
inheritance tax and capital gains tax are
raised automatically each year in line with
the rise in retail prices over the previous
calendar year unless Parliament decides
otherwise. The Inland Revenue assesses and
collects the taxes on income, profits and
capital, and also stamp duty. Taxes on
individual incomes are progressive in that
larger incomes bear a proportionately greater
amount of tax. HM Customs and Excise
collects the most important taxes on
expenditure (VAT, most duties and car tax).
Vehicle excise duty is the responsibility of
the Department of Transport and National
Insurance contributions that of the
Department of Social Security (although the
latter are generally collected by the Inland
Revenue). The community charge and
business rates are collected by local
authorities.
A new taxpayer’s charter was launched in
1991. It sets out the standard of service that
people can expect from the Inland revenue
and HM Customs and Excise.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
Income tax is imposed for the year of
assessment beginning on 6 April. For
1991-92 the basic rate of 25 per cent applies
to the first £23,700 of taxable income. A rate
of 40 per cent applies to income above this
level. These rates apply to total income,
including both earned and investment
income.
A number of personal allowances and
reliefs reduce the amount of a person’s
taxable income compared with gross income.
All taxpayers, irrespective of sex or marital
status, are entitled to a personal allowance
against income from all sources. Married
women pay their own tax on the basis of
their own income. In addition, there is a
married couple’s allowance, which goes to
the husband in the first instance. However, if
his income is not high enough to use it in
full, he can transfer the unused portion to
his wife, to set against her income. The
current values of the main allowances are
£3,295 for the personal allowance and
£1,720 for the married couple’s allowance.
343
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Assuming only the basic personal
allowances, a single person or married
woman with an income of £14,000 in
1991-92 pays £2,676 in income tax, while a
married man with the same income pays
£2,246. The amount of tax payable by a
single person or married woman varies from,
for example, £1,176 on an annual income of
£8,000 to £27,127 on one of £80,000.
Among the most important of the reliefs is
that for mortgage interest payments on
borrowing for house purchase up to the
statutory limit of £30,000. Relief is restricted
to the basic rate and is usually given ‘at
source’ (that is, repayments which the
borrower makes to the lender are reduced to
take account of tax at the basic rate and the
tax refund is then passed directly by the tax
authorities to the building society or bank
making the loan rather than to the individual
taxpayer). Another relief is that under the
Business Expansion Scheme, whereby certain
investors in trading companies without a
stock market quotation (usually small
companies) are able to obtain relief on up to
£40,000 invested in any one year.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn
(PAYE) system whereby tax is deducted (and
accounted for to the Inland Revenue) by the
employer, thus enabling employees to keep
as up to date as possible with their tax
payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all
income which originates in Britain (although
some forms of income—such as certain social
security benefits—are exempt) and on all
income arising abroad of people resident in
Britain. Interest on certain British
government securities belonging to people
not ordinarily resident in Britain is exempt.
Britain has entered into agreements with
many countries to provide relief from double
taxation; where such agreements are not in
force unilateral relief is often allowed. British
residents working abroad for the whole year
benefit from 100 per cent tax relief.
Corporation Tax
The rates of company tax in Britain are
lower than in most other industrialised
countries. Companies pay corporation tax on
their income after deduction of certain
allowances and any capital gains. A company
which distributes profits to its shareholders
is required to make an advance payment of
corporation tax to the Inland Revenue. In
general, this payment is set against a
company’s liability to corporation tax on its
income and capital gains. The recipient of
the distribution (if resident in Britain) is
entitled to a tax credit, which satisfies his or
her liability to income tax at the basic rate.
The main rate of corporation tax is 33 per
cent for 1991-92, with a reduced rate of 25
per cent for small companies (those with
profits below £250,000 in a year). Marginal
relief between the main rate and the small
companies’ rate is allowed for companies
with profits between £250,000 and £E25
million. Expenditure on plant and
machinery, on scientific research and on
industrial and certain other buildings
qualifies for annual allowances.
Petroleum Revenue Tax
Petroleum revenue tax (deductible in
computing profits for corporation tax) is
charged on profits from the production, as
opposed to the refining or other forms of
processing, of oil and gas under licence in
Britain and on its Continental Shelf. The
rate of tax is 75 per cent. Each licensee of an
oilfield is charged on the profits from that
field after deduction of certain allowances
and reliefs which, among other things,
encourage exploration, appraisal and future
field development. The tax is computed at
half-yearly intervals and the bulk of it is
collected in monthly instalments.
Taxes on Capital
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax applies to transfers of property
made on, or up to seven years before, the
donor’s death. It is also immediately
chargeable on certain lifetime transfers.
Subject to certain exemptions and reliefs, the
first £140,000 of the cumulative total of
chargeable transfers is not liable to tax, higher
344
PUBLIC FINANCE
amounts are taxed at a single rate of 40 per
cent. A tapered system of relief reduces the
tax on transfers made between three and
seven years before the donor’s death. Relief
ranges from 20 per cent of the tax payable on
transfers made between three and four years
prior to death to 80 per cent on those made
between six and seven years prior to death.
There are several exemptions. All
transfers to a spouse living in Britain are
exempt while gifts and bequests to charities,
political parties and heritage bodies are also
normally exempt. Business property qualifies
for relief of up to 50 per cent.
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains realised on the disposal of
assets are liable to capital gains tax or, in the
case of companies, to corporation tax.
Individuals are exempt from tax in respect of
total net gains of up to £5,500 in any one
year and most trusts on gains of up to
£2,750. Gains are treated as the taxpayer’s
top slice of income, being charged at the
individual’s higher income tax rate or the
company’s higher corporation tax rate.
Only gains arising since March 1982 are
subject to tax and the effects of inflation are
allowed for when measuring gains. The tax
on certain types of gift and certain deemed
disposals of assets may be deferred until the
assets are sold. Some assets, including the
principal private residence, movable
possessions worth less than £6,000 (and any
movable possessions with a predictable life of
less than 50 years except those on which the
expenditure qualifies for a capital allowance),
private motor cars, and National Savings
Certificates and Bonds are normally exempt.
Gains on government securities and certain
corporate bonds are exempt from the tax, as
are gains on shares owned under the
Personal Equity Plan (designed to encourage
wider share ownership).
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax
Value added tax (VAT) is a broadly based
tax, chargeable at 17-5 per cent. It is
collected at each stage in the production and
distribution of goods and services by taxable
persons (generally those whose business has a
turnover of more than £35,000 a year). The
final tax is borne by the consumer. When a
taxable person purchases taxable goods or
services, the supplier charges VAT (the
taxable person’s input tax). When the taxable
person supplies taxable goods or services to
customers, then they in turn are charged
VAT (the taxable person’s output tax). The
difference between the output tax and the
input tax is paid to, or repaid by, HM
Customs and Excise.
Certain goods and services are relieved
from VAT, either by charging at a zero rate
(a taxable person does not charge tax to a
customer but reclaims any input tax paid to
suppliers) or by exemption (a taxable person
does not charge a customer any output tax
and is not entitled to deduct or reclaim the
input tax). Zero-rating applies to exports and
to most food; books, newspapers and
periodicals; fuel (except for petrol and other
fuels for road use) and power for domestic
users; construction of new residential
buildings; certain international services;
public transport fares; caravans and
houseboats; young children’s clothing and
footwear; drugs and medicines supplied on
prescription; specified aids for handicapped
people; and certain supplies by or to
charities. Exemption applies to land
(including rents), insurance, postal services,
betting, gaming (other than by gaming
machines and lotteries), finance, education,
health, burial and cremation, and supplies by
trade unions and professional bodies to their
members.
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable in accordance
with the Common Customs Tariff of the
European Community (no such duties are
chargeable on goods which qualify as
Community goods). Special customs import
and export procedures are operated under
the Common Agricultural Policy, and
Community levies are chargeable on a wide
range of agricultural products from non-
Community countries. Under the single

Excise Duties
Hydrocarbon oils used as road fuel bear
higher rates of duty than those used for
other purposes. Kerosene, most lubricating
oils and other oils used for certain industrial
processes are free of duty. There are duties
on spirits, beer, wine, made-wine, cider and
perry, based on alcoholic strength and
volume. Spirits used for scientific, medical,
research and industrial processes are
generally free of duty. The cigarette duty is
based partly on a charge per 1,000 cigarettes
and partly on a percentage of retail price.
Duty on other tobacco products is based on
weight. Duties are charged on off-course
betting, pool betting, gaming in casinos,
bingo and gaming machines. The rates vary
with the particular form of gambling. Duty
is charged either as a percentage of gross or
net stakes or, in the case of gaming
machines, as a fixed amount per machine
according to the cost of playing it and its
prize level.
Vehicle excise duty on a private motor car
or light van is £100 a year; for motor cycles
it is £10, £20 or £40 a year according to
engine capacity. The duty on goods vehicles
is levied on the basis of gross weight and, if
over 12 tonnes, according to the number of
axles; the duty is designed to ensure that
such vehicles cover at least their road costs
through the tax paid (licence duty and fuel
duty). The duty on taxis and buses varies
according to seating capacity.
Car Tax
Cars, motor cycles, scooters, mopeds and
some motor caravans, whether British made
or imported, are chargeable with car tax at
10 per cent of the wholesale value (motor
caravans are charged at 10 per cent of 60 per
cent of the wholesale value).
VAT is charged on the price including
car tax.
Stamp Duty
Certain kinds of transfer are subject to stamp
duty. These include purchases of houses
(1 per cent on the total price if this exceeds
£30,000) and instruments such as
declarations of trust (usually 50p). Stamp
duty is also charged on transfers of stocks
and shares other than government stocks
(broadly 0 5 per cent of the value of the
transaction). However, this is to be abolished
in late 1991-92. Transfers by gift and
transfers to charities are exempt.
OTHER REVENUE
National Insurance Contributions
There are four classes of National Insurance
contribution:
• Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers;
• Class 2—paid by the self-employed;
• Class 3—paid voluntarily for pension
purposes; and
• Class 4—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower
limit, currently £5,900 a year, and up to
a set upper limit, currently £20,280 a
year (in addition to their Class 2
contribution).
Employees with earnings below £52 a
week do not pay Class 1 contributions.
Contributions on earnings of £52 a week and
over are at the rate of 2 per cent of the first
£52 of total earnings and 9 per cent of the
balance, up to the upper earnings limit of
£390 a week. Employers’ contributions are
subject to the same threshold. On earnings
above the threshold, contributions rise in
stages from 4 6 per cent of total earnings up
to a maximum of 10 4 per cent when
earnings are £185 or more a week; there is
no upper earnings limit.
Class 2 and Class 3 contributions are at a
flat rate—£515 and £5 05 a week
respectively. The self-employed may claim
exemption from payment of Class 2
contributions if their profits are expected to
be below £2,900 for the 1991-92 tax year.
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Class 4 contributions are payable at the
rate of 6-3 per cent.
Local Authority Revenue
A major source of local authority revenue in
Great Britain (but not Northern Ireland) is
the community charge. This is set at a level
reflecting spending decisions reached by a
council, for which it has to account to its
electors. However, following a review of local
government, the Government has announced
that the community charge is to be replaced
by a new council tax.
Under the council tax, each household
would receive a single bill. For
households consisting of two or more
adults, the full bill would normally be
payable; single-adult households would
receive a 25 per cent discount.
Properties would be allocated to one of
eight broad tax bands in accordance with
their value in relation to the national average
in England, Scotland or Wales as
appropriate. The Government is aiming for
the council tax to be in place in 1993-94.
In England and Wales the national non¬
domestic rate is set by central government
(although collected by local authorities). It is
paid into a national pool and then
redistributed to local authorities. In Scotland
non-domestic rates are levied by local
authorities.
FINANCIAL CONTROL
Control of public sector finances is a central
part of the Government’s medium-term
financial strategy. Between 1987-88 and
1990-91 the public sector was in surplus, so
that the Government repaid debt. From
1991_92 to 1993-94 the public sector is
expected to be in deficit, reflecting the
cyclical downswing in the economy.
However, as output revives, the public sector
finances are expected to return to their
underlying balance. Balanced public sector
finances over the medium term remain the
Government’s objective. It sees them as a
firm buttress for monetary policy in the
defeat of inflation. They also ensure that
public debt and debt interest fall steadily in
relation to GDP.
The major government debt instrument is
known as gilt-edged stock as there is no risk
of default. Gilt-edged stock is marketable
and is widely traded. Individuals may also
make transactions through post offices in
stocks included on the National Savings
Stock Register. Pension funds and life
insurance companies have the largest
holdings. The Bank of England on behalf of
the Government issues both conventional
and indexed stock (on which principal and
interest are linked to the movement in the
retail prices index).
An important additional source of
government finance is the range of
National Savings products, which are non-
marketable and are designed to attract
personal savings. The chief products are
Income Bonds, National Savings Certificates
(which may be index-linked), the Investment
Account, Capital Bonds and a Children s
Bonus Bond.
Other central government debt
instruments are Treasury bills and
certificates of tax deposit. Sterling Treasury
bills are sold at a weekly tender; the majority
have a maturity of three months. The
Government has also issued bills
denominated and payable in European
Currency Units (ECUs) since 1988. The
proceeds have been added to the official
foreign exchange reserves as opposed to
being used to finance public expenditure.
Certificates of tax deposit may be purchased
by individuals or corporate bodies to be
tendered in settlement of a range of taxes
and are non-marketable.
The bulk of public corporations’
borrowing is met by central government,
although their temporary borrowing needs
are met largely from the market, usually
under Treasury guarantee. That part of local
authority borrowing met by central
government is supplied by authorisation of
Parliament through the Public Works Loan
Board from the National Loans Fund. (The
Board remains an independent body even
though it is merged for administrative
purposes with the former National Debt
348
PUBLIC FINANCE
Office, forming the National Investment and
Loans Office.) Local authorities may also
borrow directly from the market, both short¬
term and long-term, through a range of
instruments. Some public corporations and
local authorities also borrow on occasion,
under special statutory power and with
Treasury consent, in foreign currencies.
Net Public Sector Debt
Public sector borrowing (or debt repayment)
each year represents an addition to (or
subtraction from) the net debt of the public
sector. This debt is the consolidated debt of
the public sector less its holdings of liquid
assets. At the end of March 1990
consolidated debt amounted to £190,000
million. Central government accounted for
nearly 97 per cent, local authorities for
almost 3 per cent and public corporations for
under 1 per cent. With consolidated liquid
assets amounting to £39,000 million, net
public sector debt was £151,000 million.
Central government accounted for nearly
73 per cent of consolidated liquid assets,
local authorities for almost 22 per cent and
public corporations for under 6 per cent.
20 Banking and Financial
Institutions
Britain is a major financial centre providing a
wide range of specialised services.
Historically the industry was located in the
famous ‘Square Mile’ in the City of London.
This remains broadly the case even though
the markets for financial and related services
have grown and diversified greatly. ‘The
City’ refers to a collection of markets and
institutions in and around the Square Mile.
This area is remarkable for having:
• the greatest concentration of banks in the
world (responsible for about a fifth of
total international bank lending);
• the world’s biggest insurance industry
(with about one-fifth of the international
market);
• one of the world’s largest stock
exchanges; and
• the role of principal international centre
for transactions in a large number of
commodities.
Banking, finance, insurance, business
services and leasing accounted for 18 per
cent of Britain’s total output in 1990, a share
which has risen sharply over the past decade.
Banking, finance and insurance accounted for
11-9 per cent of all employment at the end of
1990. The net identified overseas receipts of
British financial institutions in 1990 were
£14,100 million.
Development of Financial Services
The increase in the rate of international
movements of capital in the 1960s and 1970s
mainly took the form of increased bank
lending and foreign exchange trading.
London became the international centre of
this activity, particularly in the eurocurrency
markets (see p 362), and the number of
overseas banks represented in London is
larger than in any other financial centre. In
the last decade, with increasing international
competition in financial services and with
developments in technology, there has been
rapid growth in the international markets for
securities. London has again played an
important role, especially in the market for
eurobonds, in a variety of currencies (see
p 362).
Supervision
Three Acts have helped Britain’s financial
services industry to respond to the new
competitive climate, while at the same time
maintaining adequate safeguards for the
investing public:
• the Financial Services Act 1986;
• the Building Societies Act 1986 (see
p 356); and
• the Banking Act 1987 (see p 353).
They have also assisted the implementation
in Britain of certain European Community
(EC) directives on banking and building
societies, investment services and securities
transactions.
Under the Financial Services Act a new
supervisory framework has been built up.
Investment businesses (those effecting
transactions in, managing or giving advice on
investments) require authorisation and have
to obey rules of conduct based on principles
set out in the legislation. Supervision is in
the hands of the Securities and Investments
Board (SIB), which is empowered to
recognise self-regulating organisations
(SROs), provided that they offer investors
protection equivalent to that provided by the
SIB. The SROs are practitioner-based
bodies. Most investment businesses have
opted to achieve authorisation by obtaining
membership of an SRO. The SROs are:
351
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• the Financial Intermediaries, Managers
and Brokers Regulatory Association
(FIMBRA), which covers firms such as
financial advisers and insurance brokers;
• the Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (IMRO), for concerns such
as merchant banks and pension fund
managers with mainly corporate clients;
• the Life Assurance and Unit Trust
Regulatory Organisation (LAUTRO);
and
• the Securities and Futures Authority
(SFA), whose members include the
member firms of The London Stock
Exchange, as well as futures brokers and
dealers.
In each Act there is provision for
improved co-operation and information¬
sharing between supervisors in different
financial sectors. The Bank of England, the
Building Societies Commission (see p 356),
the Department of Trade and Industry,
the SIB and the SROs have statutory
responsibility for financial supervision in the
sectors to which these Acts apply. There are
strengthened government powers to
investigate insider dealing (dealing carried
out on the basis of privileged access to
relevant information), and a separate
department, the Serious Fraud Office, to
deal with cases of serious or complex fraud.
The Government is helping to extend
international co-operation in investigating
suspected breaches of rules or requirements
in the field of investment business—
agreements about exchange of information
are in place with the United States and
Japan.
Changes within financial services have
been eroding traditional distinctions between
financial institutions, with single firms
providing a broader range of services, both
in domestic and international markets.
THE BANK OF ENGLAND
The Bank of England was established in
1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter
as a corporate body; the entire capital stock
was acquired by the Government in 1946.
The Bank’s main functions are:
• to execute monetary policy;
• to act as banker to the Government;
• to act as a note-issuing authority; and
• to exercise prudential supervision over,
and to provide banking facilities for, the
banking system.
As agent for the Government, the Bank is
responsible for arranging government
borrowing or repayment of debt and for
managing the National Debt. It also manages
the Exchange Equalisation Account (see
p 353) and maintains the register of holdings
of government securities on behalf of the
Treasury. More generally, the Bank has a
responsibility for overseeing the soundness of
the financial system as a whole and for
promoting the efficiency and competitiveness
of financial markets. For this reason the
Bank took part on 5 July 1991 in a
worldwide operation by financial authorities
to seize the assets of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI), after an
auditor’s report revealed evidence of large-
scale fraud in the supervision of that bank.
Subsequently the Bank and the Treasury
jointly sponsored an inquiry into the
supervision of BCCI.
The Bank of England has the sole right in
England and Wales to issue banknotes. The
note issue is no longer backed by gold but by
government and other securities. The
Scottish and Northern Ireland banks have
limited rights to issue notes. These issues,
apart from a small amount specified by
legislation for each bank, must be fully
covered by holdings of Bank of England
notes. Responsibility for the provision of
coin lies with the Royal Mint, a government
trading fund which became an executive
agency in April 1990.
The Bank is able to influence money-
market conditions through its dealings with
the discount houses (see p 357), which
developed in the nineteenth century as bill
brokers for industrialists. The discount
houses hold mainly Treasury, local authority
and commercial bills, and negotiable
certificates of deposit financed by short-term
loans from the banks. If on a particular day
there is a shortage of cash in the banking
system as a result, for example, of large tax
352
BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
payments, the Bank relieves the shortage
either by buying bills from the discount
houses or by lending directly to them. This
permits the banks to replenish their cash
balances at the Bank by recalling some of
their short-term loans to the discount houses.
The terms on which the Bank’s dealings with
the discount houses take place allow the
authorities to set and maintain interest rates
at the level they consider appropriate.
On behalf of the Treasury, the Bank
manages the Exchange Equalisation Account
(EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves
of gold, foreign exchange, Special Drawing
Rights (SDRs, which are claims on the
International Monetary Fund) and European
Currency Units (ECUs). Using the resources
of the EEA, the Bank may intervene in
the foreign exchange markets to check
undue fluctuations in the exchange value of
sterling.
Under the Financial Services Act, the
Bank is responsible for the supervision of the
main wholesale markets in London for
money, foreign exchange and gold bullion.
(The markets are wholesale in the sense that
the participants are professional operators
dealing in substantial amounts of money.)
Under the Banking Act 1987, deposit¬
taking organisations require authorisation
from the Bank of England (unless they are
specifically exempted) and are subject to the
Bank’s supervision. The Act created a Board
of Banking Supervision and increased the
Bank’s powers to modify the conduct of
banking institutions, to investigate cases of
illegal deposit-taking, to block bank mergers
and takeovers on prudential grounds and to
require information from banks. The Act
also enables information to be shared, in
strictly controlled ways, among supervisors
in different financial services, and permits
auditors to make reports to the Bank of
England about a bank if the circumstances
justify it.
The Bank has an interest in the financial
sector which extends beyond its main
functions. It is closely involved in the proper
functioning of payment and settlement
systems and ensuring that providers of
financial services are efficient and
competitive.
BANKS AND BUILDING SOCIETIES
In addition to banks, which are authorised
under the Banking Act 1987 and are
supervised by the Bank of England, the chief
institutions which offer banking services are
the building societies and the National
Savings Bank.
Banks and building societies are broadly
covered by the definition of ‘credit
institutions’ used in EC banking legislation.
The First Banking Directive, adopted in
1977, established the principle of non¬
discrimination for credit institutions in one
member state wishing to operate elsewhere in
the Community. The Second Banking
Directive, which will come into operation at
the beginning of 1993, will complete the
single European market in banking by
establishing mutual recognition of home
country authorisation for credit institutions.
A useful distinction is that between ‘retail’
banking and ‘wholesale’ banking. Retail
banking is primarily for personal customers
and small businesses. Its main services are
cash deposit and withdrawal facilities, and
systems for transferring funds, notably by
cheque. Competition between the banks and
the building societies in the provision of
money transmission services to individuals
has increased during the last two decades
and is expected to increase further (see
p 356). Building societies can now also offer
money transmission services to companies.
Wholesale business involves the taking of
large deposits at higher rates of interest, the
deployment of funds in money-market
instruments (see p 361) and the making of
large loans and investments. Nearly all the
banks in Britain engage in some wholesale
activities and some, such as the merchant
and overseas banks, centre their business on
them. Many such wholesale dealings are
conducted on the inter-bank market, that is,
between banks themselves.
In June 1991 there were 525 institutions
authorised under the Banking Act 1987,
including retail banks, merchant banks,
branches of overseas banks, discount houses
and banking subsidiaries of both banking and
non-banking institutions from Britain and
overseas. Of these, 325 were members of the
353
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
British Bankers’ Association, which is the
main representative body for British
banks.
Retail Banks
The major retail banks are those with a
significant branch network, offering a full
range of financial services to both individuals
and companies. They provide current
accounts including, generally, interest-
bearing current accounts; deposit accounts;
and various kinds of loan arrangements,
together with a full range of money
transmission facilities increasingly featuring
plastic card technology.
The major banks in England and Wales
are Barclays, Lloyds, Midland, National
Westminster, the TSB Group and Abbey
National; and in Scotland the Bank of
Scotland and The Royal Bank of Scotland.
Other important retail banks are the
Clydesdale Bank, the Co-operative Bank, the
Yorkshire Bank and Girobank, which was
previously a subsidiary of the Post Office but
which was offered for sale to the private
sector and in 1990 became a subsidiary of
the Alliance and Leicester Building Society.
Northern Ireland is served by branch
networks of five banks.
With the growth of financial services since
the 1970s, and a relaxation of restrictions on
competition among financial institutions, the
major banks have diversified their services.
They have lent more money for house
purchases, and have established or acquired
substantial interests in finance houses, leasing
and factoring companies, merchant banking,
securities dealers, insurance companies, unit
trust companies and estate agencies.
The banks provide loan facilities to
industrial companies and, since the 1970s,
have provided more medium- and long-term
loans than they did formerly. They have also
become important providers of finance for
small firms. They have supported a loan
guarantee scheme under which 70 per cent
of the value of loans to small companies is
guaranteed by the Government, and some
banks have set up special subsidiaries to
provide venture capital for companies (see
p 360).
Most retail banks also conduct
international operations, which account for a
substantial proportion of their business. In
addition to maintaining overseas subsidiaries,
they are active in eurocurrency markets (see
p 362).
Deposits and Assets
The total liabilities/assets of the retail banks
amounted to £436,000 million at the end of
June 1991. Of the liabilities, 69 per cent was
sterling deposits, 16 per cent other currency
deposits, and the remainder items in
suspense or transmission, and capital and
other funds. Of the £300,000 million of
sterling deposits, sight deposits withdrawable
on demand constituted about 48 per cent and
time deposits requiring notice of withdrawal
some 45 per cent. Certificates of deposit and
other short-term instruments accounted for
the remaining 7 per cent. The banks’ main
liquid assets consist of money at call (mainly
short-term loans to discount houses), their
holdings of Treasury and some other bills,
short-dated British government securities and
balances at the Bank of England. They also
hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio
investments (mainly longer-dated British
government securities) or trade investments.
Branches and Accounts
At the beginning of 1991 the retail banks in
Britain operated through some 13,900
branches and sub-branches. National
Westminster had the largest number (2,898),
followed by Barclays (2,606), Lloyds (2,100),
Midland (2,036) TSB (1,538), The Royal
Bank of Scotland (841) and Abbey National
(681). Some 85 per cent of adults in Britain
have a current account and over one-third a
deposit account.
Payment Systems and Services
The main payment systems are run by three
separate companies operating under an
umbrella organisation, the Association for
Payment Clearing Services (APACS). One
covers bulk paper clearings (cheques and
credit transfers). A second covers high-value
354
BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
clearings for same-day settlement, namely the
nationwide electronic transfer service
Clearing House Automated Payment System
(CHAPS) and the cheque-based Town
Clearing (which operates only in the City of
London). A third covers the bulk electronic
clearing which handles standing orders and
direct debits. Membership of each of these
clearing companies is open to any bank,
building society or other financial institution
that meets the criteria for appropriate
supervision and volume of transactions.
All the major retail banks and building
societies have substantial networks of
automated teller machines or cash
dispensers with, in all, almost 17,000
machines at the beginning of 1991.
Automated teller machines give customers
access to cash and other services for up to 24
hours a day. Many banks and building
societies offer home banking services
whereby customers can use telephone or
screen-based access devices to obtain account
information, make transfers and pay bills.
The banks and major building societies
also offer their customers cheque guarantee
cards which entitle holders to reciprocal
cheque-cashing facilities up to, in most cases,
£50 a day, although some cards now have
higher limits. The cards will also guarantee
transactions with retailers up to the same
amount. Uniform eurocheques supported by
a eurocheque card are available from all
major banks. These standard-format cheques
may be used to obtain cash or make
payments in Britain, elsewhere in Europe
and in a few other overseas countries. The
cheques are made out in the currency of the
country in which they are being used, with a
guarantee limit of approximately £100 per
cheque.
Credit cards issued by major retail banks
and building societies are also a popular
means of payment and are very widely
accepted throughout Britain. Most cards are
affiliated to one of the two major
international credit card organisations, Visa
and MasterCard. Some of the major retail
stores issue their own cards, which operate
like credit cards. A charge card, like a credit
card, enables the holder to make retail
payments, but there is either no credit limit
or a very high limit, and the balance must be
settled in full on receipt of a monthly
statement.
Debit cards, which allow payments to be
deducted directly from the purchaser’s bank
account, are becoming increasingly popular.
Most cards are affiliated either to Visa or to
the Switch organisation, which is based in
Britain.
As well as the traditional paper-based
systems for making retail payments by credit
or debit cards, many stores and garages now
provide electronic funds transfer at point of
sale (EFTPOS) facilities for transferring
funds electronically.
Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
owned by their savers and borrowers. They
raise short-term deposits from savers, who
are generally able to withdraw their money
on demand or at short notice. The societies
provide long-term loans, mostly at variable
rates of interest, against the security of
property—usually private dwellings
purchased for owner-occupation.
Building societies are the major lenders
for house purchase in Britain and are the
principal repository for the personal sector’s
liquid assets (although banks’ shares have
increased in both areas since 1985). Some 60
per cent of adults have building society
savings accounts. Competition among the
building societies and between building
societies and other financial institutions has
increased in the last decade. A variety of
savings schemes have been established, and a
growing number of societies provide current
account facilities such as cheque books and
automated teller machines. In 1991 there
were some 2,900 building society automated
teller machines, about 17 per cent of the
total. About ten building societies issue
credit cards.
At the end of April 1991 there were 116
registered societies, of which 98 were
members of The Building Societies’
Association. Building societies’ assets totalled
£217,000 million at the end of May 1991;
355
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
about £43,000 million was advanced in new
mortgages in the course of 1990. The three
largest societies (the Halifax, Nationwide
Anglia and Woolwich) account for nearly 50
per cent of the total assets of all societies and
the 20 largest for some 90 per cent.
The Building Societies Act 1986 allows
the societies to provide a wider range of
services. Up to 17-5 per cent of a society’s
commercial assets may be used for purposes
other than loans on first mortgage of owner-
occupied houses, including up to 7 5 per
cent in other types of asset such as
unsecured loans. These limits will increase to
25 per cent and 15 per cent respectively in
1993. Directly or through subsidiaries,
societies may now offer services within the
general areas of banking, investment,
insurance, trusteeship, executorship and
estate agency. Societies may also operate
throughout the European Community.
However, their main business will continue
to be the provision of financial and housing-
related services.
The 1986 Act established the Building
Societies Commission to carry out the
prudential supervision of building societies.
It also made provision for a society to seek
the approval of its members to convert into a
public limited company. In this event the
society becomes an authorised institution
under the Banking Act 1987 (see p 353) and
is then supervised by the Bank of England.
Abbey National pursued this course and no
longer contributes to building society
statistics.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders is a
trade body established in 1989 for all
mortgage lending institutions, including
building societies, insurance companies,
finance houses and banks.
National Savings Bank
The National Savings Bank is run by the
Department for National Savings, based in
Glasgow, and provides a system for
depositing and withdrawing savings at
21,000 post offices around the country, or
by post.
There are about 20 million accounts.
Ordinary Accounts earn interest at a rate
which depends on the balance maintained;
the first £70 of annual interest is tax free.
Investment Accounts earn a higher, variable
rate of interest, which is taxable. At the end
of May 1991 the sum of the two accounts
totalled just over £10,000 million. Other
National Savings instruments include:
• tax-free Savings Certificates, which
either pay a fixed rate of interest alone
or a (lower) fixed rate of interest
combined with index-linking;
• Premium Bonds, where interest is paid
in the form of prizes chosen by lottery;
• taxable Income and Capital Bonds;
and
• Children’s Bonus Bonds.
All National Savings interest is paid
without deduction of tax at source and some
instruments encourage savers to leave their
savings untouched for five years. The
National Savings Bank does not offer lending
facilities. At the end of May 1991 the total
amount of money invested in National
Savings was £37,000 million, and this forms
a part of government borrowing.
Merchant Banks
Merchant banks have traditionally been
concerned primarily with the accepting (or
guaranteeing) of commercial bills and with
the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf of
their customers. Today they have a widely
diversified and complex range of activities,
with important roles in equity and debt
markets; the provision of expert advice and
financial services to industrial companies,
especially where mergers, takeovers and
other forms of corporate reorganisation are
involved; and in the management of
investment holdings, including trusts,
pensions and other funds. The sector is split
between independent houses and those which
are part of larger banking groups.
Overseas Banks
A total of 256 banks incorporated overseas
were represented in Britain in June 1991. Of
these, 28 were from the United States and
356
BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
24 from Japan. They provide a
comprehensive banking service in many parts
of the world and engage in the financing of
trade not only between Britain and other
countries but also between third-party
countries.
British Overseas Banks
A small number of banks have their head
offices in Britain, but operate mainly abroad,
specialising in particular regions such as
Africa and South East Asia. One example of
a bank in this sector is Standard Chartered.
The Discount Houses
The discount houses, of which there are
eight, are specialised institutions unique in
their function and central position in the
British monetary system. They act as
financial intermediaries between the Bank of
England and the rest of the banking sector,
promoting an orderly flow of short-term
funds between the authorities and the banks,
and lending to the Government by
guaranteeing to tender for the whole of the
weekly offer of Treasury bills (which are
instruments to raise funds over a period of
up to six months). In return for acting as
intermediaries, the discount houses have
privileged daily access to the Bank of
England, which acts as ‘lender of last resort’.
Assets of the discount houses consist mainly
of Treasury and commercial bills, negotiable
certificates of deposit and short-term loans.
Their liabilities consist mainly of short-term
deposits.
INSURANCE
The British insurance industry provides a
comprehensive and competitive service
domestically and internationally. It falls
broadly into two parts: long-term life
insurance, where contracts may be for
periods of many years; and general
insurance, including accident and short-term
life insurance, where contracts are for a year
or less. The London market is the world’s
leading centre for insurance and for the
placement of international reinsurance. It has
been estimated that it handles some 20 per
cent of general insurance business placed on
the international market.
In addition to the British companies and
Lloyd’s, a large number of overseas
companies are represented, with which many
British companies have formed close
relationships. Some British companies
confine their activities to domestic business
but most large companies undertaking
general business transact a substantial
amount overseas through branches and
agencies or affiliated local companies.
Insurance companies carrying on business
in Britain are supervised by the Department
of Trade and Industry under the Insurance
Companies Act 1982. Marketing of life
insurance is regulated by the Securities and
Investments Board (see p 351). EC directives
cover reinsurance, compulsory motor
insurance, freedom of establishment for life
and non-life insurers, Community co-
insurance and insurance intermediaries. A
directive regulating cross-frontier trade in
non-life insurance services came into force in
June 1990, and agreement has been reached
on a directive on cross-frontier trade in life
insurance services.
Some 840 companies are authorised to
carry on one or more classes of insurance
business in Britain, of which 7 per cent are
European Community companies with their
head office outside Britain, and a further 10
per cent are companies established outside
the Community. The total invested assets of
these companies amounted to £311,000
million at the beginning of 1991. Some 450
companies belong to the Association of
British Insurers (ABI). Some companies are
mutual institutions, owned by their policy
holders. Insurance is also available from
some friendly societies—mutual institutions
administered by trustees.
Long-term Insurance
Long-term insurance is handled by some 270
companies. As well as providing life cover,
long-term insurance is a vehicle for saving
and investment by individuals, premiums
being invested in securities and other assets.
The net long-term insurance premium
357
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
income of ABI member companies in 1990
was some £32,000 million.
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by Lloyd’s. It
covers fire, accident, general liability, short¬
term life, motor, marine, aviation and
transport. Total ABI member company
premiums in Britain in 1990 were some
£15,400 million, of which £4,900 million was
for motor insurance and £1,100 million for
marine, aviation and transport insurance.
The bulk of business by ABI companies in
the latter categories was written through the
Institute of London Underwriters (see
below).
Lloyd’s
Lloyd’s, the origins of which go back to the
seventeenth century, is an incorporated
society of private insurers in London.
Although its activities were originally
confined to the conduct of marine insurance,
a very considerable worldwide market for the
transaction of other classes of insurance
business (such as aviation and motor) has
been built up.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for
insurance administered by the Council of
Lloyd’s. Business is carried out for
individual elected underwriting members,
or ‘names’, who must show sufficient
available wealth and lodge a deposit.
Insurance is transacted for them with
unlimited liability, in competition with each
other and with insurance companies. In June
1991 there were 26,500 members, grouped
into 354 syndicates. Each syndicate is
managed by an underwriting agent
responsible for appointing a professional
underwriter to accept insurance risks and
settle claims on the syndicate members’
behalf. Insurance may only be placed
through accredited Lloyd’s brokers, who
negotiate with Lloyd’s syndicates on behalf
of the insured.
The net premium income of Lloyd’s in
1989, the most recent year for which figures
are available, was some £4,200 million, of
which around £500 million was for motor
insurance and around £1,500 million for
marine, aviation and transport insurance.
Institute of London Underwriters
The Institute of London Underwriters was
formed in 1884, originally as a trade
association for marine underwriters. It now
provides a market where insurance
companies transact marine, commercial
transport and aviation business. The Institute
issues combined policies in its own name
which are underwritten by the companies
which form its membership. The premium
income processed by the Institute in 1990
was some £1,400 million. About half of its
114 member companies are branches or
subsidiaries of overseas companies.
Insurance Brokers
Insurance brokers, acting on behalf of the
insured, are a valuable part of the company
market and an essential part of the Lloyd’s
market. Many brokers specialise in
reinsurance business, acting as intermediaries
in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and
often acting as London representatives of
the latter. The Insurance Brokers
(Registration) Act 1977 provides for the
voluntary registration and regulation of
insurance brokers by the Insurance Brokers
Registration Council. Only those registered
with the Council can use the title
‘insurance broker’. In July 1991 some
16,000 individuals were registered with the
Council, through 1,427 partnerships or sole
traderships and 3,112 limited companies.
INVESTMENT FUNDS
Pension Funds
Virtually all occupational pension schemes
are based on trust funds managed so as to
protect the interests of the members. Pension
contributions are invested either directly in
the securities and other investment markets
or through intermediaries such as insurance
companies. The funds are a dominant force

in securities markets. The Government
has introduced legislation to allow people
more choice in opting out of occupational
pension schemes and setting up personal
pension arrangements. Over 11 million
people belong to occupational pension
schemes and over 4-5 million people belong
to personal pension schemes. The market
value of assets held directly by pension funds
rose from £2,000 million in 1957 to some
£300,000 million at the beginning of 1990.
Investment and Unit Trusts
An investment trust is a collective
investment fund which is structured as a
company and quoted on The London Stock
Exchange. It invests in securities, which are
purchased mainly out of the capital
subscribed by shareholders. The investments
are carried out for the benefit of these
shareholders. The shares of an investment
trust are available only to the extent that
existing shareholders are prepared to sell
some or all of their holdings. The total assets
of the 206 members of the Association of
Investment Trusts were £22,500 million in
July 1991.
A unit trust is a fund made up of the
cash contributions of many individual
investors, who pool their resources in order
to be able to invest a sufficient amount to
obtain professional management and the
spread of risk that they could not afford
individually.
Unit trusts operate a dual pricing system.
This means that two prices are always quoted:
the bid price, at which the manager will buy
units back from the unitholder; and the offer
price, at which the manager will sell units.
Unit trusts may invest in British shares in
general or in certain sectors or in the
securities of other countries. Unit trusts are
subject to the provisions of the Financial
Services Act 1986. The power to make
regulations governing authorised unit trusts
lies with the Securities and Investments
Board. Only an authorised unit trust may be
promoted to the general public.
There were 1,400 authorised unit trusts
in June 1991, with total holdings of some
£56,500 million.
COMPANY FINANCING
INSTITUTIONS
There are many specialised financial
institutions meeting the needs of specific
groups of borrowers which are not
adequately covered by other institutions.
They are to be found in both the public and
the private sectors. Some of the latter were
set up with official support, but with
financing from banks and other financial
institutions. They may offer loan finance or
equity capital.
The main private sector institutions are
described below. Among public sector
agencies are Scottish Enterprise, the Welsh
Development Agency, the Industrial
Development Board for Northern Ireland,
the Co-operative Development Agency and
ECGD (Export Credits Guarantee
Department), Britain’s official export credit
insurer. The Insurance Services Group of
ECGD, which handles the export of capital
goods sold on short-term credit, is to be
privatised.
Finance Houses
Finance houses are major providers of
instalment credit facilities for the personal
sector and of both loan and leasing finance
(see below) to the corporate sector. Forty-
two firms constitute the Finance Houses
Association (FHA); at the beginning of 1991
loan and leasing credit outstanding to the
members of the FHA was some £36,500
million. Many of the finance houses are
owned by banks, and most are institutions
authorised under the Banking Act 1987.
Leasing Companies
Leasing companies buy and own plant or
equipment required and chosen by
businesses and lease it at an agreed rental.
This form of finance grew quickly in
importance in the 1970s, partly because the
leasing companies were able to take
advantage of investment incentives to the
benefit of customers whose tax position
would otherwise have made this impossible.
In 1990 the 72 members of the Equipment
359
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Leasing Association acquired assets in Britain
valued at some £14,300 million, which
represented 36 per cent of all investment in
plant and machinery.
Factoring Companies
Factoring comprises a range of financial
services which provide growing companies
with a flexible source of finance in exchange
for the outstanding invoices due to them.
Since the early 1960s factoring has developed
as a major financial service, covering
international activities as well as domestic
trade. In 1990 member companies of the
Association of British Factors and
Discounters handled business of £13,800
million (representing about 90 per cent of all
factoring business in Britain) and some 8,800
companies made use of the Association’s
services. Just over two-thirds of the companies
had a turnover of less than £1 million.
Venture Capital Companies
Venture capital companies meet the need for
medium- and long-term capital when such
funds are not easily or directly available from
traditional sources such as the stock market
or the banks.
There are over 120 British venture capital
companies, which take equity stakes in small
and medium-sized firms. Many of these
companies are subsidiaries of other financial
institutions, including banks, insurance
companies and pension funds. The 120 full
members of the British Venture Capital
Association invested almost £1,394 million in
Britain, elsewhere in Europe, and in the
United States in 1990.
Formerly Investors in Industry, 3i
supports investment programmes over a
whole range of industries. During the year
ended 31 March 1991 the corporation
invested £382 million. Within the last few
years it has become increasingly prominent
in financing management ‘buy-outs’, which
involve the purchase of businesses from their
owners by the management and other staff.
The shares in 3i are currently owned by the
Bank of England (15 per cent) and six of the
major retail banks.
FINANCIAL MARKETS
The City of London has a wide range of
financial markets. They include The London
Stock Exchange, the foreign exchange market,
the financial futures and options market, the
eurobond and eurocurrency markets, the
Lloyd’s insurance market (see p 358), and the
bullion and commodity markets.
The London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange has its main
administrative centre in London, as well as
centres in Belfast, Birmingham, Dublin,
Glasgow and Manchester.
As a result of a set of reforms known
popularly as ‘Big Bang’, the Exchange has
changed radically in recent years. The main
reforms were as follows:
• the Exchange’s rules on membership
were altered to allow corporate
ownership of member firms;
• the system under which dealers charged
fixed minimum scales of commission to
investors was abolished in favour of
negotiated commissions;
• dealers were permitted to trade in
securities both on their own behalf, as
principals, and on behalf of clients, as
agents, these two roles formerly
having been kept distinct;
and
• a screen-based dealing system came
into operation, which has been so
successful that the trading floor has been
closed (except for dealing in traded
options).
The London Stock Exchange is one of the
largest in the world in terms of the number
and variety of securities listed. Its turnover
of equities in 1990 accounted for some 10
per cent of equity trading worldwide. Some
7,200 securities are quoted; at the end of
June 1991 these had a market value of
£2,200,000 million. Nearly 5,000 company
securities are quoted, including those of a
growing number of leading overseas
companies, with a value of some £1,900,000
million. The remainder is made up of
360
BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
British and overseas government and
corporation stocks as well as eurobonds
(see p 362).
In recent years the largest market for new
issues has been that for companies’
securities, including issues of shares resulting
from the Government’s privatisation
programme. Trading in British government
securities (‘gilt-edged stocks’) in the first six
months of 1991 accounted for about 47 per
cent of transactions by value (excluding
traded options). New issues are made on the
Government’s behalf by the Bank of England
when required.
The Exchange’s London Traded Options
Market enables investors not only to buy
options to purchase or sell shares in the
future at pre-fixed prices, but also to trade in
the options themselves. There is trading in
around 70 equity options of prominent
British and overseas companies and in stock
index options. The Market is due to merge
with the London International Financial
Futures Exchange (see p 362) by the end of
1991.
Listing Changes
The London Stock Exchange altered its rules
in 1990 to conform to EC directives on
listing particulars, prospectuses and mutual
recognition. The major effect of the EC
directive on Mutual Recognition of Listing
Particulars is that, subject to certain
limitations, each member state is required to
recognise listing particulars accepted in
another member state. In order to put
British companies on an equal footing with
those in other EC countries, the Exchange
reduced the minimum trading record
requirement for full listing from five years to
three. At the same time the corresponding
requirement for the Unlisted Securities
Market, on which the securities of smaller
companies are quoted, was reduced from
three years to two. The Third Market,
which previously provided a structure for
dealing in the securities of companies which
did not qualify for the Unlisted Securities
Market, was phased out at the end of 1990.
A majority of Third Market companies
joined the Unlisted Securities Market.
The Money Markets
The London money markets channel
wholesale funds (mainly short-term) from
lenders to borrowers. They consist of a series
of integrated groups of financial institutions
conducting negotiations primarily by
telephone, telex and automated dealing
systems, there being no physical market¬
place. Under the Financial Services Act 1986
(see p 351), the Bank of England is
responsible for regulating some market
participants and has developed a code of
conduct which is observed by all market
participants. The discount houses (see p 357)
play an important role. The main financial
instruments dealt in are bills (issued by the
Treasury, local authorities or companies),
certificates of deposit (CDs, large-
denomination transferable deposits) and
short-term deposits. The bill markets and
the markets in which the discount houses
borrow from the rest of the banking system
are often referred to as the ‘traditional’
markets. Newer markets, known as ‘parallel’
markets, emerged in the 1960s, and include
the inter-bank market and the market in
CDs. Since a large proportion of the latter is
held by banks, the CD market is effectively
an extension of the inter-bank market.
Capital markets have been undergoing
continuous transformation since the 1960s
(see p 351). In the 1980s a trend towards the
‘securitisation of debt’ developed—major
borrowers increasingly raised funds by
issuing securities instead of seeking bank
loans. In 1986 large companies were
permitted to develop a sterling commercial
paper market: this consisted initially of issues
of short-term debt denominated in sterling
with a maturity of up to one year. Since
1989 the sterling commercial paper and the
short-term corporate bond markets have been
consolidated. The range of issuers has been
broadened since 1986 to include, for
example, banks and building societies, certain
unquoted companies and overseas public
sector bodies. The market now provides a
way for such bodies to issue short-term debt
of up to five years’ maturity and to borrow
directly from the money market by issuing
short-term debt of up to five years’ maturity.
361
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Euromarkets
The eurocurrency market enables banks to
deal in deposits and loans denominated in a
currency other than that of the country in
which the bank is situated. Transactions can
thus be carried out in eurodollars,
eurodeutschmarks, euroyen and so on.
London and Tokyo are the main world
centres for this business.
The eurobond market performs a similar
service in transferring funds from lenders to
borrowers but over a longer period by means
of bonds issued in currencies other than that
of the issuing country. Transactions in both
markets tend to be in large denominations.
The euromarkets developed in the late
1950s following the restoration of
convertibility between the major
currencies, partly in order to avoid
incurring the costs of exchange control
and other regulations.
The participants in the markets include
multinational corporations, non-bank
financial institutions, and governments, as
well as the international banking community.
In the 1980s there was considerable
growth in the euro-commercial paper market.
As with the establishment of the sterling
commercial paper market (see above), this
represents a further movement towards the
securitisation of debt.
The Foreign Exchange Market
The foreign exchange market has no physical
centre, but consists of telephone links
between the participants, which include
banks, other financial institutions and several
firms of foreign exchange brokers which act
as intermediaries between the banks. It
provides those engaged in international trade
and investment with foreign currencies for
their transactions. The banks are in close
contact with financial centres abroad and are
able to quote buying and selling rates for
both immediate and forward delivery in a
wide range of currencies and maturities. The
forward market enables traders and dealers
who, at a given date in the future, wish to
receive or make a specific foreign currency
payment, to contract in advance to sell or
buy the foreign currency involved for
sterling at a fixed exchange rate. The most
recent Bank of England survey (in April
1989) showed that average daily turnover on
London’s foreign exchange market was about
£110,000 million, making it the largest such
market in the world.
Financial Futures
The London International Financial Futures
Exchange (LIFFE) trades on the floor of the
Royal Exchange building, although it is due
to move to new premises at the Cannon
Bridge development in January 1992. Over
200 banks, other financial institutions,
brokers and individual traders are members
of the market. Futures markets allow parties
that could be affected by movements in
prices, interest rates or exchange rates to
reduce their vulnerability or to speculate on
the possibility of making a gain. Financial
futures contracts are legally binding
documents for the purchase or sale of a fixed
amount of a financial commodity, at a price
agreed in the present, on a specified future
date. They facilitate the transfer of risk from
those who do not wish to bear it to those
who are prepared to bear it. LIFFE has the
widest range of financial futures and options
products of any exchange in the world.
Turnover in the first half of 1991 was some
£35,000 million, representing average daily
trading of about 180,000 futures and futures
options contracts. LIFFE is due to merge
with the London Traded Options Market
(see p 361) by the end of 1991.
The London Bullion Market
Over 60 banks, securities and trading
companies comprise the London gold and
silver markets which, like the foreign
exchange market, trade by telephone and
telex links. Five of the members meet twice
daily to establish a London fixing price for
gold which provides a reference point for
worldwide dealings. The silver fixing is held
once a day and has three participants.
Although much interest centres upon the
362
BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
fixings, active dealing takes place throughout
the day. London and Zurich are the main
world centres for gold dealings.
Commodity, Shipping and Freight
Markets
Britain remains the principal international
centre for transactions in a large number of
commodities, although most of the sales
negotiated in London relate to consignments
which never pass through the ports of
Britain. The need for close links with
sources of finance and with shipping and
insurance services often determined the
location of these markets in the City of
London. There are also futures markets in
cocoa, coffee, grains (wheat, barley and rice),
soya bean meal, sugar, pigmeat, non-ferrous
metals (aluminium, copper, lead, nickel,
silver and zinc), potatoes, gas oil (heating oil)
and crude petroleum oil. The markets are
collaborating in the development of new
arrangements to safeguard participants.
In ship brokerage, London’s Baltic
Exchange is responsible for a substantial
proportion of the world’s tramp fixtures. A
freight futures market is in operation at
London Fox, the Futures and Options
Exchange, where all Britain’s agricultural
futures markets are operated; commodity
futures trading is also carried out there.

21 Overseas Trade
Overseas trade has been of vital importance
to the British economy for hundreds of
years, and especially since the mid¬
nineteenth century, when the rapid growth
of industry, commerce and shipping was
accompanied by Britain’s development as an
international trading centre. Today, although
small in area and accounting for only about
1 per cent of the world’s population, Britain
is the fifth largest trading nation in the
world, and, as a member of the European
Community, part of the world’s largest
trading bloc, accounting for about a third of
all trade.
Exports of goods and services in 1990
were equivalent to over a quarter of gross
domestic product (GDP). Britain is a major
supplier of machinery, vehicles, aerospace
products, electrical and electronic equipment
and chemicals, and a significant oil exporter.
It relies upon imports for about a third of
total consumption of foodstuffs, and for
many of the basic materials needed for its
industries.
Trade in invisibles is of great
significance to the economy: in 1990
overseas earnings from services were
equivalent to nearly a third of those
from total visible exports.
VISIBLE TRADE
In 1990 Britain’s exports of goods were
valued at about £102,700 million and its
imports of goods at some £120,700 million
on a balance-of-payments basis (see Table
21.1). Between 1989 and 1990 exports rose
by 6-8 per cent in terms of volume and by
5-5 per cent in terms of unit value, leading
to an increase in the total value of exports of
almost 11 per cent. Import volume rose by
1-3 per cent, unit value rose by 3 8 per cent
and total value rose by just over 3 per cent.

BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commodity Composition
Although Britain has traditionally been an
exporter of manufactured goods and an
importer of food and basic materials, it has
not had a surplus on manufactures since
1983. In 1970 manufactures accounted for 85
per cent of exports. The proportion fell
sharply in the early 1980s—to around 67 per
cent by the middle of the decade as fuels
increased their share; it has since risen, to 81
per cent in 1990. The share of finished
manufactures in total imports rose from 25
per cent in 1970 to 52 per cent in 1990.
Machinery and transport equipment account
for over a third of exports and a similar
proportion of imports. Export sectors that
have declined in relative importance include
textiles and vehicles. Textiles accounted for
5 per cent of total exports in 1970 but only
2 per cent in 1990; the corresponding figures
for vehicles were 11 per cent and 7 per cent.
Over the same period, the share of food,
beverages and tobacco in total imports fell
from 22 per cent to 10 per cent and that
of basic materials from 15 per cent to
5 per cent.
Since the mid-1970s North Sea oil has
made a significant contribution to Britain’s
overseas trade both in terms of exports and
in terms of import substitution. In 1990
exports of fuels in volume terms were over
four times their 1975 level; imports were less
than three-quarters of their 1975 level. Over
this period the share of fuels in exports
changed from 4 per cent to 7-5 per cent and

OVERSEAS TRADE
in imports from 18 per cent to 6 per cent.
North Sea oil production has now passed its
peak of the mid-1980s, when exports of fuels
had accounted for over 20 per cent of total
exports. In 1990 the surplus on trade in oil
amounted to about £1,500 million.
Since the early 1960s Britain’s imports of
semi-manufactures have exceeded those of
basic materials; they are now more than five
times as high. This reflects the increasing
tendency for producing countries to carry
out the processing of primary products up to
the semi-finished and, on occasions, the
finished stage. The fall in the share of food
in total imports (from around 35 per cent of
total imports in the 1950s to 8 per cent in
1990) is a result both of the increasing extent
to which food demand has been met from
domestic agriculture and the decline in the
proportion of total expenditure on food.
Geographical Distribution
Britain’s overseas trade is mainly—and
increasingly—with other developed countries.
In 1970 these accounted for 73 per cent of
exports and a similar proportion of imports;
by 1990 the shares were 81 per cent and 85
per cent respectively. In 1970 non-oil
developing countries accounted for 17 per
cent of Britain’s exports and 15 per cent of
Britain’s imports; by 1990 they accounted for
13 per cent of Britain’s exports and 12 per
cent of Britain’s imports. In 1972 (the year
before Britain joined the European
Community) around a third of Britain’s trade
was with the other 11 countries which now
make up the Community. The proportion is
now about a half, and is expected to increase
with the completion of the single European
market in 1992 (see p 368). Trade with other
Commonwealth countries has declined in
importance.
European Community countries accounted
for seven of the top ten export markets and
for six of the ten leading suppliers of goods
to Britain in 1990 (see Table 21.3). From
1981 to 1989 the United States was Britain’s
largest single market but it was overtaken in
1990 by Germany. Germany is also Britain’s
largest single supplier. In 1990 Germany
accounted for almost 13 per cent of Britain’s
exports and supplied almost 16 per cent of
Britain’s imports.

There have been a number of changes in
the trends of Britain’s overseas trade in
recent years. The increase in wealth of the
oil-exporting countries during the 1970s led
to a sharp increase in their imports from all
sources and by the early 1980s they were
taking some 12 per cent of Britain’s exports.
There was then a fall in the capacity of these
countries to absorb imports (partly because
of a reduction in the price of oil) so that, by
1990, their share of Britain’s exports had
fallen to 5 per cent. In 1973 the oil-exporting
countries supplied 10 per cent of Britain’s
imports but, with Britain achieving self-
sufficiency in oil, the proportion had fallen
to 2 per cent in 1990. Japan has steadily
increased its share of Britain’s imports and
now accounts for over 5 per cent.
INVISIBLE TRANSACTIONS
Transactions on invisible trade fall into three
main groups:
• services (receipts and payments arising
from services, as distinct from goods,
supplied to and received from overseas
residents);
• interest, profits and dividends (income
arising from outward and inward
investment, loans and other capital
transactions); and
• transfers between Britain and other
countries.
Invisible trade is of fundamental
importance to Britain’s economy; overseas
earnings from invisibles amounted to
£117,000 million in 1990—over half of
Britain’s total overseas earnings. Britain’s
share of world invisible trade is 14-5 per cent
and earnings are second only to those of the
United States. In 1990 Britain’s invisibles
surplus was the largest in the world,
according to figures from the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD). Services have been in surplus for

over 200 years (excluding war periods), while
interest, profits and dividends have rarely
been in deficit; transfers, however, have
almost always been in deficit. For invisible
trade as a whole, the deficit of general
government is more than offset by the
substantial surplus of the private sector
(including public corporations), to give an
overall surplus. General government
transactions are relatively unimportant in
either the services or the interest, profits and
dividends accounts but they form the greater
part of the transfers account. In 1990 the
private sector had a surplus of almost
£12,000 million on invisible trade while
government had a deficit of about £7,500
million. British Invisibles, which is financed
almost entirely by contributions from the
private sector, especially City institutions,
promotes measures to encourage invisible
trade.
Earnings from private sector services rose
in value by 6 per cent in 1990 to £31,600
million; debits, at £24,100 million, were 5
per cent higher than a year previously.
The surplus on private sector interest,
profits and dividends was £4,600 million in
1990—about the same as in 1989. Earnings
on portfolio investment (investment in
overseas securities) and on direct investment
overseas remained high—at £8,100 million
and £17,800 million respectively— reflecting
in part the substantial volume of overseas
investment following the abolition of
exchange controls in 1979 and changes in the
method of foreign currency lending by banks
located in Britain.
The deficit on private sector transfers in
1990 was £300 million, while that on
government transfers was £4,600 million,
mainly as a result of contributions and
subscriptions to the European Community
and other international organisations, and
bilateral aid.
COMMERCIAL POLICY
Britain remains committed to the open
multilateral trading system and to the further
liberalisation of world trade. To this end it
has taken a leading part in the activities of
such organisations as the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) and has given full
support to the current round of multilateral
trade negotiations. Since 1973, when Britain
369
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain joined it, the European Community
has acted for Britain in international trade
negotiations. The Community’s common
customs tariff is, at a trade-weighted average
of 2-5 per cent, at a low level, similar to the
tariffs of most major industrialised countries.
Single European Market
Britain strongly supports the drive to
complete the single European market by the
end of 1992. The single market programme
is designed to eliminate the remaining trade
barriers within the Community and is
expected to provide substantial opportunities
for business and benefits for consumers.
The single European market
programme was launched in 1985 and,
by August 1991, 197 out of a proposed
282 measures had been adopted or
agreed in principle.
By May 1991 Britain was the third most
successful member state in turning single
market measures into national legislation.
General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade
Tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade have
been considerably reduced in the seven
rounds of multilateral trade negotiations
completed since 1947 under the auspices of
GATT, the most recent one completed being
the Tokyo Round (1973-79). Britain
participates in these negotiations as a
member of the European Community.
The eighth round of GATT multilateral
trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round) was
launched in September 1986. It is the most
ambitious and wide-ranging round of trade
negotiations ever. It was due to be completed
in December 1990 but this was not possible.
However, negotiations were resumed in
February 1991. The Uruguay Round’s main
concerns are:
• to bring trade in agriculture and textiles
fully within the GATT system;
• to achieve further reductions in tariff
and non-tariff barriers;
• to extend GATT disciplines to the new
areas of intellectual property, investment
and services; and
• to strengthen the GATT system, so that
it can deal more effectively with trade
distortions and disputes.
The British Government remains
committed to a successful conclusion to the
Round and is working to bring this about as
soon as possible.
European Community Agreements
Britain applies the common customs tariff to
all countries neither belonging to, nor having
any special arrangement with, the European
Community. There is duty-free trade
between those member states that joined
before 1986. Portugal and Spain joined at the
beginning of that year. Their trade with the
rest of the Community is in a transitional
stage: tariffs on industrial products are due
to be phased out by the start of 1993, but
those on certain agricultural products will be
dismantled over a longer period.
The Community has reciprocal
agreements with the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA) countries (Austria,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and
Switzerland) and Liechtenstein, which allow
for industrial products to be traded free of
duty. Following the Luxembourg Declaration
of 1984, the Community and EFT A are
working towards closer economic co¬
operation. In 1989 Community and EFT A
ministers agreed on further action to this end
and to remove remaining non-tariff barriers
to trade. Negotiations are continuing, with
the aim of extending the single market to the
EFT A countries.
The Community also has reciprocal
preferential trading agreements with Cyprus,
Israel, Malta and Turkey and non-reciprocal
agreements with Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia,
Egypt, Jordan, the Occupied Territories,
Lebanon, Syria and Yugoslavia and, under
the Lome Convention, with a group of 69
African, Caribbean and Pacific developing
countries. The Lome Convention gives these
countries tariff-free access (subject to certain
safeguards) to the Community for industrial
370
OVERSEAS TRADE
goods and most agricultural products.
Tariff preference is also given to
developing countries (under the Generalised
System of Preferences), the Faroe Islands,
and the overseas dependencies and territories
of member states.
The Community also has economic co¬
operation agreements with a number of Latin
American countries, with the People’s
Republic of China and with the six members
of the Association of South East Asian
Nations.
An economic co-operation agreement is in
force with the six members of the Gulf
Co-operation Council. Negotiations are in
progress which may lead to the establishment
of a free trade area embracing the
Community and the Council.
Following the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the Central and
Eastern European countries and the
Community, the Community negotiated
trade, commercial and economic co-operation
agreements with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet
Union. These agreements cover trade
concessions and co-operation in areas such
as energy, agriculture, transport and the
environment. ‘Association agreements’
are currently being negotiated with
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. Their
aim is to develop closer association, leading
to reciprocal free trade. The next stage,
as economic and political reform is
consolidated, will be the development of
closer association agreements with individual
Eastern and Central European countries.
CONTROLS ON TRADE
Britain maintains few restrictions on its
international trade. Most goods may be
imported freely and only a narrow range of
goods is subject to any sort of export control.
Import Controls
In accordance with its international
obligations under GATT and to the
European Community, Britain has
progressively removed almost all quantitative
import restrictions imposed on economic
grounds. The few remaining quantitative
restrictions mainly affect textile goods (in
view of the rapid contraction of the domestic
textile industry). They stem primarily from
the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA), under
which there exists a series of bilateral
agreements covering international trade in
textiles, designed to balance the interests of
both exporting and importing countries. The
present MFA expired in July 1991 but has
been extended to the end of 1992, pending
its phasing out as part of the Uruguay
Round.
A small number of quantitative
restrictions are also maintained against non-
GATT countries. Britain, in accordance with
European Community directives, operates a
ban on the import from North Korea and
South Africa of certain iron and steel
products. Quantitative restrictions have been
removed from imports of goods of
Community origin. However, there are
exceptions: Britain continues to apply
internationally recognised restrictions on
non-economic grounds on imports from all
countries of products such as firearms,
ammunition and nuclear materials. Other
government departments apply similar non¬
economic restrictions on goods such as meat
and poultry; animals, birds, bees, fish and
plants and some of their derivatives;
controlled drugs; explosives; fireworks;
certain offensive weapons; certain citizens’
band radios; indecent or obscene articles and
products derived from endangered species.
Export Controls
The great majority of British exports are not
subject to any government control or
direction except for presentation and
declaration to HM Customs and Excise on
export for the purpose of collecting the
overseas trade statistics. However, there are
controls governing the export of goods
associated with biological, chemical and
nuclear weapons and missiles. Controls also
exist on the export of military equipment
and of advanced industrial goods of strategic
significance as well as on steel sales to the
United States.
Other controls include those for health

certification purposes on certain animals,
meat and fish exported to another member of
the European Community; on endangered
animal and plant species; on photographic
and artistic material over a certain age and
value; and on documents, manuscripts and
archaeological items.
The Co-ordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM),1 of
which Britain is a member, announced major
changes in 1990 to the control of exports on
certain goods and technologies that are
enforced by its members. Many items have
been removed from control, and significant
relaxations have been achieved on the
controls on telecommunications equipment,
computers and machine tools. COCOM is
continuing to seek to remove and relax its
controls on other industrial goods and
technologies in order that the burden placed
upon exporters by these controls is reduced
as much as possible. The Government
wishes to assist in creating more favourable
export conditions while maintaining an
embargo on the most strategically sensitive
equipment and technologies.
GOVERNMENT SERVICES
The Government assists exporters by
creating conditions favourable to the export
trade and by providing practical help, advice
and support. This includes a wide range of
services.
Export Promotion Services
The major government departments involved
in export promotion collaborate to provide
Overseas Trade Services. The departments
are: the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI), the Foreign & Commonwealth Office,
the Industry Departments of the Scottish
and Welsh Offices and the Industrial
Development Board of Northern Ireland.
The operation is conducted from the DTFs
1 COCOM is an informal body of countries of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation except Iceland, plus Australia and
Japan. It was established in 1950 to co-ordinate controls on East-
West trade and on the export of strategic equipment, including
atomic energy material, munitions and industrial goods of
potential military use.
London headquarters, from 11 regional
offices throughout Britain and from nearly
200 diplomatic posts overseas.
The range of services available includes
the dissemination of export intelligence,
assistance in researching potential markets,
help at trade fairs and support for firms
participating in trade missions. In 1990-91
some ^166 million was spent on support for
exporters.
Overseas Trade Services also uses the
advice of the British Overseas Trade
Board—part of the DTI—and its 17 area
advisory groups. The Board has been
involved in identifying priorities for export
promotion. Priority markets are Western
Europe, North America and the Asia/Pacific
Rim.
ECGD
ECGD is a government department,
responsible to the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry. Since 1919 it has been
helping British exporters overcome many of
the risks in selling overseas.
ECGD underwrites credit contracts for
projects running into the medium term and
longer periods. Exporters are helped to break
into new markets through guarantees of
credit. In 1991 arrangements were made for
the sale to the private sector of its Insurance
Services Group, which dealt with exports
sold on short-term credit. ECGD assists
companies by providing insurance for new
investments overseas—mainly in developing
countries—against the political risks of
nationalisation, war and restrictions on
remittances.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The balance-of-payments statistics record
transactions between residents of Britain and
non-residents. The transactions are classified
into two groups: current account (visibles
and invisibles) and transactions in assets and
liabilities. The balance on current account
shows whether Britain has had a surplus of
income over expenditure.
Since 1983 Britain has had a deficit on
visible trade. It has traditionally run a

surplus on trade in invisibles. Between
1989 and 1990 the surplus on invisibles
rose slightly from £4,200 million to
£4,300 million. The surplus on services
increased by £500 million; that on interest,
profits and dividends declined by £59
million; and the deficit on transfers grew by
£357 million.
Capital Flows
Britain has no exchange controls; residents
are free to acquire foreign currency for any
purpose, including direct and portfolio
investment overseas. There are also no
controls on the lending of sterling abroad
and non-residents may freely acquire sterling
for any purpose. Gold may be freely bought
and sold. The abolition of exchange controls
in 1979 means that Britain meets its full
obligations on capital movements under the
OECD code on capital movements and
under European Community directives.
The Government welcomes both outward
and inward investment. Outward investment
helps to develop markets for British exports,
while providing earnings in the form of
interest, profits and dividends. Inward
investment creates employment directly;
introduces new technology, products,
management styles and attitudes; and
provides an opportunity to increase exports
or substitute imports. Inward investment is
particularly encouraged by the DTPs Invest
in Britain Bureau.
Inward direct investment in 1990 was
£19,000 million, compared with £17,100
million in 1989. In 1990 direct investment
overseas by British residents was £11,700
million, just over half the 1989 level.
Outward portfolio investment was £12,600
million. The inflow of direct and portfolio
investment into Britain amounted to £24,100
million. An analysis of transactions in
Britain’s external assets and liabilities is
given in Table 21.6.
External Assets and Liabilities
At the end of 1990 Britain’s identified
external assets exceeded identified external
liabilities by £30,000 million; this compares
with £84,000 million a year earlier and
reflects significant falls in securities prices in
1990. Net assets of the private sector and
public corporations amounted to over
£19,000 million and those of general
government to £10,000 million.
Direct investment assets overseas of
British residents (investment in branches,
subsidiaries and associated companies)
totalled £127,000 million at the end of 1990
and portfolio investment £186,000 million.
At the end of 1987 (the latest year for which
data are available) over 84 per cent of direct
investment was in developed countries, with
over 35 per cent in the United States and
nearly 28 per cent in the European
Community. In terms of industries,
manufacturing accounted for 35 per cent of

direct investment holdings. By type of
company, oil companies were responsible for
26 per cent, insurance companies for
7 per cent and banks for 4 per cent.
The significance of any inventory of
Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities is limited because a variety of
claims and obligations are included that are
very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity
and in method of valuation. For example,
while portfolio investment is valued at
market prices, direct investment is stated at
book value, which is likely to understate its
current market value.
Direct investment in Britain by overseas
residents amounted to £ 107,000 million at
the end of 1990 and portfolio investment to
£103,000 million. At the end of 1987
investment from developed countries
accounted for 95 per cent of overseas direct
investment in Britain: 46 per cent originated
in the United States and 26 per cent in the
European Community. A total of 36 per cent
was in manufacturing. Oil companies were
responsible for 29 per cent, insurance
companies for 4 per cent and banks for 10
per cent.
Another type of overseas transaction is
company cross-border acquisitions and
mergers. In 1990 overseas acquisitions and
mergers less disposals carried out by British
companies were valued at £6,300 million,
while the corresponding figure for operations
in Britain by overseas companies was
£10,000 million. The United States
accounted for 55 per cent of the value of
acquisitions and mergers by British
companies and the European Community for
31 per cent. The European Community also
accounted for 31 per cent of the value of
acquisitions and mergers by overseas
companies.

22 Promotion of Science
and Technology
Britain’s tradition for innovation in science
and technology is upheld by contemporary
British scientists, who continue to conduct
pioneering work in a wide range of areas.
During the 1980s Professor Michael Green
helped to develop the superstring theories,
which shed new light on the composition of
matter. In 1985 Professor Alec Jeffreys
invented genetic fingerprinting, while the
first combined heart, lungs and liver
transplant was carried out at Papworth
Hospital, Cambridge, in 1986. Agricultural
research in Britain has produced the first
microbial pesticides not to harm the
environment. A recent landmark in genetic
research has been the identification of the
gene in the Y chromosome responsible for
determining sex.
Nobel prizes for science have been won
by 70 British citizens. Table 22.1 lists British
prizewinners (excluding those in economic
sciences) since 1980.
Research and Development Expenditure
International comparisons of expenditure on
research and development (R & D) are based
on definitions agreed by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development.
According to these, total expenditure in
Britain on scientific research and
development in 1989 was about £11,532
million, 2 3 per cent of gross domestic
product. Some 50 per cent of this was
provided by industry and 37 per cent by
government. Significant contributions were
also made by overseas sources, private
endowments, trusts and charities.
Government finance for R & D goes to
research establishments, including its own, to
institutions of higher education and to
private industry, as well as to support
collaborative research programmes. In many
cases nationalised and private-sector
industries finance their own research and run

their own laboratories. Industry also funds
university research and spends money on
contracts to government establishments.
Charities may have their own laboratories as
well as offering grants for outside research.
Expenditure in Industry
According to a survey, R & D expenditure in
industry in 1989 amounted to £7,600
million, of which £1,249 million came from
government, £1,023 million from overseas
and the remaining £5,328 million chiefly
from industry’s own funds. The main areas
of expenditure were electronics (£2,259
million), chemicals (£1,692 million) and
aerospace (£1,070 million).
Expenditure by Government
Government figures for its R & D
expenditure differ somewhat from those used
in international comparisons and those
resulting from industrial surveys because
they include expenditure on social science
and the humanities, and also expenditure
overseas. Survey methods, too, tend to
produce an understatement of government
funding of research in industry. Total
government R & D expenditure (both civil
and defence) in 1990-91 was some £5,153
million. Among departments, the Ministry
of Defence has the largest research budget.
The main civil departments involved are the
Department of Education and Science (see
p 378); the Department of Trade and
Industry (see below); the Department of
Energy (see p 380); and the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (see p 380).
Government and Scientific Research
The main objectives of the Government’s
science programme are to advance scientific
knowledge and technological capability in
Britain, and provide training for scientists, in
order to achieve economic, social and
cultural benefits for Britain. The
Government considers that public funding
should support the pursuit of basic scientific
knowledge, while industry should bear the
chief responsibility for the commercial
development of scientific advances.
Science and technology policy is decided
collectively by ministers under the leadership
of the Prime Minister. The Government is
advised by the Chief Scientific Adviser and
by an independent Advisory Council on
Science and Technology (ACOST).
Members of ACOST are industrialists and
scientists appointed by the Prime Minister
for their personal eminence in their field.
There are also two ex officio members: the
chairman of the Advisory Board for the
Research Councils (ABRC) and the chairman
of the Universities Funding Council and the
Innovation Advisory Board. The remit of
ACOST covers defence as well as civil
research, and both academic science and
industrial R & D. It advises on national
priorities in science and technology, on the
application of science and technology, on
the co-ordination of science and technology
activities and on Britain’s participation in
international science and technology
collaboration.
Responsibility for basic civil science rests
with the Secretary of State for Education
and Science, who is advised by the ABRC.
Responsibility for technology rests mainly
with the Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry. Other departments with a
substantial involvement in science and
technology have a departmental advisory
body; these bodies work closely with
ACOST. A committee of Departmental
Chief Scientists, under the chairmanship of
the Chief Scientific Adviser, is responsible
for co-ordination among departments.
The Centre for Exploitation of Science
and Technology (CEST) was set up in 1988.
By studying the evolution of markets, it aims
to identify the science and technologies
needed to improve competitive performance
in particular industries. CEST is supported
by industry and by the Government.
The Department of Trade and Industry
Although most industrial research and
development is financed by industry itself,
the Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) provides support where there is a
sound case for doing so. Following a review
376
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
in 1988, the Department moved away from
general support for research with a strong
commercial emphasis towards collaborative
programmes of pre-competitive research,
with greater emphasis on encouraging links
between industry and the science base, and
on technology transfer.
In 1989-90 the DTI spent £310 million
on R & D, covering general industrial
innovation, aeronautics, space (see p 388)
and support for statutory, regulatory and
policy responsibilities. A further £90 million
was allocated to technology transfer and
related activities.
General Industrial Innovation
There are four main schemes of collaborative
R & D: LINK, EUREKA (see p 387),
Advanced Technology Programmes and Club
R & D. They complement the European
Community R & D programmes (see p 387).
The LINK scheme encourages
collaboration on pre-competitive research
between industry and the higher education
institutions and research councils. The aim
of this is to bridge the gap between scientific
research and its resulting commercial
applications. Under the scheme the DTI
funds up to 50 per cent of the costs.
Government funding of £190 million has
been committed to 30 LINK programmes,
mainly in the areas of biotechnology,
advanced materials, advanced manufacturing
and electronics.
Advanced Technology Programmes
encourage and support pre-competitive
research in new technologies. Twelve
programmes had been approved by July
1991, in high-temperature superconductivity,
marine exploitation and several aspects of
electronics and information technology.
Club R & D enables companies,
particularly of small and medium size, to
benefit from collaborative research in a major
research organisation at a subsidised rate.
The research is conducted in a host
organisation, such as a higher education
institution or a research and technology
organisation. To encourage research work
and innovation in small companies, the DTI
runs a competitive scheme called the Small
Firms Merit Award for Research and
Technology (SMART). In the 1990
competition 180 awards were announced.
Since February 1991 support for small and
medium-sized companies has been available
under the SPUR (Support for Products
under Research) scheme, which encourages
development of new products and processes.
Aeronautics
Funding from the DTI supports research
and innovation in Britain’s aircraft and
aeroengine industry, helping it to compete
effectively in world markets. Over half of the
work supported is conducted in industry and
universities, and the remainder in Ministry
of Defence establishments. The Civil Aircraft
and Aeroengine Research and Demonstration
Programme (CARAD) is part of a national
aircraft research effort conducted by
industry, the Government, research
establishments and higher education
institutes. In 1989-90 this programme was
supported by government funding of £28
million. The DTI is also supporting the
European Wind Tunnel project in Cologne,
due to be completed by the end of 1992.
Launch Aid is a scheme providing
government assistance for specific
development projects in the aerospace
industry. British Aerospace is currently
receiving aid for its participation in the
European Airbus Industrie consortium for
the A330/340 airliner project.
Research Establishments
The DTI has four research establishments,
which accounted for £35 million of the
Department’s R & D expenditure in
1989-90. Their primary role is to provide
the Government with an effective source of
scientific and technological expertise. They
provide technological services to industry
and also undertake research commissioned by
industry. The laboratories are also involved
in a variety of international activities.
1. The Laboratory of the Government
Chemist provides government with a
comprehensive service in analytical chemistry
377
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and serves to underpin sound chemical
measurement in Britain as part of the
National Measurement System (see below).
Its Biotechnology Unit takes the lead within
government for promoting the industrial
development of biotechnology.
2. NEL, the National Engineering
Laboratory, carries out R & D in a wide
range of engineering and related disciplines
and maintains the British standards of flow
measurement, of special importance in the oil
and gas industries.
3. The National Physical Laboratory is
Britain’s national standards laboratory and
the focus of the National Measurement
System. As well as developing and
disseminating standards of measurement, it
undertakes research on materials standards
and information technology.
4. The Warren Spring Laboratory is devoted
to research into environmental technology
dealing with pollution of air, land and water.
All four laboratories are now executive
agencies and the Government has long-term
plans to privatise the NEL, as the majority
of its work is for the benefit of industry.
Technology Transfer
The DTI has introduced several programmes
specifically to encourage technology transfer.
They promote the use of best-practice
techniques and modern technology as well as
exploiting the most recent research.
Examples are the Open Systems information
technology standards programme and the
Materials Matter programme, concerned with
modern materials and associated
manufacturing methods. Each programme
comprises an integrated package of activities
which may include seminars, conferences and
demonstration activities, as well as the
production of case study material and other
practical literature.
There are also general technology transfer
programmes not related to specific
technology areas. For example, in association
with the Departments of Education and
Science and Employment, the DTI supports
13 Regional Technology Centres. These
assist small and medium-sized enterprises
and help to promote the expertise of higher
education institutions.
Two new schemes were launched in
February 1991 to further support small and
medium-sized companies. The
Manufacturing Planning and Implementation
Studies Programme and the Technical
Action Line help companies to plan their use
of advanced manufacturing technology and
gain access to technical advice.
The Department of Education and
Science
The Department of Education and Science
discharges its responsibilities for basic and
applied civil science mainly through the five
research councils (see p 380), to which it
allocates funds from its science budget. For
1991-92 this is over £927 million (see Table
22.2).
The allocations provide support for
research in the following ways:
• grants and contracts to universities,
polytechnics, research units and other
research council establishments;
• support for postgraduate study; and
• subscriptions to international scientific
organisations.

PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
The Department is responsible for some
aspects of international scientific relations
and helps to co-ordinate and implement
government policy on scientific and technical
information. Together with the Scottish and
Welsh education departments, the DTI and
the Department of Employment, the DES
funds a number of schemes for training full¬
time students and those working in industry
in the latest technology. For example, under
the Professional, Industrial and Commercial
Updating (PICKUP) initiative, scientists
from higher education institutions spend
some of their time at 13 Regional
Technology Centres (see p 378), training
employees of private sector companies in
recent developments in their fields.
The Department is also the main source
of funding for the universities, whose
individual allocations are determined by
the Universities Funding Council (see
p 383). Until 1990 each university decided
on the division of its resources between
teaching and research. The overall
proportion committed to research was
thought to be about 40 per cent. Research
funding is now identified separately by the
Council.
The Advisory Board for the Research
Councils
The Advisory Board for the Research
Councils (ABRC) advises the Secretary of
State on matters relating to civil science,
particularly with regard to the operation of
the research council system. The ABRC
assesses the resource needs of the research
councils and other bodies, and advises on the
allocation of the science budget between
them. It also advises on the proper balance
between national and international scientific
activities.
The ABRC promotes effective
collaboration between the five research
councils, for example, in cases where there is
an overlap of scientific subject
responsibilities. It also fosters close liaison
between the councils and those using their
research, including industry and government
departments. The Board’s membership
includes the heads of the research councils
and senior scientists from industry and the
academic world.
The Ministry of Defence
The expenditure of the Ministry of Defence
(MoD) on research and development in
1989-90 was some £2,421 million. About
£932 million of this was medium- and long¬
term applied research relevant to known
military needs, much of it carried out in the
MoD’s defence research establishments.
Some £112 million of this research was
carried out under contract in industry and
the academic sector. The Government is
committed to achieving a gradual reduction
in real terms in spending on defence research
and development in future years. An
increasing emphasis is placed on research
funded jointly with industry, and initiatives
have also been taken to encourage ‘spin-off
from defence technology to the civil market.
Examples of technological innovations at
research establishments include:
• Royal Aerospace Establishment:
reduction in jet engine exhaust noise,
which has led to changes in Rolls-
Royce’s new civil engines.
• Royal Signals and Radar Establishment:
pioneering work on liquid crystal
displays, now widely used in the civil
sector. Development of infra-red
detectors now adopted by fire services.
• Admiralty Research Establishment:
development of a Multi-function
Electronically Scanned Adaptive Radar
(MESAR), which can perform the
functions of several different radars in
one system. This was a joint project with
Plessey, now part of GEC.
In 1991 these three non-nuclear research
establishments, together with the Royal
Armament Research and Development
Establishment, merged to become the
Defence Research Agency. Its role is to
provide scientific and technical services to
the MoD and other government
departments.
The major part of the Ministry’s R & D
expenditure (more than £1,298 million in
1989-90) is on the development of individual
379
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
items of equipment. Most of this takes place
in industry, and represents the bulk of
government expenditure on R & D in
industry.
Other Government Departments
The Department of Energy funds research in
support of offshore oil and gas technology,
energy efficiency and the development and
demonstration of British renewable energy
sources. The major part of its R & D is on
nuclear energy (£132 million in 1989-90),
most of which is carried out by the United
Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food co-ordinates its research
programme with the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department, the
Department of Agriculture for Northern
Ireland and the Agricultural and Food
Research Council (see p 383). Overall, the
Ministry’s research has three main objectives:
to protect the consumer and the
environment; to assist in the formulation and
assessment of policy; and to underpin the
applied R & D done by the agricultural
industry.
The Ministry’s wide-ranging
responsibilities are reflected in its research
activities, which cover land use and
conservation, animal welfare, food safety and
quality, and conservation of fish stocks.
Expenditure in 1989—90 was £112 million,
about half of which was in the Ministry’s
own laboratories and agencies. Most of the
rest was in contracts to the Agricultural and
Food Research Council.
The Department of the Environment
funds research in seven policy areas:
environmental protection, including
radioactive substances; water; countryside;
planning and inner cities; local government;
housing; and building and construction. The
largest individual sub-programme is on the
safe disposal of radioactive waste. An area of
research of increasing importance is that of
pollution-related climate change. Total
research expenditure in 1990—91 was £74
million.
The Department of Health is introducing
the first comprehensive R & D strategy for
the National Health Service, which will focus
on improving methods of health care and
achieving a cost-effective use of resources.
The Department also manages a Health and
Personal Social Services research programme,
which is concerned with the needs of
ministers and policy-makers, with emphasis
on improving efficiency. T he Department s
Director of Research and Development
advises the Secretary of State as required on
the research undertaken by non-departmental
public bodies for which he is responsible.
The National Computing Centre
promotes best practice in software
engineering in industry, while the Central
Computer and Telecommunications Agency,
part of HM Treasury, encourages the
establishment of standards of computer
compatibility and the best use of information
technology in the public sector.
THE RESEARCH COUNCILS
Each of the four research councils engaged in
scientific research is an autonomous body
established under Royal Charter, with
membership drawn from the universities,
professions, industry and the Government.
They conduct research through their own
establishments and by supporting selected
research, study and training in universities
and other higher education establishments.
In addition to funding from the Department
of Education and Science (see p 378), they
also receive income for research
commissioned by departments under the
customer-contractor principle and from the
private sector. Income from commissioned
research is particularly important for the
Agricultural and Food Research Council
and the Natural Environment Research
Council.
Institutions undertaking research with the
support of research council grants have the
rights and responsibility for the commercial
exploitation of that research, subject to prior
agreement with the sponsoring research
council. Universities and research institutes
may make use of the expertise of the British
Technology Group (see p 385) to patent and
license their inventions, but are not obliged
to do so.
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
Science and Engineering Research
Council
The Science and Engineering Research
Council (SERC) is responsible for the
support of research and postgraduate training
in pure and applied science (including
engineering) outside the areas of agriculture,
medicine and the environment. SERC is the
most highly funded of the research councils.
Its expenditure in 1989-90 was allocated as
follows:
• research grants, chiefly to higher
education institutions (£150 million);
• contributions to international
organisations (£90 million, see p 387);
• the Council’s own establishments (£82
million); and
• funding of postgraduate training (£64
million).
The Council has funded Interdisciplinary
Research Centres in fields such as high-
temperature superconductivity, engineering
design, molecular sciences, high performance
materials, and optical and laser-related
science and technology. It encourages
collaboration between higher education and
industry, partly by sponsoring co-ordinated
research programmes in areas of special
industrial concern.
The SERC maintains four research
establishments: the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory at Chilton (Oxfordshire), the
Daresbury Laboratory at Warrington
(Cheshire), the Royal Greenwich
Observatory at Cambridge, and the Royal
Observatory, Edinburgh. They are centres of
specialised research, providing experimental
facilities beyond the resources of individual
academic institutions; they also undertake
contract research.
SERC research support is organised under
four boards, covering science (£123 million
in 1989-90); engineering (£111 million);
nuclear physics (£76 million); and astronomy
and planetary science (£69 million). In
recent years the SERC’s policy has been to
transfer funds from the astronomy and
nuclear physics boards, representing largely
‘big’ science and basic research, to the more
general areas of science and engineering,
representing largely strategic research on a
smaller scale.
Science
The Science Board supports academic
research in chemistry, physics, mathematics,
the biological sciences and science-based
archaeology. Its main priority is the
provision of research grants to universities
and polytechnics. About 50 per cent of
grants are awarded as part of co-ordinated
programmes of interdisciplinary strategic
research falling within the areas of materials;
molecular sciences; and mathematics,
computational and cognitive science. They
may be part of a LINK programme (see
p 377) or associated with an Interdisciplinary
Research Centre.
Engineering
The Engineering Board, whose funding has
increased greatly in recent years, supports
strategic research into the development of
advanced technology. It aims to identify
promising areas of national importance and
initiates co-ordinated programmes of research
which will benefit British industry. Some of
the areas identified for priority action are
training, computer software research,
materials research, supercomputing in
engineering and biotechnology (where a
special directorate funded jointly with the
Science Board is in operation).
The Teaching Company Scheme is jointly
sponsored by the SERC and the DTI, with
contributions from the Northern Ireland
Department of Economic Development and
the Economic and Social Research Council.
The scheme supports some 380 collaborative
ventures between academic engineering
departments and industrial companies, to
improve their manufacturing and
management methods.
Nuclear Physics
The Nuclear Physics Board supports particle
physics and nuclear structure physics. The
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory co-ordinates
381
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain’s experimental particle physics
research programme and links university
researchers with overseas centres such as
CERN (see p 387). The laboratory’s
spallation neutron source (called ‘ISIS’) is
the world’s leading pulsed neutron facility.
The nuclear structure physics programme is
concentrated largely at the Daresbury
laboratory, which has a 20-million volt
tandem accelerator. The laboratory operates a
synchrotron radiation facility which provides
high-intensity X-ray and ultraviolet radiation
used in a wide range of experiments in
protein crystallography, surface physics,
chemical structure and materials science.
Astronomy and Planetary Science
The Astronomy and Planetary Science Board
supports space science, including
contributions to international programmes
(see p 000), ground-based astronomy and
geophysics. In optical astronomy the SERC
is a principal partner in the international
observatory on the island of La Palma in the
Canary Islands. The observatory’s four
telescopes include the 4 2-m William
Herschel. Opened in 1987, it is the third
largest single-mirror optical telescope in the
world. On Mauna Kea, Hawaii, the SERC
has a 3-8-m infra-red telescope, the largest
telescope in the world designed specifically
for infra-red observations, and the 15-m
James Clerk Maxwell radio telescope (built in
collaboration with the Netherlands and
Canada). Such telescopes have proved
invaluable to scientists researching into the
creation of the universe.
Medical Research Council
The Medical Research Council (MRC) is the
main government agency for the support of
biomedical research. Some three-quarters of
its budget is used to fund research projects
at its own centres and units; it also allocates
grants to research workers at higher
education institutions and hospitals. The
MRC’s major research establishments are the
National Institute for Medical Research at
Mill Hill, London; the Clinical Research
Centre at Northwick Park Hospital, London;
and the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at
Cambridge. The Council has more than 50
other research units, located in universities
and medical schools throughout Britain.
Four Interdisciplinary Research Centres
are being set up, in toxicology, molecular
medicine, protein engineering and cell
biology. Two more are planned, in brain and
behaviour and brain repair.
The MRC’s scientists and doctors have
pioneered developments in molecular
biology, therapeutic clinical trials, applied
psychology, and methods of imaging the
body such as magnetic resonance and
ultrasound. The Council’s larger research
programmes include psychiatric and
neurological (including Alzheimer’s) disease,
heart and respiratory ailments, infectious
diseases, tropical medicine, and antenatal
screening for cystic fibrosis and muscular
dystrophy.
Major new projects are:
• specially funded work on AIDS;
• research on vaccines against meningitis
and whooping cough; and
• the mapping of the human genome, the
complete sequence of genes in a human
cell.
Research is also continuing into the use of
monoclonal antibodies in transplant
operations.
The Council’s policy is to foster
collaboration between its establishments and
industry in order to promote the transfer of
skills and technologies, the exploitation of
Council discoveries, and the development of
new health care products.
Natural Environment Research Council
The Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC) seeks to advance understanding of
the biological, physical and chemical
processes of the planet, and how the natural
environment is changing, either by natural
causes or through human activities.
In 1991-92 about 75 per cent of NERC’s
funds are from the science budget, and about
25 per cent from commissioned work for
public authorities and industry in Britain and
overseas.
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
The Council supports research and
training in over 14 NERC Institutes and
research units and in universities and
polytechnics. NERC Institutes include the
British Geological Survey, the Institute of
Terrestrial Ecology, the Institute of
Oceanographic Sciences Deacon Laboratory,
and the British Antarctic Survey.
NERC conducts local and regional
research in Britain and in other countries,
while also participating in major international
environmental projects. Examples of NERC
research and new developments include:
• a comprehensive geological survey of
Britain’s inner continental shelf
completed by the British Geological
Survey. Britain is the first country in the
world to complete such a survey;
• the NERC Biogeochemical Ocean Flux
Study, which examines how carbon
dioxide is absorbed by the oceans and
buried in the sea floor sediments,
helping to balance the ‘greenhouse
effect’; and
• participation by scientists at the Institute
of Terrestrial Ecology in a major new
Countryside Survey of Britain, using
satellite and field information.
Applied projects in progress overseas
include initiatives in biological pest control;
regeneration of tropical hardwoods; drip
irrigation techniques for tropical crops; and
surveys of potential resources.
In 1991 NERC opened the James Rennell
Centre in Southampton to act as a focus
for Britain’s contributions to the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment, which
investigates the vital role of the oceans
in controlling climate.
In the same year NERC also opened an
Interdisciplinary Research Centre for
population biology at Imperial College,
Silwood Park, Berkshire. The centre includes
a series of 16 computer-controlled
environmental chambers which provide
suitable living conditions for small
communities of plants and animals. This will
aid research into ecology and population
interactions.
Several computer-based environmental
data centres have been established at NERC
sites, providing an information and advisory
service for a wide range of users.
Agricultural and Food Research Council
The Agricultural and Food Research Council
(AFRC) supports research underpinning
agriculture, food and the biologically based
industries. The Council’s main research areas
include animal health, animal physiology and
genetics, food safety and quality, diet and
health, agricultural engineering, grassland
and the environmental aspects of agriculture.
Work is carried out at seven AFRC
institutes, at Horticulture Research
International and in higher education
institutions. The AFRC also offers scientific
advice to the Scottish Agricultural Research
Institutes, funded by the Scottish Office
Agriculture and Fisheries Department. The
Council plans to increase its support for
higher education institutions over the next
five years to about 30 per cent of its science
budget funding.
The AFRC at present draws almost two-
thirds of its funding from the science
budget, about a quarter from the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for
commissioned research, and an increasing
proportion from industry. The Council aims
to raise 25 per cent of its institute funding
from commercial and other sources by
1994—95.
Recent research conducted by the AFRC
has demonstrated the link between bovine
spongiform encephalopathy and the disease
scrapie in sheep. New, rapid methods have
been designed to detect food poisoning
organisms. Promising research is being
conducted into ‘anti-sense’ genes in plants,
which can block unwanted genetic changes.
The anti-sense genes could stop leaf-drop in
crop plants, or delay the ripening process in
fruit, prolonging the storage period.
UNIVERSITY RESEARCH
About half the research carried out in
universities is financed from resources
allocated by the Universities Funding
383
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Council. These funds contribute to the cost
of academic staff—who teach as well as carry
out research—and provide for support staff,
administration, equipment and
accommodation. The research councils also
support scientific research in the universities
and other institutions of higher education, in
two ways. First, they allocate maintenance
awards to over a quarter of postgraduate
students in science and technology.
Secondly, they give grants and contracts to
the universities and other institutions for
specified projects, particularly in new or
developing areas of research.
From August 1992 the research councils
will be responsible for meeting in full the
research costs of the projects they support in
universities and polytechnics. The higher
education institutions will, however, continue
to provide the salaries of academic staff and
meet other costs, such as the upkeep of
premises.
The other main channels of support for
scientific research in the universities are
various government departments, the Royal
Society, industry and the independent
foundations. Universities are encouraged to
recover the full cost of research from these
foundations. They are also encouraged to
direct their resources into those areas where
they have existing research strength, or
where they may contribute to new and
promising spheres of science and technology.
Increasingly, close relationships are being
fostered between the universities, industry
and the Government in numerous joint
projects. British universities’ earnings from
industry and other outside agencies are rising
rapidly and amounted to some £915 million
in 1989-90. The money comes from a range
of sources, including research grants and
contracts and services to industry. Many
universities now operate industrial liaison
service units.
The universities sector has produced a
number of recent technological
breakthroughs. At Heriot-Watt University in
Edinburgh, researchers have developed
optoelectronic devices for future super-fast
optical computers. A further innovation
announced in 1991 has been the production
of an electronic video camera on a single
silicon chip less than 10 mm square. This
could lead to the development of video
telephones, allowing people to see the caller
at the end of the line. At the universities of
Cambridge and Essex, scientists are
pioneering techniques for the active
cancellation of unwanted sound and other
vibrations. Important research on optical
fibres is being carried out at Southampton,
Exeter and Essex universities, and on
pharmaceutical products and biotechnology
at Strathclyde.
Science Parks
Science parks were designed to promote
closer links between industry and university
research departments. By mid-1991 there
were 39 such parks in operation, at or near
universities, providing accommodation for
around 1,000 companies. Most of these
companies are involved in computing,
electronics, instrumentation, robotics,
electrical engineering, chemicals and
biotechnology. Research, development and
training activities are emphasised, rather than
large-scale manufacturing.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Charitable Foundations
Charitable foundations sponsoring research
in Britain include the Cancer Research
Campaign, the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund, the Wellcome Trust and the Nuffield
Foundation. In 1990 the largest spenders on
medical research were the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund at £50 4 million and the
Wellcome Trust at £47-2 million.
Industrial Research Organisations
In Britain there are over 40 independent
companies which undertake research contracts
and provide consultancy and training services
for a wide range of industrial companies.
Between them they employ over 9,000 people
and had a turnover in 1990 of £300 million.
The companies are linked by the Cambridge-
based Association of Independent Research
and Technology Organisations.
384
PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
British Technology Group
British Technology Group (BTG) promotes
the development of new technology into
commercial products, particularly where
the technology originates from public sector
sources, such as universities, polytechnics,
research councils and government research
establishments. It offers to take responsibility
for protecting and licensing inventions from
these sources, provides funds for
development, seeks licensees and negotiates
licence agreements with industry.
BTG provides finance to British industry
to encourage innovation, most commonly
through equity or project finance. The
latter offers companies up to 50 per cent of
their development costs. The Group also
helps companies to negotiate licences
overseas for their inventions. BTG expects to
recover its investment by means of a
percentage levy on sales of the resulting
product or process.
At present, BTG is involved with 1,672
inventions, some 700 of which are at
universities and other public sector
institutions. In 1990—91 the Group’s income
exceeded £30 million. Legislation to privatise
BTG is before Parliament.
Professional Institutions and Learned
Societies
There are numerous technical institutions
and professional associations in Britain, many
of which promote their own disciplines or
are interested in the education and
professional well-being of their members.
More than 300 learned societies play
an important part in the promotion
of science and technology through
meetings, publications and sponsorship.
The Council of Science and Technology
Institutes has seven member institutes
representing biology, chemical engineering,
chemistry, food science and technology,
geology, hospital physics and physics.
The Engineering Council, established in
1981, promotes the study of all types of
engineering in schools and other
organisations, in co-operation with its 260
industrial affiliates. These include large
private sector companies and government
departments. Together with 47 professional
engineering institutions, the Council
accredits courses in higher education
institutions. It also advises the Government
on a range of academic, industrial and
professional issues.
The national academy of engineering in
Britain is the Fellowship of Engineering, set
up in 1976. It promotes the discipline and
advises the Government on related policy
issues. Its membership consists of
distinguished engineers.
The Royal Society
The most prestigious learned society is The
Royal Society, or, more fully, The Royal
Society of London for Improving Natural
Knowledge, founded in 1660. The Society
has over 1,000 Fellows, many of whom
serve on the governmental advisory councils
and committees concerned with research.
It administers a grant-in-aid from the
Department of Education and Science
(£15 7 million in 1991-92) which represents
some 75 per cent of its annual expenditure.
The remainder is derived from private
funds.
The Royal Society encourages scientific
research and its application through a
programme of meetings and lectures, its
publications, and through the award of
grants, fellowships and other funding. It
recognises scientific and technological
achievements through election to the
Fellowship and the award of medals and
endowed lectureships. As the national
academy of sciences, it represents Britain in
a number of international non-governmental
organisations and is involved in a variety of
international scientific programmes. It also
facilitates collaborative projects and the
exchange of scientists through bilateral
agreements with academies and research
councils throughout the world. It provides
independent advice on scientific matters,
notably to government, and represents and
supports the scientific community as a
whole. The Society is increasingly active in
promoting science understanding and
385
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
awareness in the public, and also science
education. It also supports research into the
history of scientific endeavour.
Other Societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, established in 1783, promotes
science through scholarships, the
organisation of meetings and symposia, the
publication of journals and the award of
prizes. The Society also administers various
fellowship schemes for post-doctoral research
workers.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments through lectures and
publications for specialists and for
schoolchildren. Of these, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science,
founded in 1831, is mainly concerned with
science, while the Royal Society of Arts,
dating from 1754, deals with the arts and
commerce as well as science. The Royal
Institution, founded in 1799, also performs
these functions and runs its own research
laboratories.
Zoological Gardens
The Zoological Society of London, an
independent scientific body, runs the world-
famous London Zoo, which occupies some 15
hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s Park, London.
The zoo has successfully operated a captive
breeding programme to conserve some of the
world’s most endangered animals, such as
Brazilian golden lion tamarins. The Society is
responsible for the Institute of Zoology,
which carries out research in conservation
and comparative medicine. It also organises
scientific meetings and symposia, and
publishes scientific journals.
Whipsnade Wild Animal Park near
Dunstable (Bedfordshire) is also run by the
Society. Other well-known zoos include
those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley
and Marwell (near Winchester).
Botanical Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, founded in
1759, cover 121 hectares (300 acres) at Kew
in west London and a 187-hectare (462-
acre) estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardingly,
in West Sussex. They contain the largest
collections of living and dried plants in the
world. Research is conducted into all
aspects of plant life, including physiology,
biochemistry, genetics, economic botany
and the conservation of habitats and
species. Kew also has the world’s largest
seed bank for wild origin species and
is active in programmes to return
endangered plant species to the wild. It
participates in joint research programmes
in 52 countries.
The Royal Botanic Garden in
Edinburgh, founded in 1670, is a centre
for research into taxonomy, for the
conservation and study of living plants and
for horticultural education.
Scientific Museums
The Natural History Museum, which now
includes the Geological Museum, has some
60 million specimens ranging in size from a
blue whale skeleton to minute insects. It is
one of the world’s principal centres for
research into natural history, offering an
advisory service to institutions all over the
world. The museum is keen to promote
public appreciation of nature conservation
and in 1991 opened a major exhibition on
ecology, illustrating the diversity of living
species.
The Science Museum promotes
understanding of the history of science,
technology, industry and medicine. Its
extensive collection of scientific
instruments and machinery is
complemented by interactive computer
games and audio-visual equipment for
visitors to use. In this way the museum
explains scientific principles to the public
and documents the history of science,
from early discoveries to space age
technology.
These two museums are in South
Kensington, London. Other important
collections include the Museum of Science
and Industry in Birmingham, the Museum
of the History of Science at Oxford, and
the Royal Scottish Museum, Edinburgh.

PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC
RELATIONS
European Community
Since 1984 the European Community has
run a series of R & D Framework
Programmes in a number of strategic sectors,
with the aim of strengthening the
international competitiveness of European
industry. The Third Framework Programme
runs from 1990-94, with a European
Community budget of £4,200 million. It
overlaps with the Second Framework
Programme (1987-91) and covers the
following broad categories:
• information and communication
technologies;
• industrial and material technologies;
• the environment;
• life sciences and technologies;
• energy; and
• human capital and mobility.
Overall, British organisations—research
organisations, companies and higher
education institutions—have performed well,
securing some 20 per cent of the total
funding available. This is broadly equal to
Britain’s contribution to the R & D budget
of the European Community.
Britain hosts the Joint European Torus
nuclear fusion project (JET), which is based
at Culham, Oxfordshire.
Non-EC Activities
EUREKA is a scheme to encourage
European co-operation in the development
and production of high-technology products
with worldwide sales potential. There are
currently 385 approved EUREKA projects,
involving an estimated total investment of
£5,000 million. British companies are
participating in 100 of these, 28 of which are
British-led. The members of EUREKA are
the 12 countries of the European
Community, the six countries of the
European Free Trade Association, Turkey
and the European Commission.
COST (European Co-operation in the
Field of Scientific and Technical Research)
encourages the co-operation of national
research activities. There are currently 19
member states: the 12 countries of the
European Community, Austria, Finland,
Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and
Yugoslavia. British organisations are involved
in 35 out of 46 projects.
Britain is a member of the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN)
in Geneva. Britain’s contributions to CERN,
to the high-flux neutron source at the
Institut Laue-Langevin and to the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, both at
Grenoble, are paid through the SERC. The
SERC is also a partner in the European
Incoherent Scatter radar facilities in northern
Scandinavia, which are used for atmospheric
research. Through the NERC, Britain is a
member of the Ocean Drilling Program led
by the United States, and of the World
Ocean Circulation Experiment, which aims
to discover how the oceans help to control
the Earth’s climate. Through the MRC,
Britain participates in the European
Molecular Biology Organisation.
Britain is also a member of the science
and technology committees of international
organisations such as the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,
and various specialised agencies of the
United Nations.
Britain has concluded a number of inter¬
governmental and inter-agency agreements
with other countries for co-operation in
science and technology. Among non¬
governmental organisations, the five research
councils, the Royal Society and the British
Academy were founder members of the
European Science Foundation in 1974. The
research councils also maintain a joint office
in Brussels to further European co-operation
in research.
Staff in British Embassies and High
Commissions promote contacts in science
and technology between Britain and the
countries in which they are accredited. The
British Council promotes better
understanding and knowledge of Britain and
its scientific and technological achievements.
It encourages exchanges of specialists,
387
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
provides specialised information, and fosters
co-operation in research, training and
education. The Council also identifies and
manages technological, scientific and
educational projects in the developing
countries. Many British companies are
involved in commercial co-operative research
projects with overseas manufacturers.
Space Activities
Britain’s involvement in civil space research
is co-ordinated by the British National Space
Centre (BNSC), which is a partnership
between various government departments
and research councils. Through BNSC,
Britain spent some £150 million on space
activities in 1990-91, financed mainly by the
DTI and the SERC. Of this over 60 per cent
was devoted to programmes shared with the
European Space Agency (ESA). The
remainder supported a programme of
research and development in government
establishments, universities and industry.
A major part of Britain’s space programme
is concerned with earth observation, or
remote sensing. Britain has committed
around £10 million to the ESA’s satellite
ERS-1, launched in July 1991, which is
designed to provide all-weather, 24-hour
coverage of the Earth. Britain has provided
the main active microwave instrument for
ERS-1, along with a precision instrument to
measure thermal infra-red emissions from the
sea surface. A £30 million Earth Observation
Data Centre was opened in 1991 at
Farnborough, Hampshire, to process the data
output from ERS satellites and distribute it
to scientists and commercial users.
Britain is also contributing some £250
million to the Columbus programme,
Europe’s contribution to the United States-
led International Space Station project.
Britain is playing a major role in developing
the polar-orbiting platform and key
instruments for the Columbus project.
In space science, British groups have been
involved with almost all of the ESA’s
missions, including the investigation of
Halley’s Comet by the British-built Giotto
spacecraft, the International Ultraviolet
Explorer, the Hipparcos star-mapping
mission and the Ulysses solar polar probe.
Britain is contributing substantially to the
Cluster and SOHO missions to be launched
in 1995 to study the Sun, the Earth’s
magnetosphere and the solar wind. It is also
expected that Britain will participate in the
ESA’s X-ray spectroscopy mission due for
launch in 1998.
Britain has bilateral arrangements for
space research with other countries, notably
the United States through its National
Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA), the Soviet Union and the People’s
Republic of China. British groups have
participated in several NASA space science
missions, and have developed instruments for
NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. Other
collaborations include the development of the
wide-field camera for Germany’s X-ray
satellite ROSAT and the X-ray sensor for
the Japanese-built Ginga satellite.
In satellite communications Britain has
collaborated with the ESA in such
programmes as Olympus, DRTM and
ASTP-4, with the aim of encouraging the
use and development of new services and
research concepts.
In May 1991 Britain’s first astronaut,
Helen Sharman, participated in a mission
of the Soviet Mir space station (a private
sector venture), during which she performed
a number of scientific experiments in orbit.

23 Promotion of the Arts
Artistic and cultural activity in Britain ranges
from the highest professional standards to
the enthusiastic support and participation of
amateurs. London is one of the leading
world centres for drama, music, opera and
dance, and festivals held in towns and cities
throughout the country attract much interest.
Many British playwrights, composers, film¬
makers, sculptors, painters, writers, actors,
singers, choreographers and dancers enjoy
international reputations. Television and
radio bring a wide range of artistic events to
a large audience. Arts activities introduced
and developed by the ethnic minorities are
also thriving. At an amateur level, numerous
choral, orchestral, operatic, dramatic and
other societies for the arts make use of local
talent and resources.
Policies
The Government’s policies for the arts aim
to develop a high standard of artistic and
cultural activity throughout Britain; to
encourage innovation and scholarship; and to
promote public access to, and appreciation
of, the arts and the cultural heritage. This is
achieved through providing funds and advice,
and expanding total resources by encouraging
partnership with the private sector, including
business sponsorship. National museums and
galleries are encouraged and given an
incentive to increase their resources, for
example, through trading and other activities
which, in 1991-92, will provide an estimated
£46 million. An important concept in
funding policy is the ‘arm’s length’ principle,
by which government funds are distributed
to arts organisations indirectly, through
bodies such as the Arts Councils and the
British Film Institute; this helps safeguard
against political interference in the arts.
Administration
Promotion and patronage of the arts are the
concern of both official and unofficial bodies.
The Government and local authorities play
an active part, and a substantial amount of
help comes from private sources, including
trusts and commercial concerns.
The Minister for the Arts is responsible
for general arts policy and heads the Office
of Arts and Libraries, which administers
government expenditure on national
museums and art galleries in England, the
Arts Council, the British Library and other
national arts and heritage bodies. English
Heritage (the Historic Buildings and
Monuments Commission for England)
manages some 400 ancient monuments and
historic buildings on behalf of the
Department of the Environment. The
regulation of the film industry and of
broadcasting is conducted by the Department
of Trade and Industry and the Home Office
respectively. The Secretaries of State for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are
responsible for the national museums,
galleries and libraries in their countries, and
for other cultural matters.
Local authorities maintain more than
1,000 local museums and art galleries and
some 4,000 public libraries in England. They
also support many arts organisations and
artistic events in their areas, providing grant
aid for professional and voluntary
organisations, including orchestras and
theatre, opera and dance companies. They
undertake direct promotions through local
arts councils and contribute to the cost of
new or converted buildings for the arts. In
England this support is estimated to be over
£100 million a year. Arts education in
schools, colleges, polytechnics, evening
institutes and community centres is the
389
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
responsibility of central government
education departments, in partnership with
local education authorities and voluntary
bodies.
Finance
Since 1988 the Government has set the arts
budget for a three-year period in order to
give recipient arts bodies a firm basis on
which to plan future activities and to
encourage greater self-reliance and
diversification in their sources of funding. It
considers that this strategy has proved
successful in encouraging arts bodies to
match their plans to a realistic view of the
total resources likely to be available. The
three-year settlement applies to the larger
part of the central government arts
programme. Planned central government
expenditure through the Office of Arts and
Libraries amounts to £559 million in
1991-92. About 35 per cent is spent on 11
national galleries and museums in England,
with 40 per cent channelled through the Arts
Council to support the performing and visual
arts throughout England, Scotland and
Wales; about 11 per cent goes to the British
Library. Grants are also made to the British
Film Institute, the Crafts Council, certain
other museums and arts bodies, and to the
National Heritage Memorial Fund. The
Fund helps organisations wishing to acquire,
for the public benefit, land, buildings, works
of art and other objects associated with the
national heritage.
Industrial and commercial concerns offer
vital sponsorship and patronage to a wide
range of arts, including exhibitions, concerts
and opera seasons. The Business
Sponsorship Incentive Scheme was launched
by the Office of Arts and Libraries in co¬
operation with the Association for Business
Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA) in Great
Britain in 1984, with the aim of raising the
overall level of business sponsorship. (A
similar scheme was set up in Northern
Ireland in 1987.) Since its inception the
Scheme has attracted nearly £40 million of
new money and over 1,700 sponsors into the
arts. An estimated 70 per cent of the awards
have been made to arts organisations outside
London. ABSA is also participating in UK
Charity Lotteries, a venture launched in
February 1991 designed to benefit 200
charities, among them many arts
organisations.
In 1990-91 the Scheme made available
£3-5 million to match new sponsorships.
Further support is encouraged by tax
concessions which allow companies and
individuals to obtain tax relief on donations
to arts charities. For example, under the Gift
Aid scheme, announced in 1990, single gifts
of between £600 and £5 million in any one
year qualify for tax relief.
In 1991-92 the Arts Council is creating an
Enhancement Fund, with the aim of
strengthening leading arts organisations and
enhancing standards. It is setting aside £22-5
million for schemes in England, Scotland
and Wales in the period 1991-92 to 1993-94,
and is seeking matching contributions.
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts
was set up in 1991 by the Pool Promoters
Association, with grants expected to total
£60 million a year. About two-thirds of the
revenue will be used to benefit sport and the
remainder will benefit the arts.
Arts Councils
The independent Arts Council of Great
Britain, established in 1946, is the main
channel for government aid to the
performing and visual arts. Its chief aims are
to improve the knowledge, understanding
and practice of the performing and visual
arts, increase their accessibility to the public,
and advise and co-operate with government
departments, local authorities and other
organisations. The Council gives financial
help and advice to organisations ranging
from the major opera, dance and drama
companies; orchestras and festivals; to small
touring theatres and experimental groups.
It also trains arts administrators and helps
arts organisations to develop other sources of
income. It encourages contemporary dance,
mime, jazz, literature, photography and art
films, and helps professional creative writers,
choreographers, composers, artists and
photographers through a variety of schemes.
It also promotes art exhibitions and tours
390
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
and makes funds available for some specialist
training courses in the arts. The Council has
allocated £2 million a year from 1988-89 to
1991-92 for increased touring to help widen
access to the arts. Emphasis is being placed
on obtaining funds through partnership
arrangements with local authorities and other
agencies, and from commercial sources.
Organisations in Scotland and Wales
receive their subsidies through the Scottish
and Welsh Arts Councils, which are
committees of the Arts Council of Great
Britain with a large measure of autonomy.
Northern Ireland has an independent Arts
Council with aims and functions similar to
those of the Arts Council of Great Britain.
Developments
Government plans to change the structure of
arts funding in England will take effect from
April 1993. These changes will strengthen
the policy-making role of the Arts Council
and involve a major shift in direct funding
responsibilities from the Council to ten
regional arts boards (see below). The Council
will retain the funding of the four national
companies—the Royal Opera House, the
English National Opera, the Royal
Shakespeare Company and the Royal
National Theatre—and a number of other
national centres of excellence, and will retain
responsibility for touring, broadcasting,
research, education and training. The
Council is preparing a national arts strategy,
due for completion in mid-1992.
Local Arts Councils
Local arts councils in towns and
communities throughout Britain, some of
them founded and supported by local
authorities, aim to develop and co-ordinate
arts activities in their localities. Industrial
and commercial interests also give financial
help.
Regional Arts Boards
Regional development of the arts is currently
promoted by 12 regional arts associations in
England and three in Wales. They bring
together all those in a region, from local
authorities and private sector companies to
local artists, with an interest in improving
the artistic life of their area. The associations
offer financial assistance to artists and arts
organisations, and advise on, and in some
cases promote, activities. They are financed
mainly by the Arts Council, with smaller
sums from the British Film Institute, the
Crafts Council and local authorities, and
these interests are represented on their
governing bodies. Business sponsorship is
also an increasingly important source of
regional funds.
From October 1991 these associations will
become incorporated as ten regional arts
boards, each with its own chair. The boards
will be subject to a greater financial
accountability through a system of forward
planning and budgeting, under the direction
of the Arts Council.
Arts of Minority Communities
A wide range of arts activities is undertaken
by Britain’s diverse communities, embracing
both the traditional and new forms of artistic
expression. In its support for cultural equity
the Arts Council has, over the last five years,
devoted particular attention to black and
Asian dance and drama. It has expanded its
training schemes to include arts
administration and technical skills. The
Commonwealth Institute arranges a varied
programme of artistic events, and the
Minorities Arts Advisory Service is an
independent organisation which provides
advice and information on, and training in,
the arts of these communities.
Arts Centres
More than 250 arts centres in Britain provide
opportunities for enjoyment of and
participation in a range of activities in both
the performing and visual arts, with
educational projects becoming increasingly
important. Nearly all are professionally
managed and most are supported by
volunteer groups. About 70 per cent of all
arts centres are converted buildings,
including former churches, warehouses,
391
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
schools, town halls and private houses.
Nearly 90 per cent arrange holiday
programmes for young people. The centres
are assisted mainly by regional arts boards
and local authorities, while the Arts Council
funds two large centres in London—the
South Bank Centre and the Institute of
Contemporary Arts. Many theatres and art
galleries also provide a focal point for the
community by making available facilities for
other arts.
British Council
The British Council promotes a knowledge
of British culture overseas and maintains
libraries in many of the 90 countries in
which it is represented. The Council initiates
or supports overseas tours by British theatre
companies, orchestras, choirs, opera and
dance companies, and jazz, rock and folk
groups, as well as by individual actors,
musicians and artists. It also arranges for
directors, designers, choreographers and
conductors to work with overseas companies,
orchestras and choirs. The Council organises
and supports fine arts and other exhibitions
overseas as well as British participation in
international exhibitions and film festivals. It
also maintains film libraries in many of the
countries in which it works, and encourages
professional interchange between Britain and
other countries in all cultural fields.
Visiting Arts Office
The Visiting Arts Office, an autonomous
body administered by the British Council,
promotes foreign arts in Britain. It provides
a clearing house for British and overseas arts
organisations, advises on touring matters and
makes awards for projects.
Broadcasting Organisations
Both BBC radio and television and the
independent companies broadcast a wide
variety of drama (including adaptations of
novels and stage plays), opera, ballet, and
music; and general arts magazine
programmes and documentaries. These have
won many international awards at festivals
such as the Prix Italia and Montreux
International Television Festivals.
Independent television companies also make
grants for arts promotion in their regions.
The BBC has six orchestras which employ
many of Britain’s full-time professional
musicians. Each week it broadcasts about 100
hours of classical and other music (both live
and recorded) on its Radio 3 channel. A
large part of the output of Radios 1 and 2
and of many independent local radio stations
is popular and light music. The BBC
regularly commissions new music,
particularly by British composers, and
sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals.
Each summer it presents and broadcasts the
BBC Promenade Concerts at the Royal
Albert Hall.
Festivals
Some 650 professional arts festivals take
place in Britain each year. The Edinburgh
International Festival, featuring a wide range
of arts, is the largest of its kind in the world.
Other annual festivals held in the Scottish
capital include International Folk and Jazz
Festivals and the Film and Television
Festival, while the Mayfest, the second
largest festival in Britain, takes place in
Glasgow. Some well-known festivals
concentrating on music are the Three Choirs
Festival, which has taken place annually for
260 years in Gloucester, Worcester or
Hereford; the Cheltenham Festival, largely
devoted to contemporary British music; and
the Aldeburgh and Bath festivals. Among
others catering for a number of art forms are
the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, the
Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod,
the National Gaelic Mod in Scotland, and
the festivals in Belfast, Brighton, Buxton,
Chichester, Harrogate, Malvern, Pitlochry,
Salisbury, Windsor and York.
DRAMA
Professional Theatre
Britain is one of the world’s major centres
for theatre, and has a long and rich dramatic
tradition. There are many companies based
392
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
in London and other major cities and towns,
as well as numerous touring companies
which visit theatres, festivals and other
venues throughout Britain, including arts
and sports centres and social clubs. There
are 64 companies in receipt of subsidies from
the Arts Council; 27 of these are touring
companies. Contemporary British
playwrights who have received international
recognition include Harold Pinter, Tom
Stoppard, Alan Ayckbourn, Caryl Churchill,
Alan Bennett, Peter Shaffer and David Hare.
The musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber have
been highly successful both in Britain and
overseas. Among the best-known directors
are Sir Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian
Noble, Richard Eyre, Jonathan Miller, Terry
! Hands and Deborah Warner, while the many
British performers who enjoy international
reputations include Sir John Gielgud, Sir
Alec Guinness, Vanessa Redgrave, Sir Ian
McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Irons,
Albert Finney, Dame Judi Dench, Glenda
Jackson and Diana Rigg. British stage
designers such as John Bury, Ralph Koltai
and Carl Toms are internationally recognised.
‘West End’ theatre attendances exceeded
11 million in 1990.
Britain has about 300 theatres intended
for professional use which can seat between
200 and 2,300 people. Some are privately
owned, but most are owned either
municipally or by non-profit-distributing
organisations. Over 30 of these house
resident theatre companies receiving
subsidies from the Arts Council. London is
the main focus, with about 100 West End
and suburban theatres, 15 of them
permanently occupied by subsidised
companies. These include the Royal National
Theatre, which stages a wide range of
modern and classical plays in its three
auditoriums in the South Bank Centre; the
Royal Shakespeare Company, which presents
plays mainly by Shakespeare and his
contemporaries, as well as modern work,
both in Stratford-upon-Avon and in its two
auditoriums in the City’s Barbican Centre;
and the English Stage Company at the Royal
Court Theatre, which stages the work of
many talented new playwrights.
In 1989 the partial remains of the Globe
Theatre, where Shakespeare acted, were
excavated on the south bank of the Thames
in central London; it has since been listed as
an ancient monument. A modern
reconstruction of the Globe Theatre, on its
original site, is in progress. This is planned
to open in 1992, at the cost of £18 million.
Regional Theatres
Outside London most cities and many large
towns have at least one theatre; some, like
the Theatre Royal, Newcastle upon Tyne,
date from the eighteenth century and have
been handsomely restored. Others, like the
West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, and the
Theatre Royal, Plymouth, have been built to
the latest designs. Several universities have
theatres which house professional companies
playing to the general public. Most regional
repertory companies mount about eight to
ten productions a year; several have studio
theatres in addition to the main auditorium,
where they present new or experimental
drama and plays of specialist interest.
Repertory theatres also often function as a
social centre by offering concerts, poetry
readings and exhibitions, and by providing
restaurants, bars and theatre shops.
Successful productions from regional theatre
companies often transfer to London’s West
End, while the largest regional theatres
receive visits from the Royal National
Theatre or the Royal Shakespeare Company.
The English Shakespeare Company, a
recently formed classical company, tours
worldwide.
Theatre for Young People
A number of companies provide theatre for
young audiences. Unicorn Theatre for
Children and Polka Children’s Theatre, both
in London, present plays specially written
for young people; and the Whirligig Theatre
tours throughout Britain. The Young Vic
Company in London and Contact Theatre
Company in Manchester stage plays for
young people. Numerous Theatre-in-
Education companies perform in schools for
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
all age ranges and abilities. Some of these
companies operate independently—Theatre
Centre, for example, plays in London and
tours further afield. Others are attached to
regional repertory theatres such as the
Belgrade in Coventry and the West
Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. Most regional
repertory theatres also mount occasional
productions for younger audiences, and
concessionary ticket prices are generally
available for those at school, college or
university. There are also a number of
puppet companies.
There has been a marked growth in youth
theatres, which number more than 500 in
England alone; both the National Youth
Theatre in London and the Scottish Youth
Theatre in Glasgow offer early acting
opportunities to young people.
Dramatic Training
Training for actors, directors, lighting and
sound technicians, and stage managers is
provided mainly in drama schools. Among
the best known are the Royal Academy of
Dramatic Art, the Central School of Speech
and Drama, the London Academy of Music
and Dramatic Art, and the Drama Centre (all
in London); the Bristol Old Vic School, the
Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama (Glasgow) and the Manchester
Polytechnic School of Drama. Theatre
design courses, often based in art schools, are
available for people wanting to train as stage
designers. A number of universities,
polytechnics and other colleges offer degree
courses in drama.
Amateur Theatre
There are several thousand amateur dramatic
societies throughout Britain. Their work is
encouraged by a number of organisations,
such as the Central Council for Amateur
Theatre, the National Drama Conference,
the Scottish Community Drama Association
and the Association of Ulster Drama
Festivals. Amateur companies sometimes
receive financial support from local
government, regional arts boards and other
bodies.
MUSIC, OPERA AND DANCE
A wide range of musical interests is catered
for in Britain, ranging from classical music to
rock and pop music, the latter being
extremely popular, especially among younger
people. Folk music, jazz, light music and
brass band music also have substantial
followings.
Music
Orchestral and Choral
Seasons of orchestral and choral concerts are
promoted every year in many large towns
and cities. The principal concert-halls in
central London are the Royal Festival Hall in
the South Bank Centre, next to which are
the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room, which accommodate smaller-scale
performances; the Barbican Hall (part of the
Barbican Centre for Arts and Conferences);
the Royal Albert Hall; the Wigmore Hall, a
recital centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
A major new concert venue, the Symphony
Hall, opened in Birmingham in April 1991.
The leading symphony orchestras are the
London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony, the Philharmonia, the Royal
Philharmonic, the BBC Symphony, the
Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle
(Manchester), the City of Birmingham
Symphony, the Bournemouth Symphony,
and the Ulster and the Royal Scottish
Orchestras. The BBC’s six orchestras
provide broadcast concerts which are often
open to the public. There are also chamber
orchestras such as the English Chamber
Orchestra, the Academy of St Martin-in-the-
Fields, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta, the
Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle upon Tyne),
and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.
Specialised ensembles include the Orchestra
of the Age of Enlightenment, the English
Baroque Soloists and the English Concert.
The London Sinfonietta and the
Birmingham Contemporary Music Group
specialise in performing contemporary music.
British conductors such as Sir Colin
Davis, Sir Neville Marriner, Simon Rattle,
Andrew Davis, Jane Glover and Jeffrey Tate
394
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
reach a wide audience through their
recordings as well as by their performances.
The works of living composers such as Sir
Michael Tippett, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies
and Sir Harrison Birtwistle enjoy
international acclaim. Younger composers
include George Benjamin, Oliver Knussen,
Colin Matthews, Nigel Osborne and Robert
Saxton. The Master of the Queen’s Music,
Malcolm Williamson, holds an office within
the Royal Household with responsibility for
organising and writing music for state
occasions. Percussionist Evelyn Glennie and
violinist Nigel Kennedy are among solo
performers currently enjoying great acclaim.
The principal choral societies include the
Bach Choir, the Brighton Festival Chorus,
the Royal Choral Society, the Huddersfield
Choral Society, the Cardiff Polyphonic Choir,
the Edinburgh International Festival Chorus
and the Belfast Philharmonic Society. Almost
all the leading orchestras maintain their own
choral societies. The English tradition of
church singing is represented by choirs such
as those of King’s College Chapel,
Cambridge, and Christ Church Cathedral,
Oxford. There are many male-voice choirs in
Wales and in certain parts of England.
Pop and Rock Music
Among the characteristics of modern pop
and rock music are the diversity of styles,
the frequency with which new styles and
stars emerge, and the short lifespan of many
groups. Electric guitars and drums usually
provide the instrumental basis, but there has
been an increasing use of synthesisers, while
modern production techniques have widened
the range of music being released. In the
1960s and 1970s groups such as the Beatles,
the Rolling Stones, the Who, Led Zeppelin
and Pink Floyd achieved international
success. British groups continue to be
popular throughout the world and are often
at the forefront of new developments in
music. Some of the more recent groups
include the Cure, Iron Maiden, Fine Young
Cannibals, the Pet Shop Boys and Simple
Minds. Well-known performers include
George Michael, Phil Collins, Sting and Lisa
Stansfield. In recent years young black
musicians have further strengthened the
development of popular music.
The pop and rock music industry
continues to contribute significantly to
Britain’s overseas earnings.
jfazz
Jazz has an enthusiastic following in Britain
and is played in numerous clubs and pubs.
British musicians such as Barbara
Thompson, Stan Tracey, John Surman,
Andy Sheppard and Courtney Pine have
established strong reputations throughout
Europe. Festivals of jazz music are held
annually in Soho (London), Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Crawley (West Sussex) and at a
number of other places. Jazz Services
provides a national touring network.
Jazz FM, Britain’s first radio station
devoted exclusively to jazz, was launched in
1990. It broadcasts both live and recorded
music 24 hours a day to listeners in the
London area.
Opera and Dance
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are held
at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden,
London. The Royal Opera and Royal Ballet,
which rank among the world’s leading
companies, are supported by a permanent
orchestra. Seasons of opera in English are
given by the English National Opera at the
London Coliseum. Scottish Opera has
regular seasons at the Theatre Royal in
Glasgow, and tours mainly in Scotland and
northern England. Welsh National Opera
presents seasons in Cardiff and other cities.
Opera North, based in Leeds, tours primarily
in the north of England and Opera Factory
stages experimental work in opera and music
theatre. Opera 80 takes opera to towns
throughout England, playing in a wide range
of venues. Opera in Northern Ireland is
promoted by Opera Northern Ireland.
An opera season for which international
casts are specially assembled is held every
summer at Glyndebourne in East Sussex. This
is followed by an autumn tour by Glynde¬
bourne Touring Opera, often using casts
drawn from the chorus of the festival season.

Subsidised Dance Companies
Subsidised dance companies include: the
Birmingham (formerly Sadler’s Wells) Royal
Ballet, which tours widely in Britain and
overseas; English National Ballet, which
divides its performances between London
and the regions; Northern Ballet Theatre,
which is based in Halifax and also tours,
particularly in the north of England; and
Scottish Ballet, based in Glasgow. Also
included are Rambert Dance (Britain’s oldest
ballet company, which re-formed in 1966 as
a leading contemporary dance company);
London Contemporary Dance Theatre,
which provides regular seasons in London
besides touring extensively; Adzido Pan
African Dance Ensemble; and the KOSH,
which combines dance, theatre and
acrobatics. The Arts Council also supports
Dance Umbrella, an organisation which
promotes an annual festival of contemporary
dance. In addition, the three Arts Councils
and the regional arts boards support
individual artists and offer project grants to
several small groups.
Sir Kenneth Macmillan, David Bintley,
and Siobhan Davies are among the foremost
British choreographers, and Michael Clark
and Darcey Bussell among the leading
dancers.
Training
Professional training in music is given
mainly at colleges of music. The leading
London colleges are the Royal Academy of
Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and
Trinity College of Music. Outside London
the main centres are the Royal Scottish
Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow,
the Royal Northern College of Music in
Manchester, the Welsh College of Music and
Drama, Cardiff, and the Birmingham
Conservatoire. The National Opera Studio
provides advanced training courses.
Leading dance schools include the Royal
Ballet School, the Ballet Rambert School and
the London School of Contemporary Dance
which, with many private schools, have
helped in raising British dance to its present
standard. Dance is a subject for degree
studies at the Laban Centre (University of
London), the University of Surrey and
Darlington College of the Arts. Courses
for students intending to work with
community groups are available at three
institutions. In June 1991 the Royal Ballet
announced a scheme to widen access to
dance training for children from ethnic
minorities.
A city technology college offering studies
in drama, music and dance to pupils aged
from 13 to 18, with the emphasis on the
application of technology to the performing
arts, opened in Croydon, Surrey, in
September 1991. The capital cost of £5-9
million is being shared between the
Government (60 per cent) and the British
phonographic industry (40 per cent).
Youth and Music, an organisation
affiliated to the international Jeunesses
Musicales, encourages attendance by young
people at opera, dance and concert
performances. Special performances of
orchestral music for children include the
Robert Mayer Concerts, held in London on
Saturday mornings. Ludus Dance-in-
Education Company and Outreach (in the
north of England) work mainly with young
people. Scottish Ballet Steps Out works in
schools throughout Scotland.
Many children learn to play musical
instruments at school, and some take the
examinations of the Associated Board
of the Royal Schools of Music. Music is
one of the foundation subjects in the
National Curriculum in publicly maintained
schools in England and Wales. The National
Youth Orchestras of Great Britain, of
Scotland and of Wales and other youth
orchestras have established high standards.
Nearly a third of the players in the European
Community Youth Orchestra come from
Britain. There is also a National Youth Jazz
Orchestra.
National Youth Music Theatre, which is
based in London, gives young people
between 11 and 18 the opportunity to
perform music theatre under the guidance of
professional directors and choreographers.
All the work takes place in the school
holidays.

FILMS
British films, actors, and the creative and
technical services supporting them are widely
acclaimed in international film festivals and
other events. Besides feature films, including
co-productions with other countries, the
industry produces films for television as well
as promotional, advertising, industrial,
scientific, educational and training films.
There are approximately 1,424 cinema
screens in Britain and estimated attendances
are currently running at about 2 million a
week.
Cinema admissions in 1990 totalled 98
million—85 per cent more than in 1984.
The present resurgence in attendance figures
can be attributed partly to the rapid growth
in the rental of video films, which has
stimulated not only an interest in films
generally but also a wish to see popular
action films in their original medium. There
has been a growth in recent years in the
number of grant-aided regional film theatres
and film societies offering alternative
programmes to those of the commercial
cinema chains.
Government Support for the Film Industry
An annual government grant (£14 million for
1991-92) is made to the British Film
Institute and one of over £706,000 to the
Scottish Film Council and the Scottish Film
Production Fund. In 1990 the Government
agreed to provide £5 million over three years
to help British film producers wishing to
enter European co-production.
In May 1991 the UK Film Commission
was launched, with government funding
of £3 5 million over four years. The
Commission aims to attract film productions
from overseas by offering a service to assist
film-makers.
British Screen Finance, a private sector
company with shareholders from the film
I and television industries, provides a source of
finance for new film-makers with
commercially viable productions who have
difficulty in attracting funding. The
company, investing its own money together
with contributions from the Government,
part-finances the production of low- and
medium-budget films involving largely
British talent. With further government
funding of £2 5 million over five years from
1991, the company manages schemes to
encourage the early stages of film project
development and the production of short
films.
British Film Institute
The development of film, video and
television as art forms is promoted by the
British Film Institute (BFI), founded in
1933, and in Scotland by the Scottish Film
Council. The Institute offers direct financial
and technical help through its Film
Production Board to new and experienced
film-makers who cannot find support
elsewhere, and helps to fund film and video
workshops in liaison with the Channel Four
Television Company.
It administers the National Film Theatre
in London and the National Film Archive,
and has a library from which films and
video-cassettes may be hired. The Institute
holds extensive international collections of
books, periodicals, scripts, stills and posters.
Its Education Department aims to enable as
many people as possible to discover new
ways of producing and enjoying film, video
and television.
The National Film Archive contains over
175,000 films and television programmes,
including newsreels and other miscellaneous
items. BFI South Bank comprises the
Museum of the Moving Image, which traces
the history of film and television, and the
National Film Theatre. The latter has two
cinemas showing films of historical, artistic
or technical interest, and is unique in
offering regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations. In November
each year it mounts the London Film
Festival, at which some 160 new films from
all over the world are screened.
The British Film Institute has promoted,
and helps to fund, the development of some
32 regional film theatres, with 44 screens;
and is involved in establishing film and
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
television centres with a range of activities
and facilities in a number of major cities. It
also co-operates with the regional arts boards
and grant-aids their film activities. The
Institute received £500,000 in incentive
funding in 1989-90, which it is using to
generate a further £1 million from other
sources. It has raised some £15 million from
private sources for capital development.
The Welsh Arts Council acts as the
Institute’s agent in Wales. In Scotland the
Scottish Film Council supports regional film
theatres, administers the Scottish Film
Archive, and promotes and provides material
for media education. Together with the
Scottish Arts Council, it has set up the
Scottish Film Production Fund, which makes
grants towards film production in Scotland.
The BFI is working with the newly
established Northern Ireland Film Institute.
Grants in Northern Ireland are made by the
Arts Council of Northern Ireland. An annual
festival of film and television in the Celtic
countries is held in rotation in Scotland,
Wales, Ireland and France.
Children’s Film
The Children’s Film and Television
Foundation produces and distributes
entertainment films specially designed for
children. These are shown largely through
video and television.
Training in Film Production
The National Film and Television School,
which is financed jointly by the Government
and the film and television industry, offers
postgraduate and short course training for
directors, editors, camera operators,
animators and other specialists. Training in
film production is also given at the London
International Film School, the Royal College
of Art, and at some polytechnics and other
institutions.
Cinema Licensing and Film
Classification
Cinemas showing films to the public must be
licensed by local authorities, which have a
legal duty to prohibit the admission of
children under 16 to unsuitable films, and
may prevent the showing of any film. In
assessing the suitability of films the
authorities normally rely on the judgment of
an independent non-statutory body, the
British Board of Film Classification, to
which films offered to the public must be
submitted. The Board was set up on the
initiative of the cinema industry to ensure a
proper standard in films shown to the public.
It does not use any written code of
censorship, but can require cuts to be made
before granting a certificate; on rare
occasions, it refuses a certificate.
Films passed by the Board are put into
one of the following categories:
• U, meaning universal—suitable for all;
• PG, meaning parental guidance, in
which some scenes may be unsuitable for
young children;
• 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
12, 15 and 18 years of age respectively;
and
• Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at segregated premises to which no one
under 18 is admitted—for example,
licensed cinema clubs.
Videos
The British Board of Film Classification is
also legally responsible for classifying videos.
The system of classification is similar to that
for films. It is an offence to supply
commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of
its classification—for example, to sell or hire
a video classified 18 to a person under the
age of 18.
VISUAL ARTS
State support for the visual arts consists
largely of maintenance and purchase grants
for the national museums and galleries,
purchase grants for municipal museums and
galleries, and funding through local
authorities, the Museums and Galleries
Commission and the area museum councils
(see p 399). It also includes funding for
398
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
living artists channelled through the Arts
Councils, the Crafts Council and the regional
arts boards, and grants towards the cost of
art education. The Government encourages
high standards of industrial design and
craftsmanship through grants to the Design
Council.
All national museums and galleries are
financed chiefly from government funds.
They may levy entrance charges to their
permanent collections, special exhibitions and
outstations at their discretion. Government
policy is to give priority to the conservation
of the buildings and collections of the
national institutions rather than to increase
purchase grants for acquisitions. All the
national collections are managed by
independent trustees.
Museums and art galleries maintained by
local authorities, universities and private
benefactions may receive help in building up
their collections through annual government
grants administered by the Museums and
Galleries Commission (for England and
Wales) and the Scottish Museums Council.
Financial and practical assistance to both
national and local museums and galleries is
also given by the Arts Council and by trusts
and voluntary bodies, including the Calouste
Gulbenkian Foundation, the National Art-
Collections Fund and the Contemporary Art
Society.
Pre-eminent works of art accepted by the
Government in place of inheritance tax are
allocated to public galleries. Financial help
may be available from the National Heritage
Memorial Fund, which was allocated
£3 million by the Government in 1990-91.
In recent years the Fund has made important
contributions towards pictures bought by the
Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester City Art
Galleries, and by the national galleries and
museums.
In co-operation with regional arts boards,
the Arts Council makes grants towards the
public display of the visual arts, especially
contemporary and experimental works, and
the publication of books and magazines. It
also encourages the commissioning of works
of art in public places. The South Bank
Board maintains a collection of contemporary
British art and organises touring exhibitions
throughout the country on behalf of the Arts
Council. The Council supports a number of
art and photography galleries in London,
including the Hayward Gallery, Serpentine
Gallery, Photographers’ Gallery and
Whitechapel Art Gallery; and in the regions,
the Arnolfini in Bristol and the Museum of
Modern Art in Oxford. It also provides
support for artists and photographers
through purchasing and commissioning
fellowships and residencies. Similar support
is given by the Scottish Arts Council to
galleries in Scotland such as the Fruitmarket
Gallery in Edinburgh. The Welsh and
Northern Ireland Arts Councils have galleries
in Cardiff and Belfast respectively.
A number of modern British sculptors
and painters have international reputations,
and have received international prizes and
commissions for major works in foreign
cities. Among the best known are Francis
Bacon, David Hockney, Lucian Freud,
Eduardo Paolozzi and Elizabeth Frink.
Museums and Art Galleries
A major expansion in the number of
museums is taking place and many are
introducing new display techniques that
attract increasing numbers of visitors. About
100 million people a year attend some 2,500
museums and galleries open to the public,
which include the major national collections
and a wide variety of municipally and
independently or privately owned
institutions. Government provision for
museums and galleries is £248 million in
1991-92. The Museums and Galleries
Improvement Fund, which is jointly financed
by the Government and the Wolfson
Charities, is providing an annual budget of
£4 million over the three years from 1991-92
for renovating and improving galleries,
focusing on priority work which museums
are unable to fund fully from their own
resources. The British Museum, the Royal
Museum of Scotland, the Manchester
Museum of Science, the Walker Art Gallery
in Liverpool and the Science Museum have
all received refurbishment awards.
The Government takes advice on policy
matters from the Museums and Galleries
399
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Commission. The Commission also promotes
co-operation between national and provincial
institutions. Nine area museum councils
supply technical services and advice on
conservation, display, documentation and
publicity.
The Government encourages the loan of
objects from national and provincial
museums and gallery collections so that
works of art can be seen by as wide a public
as possible. It provides funds for promoting
the touring of exhibitions and for facilitating
the loan of items between institutions.
The Museum Training Institute is
responsible for developing training standards
and programmes.
Museums Association
The independent Museums Association, to
which many museums and art galleries and
their staffs belong, and which has many
overseas members, facilitates exchange of
information and discussion of matters
relating to museums and galleries. It
provides training, seminar, research and
publishing programmes. Its subsidiary,
Museum Enterprises, provides consultancy
services to museums and galleries in
planning, trading and recruitment.
National Collections
The national museums and art galleries, most
of which are located in London, contain
some of the world’s most comprehensive
collections of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and
general interest. They are the British
Museum (including the Museum of
Mankind), the Natural History Museum, the
Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A), the
Science Museum, the National Gallery, the
Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery,
the Imperial War Museum, the National
Army Museum, the Royal Air Force
Museum, the National Maritime Museum,
the Wallace Collection, the Geological
Museum and a group of museums and
galleries on Merseyside. An extension to the
National Gallery, the Sainsbury Wing,
opened in July 1991. A gift from the
Sainsbury family, it provides a venue for
major international touring exhibitions and
other events.
Some of the museums in London have
branches in the regions, examples being the
National Railway Museum (York) and the
National Museum of Photography, Film and
Television (Bradford), which are part of the
Science Museum. The V&A plans to open a
branch in Bradford. The Tate Gallery opened
a branch in Liverpool in 1988, and is planning
to open another in St Ives, Cornwall.
Some of the national museums’ and
galleries’ recent acquisitions include:
• five nineteenth-century French
paintings by Monet, Corot, Jongkind,
Boudin and Renoir—National
Gallery;
• collection of foreign artillery
equipment and medals—Imperial
War Museum;
• Egyptian red granite sarcophagus—
British Museum; and
• Standing by the Rags by Lucian
Freud—Tate Gallery.  
In Scotland the national collections are
held by the National Museums of Scotland
and the National Galleries of Scotland. The
National Museums of Scotland include the
Royal Museum of Scotland and the Scottish
United Services Museum, both in
Edinburgh; the Museum of Flight, near
North Berwick; the Scottish Agricultural
Museum, at Ingliston; and the Shambellie
House Museum of Costume, near Dumfries.
A new Museum of Scotland is to be built
next to the Royal Museum to house the
National Museums’ Scottish collection. The
National Galleries of Scotland comprise the
National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery and the Scottish
National Gallery of Modern Art.
The National Museum of Wales (where a
major expansion scheme is in progress), in
Cardiff, has a branch at St Fagan’s Castle,
where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed; an
Industrial and Maritime Museum in
Cardiff s dockland; the Museum of the
Woollen Industry at Drefach Felindre; and
400
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
the Slate Museum at Llanberis. Northern
Ireland has two national museums: the Ulster
Museum in Belfast and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum in County Down.
Other Collections
Other important collections in London
include the Royal Armouries in the Tower of
London, the Museum of London, Sir John
Soane’s Museum, the Courtauld collection
and the London Transport Museum. The
Queen’s Gallery in Buckingham Palace has
exhibitions of pictures from the extensive
royal collections.
Most cities and towns have museums
devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually administered by the local
authorities but sometimes by local learned
societies or by individuals or trustees. Both
Oxford and Cambridge are rich in museums.
Many are associated with their universities,
such as the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford
(founded in 1683—the oldest in the world),
and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.
Many private art collections in historic
family mansions, including those owned by
the National Trusts, are open to the public,
while an increasing number of open air
museums depict the regional life of an area
or preserve early industrial remains. These
include the Weald and Downland Museum
in West Sussex, the North of England Open
Air Museum in Durham, and the
Ironbridge Gorge Museum in Shropshire.
Skills of the past are revived in a number
of ‘living’ museums like the Gladstone
Pottery Museum near Stoke-on-Trent
and the Quarry Bank Mill at Styal in
Cheshire.
Among the newest museums are the
National Horseracing Museum at
Newmarket; the Jorvik Viking Centre, a
reconstruction of the Viking settlement in
York; a new maritime museum in
Portsmouth, housing the restored wreck of
the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII,
which sank in 1545 and was raised in 1982;
and Catalyst: Museum of the Chemical
Industry, at Widnes, Cheshire. The Burrell
Collection in Glasgow houses world-famous
tapestries, paintings and objets d'art. The
Design Museum opened in London’s
Docklands in 1990. It houses exhibits
charting changes in design and technology.
Apart from their permanent collections,
most museums and galleries stage temporary
exhibitions on particular themes. There are
also a number of national art exhibiting
societies, the most famous being the Royal
Academy of Arts at Burlington House. The
Academy holds an annual Summer
Exhibition, where the works of hundreds of
professional and amateur artists can be seen,
and important exhibitions during the rest of
the year. The Royal Scottish Academy holds
annual exhibitions in Edinburgh. There are
also children’s exhibitions, including the
National Exhibition of Children’s Art.
Crafts
Government aid for the crafts, amounting to
just over £2-5 million in 1991-92, is
administered in England and Wales by the
Crafts Council. The Council supports
craftsmen and women by promoting interest
in their work, making it accessible to the
public and encouraging the creation and
appreciation of articles of contemporary
craftsmanship. Grants are available to help
with setting up workshops and acquiring
equipment. The Council arranges
exhibitions, crafts fairs and seminars, and
circulates information. It also runs a gallery
in London and a crafts shop at the Victoria
and Albert Museum. Funding is given to the
Welsh Arts Council and the regional arts
boards in England for the support of crafts,
and to Contemporary Applied Art, a
membership organisation that holds
exhibitions and sells work through its
London gallery.
New arrangements for the support of
crafts in Scotland came into effect in April
1991. A wide range of commercial services is
now provided by a company, Made in
Scotland, while training and business
development support is provided by two new
government-funded bodies, Scottish
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, each with a network of local
enterprise companies led by the private
sector.
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Training in Art and Design
Most practical education in art and design is
provided in colleges of art (among the best
known of which are the Slade School and
the Royal College of Art, both in London),
further education colleges and private art
schools. Degrees at postgraduate level are
awarded by the Royal College of Art. Art is
also taught at an advanced level at the four
Scottish Central (Art) Institutions.
Courses at universities and polytechnics
concentrate largely on academic disciplines
such as the history of art. The leading
institutions include the Courtauld and
Warburg Institutes of the University of
London and the Department of Classical Art
and Archaeology at University College,
London. Art is one of the foundation
subjects in the National Curriculum in
publicly maintained schools in England and
Wales; and the Society for Education
through Art encourages, among other
activities, the purchase by schools of original
works of art by organising an annual Pictures
for Schools exhibition.
The Open College of the Arts offers
correspondence courses in art and design,
painting, sculpture, textiles, photography and
creative writing to people wishing to study at
home.
The Art Market
London is a major centre for the
international art market, and sales of works
of art take place in the main auction houses
(two of the longest established being
Sotheby’s and Christie’s), and through
private dealers. Certain items are covered by
export control. These are as follows:
• works of art and collectors’ items over 50
years old and worth £20,000 or more
(£5,000 or more in the case of British
historical portraits);
• photographic material over 50 years old
and valued at £500 or more an item; and
• documents, manuscripts and archives
over 50 years old, irrespective of value.
A licence from the Department of Trade
and Industry is required before such items
can be exported. If the Department’s
advisers recommend withholding a licence,
the matter is referred to the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art.
If the Committee considers a work to be of
national importance it can advise the
Government to withhold the export licence
for a specified time to give a public museum,
art gallery, or private collector an
opportunity to buy at a fair price.
LITERATURE AND LIBRARIES
A number of literary activities receive public
subsidy through the Arts Council of Great
Britain. In 1990, for example, the Council
sponsored its first writer’s tour, and
contributed to an innovative television series
on modern poetry. It continued to foster an
interest in writing from diverse cultures
through its support for translations and the
black Sound archive.
There are free public libraries throughout
Britain, private libraries and several private
literary societies. Book reviews are featured
in the press and on television and radio, and
numerous periodicals concerned with
literature are published. Recognition of
outstanding literary merit is provided by a
number of awards, some of the most valuable
being the Booker, National Cash Register
and Whitbread prizes. Awards to encourage
young writers include those of the Somerset
Maugham Trust Fund and the E. C. Gregory
Trust Fund. Many British writers are
internationally recognised and in 1983 the
Nobel prize for literature was awarded to the
novelist Sir William Golding. Other well-
known living authors include Sir Kingsley
Amis, Anthony Burgess, Penelope Lively and
Fay Weldon. Distinguished British poets
include Ted Hughes, the Poet Laureate, who
writes verse to mark royal occasions;
Geoffrey Hill; Tony Harrison; James Berry;
Gavin Ewart; and Elizabeth Jennings.
Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic1
works, films, sound recordings and
broadcasts are automatically protected in
402
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
Britain. This protection is given to foreign
works under the terms of international
conventions.1 The copyright owner has rights
against unauthorised reproduction, public
performance, broadcasting and issue to the
public of his or her work; and against dealing
in unauthorised copies. In most cases the
author is the first owner of the copyright,
and the term of copyright is the life of the
author and a period of 50 years after death
(50 years from the year of release for films
and sound recordings and 50 years from the
year of broadcast for broadcasts).
The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988 reformed and restated copyright law
and introduced the concept of moral rights,
whereby authors have the right to be
identified on their works and to object to
derogatory treatment of them. The Act
introduced a statutory framework of civil
rights to protect performers against making
and trading in unauthorised recordings of
live performance, the term of protection for
these rights being 50 years from the year in
which the performance is given.
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association and the Royal Society of
Literature. The leading society for studies in
the humanities is the British Academy for
the Promotion of Historical, Philosophical
and Philological Studies (the British
Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several societies devoted to
particular authors, the largest of which is the
Dickens Fellowship. Various societies, such
as the Poetry Society, sponsor poetry
readings and recitals.
Libraries
The British Library
The British Library, the national library of
Britain, is one of the world’s greatest
1 All countries which are members of the Berne Copyright
Convention, the Universal Copyright Convention and the Rome
Convention are obliged to protect works of British origin.
libraries. Its collections comprise over 18
million items—monographs, manuscripts,
maps, newspapers, patents, stamps and
recorded sound. Publishers must deposit
there a copy of most items published or
available in Britain.
The National Bibliographic Service
processes material legally deposited at the
Library for inclusion in catalogues and
maintains a machine-readable database of
bibliographical records from which is derived
the British National Bibliography (a list of
new and forthcoming British books) and a
range of automated bibliographical services.
The Research and Development
Department is a major source of funding for
research and development in library and
information services.
The Library’s Document Supply Centre
at Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the
national centre for inter-library lending
within Britain and between Britain and
countries overseas. It supplies 3 5 million
requests a year, mostly from its own stock of
7 million documents.
In 1990 the Library set up the self-
supporting Centre for the Book, to promote
awareness of books and their role in British
life, past and present.
The Library’s new London headquarters
at St Pancras is being built at a cost of £450
million, and will be open to the public from
1993. It will provide reading rooms for most
of the Library’s London-based collections—
humanities, science, technology and
industry—and also specialist reading areas.
The new Library aims to offer greatly
improved services, including exhibition
galleries, a bookshop, a lecture theatre and a
conference centre.
Other Libraries
The National Libraries of Scotland and
Wales, the Bodleian Library of Oxford
University and the Cambridge University
Library can also claim copies of all new
British publications under legal deposit. The
first phase of a new building for the National
Library of Scotland was opened in 1989.
Costing £11-5 million, it provides 49 km (30
miles) of storage shelving and accommodates
403
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
a map library, lending services and the
Scottish Science Library. Work on the
second stage began in late 1990, for
completion in 1994.
Some of the national museums and
government departments have important
libraries. The Public Record Office in
London and in Kew, Surrey, contains the
records of the superior courts of law and of
most government departments, as well as
famous historical documents. The Scottish
Record Office in Edinburgh serves the same
purpose.
Besides a number of great private
collections, such as that of the London
Library, there are the rich resources of the
learned societies and institutions. Examples
are the libraries of the Royal Institute of
International Affairs, the Commonwealth
Trust, the Royal Geographical Society, the
Royal Academy of Music, the National
Library for the Blind and the Book Trust.
The Poetry Library, owned by the Arts
Council, is a national collection of twentieth
century poetry written in or translated into
English.
University Libraries
The university libraries of Oxford and
Cambridge are unmatched by those of the
more recent foundations. However, the
combined library resources of the colleges
and institutions of the University of London
total 9 million volumes, the John Rylands
University Library in Manchester contains
3-4 million volumes, Edinburgh 2 million,
Leeds L8 million, and Birmingham,
Glasgow, Liverpool and Aberdeen each have
over 1 million volumes. Many universities
have important research collections in special
subjects; examples include the Barnes
Medical Library at Birmingham and the
British Library of Political and Economic
Science at the London School of Economics.
Special Libraries
Numerous associations and commercial and
industrial organisations run library and
information services. Although most are
primarily intended for use within the
organisation, many special libraries can be
used, by arrangement, by people interested
in the area covered, and the specialist
publications held are often available for
inter-library lending.
Public Libraries
Local authorities have a duty to provide a
free lending and reference library service in
their areas, and Britain’s network of libraries
has a total stock of about 156-7 million
books. Over half of the total population are
members of public libraries. Some areas are
served by mobile libraries, and domiciliary
services cater for people unable to visit a
library. Many libraries have collections of
records, audio- and video-cassettes, and
musical scores for loan to the public, while a
number also lend from collections of works
of art, which may be originals or
reproductions. Most libraries hold documents
on local history, and nearly all provide
children’s departments, while reference and
information sections and art, music,
commercial and technical departments meet
the growing and more specific demands in
these fields. The information role is one of
increasing importance for many libraries, and
greater use is being made of information
technology, including microcomputers and
reference databases.
The Government remains committed to
providing a free basic library service—the
borrowing and consultation of books and
other printed materials—but believes there is
scope for greater private sector involvement.
Since 1988 it has made available £250,000 a
year through an incentive funding scheme to
encourage new developments and increase
efficiency in public library services in
England. Priority is given to projects
involving collaboration with other libraries
and the private sector.
Public library authorities charge for some
services, such as research services and the
lending of non-printed materials, including
cassettes and records.
The Public Lending Right Scheme gives
registered authors the right to receive
payment from a central fund (totalling £4 75
million in 1991-92) for the use of their books
404
PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
borrowed from public libraries. Payment is
made in proportion to the number of times
the authors’ books are lent out.
The Government is advised on library
and information matters by four library and
information services councils or committees,
representing England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
The Library Association
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information services. Founded in
1877, the Association has 24,000 members
working in all kinds of libraries and
information units. It maintains a Register of
Chartered Librarians and publishes books,
pamphlets and an official journal.
The Library Association is the designated
authority for the recognition of qualifications
gained in other member states of the
European Community.
Historical Manuscripts
The Royal Commission on Historical
Manuscripts is the central investigatory and
advisory body on manuscripts, records and
archives other than the public records. It
maintains the National Register of Archives
and advises owners, custodians and
government, assists researchers and co¬
ordinates the activities of bodies working in
the field. It also publishes a series of Guides
to Sources for British History.
The National Manuscripts Conservation
Trust was established in 1989 with
government assistance of £300,000. It
provides grants to record offices, libraries
and other owners of manuscripts and
archives accessible to the public.
Books
In 1990 British publishers issued nearly
64,000 separate titles, of which about 48,000
were new titles and the remainder reprints
and new editions. The British publishing
industry devotes much effort to developing
overseas markets, and in 1990 the value of
exports of British books amounted to £700
million. The industry is also noted for its
interest in new technological developments,
including electronic publishing and the
development of software for educational and
other purposes.
Among the leading organisations
representing publishing and distribution
interests are the Publishers Association,
which has 170 members, representing over
450 separate publishing companies; and the
Booksellers’ Association, with 3,300
members. The Publishers Association,
through its associated body the Book
Development Council, promotes the export
of British books worldwide.
The British Council (see p 392) publicises
British books through its 116 libraries
overseas, participation in international book
fairs and a programme of travelling
exhibitions. The Council also publishes a
monthly periodical, British Book News.
The Book Trust, whose membership
includes authors, publishers, booksellers,
librarians and readers, encourages an interest
in books and arranges exhibitions throughout
Britain.

24 The Press
More daily newspapers, national and
regional, are sold per person in Britain than
in most other developed countries.
Three out of four adults regularly read a
paid-for regional or local newspaper as well
as a free local paper. National papers have a
total circulation of 13 9 million on weekdays
and 16 6 million on Sundays, though the
total readership is considerably greater.
There are about 160 daily (Monday to
Saturday) and Sunday newspapers, over
2,000 weekly paid-for and free newspapers
(including business, sporting and religious
newspapers) and 6,700 periodical
publications.
On an average day two out of three
people over the age of 15 read a national
morning newspaper; about three out of
four read a Sunday newspaper.
There is no state control or censorship of
the press, but it is subject to the general laws
on publication (see p 416). Following the
‘Calcutt Report’ on privacy and the press
(see p 415), the Press Complaints
Commission was set up by the newspaper
industry in what is seen as a final attempt to
make self-regulation of the press work
properly. The report also proposed that in
certain circumstances physical intrusion into
privacy by journalists should be unlawful
(see p 415). These measures were prompted
by growing criticism of press standards, with
allegations of unjustified invasion of privacy
and inaccurate and biased reporting, among
other abuses, resulting in calls for increased
government regulation of the press.
The press caters for a variety of political
views, interests and levels of education.
Newspapers are almost always financially
independent of any political party. Where
they express pronounced views and show
obvious political leanings in their editorial
comments, these derive from proprietorial
and other non-party influences. Nevertheless,
during general election campaigns many
newspapers recommend their readers to vote
for a particular political party. Even
newspapers which adopt strong political
views in their editorial columns include
feature and other types of articles by authors
of a variety of political persuasions. In order
to preserve their character and traditions,
some newspapers and periodicals are
governed by trustee-type arrangements.
Others have management arrangements to
ensure their editors’ authority and
independence.
In recent years working practices
throughout the newspaper industry have
undergone profound changes in response to
the challenges posed by computer-based
technology and the need to contain costs.
Newsprint, about three-quarters of which is
imported, forms about a quarter of average
national newspaper costs; labour represents
over half. In addition to sales, many
newspapers and periodicals derive
considerable earnings from their advertising.
Total yearly spending of around £2,900
million on newspaper advertising makes
newspapers by far the largest advertising
medium in Britain. Unlike most of its
European counterparts the British press
receives no subsidies and relatively few tax
and postal concessions.
In discussions on a ‘new world
information and communication order’
Britain has opposed measures designed to
increase governmental regulation of the
media or limit the free flow of information.
At the same time, it has reaffirmed its
willingness to support efforts to improve
communications systems in the developing
world.

THE PRESS
Newspaper Ownership
Ownership of the national, London and
regional daily newspapers is concentrated in
the hands of a number of large press
publishing groups. The groups controlling
the national press are listed in Table 24.1.
There are, in addition, some 350
independent regional and local newspaper
publishers.
Although most enterprises are organised
as limited liability companies, individual and
partner proprietorship survives. The large
national newspaper and periodical publishers
are major corporations with interests ranging
over the whole field of publishing and
communications. Some have shares in
independent television and radio companies,
while others are involved in industrial and
commercial activities.
The law provides safeguards against the
risks inherent in undue concentration of the
means of communication. It is unlawful to
transfer a newspaper or newspaper assets to a
proprietor whose newspapers have an average
daily circulation amounting, with that of the
newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or
more copies without government consent.
Except in certain limited cases, consent may
be given only after the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry has referred the matter
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
and received its report.
If it appears that newspaper shareholdings
in independent television or independent
local radio companies have led or are leading
to results contrary to the public interest, the
Independent Television Commission and the
Radio Authority (which regulate commercial
television and radio) can, with the consent of
the Home Secretary, notify the companies
that their programmes may cease to be
transmitted. There are additional controls
over newspaper interests in cable television
services.
The Broadcasting Act 1990 (see p 420)
introduced further ownership rules to curtail
cross-media ownership. Under the Act,
national newspapers are only allowed a 20
per cent stake in direct broadcasting by
satellite channels, television Channels 3 and
5, and national and local radio.
The National Press
Twelve morning daily papers and ten
Sunday papers (see Table 24.1) circulate
throughout most parts of Britain, and are
known as national newspapers. Formerly
they were produced in or near Fleet Street
in London with, in some cases, northern
editions being printed in Manchester. All of
the national papers have now moved their
editorial and printing facilities to other parts
of London (including the Docklands) or
away from the capital altogether; some use
contract printing. Today is printed at Poyle
(Middlesex) and Manchester. The
Independent uses printing presses in
Bradford, Northampton and Portsmouth.
Scottish editions of The Sun, The Times,
News of the World and The Sunday Times
are printed in Glasgow.
In order to improve distribution and
sales overseas, editions of the Financial
Times are printed in Frankfurt, Roubaix
(northern France), New Jersey and Tokyo,
while The Guardian prints an international
edition in Frankfurt. In 1990 Mirror Group
Newspapers began publishing The European,
a weekly English-language international
newspaper. It is printed in Britain, France,
Germany and Hungary.
Several newspapers have had very long
and distinguished histories. For example,
The Observer, first published in 1791, is the
oldest national Sunday newspaper in the
world, and The Times, one of the most
influential newspapers and Britain’s oldest
daily national newspaper, began publication
in 1785.
National newspapers are often thought of
as either ‘quality’ or ‘popular’ papers on the
basis of differences in style and content. Five
dailies and four Sundays are usually
described as quality newspapers. Quality
papers are directed at readers who want full
information on a wide range of public
matters and are prepared to spend a
considerable amount of time reading them.
Popular newspapers appeal to people wanting
news of a more entertaining character,
presented in a more concise form and with
ample illustrations. At present, all quality
papers are broadsheet in format and all
409
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
popular papers, with the exception of the
Sunday Express, tabloid.
Many newspapers are printed in colour
and a number produce colour magazines as
part of the Saturday or Sunday paper.
Several of the Sunday newspapers, and some
of the dailies on Saturday, publish
supplements with articles on travel, food and
wine, and other leisure topics. The leading
Scottish papers, The Scotsman and the
Glasgow Herald, have considerable
circulations outside Scotland.
There is a growing market for news and
information in the electronic media, and
quality papers like the Financial Times
provide material for use on databases and
videotext services such as Prestel. The Times
supplies a news service to British Sky
Broadcasting, a direct broadcasting by
satellite (DBS) company under the same
ownership.
The total circulation of national
newspapers amounted to 32 million in 1990,
compared with 33 5 million in 1980. Sales of
quality papers have risen by 10 per cent
since 1986, while the popular press has
experienced a fall of 8 per cent.
Regional Newspapers
England
Outside London around 70 morning or
evening dailies and Sundays and several
hundred newspapers appearing once or twice
a week provide mainly regional and local
news. The daily newspapers also cover
national and international affairs. Generally,
regional evening newspapers are non¬
political, while the morning newspapers
adopt a more positive political stance and
tend to be independent or conservative in
outlook.
Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post
(Leeds), the Northern Echo (Darlington) and
the Eastern Daily Press (Norwich) each have
a circulation of over 85,000, and two
provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun
(Newcastle upon Tyne) and the Sunday
Mercury (Birmingham)—sell 117,000 and
151,000 copies respectively. Circulation
figures of evening papers start at about
10,000 and most are in the 20,000 to 100,000
range. Those with much larger sales include
the Manchester Evening News (255,000), the
Birmingham Evening Mail (220,000),
Wolverhampton’s Express and Star (236,000)
and the Liverpool Echo (194,000). Paid
weekly papers are of mainly local appeal and
are a valuable medium for local advertising.
Most have circulations in the 5,000 to 60,000
range.
London has one evening newspaper, the
Evening Standard, with a circulation of
502,000. It contains national and
international news as well as coverage of
local affairs. A number of evening
newspapers are published in the outer
metropolitan area. Local weeklies include
papers for every district in Greater London,
often in the form of local editions of an
individual paper.
Wales
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the
Western Mail, published in Cardiff, with a
circulation of 74,000 throughout Wales. In
north Wales the Daily Post, published in
Liverpool, gives wide coverage to events in
the area. A new Sunday newspaper—Wales on
Sunday—also published in Cardiff, was
launched in 1989. It has a circulation of
46,000. Evening papers published in Wales
are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff; the South
Wales Argus, Newport; the South Wales
Evening Post, Swansea; and the Evening
Leader, Wrexham. Their circulation range is
between 30,000 and 83,000. North Wales is
also served by the Liverpool Echo, and the
Shropshire Star covers parts of north and mid-
Wales. There is also coverage to a smaller
extent by the Manchester Evening News.
The weekly press (82 publications)
includes English-language papers, some of
which carry articles in Welsh; bilingual
papers; and Welsh-language papers. Welsh
community newspapers receive an annual
grant as part of the Government’s wider
financial support for the Welsh language.
Scotland
Scotland has six morning, six evening and
four Sunday newspapers. Local weekly
410
THE PRESS
newspapers number 110 and there are 59
free local papers. The daily morning papers,
with circulations of between 85,000 and
778,000, are The Scotsman (published in
Edinburgh); the Glasgow Herald', the Daily
Record (sister paper of the Daily Mirror)', the
Dundee Courier and Advertiser, the Aberdeen
Press and Journal, and the Scottish Daily
Express (printed in Manchester). The daily
evening papers have circulations in the range
of 11,000 to 167,000 and are the Evening
News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s Evening
Times, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph,
Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily
Express and the Greenock Telegraph.
The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail,
the Sunday Post, the Scottish Sunday Express
(printed in Manchester); and a quality
broadsheet paper, Scotland on Sunday,
launched in 1988. The national Sunday
newspapers The Observer and The Sunday
Times carry Scottish supplements.
Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland has two morning
newspapers, one evening and three Sunday
papers, all published in Belfast, with
circulations ranging from 22,000 to 133,000.
They are the News Letter (unionist), the Irish
News (nationalist), the evening Belfast
Telegraph, the Sunday News, Sunday Life and
Sunday World (Northern Ireland edition).
The News Letter, established in 1737, is
the oldest English-language newspaper
in the world.
There are about 45 weeklies. Newspapers
from the Irish Republic, as well as the
British national press, are widely read in
Northern Ireland.
Free Distribution Newspapers
More than 1,150 free distribution
newspapers, mostly weekly and financed by
advertising, are published in Britain; over
half of them are produced by established
newspaper publishers. They have enjoyed
rapid growth in recent years and now have
an estimated total weekly circulation of about
42 million.
Ethnic Minority Publications
Some 100 newspapers and magazines are
produced in Britain by members of the
ethnic minorities. They are mainly published
weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Two Chinese
newspapers, Sing Tao and Wen Wei Po, the
Urdu Daily Jang (see below) and the Arabic
Al-Arab are dailies.
The Asian Times and Indiamail are
English language titles for people of Asian
descent, published weekly; the Sikh
Messenger and Sikh Courier are both
produced quarterly. Afro-Caribbean
newspapers include The Weekly Gleaner, a
local edition of the long-established Jamaican
Gleaner, and West Indian Digest. The Voice
and Caribbean Times, both weeklies, are
aimed at the black population in general, as
is the monthly magazine Root.
Leading ethnic language newspapers in
Britain include the Urdu Daily Jang, an
offshoot of the largest circulation paper in
Pakistan, and the weekly Gujarat Samachar,
a Gujarati tabloid. Publications also appear in
Bengali (such as the weeklies Jagoran and
Janomot)', in Hindi (the weeklies Amar Deep,
Hind Samachar and Navin Weekly)', and in
Punjabi (such as the weeklies Des Perdes and
Punjab Darpan and the monthlies Rachna
and Perdesan).
British provincial newspaper groups
are examining the possibility of printing
special editions for their local populations.
In 1989 the Leicester Mercury started
publishing a daily Asian edition,
incorporating news from the South Asian
sub-continent.
The Periodical Press
The 6,700 periodical publications are
classified as ‘consumer general interest’,
‘special interest’ and ‘business-to-business’.
There are also several hundred ‘house
magazines’ produced by industrial
undertakings, business houses or public
services for the benefit of their employees
and/or clients. Directories and similar
publications number more than 2,200. The
‘alternative’ press comprises a large number
of titles, many of them devoted to radical
411
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
politics, community matters, religion, the
occult, science or ecology.
Consumer general and specialist
periodicals comprise magazines for a wide
range of interests. These include women’s
magazines; publications for children;
religious periodicals; fiction magazines;
magazines dealing with sport, motoring,
gardening, teenage interests and pop music;
hobbies, humour and retirement; and
computer magazines. Also included are the
publications of learned societies, trade
unions, regiments, universities and other
organisations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest
sales have traditionally been Radio Times and
TV Times, which carry full details of all the
coming week’s television and radio
programmes, including the satellite
schedules. The Radio Times/ TV Times
listings duopoly came to an end in March
1991, and the advent of competition has led
to a reduction in the circulation figures of
both magazines. Rival publications include
TV Quick and What’s on TV. Of monthly
magazines Reader’s Digest has the highest
circulation (15 million).
Woman’s Weekly, Woman’s Own, Woman,
Weekly News (which sells mainly in
Scotland), Woman’s Realm and My Weekly
have circulations in the 450,000 to 1 million
range. A new magazine aimed at young
women, Me, first appeared in 1989 and has a
circulation of 715,000. In recent years several
women’s magazines from overseas have
achieved large circulations: Pnma and Best,
for instance, each sell over 650,000 copies,
while Bella and Hello! are also widely read.
Smash Hits, with a circulation of 443,000, is
a fortnightly magazine dealing with pop
music and teenage life styles. Viz, a cartoon
comic aimed at young adults, sells
11 million copies.
The leading journals of opinion include
The Economist, an independent conservative
publication covering a wider range of topics
than its title implies. The New Statesman and
Society reviews social issues, politics,
literature and the arts from an independent
socialist point of view, and the Spectator
covers similar subjects from an independent
conservative standpoint. Tribune represents
certain left-wing views within the Labour
Party.
New Scientist reports on science and
technology in terms that the non-specialist
can understand. Punch, traditionally the
leading humorous periodical, and Private
Eye, a satirical fortnightly, also cover public
affairs. Weekly ‘listings’ magazines, including
Time Out and City Limits, provide details of
cultural and other events in London and
other large cities.
Literary and political journals, and those
specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, appear monthly or
quarterly, and generally appeal to the more
academically-oriented reader. Business,
scientific and professional journals,
publication of which ranges from twice
weekly to quarterly, are an important aspect
of British publishing and business
communication, many having a considerable
circulation overseas. There are about 4,500
publications covering business and industrial
affairs.
New Printing Technology
The heavy production costs of newspapers
and periodicals continue to encourage
publishers to look for ways of reducing these
costs, often by using advanced computer
systems to control editing and production
processes. The ‘front end’ or ‘single stroking’
system, for example, allows journalists or
advertising staff to input ‘copy’ directly into
a video terminal, and then to transform it
automatically into computer-set columns of
type. Although it is possible for these
columns to be assembled electronically on a
page-sized screen, turned into a full page,
and made automatically into a plate ready for
transfer to the printing press, at present very
few such systems are in operation. Most
involve the production of bromides from the
computer setting, which are pasted up into
columns before being placed in a plate¬
making machine.
The most advanced systems present
opportunities for reorganisation which have
implications throughout a newspaper office
and may give rise to industrial relations
problems. Generally, and most recently in
412
THE PRESS
the case of national newspapers, the
introduction of computerised systems has led
to substantial reductions in workforces,
particularly, but not solely, among print
workers.
All the national newspapers utilise
computer technology, and its use in the
provincial press, which has generally led the
way in adopting new techniques, is
widespread. Journalists type articles directly
into, and edit them on, computer terminals;
colour pictures and graphics are entered into
the same system electronically. Where
printing plants are some distance from
editorial offices, pages for printing are sent
by facsimile machine from typesetter to print
plant. Other technological developments
include the use of full-colour printing, and a
switch from traditional letterpress printing
to the web-offset litho or plastic-plate
processes.
News International, publisher of three
daily and two Sunday papers, has at its
London Docklands headquarters more than
500 computer terminals, one of the largest
systems installed at one time anywhere in the
world. The Financial Times opened a new
printing plant in the Docklands in 1988
with about 200 production workers,
compared with the 650 employed at its
former printing facility in the City of
London. The new Docklands plant of the
Associated Newspapers Group uses
flexography, a rubber-plate process. Other
national papers have also moved into new
computer-based printing plants outside Fleet
Street.
News Agencies
The principal news agencies in Britain are
Reuters, an international news organisation
registered in London, the Press Association
and Extel Financial.
Reuters
Reuters is a publicly owned company,
employing 10,800 full-time staff in 78
countries. It has 1,170 staff journalists and
photographers. The company serves
subscribers in 128 countries, including
financial institutions; commodities houses;
traders in currencies, equities and bonds;
major corporations; government agencies;
news agencies; newspapers; and radio and
television stations.
Reuters has developed the world’s most
extensive private leased communications
network to transmit its services. It provides
the media with general, political, economic,
financial and sports news, news pictures and
graphics, and television news. Services for
business clients comprise constantly updated
price information and news, historical
information, facilities for computerised
trading; and the supply of communications
and other equipment for financial dealing
rooms. Information is distributed through
video terminals and teleprinters. Reuters is
the major shareholder in Visnews, a
television news agency whose service is
estimated to reach 1,500 million viewers
every day.
Press Association
The Press Association, the British and Irish
national news agency, is co-operatively
owned by the principal daily newspapers of
Britain outside London, and of the Irish
Republic. It offers national and regional
newspapers and broadcasters a
comprehensive range of home news—general
and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all
types of financial, commercial and sports
news. It also includes in its services to
regional papers the world news from Reuters
and Associated Press (see p 414).
News is sent by satellite from London
by the Press Association, certain items
being available in Dataformat, as camera-
ready copy. Its ‘Newsfile’ operation provides
general news, sports and foreign news on
screen to non-media as well as media clients
by means of telephone and view data
terminals. The photographic department
offers newspapers and broadcasters a daily
service of pictures. The NewsFeatures
service supplies reports of local or special
interest and grants exclusive rights to
syndicated features. In addition, it offers a
dial-in graphics facility, as well as extensive
cuttings and photograph libraries.
413
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Extel Financial
Extel Financial supplies information and
services to financial and business
communities throughout the world. Based in
London, it has a network of offices in
Europe and the United States and direct
representation in Japan and South-East Asia.
Data is collected from all the world’s major
stock exchanges, companies and the
international press. The agency is a major
source of reference material on companies
and securities. It supplies a full range of data
products on international financial matters,
and undertakes investment accounting for
banks, insurance companies and other
institutions. Up-to-the-minute business and
company news is made available by the
agency’s specialist financial news operation.
Other Agencies
The British press and broadcasting
organisations are also catered for by
Associated Press and United Press
International, which are British subsidiaries
of United States news agencies. A number of
other British, Commonwealth and foreign
agencies and news services have offices in
London, and there are minor agencies in
other cities. Syndication of features is not as
common in Britain as in some countries, but
a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
Training for Journalism
The National Council for the Training of
Journalists (NCTJ), which represents the
principal regional press organisations, sets
and conducts examinations, and organises
short training courses for journalists.
The two main methods of entry into
newspaper journalism are selection for a one-
year NCTJ pre-entry course at a college of
further education or direct recruitment by a
regional or local newspaper. Both categories
of entrant take part in an apprenticeship
scheme consisting of ‘on-the-job’ training.
Block-release courses, preceded by a period
of distance learning, are provided for those
who have not attended a pre-entry course.
There are similar courses for press
photographers. Postgraduate diploma courses
in journalism are available at the University
of Wales College of Cardiff; City University,
London; Lancashire Polytechnic, Preston;
and Strathclyde University/Glasgow
Polytechnic (jointly).
Courses for regional newspapers in such
subjects as newspaper sales, advertising,
industrial relations and management are
provided by the Newspaper Society Training
Service. Some newspaper publishers carry
out journalist training independently of the
NCTJ, awarding their own diplomas. New
vocational qualifications based on workplace
performance are being developed in regional
newspaper journalism.
Specialist training courses for journalists
and editorial managers from developing
countries are offered by the Thomson
Foundation in Cardiff. The Foundation also
conducts training courses in developing
countries and provides consultants to assist
newspapers and magazines in advertising,
management, circulation and the introduction
and operation of new technology. It runs an
international journalism training centre in
collaboration with Xinhua News Agency in
Peking.
Reuters offers assistance to overseas
journalists to study and train in Britain, as
well as in other parts of Europe and the
United States. The Reuter Foundation
awards fellowships to journalists from
developing nations to spend a year at Oxford
University. The company has also started to
run practical training courses in London for
journalists from Eastern Europe; these cover
international news writing and business news
skills.
The Periodicals Training Council is the
official training organisation in periodical
publishing. It offers a range of short courses
covering management, editorial work,
advertisement sales and circulation sales. It
has special responsibility for editorial training
and administers an industry-wide editorial
training scheme for those already in
employment. The postgraduate courses in
journalism at the University of Wales
College of Cardiff and City University,
London, contain periodical journalism
options, and the London College of Printing
provides postgraduate courses and General

Press Institutions
Employers’ organisations include the
Newspaper Publishers Association, whose
members publish national newspapers, and
the Newspaper Society, which represents
1,500 regional, local and London suburban
papers. The Scottish Daily Newspaper
Society represents the interests of daily and
Sunday newspapers in Scotland; the Scottish
Newspaper Proprietors’ Association acts on
behalf of the owners of weekly newspapers in
Scotland; and Associated Northern Ireland
Newspapers is made up of proprietors of
weekly newspapers in Northern Ireland. The
membership of the Periodical Publishers’
Association embraces most independent
publishers of business, professional and
consumer journals.
Organisations representing journalists are
the National Union of Journalists, with over
30,000 members, and the Institute of
Journalists, with about 2,000 members. The
main printing union is the Graphical, Paper
and Media Union, the result of a merger in
1991 between the Society of Graphical and
Allied Trades (SOGAT) ’82 and the
National Graphical Association (NGA) 1982,
with a membership of around 300,000.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors
is the officially recognised professional body
for newspaper editors. It has approximately
350 members and aims to maintain the
professional status and independence of
editors, defend the freedom of the press, and
improve the education and training of
journalists. The British Association of
Industrial Editors is the professional
organisation for editors of house journals.
The Association of British Editors represents
the whole range of media, including radio,
television, newspapers and magazines.
The main aim of the Foreign Press
Association, formed in 1888, is to help the
correspondents of overseas newspapers in
their work by arranging press conferences,
tours, briefings, and other services and
facilities.
Press Conduct
Readers’ representatives have been appointed
by most national papers to handle
complaints. They also help to guarantee
standards of accuracy, fairness and good
behaviour on the part of journalists.
In 1990 a report on privacy and the press
by a government-appointed independent
committee, under the chairmanship of Mr
David Calcutt, QC, recommended the
formation of a non-statutory Press
Complaints Commission by the newspaper
industry in place of the Press Council. The
Council was a voluntary non-statutory body
set up by the newspaper industry in 1953 to
safeguard press freedom and ensure that the
press conducted itself responsibly.
The ‘Calcutt Report’ also proposed
creating three new criminal offences of
physical intrusion to obtain personal
information for publication and extending
reporting restrictions on criminal cases so
that the anonymity granted to rape victims
would apply also to victims of other sexual
offences. These proposals are under
consideration by the Government.
Press Complaints Commission
The new Press Complaints Commission
took over from the Press Council on
1 January 1991. The membership of the
Commission is drawn from newspaper and
magazine editors as well as from people from
outside the industry. The Commission
operates a comprehensive code of practice
agreed by editors governing respect for
privacy, opportunity to reply, corrections,
journalists’ behaviour, references to race,
colour and religion, payments to criminals
for articles and protection of confidential
sources.
The Government will review the
Commission’s performance in 1992 to
determine whether it has been sufficiently
effective in maintaining high press standards
or whether a statutory underpinning is
needed.

BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Advertising Practice
Advertising practice in the press is regulated
and controlled by the Advertising Standards
Authority, an independent body. It aims to
promote and enforce the highest standards of
advertising in the interests of the public and
the industry, in particular through the
British Code of Advertising Practice. The
objects of the code are to ensure
• that advertisements are legal, decent,
honest and truthful;
• that they are prepared with a sense of
responsibility to the consumer;
• that they conform to the principles of
fair competition as generally accepted in
business; and
• that no advertisement brings advertising
into disrepute or reduces confidence in
advertising as a service to industry and
the public.
The Authority’s chief activities are
monitoring advertisements for their
compliance with the code and dealing with
complaints received directly from members
of the public. Its main sanction is the
recommendation to media that
advertisements considered to be in breach of
the code should not be published. It also
publishes regular reports on the results of its
investigations, naming the companies
involved. The Director General of Fair
Trading has the power to seek a court
injunction to prevent the publication of a
misleading advertisement.
The Press and the Law
The press generally has the same freedom as
the individual to comment on matters of
public interest. No specific press laws are in
operation, but certain statutes include
sections which apply to the press.
There are laws governing:
• the extent of newspaper ownership in
television and radio companies (see
p 409);
• the transfer of newspaper assets (see
p 409);
• restrictions on reporting certain types of
court proceedings and on publishing
material likely to stir up racial hatred;
and
• the right of press representatives to be
admitted to meetings of local authorities.
Publication of advertisement and
investment circulars is governed by laws
dealing with the publication of false or
misleading descriptions of goods and services
and with fraud. Advertisements for remedies
for certain diseases are covered by public
health legislation. Legal restrictions are
imposed on certain types of prize
competition; copyrights come under various
copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the press are
laws on contempt of court, official secrets,
libel and defamation. A newspaper may not
publish comments on the conduct of judicial
proceedings which are likely to prejudice the
courts’ reputation for fairness before or
during the actual proceedings, nor may it
publish before or during a trial anything
which might tend to influence the result.
The unauthorised acquisition and publication
of official information in such areas as
defence and international relations are
offences under the Official Secrets Acts 1911
to 1989 where unauthorised disclosure would
be harmful (see below).
Most legal proceedings against the press
are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor,
proprietor, publishers, printer and distributor
of the newspaper, as well as the author, may
all be held responsible.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
‘the printer’s imprint’ (the printer’s name
and place of publication) on all publications,
including newspapers. Publishers are legally
obliged to deposit copies of newspapers and
other publications at the British Library.
Defence Notices
Government officials and representatives of
the media form the Defence, Press and
Broadcasting Committee, which has agreed
that in some circumstances the publication of
certain categories of information might
416
THE PRESS
endanger national security. Details of these
categories are contained in Defence Notices
(D Notices) circulated to the media,
members of which are asked to seek advice
from the Secretary of the Committee, a
retired senior military officer, before
publishing information in these areas.
Compliance with any advice offered by the
Secretary is expected but there is no legal
force behind it and the final decision on
whether to publish rests with the editor,
producer or publisher concerned.

25 Television and Radio
Broadcasting in Britain has traditionally been
based on the principle that it is a public
service accountable to the people through
Parliament. While retaining the essential
public service element, it is now also
embracing the principles of competition and
choice.
Three public bodies—the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the
Independent Television Commission (ITC)
and the Radio Authority—are responsible for
television and radio services throughout
Britain. The BBC broadcasts television and
radio programmes, and the ITC and the
Radio Authority license and regulate
independent television and radio. In Wales,
Sianel Pedwar Cymru (S4C) broadcasts
programmes on Wales’s fourth channel.
These authorities work to broad
requirements and objectives defined by
Parliament, but are otherwise independent in
their day-to-day conduct of business.
The government department responsible
for overseeing the broadcasting system is the
Home Office. The Home Secretary may
issue directions on technical and other
matters. Since 1988, for example, the BBC
and the independent sector have been
prohibited from broadcasting direct
statements made by representatives of
Northern Ireland terrorist groups and their
supporters.
Television
Television viewing is by far the most popular
leisure pastime: nearly everyone watches
television, average viewing time per person
being over 24 hours a week.
There are four terrestrial television
channels, offering a mixture of drama, light
entertainment, films, sport, news and current
affairs, documentaries and educational
programmes. BBC 1 and BBC 2, which are
complementary national networks, are
operated by the BBC and financed
principally by licence fees. Independent
Television (ITV) is controlled by, and at
present Channel 4 is a subsidiary of, the
ITC. ITV and Channel 4 are expected to
complement each other and are largely
funded by advertising. All four channels
broadcast on 625 lines UHF (ultra-high
frequency). Over 99 per cent of the
population live within range of
transmission.
Over nine-tenths of households have
more than one television receiver and
one-half have a video recorder.
British television productions continue to
win many international awards, and in 1989
television companies received £194 million in
export earnings.
Radio
Practically every home has a radio set, and
the widespread ownership of portable sets
and car radios means that people can listen
to radio throughout the day. BBC Radio has
five national networks, which transmit all
types of music, news, current affairs, drama,
education, sport and a broad range of feature
programmes. At present there are no national
commercial radio stations, but three new
national independent stations are planned.
A total of 37 BBC local radio stations
serve England and the Channel Islands, and
regional and community radio services are
operated in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. Some 79 independent local radio
(ILR) stations are also available to local
communities throughout Britain and further
commercial local stations are in the planning
stage. About 90 per cent of the population is
within range of BBC or ILR stations.
419
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Stations supply a comprehensive service of
local news and information, music and other
entertainment, education, consumer advice
and coverage of local events. ‘Phone-in’
programmes allow listeners to express their
views on air.
Government Approach to Broadcasting
During the last few years broadcasting in
Britain has seen considerable changes. The
availability of more radio frequencies,
together with satellite, cable and microwave
transmissions1 is making more services
possible—locally, nationally and
internationally. Furthermore, the technical
quality of sound and pictures is improving.
With rapidly developing technology and
rising public demand for a wider choice of
programmes and services, the Government
introduced legislation in November 1990 to
make the regulatory framework for
broadcasting more flexible and efficient and
to give viewers and listeners access to a
broader range of services. At the same time
it aims to promote increased competition and
maintain high standards of taste and decency.
The new law is the Broadcasting Act 1990.
The Act takes full account of the need to
guarantee programme quality and diversity,
regional links, widespread ownership of
broadcasting companies and proper
geographical coverage. Provision is made for
‘sharply focused statutory safeguards’ backed
by enforcement sanctions, including financial
penalties.
Provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1990
The Broadcasting Act 1990 overhauls the
regulation of independent television and
radio and permits the introduction of
additional services. The Independent
Broadcasting Authority (IBA) and the Cable
Authority were replaced on 1 January 1991
by the Independent Television Commission
and the Radio Authority. The ITC and the
Radio Authority are initially being financed
1 Microwave transmission (MVDS) is a form of terrestrial
broadcasting using frequencies higher up the spectrum than
those normally used for television.
by government loans, but are obliged to
repay these and to support themselves from
licence fees within three years. There is
provision for the privatisation of the IBA’s
transmission system (see p 422).
The ITC and the Radio Authority are
implementing new licensing arrangements for
all commercial broadcasters. The ITC is to
award major broadcasting licences by
competitive tender to the highest bidders
satisfying stipulated quality tests. The Radio
Authority awards national radio licences by
competitive tender to the highest cash
bidders. Local radio licences will not be
allocated by competitive tender; the success
of licence applications will in part be
determined by audience demand and the
extent to which prospective stations would
increase variety. Although regulation will be
light, rules will be enforced so that
ownership remains widely spread and undue
concentrations and cross-media ownership
are kept in check.
A new national independent television
station and as many as three national
commercial radio stations will be established.
There will be opportunities for launching
hundreds of independent local radio and
television channels.
Programming Obligations
The Government does not wish to reduce
the role of public service broadcasting.
Hence, it has made no change to the BBC’s
‘cornerstone’ public service role of providing
high quality programming throughout the
full range of public tastes and interests. The
programming remits of BBC 1 and BBC 2;
BBC Radios 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; and BBC local
radio remain unchanged under the
Broadcasting Act 1990. Channel 4—in
addition to retaining public service
obligations—is, as before, required to be
innovative and distinctive, and to cater for
tastes and interests not adequately met by
ITV/Channel 3. Three of the four current
terrestrial television channels have, therefore,
the same programming obligations as before
the passing of the Act.
Licence-holders of the new independent
television Channels 3 and 5 will need to pass
420
TELEVISION AND RADIO
demanding quality tests. A ‘proper
proportion’ of programme material will have
to come from Britain and other European
countries. Between them, Channels 3, 4 and
5 will need to cater adequately for schools
programmes.
By 1993 both the BBC and commercial
television licensees will be required to ensure
that a minimum of 25 per cent of their
original programming comes from
independent producers. The system whereby
major sporting occasions (‘listed events’),
such as the Grand National horse race and
the Olympic Games, are made generally
available to television audiences on the main
terrestrial channels is retained.
Programme Standards
Recognising that television and radio are
powerful media with the potential to offend,
exploit and cause harm, the Act contains
guarantees on programme standards which
are extended to all British-based
broadcasters. These guarantees cover taste,
decency, accuracy and balance. The Act
removes broadcasters’ exemptions from the
law of obscenity and incitement to racial
hatred. It also makes provision for effective
sanctions against those supporting
unacceptable foreign satellite services
receivable in Britain, and it gives the
Broadcasting Standards Council a key role
(see p 428).
The ITC and the Radio Authority have
already approved programme codes and
guidelines dealing with standards and
impartiality (see p 427). National television
and radio are subject to a ‘due impartiality’
test, while local radio must comply with a
less demanding test for ‘undue prominence’.
Ownership Rules
In order to enjoy high standards and
diversity, the Government believes that it is
necessary to have ownership rules. The Act
includes clearer and more extensive rules
than existed previously. Non-European-
Community controlling ownership is largely
prohibited and national newspapers are
permitted relatively small stakes in direct
broadcasting by satellite (DBS) channels
(see p 426), Channels 3 and 5, and national
and local radio.
British Broadcasting Corporation
The constitution and finances of the BBC
are governed by a Royal Charter, which
expires in December 1996, and by a Licence
and Agreement. The Corporation’s board of
12 governors, including the chairman, vice-
chairman and national governors for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, is
appointed by the Queen on the advice of the
Government. It has final responsibility for all
aspects of broadcasting on the BBC. The
governors appoint the Director-General, the
Corporation’s chief executive officer, who
heads the board of management, which is in
charge of the daily running of the services.
The BBC has a strong regional structure.
The four English regions and the Scottish,
Welsh and Northern Ireland national regions
make programmes for their local audiences as
well as contributing to the national network.
The National Broadcasting Councils for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland give
advice on the policy and content of television
and radio programmes intended primarily for
reception in their areas. Local radio councils,
representative of the local community, advise
on the development and operation of the
BBC’s local radio stations.
Finance
The domestic services of the BBC are
financed principally from the sale of
television licences. Households with
television must buy an annual licence costing
£25 50 for black and white and £77 for
colour. Over 19 million licences were current
in April 1991; of these about 18 million were
for colour. More than two-thirds of
expenditure on domestic services relates to
television.
Licence income is supplemented by
profits from trading activities, such as
television programme exports, sale of
recordings and publications connected with
BBC programmes, hire and sale of
educational films, film library sales, and
421
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
exhibitions based on programmes. The BBC
meets the cost of its local radio stations, and
local education authorities help with the
funding and preparation of educational
programmes. BBC World Service radio is
financed by a grant-in-aid from the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office.
In early 1992 the BBC plans to set up a
range of specialist subscription services,
including one for the legal profession, which
will be transmitted during the night. The
services will be ‘down-loaded’ onto video
recorders fitted with decoders.
On 1 April 1991, licence fee collection
became the responsibility of the BBC.
Previously, the Post Office had undertaken
this task. With the object of improving
efficiency and encouraging the BBC to
continue developing alternative sources of
revenue, the Government has decided that
annual rises in the licence fees should be
lower than the rate of inflation. The
financing of the BBC will be considered
during the next Charter review.
BBC Television
Apart from a break during the second world
war (1939-45) the BBC has made regular
television broadcasts since 1936.
BBC 1 transmits an average of 124
hours of programmes a week and BBC 2
114 hours; the majority are broadcast on
the national network.
More than 70 per cent of the BBC’s
home-produced network programmes for
1989—90 were produced in London. Both the
BBC and the commercial television
companies enter into agreements with
overseas television corporations in order to
make new programmes economically.
Through co-ordinated planning of its two
services the BBC caters simultaneously for
people of different interests. Although both
services cover the whole range of television
output, BBC 1 presents more programmes of
general interest, such as light entertainment,
sport, current affairs, children’s programmes
and outside broadcasts. BBC 2 places greater
emphasis on minority interests, but also
shows documentaries, travel programmes,
serious drama, music, programmes on
pastimes and international films. On BBC 1
the daytime schedule consists of an early
morning service of news and information
(from Monday to Friday), followed during
the rest of the day by documentaries,
children’s programmes, films and other
programmes catering for many interests.
BBC National Radio
BBC Radio 1 broadcasts rock and pop music
24 hours a day, while Radio 2 (on VHF/FM
only) transmits popular music and light
entertainment also for 24 hours a day.
Although Radio 3 broadcasts mainly classical
music, it presents drama, poetry, and short
stories and talks too. Radio 4 is the main
speech network, providing the principal news
and current affairs service, together with
drama, comedy, documentaries and panel
games. It also carries parliamentary coverage
and live relays of major public events. In
1990 the BBC launched Radio 5 (on medium
wave only), which is devoted chiefly to sport
and education.
Independent Broadcasting
Independent Television Commission
Like the Radio Authority and S4C, the
Independent Television Commission’s
constitution and finances are governed by the
Broadcasting Act 1990. The ITC is
responsible for licensing and regulating all
non-BBC television services, including:
• ITV and its successor, Channel 3;
• Channel 4;
• the proposed Channel 5;
• cable and other local delivery services;
• independent teletext services; and
• domestic and non-domestic satellite
services available to viewers in Britain.
The former Independent Broadcasting
Authority’s television and radio transmission
networks and other facilities were transferred
to a new state company—National
Transcommunications Limited—on 1
January 1991. The company will be sold to

the private sector before the end of 1991.
The ITC is advised by committees on
educational broadcasting, religious
broadcasting, charitable appeals and
advertising. Viewer consultative councils also
comment on the commercial services’
programmes.
Until December 1992, when the present
ITV franchises (see below) end, the ITC will
continue to fulfil the IBA’s obligations
towards the ITV contracts. It will be legally
responsible for broadcasting programmes
shown on ITV, Channel 4 and by direct
broadcasting by satellite (DBS) services.
Channel 4 will be a subsidiary company of the
ITC till the end of 1992, after which it will
be set up as a corporation in its own right.
From 1993, when the new Channel 3
licences begin, the ITC will not broadcast or
‘publish’ programmes. These responsibilities
will pass to the new licensees. The ITC will
supervise with a ‘light touch’ in that it will
not be involved in detailed scheduling of
programmes. It has wider powers than the
IBA to enforce licence conditions and rules
designed to limit cross-media ownership and
excessive concentration of ownership
(see p 420).
ITV Programme Companies
At present 15 independent (ITV) companies
hold contracts to supply programmes in the
14 independent television geographical
regions. Two companies share the contract
for London, one providing programmes
during weekdays and the other at the
weekend. A contract for a national early
morning service, transmitted on the ITV
network, is held by an additional company.
The companies operate on a commercial
basis, deriving most of their revenue from
the sale of advertising time. The financial
resources, advertising revenue and
programme production of the companies
vary considerably, depending largely on the
size of population in the areas in which they
operate. Although newspapers may acquire
an interest in programme companies, there
are safeguards to ensure against
concentration of media ownership and
thereby protect the public interest.
Each programme company plans the
content of the programmes to be broadcast
in its area. These are produced by the
company itself, or by other programme
companies or bought from elsewhere. The
five largest companies—two serving London
and three serving north-west England, the
Midlands and Yorkshire—supply more
programmes for broadcast elsewhere on the
national network than do the smaller ones.
A common news service is provided 24
hours a day by Independent Television News
(ITN), a non-profit-making company in
which all the programme companies are
shareholders.
ITV Programmes
The first regular ITV programmes began in
London in 1955. ITV programmes are
broadcast 24 hours a day in all parts of the
country. About one-third of the output
comprises informative programmes—news,
documentaries, and programmes on current
affairs, education and religion. The
remainder cover sport, comedy, drama, game
shows, films, and a range of other
programmes with popular appeal. Over a half
of programmes are produced by the
programme companies and ITN.
Channel 3
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990 the
present independent television system (ITV)
will be replaced by Channel 3 in January
1993. The new channel will be made up of
15 regionally based licensees of the
Independent Television Commission (see
p 422), which decides the areas to be
covered, and an additional ITC licensee
providing a national breakfast-time
programme. A total of 40 applications for
licences have been received by the ITC,
which intends to award the licences by
31 October 1991.
Licences are to be awarded for a ten-year
period by competitive tender to the highest
bidder who has passed a quality threshold; in
exceptional cases a lower bid can be selected.
Such circumstances might include those
where an applicant was able to offer a quality
423
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of service significantly better than that
offered by the highest bidder.
There will be substantial safeguards for
quality programming. Licensees will be
required to offer a diverse programme
service and a proportion of good quality
programmes, as well as high quality
regional and national news and current
affairs programmes and children’s and
religious programmes. There is to be, for the
first time, a statutory duty to present
programmes made in and about the region.
Distinct regional programming aimed at
different areas within regions will also be
required.
Channel 3 licensees will be obliged to
operate a national programme network.
Networking arrangements are to be subject
to government approval so that anti¬
competitive practices are avoided.
ITN has been appointed to supply a
service of national and international news to
Channel 3 for a ten-year period starting in
January 1993.
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4, which began broadcasting in
1982, provides a national television service
throughout Britain, except in Wales, which
has a corresponding service—Sianel Pedwar
Cymru (S4C). It is required to present
programmes that are complementary to those
of ITV, appealing to tastes and interests not
normally catered for by the original
independent service.
Channel 4 must present a suitable
proportion of educational programmes and
encourage innovation and experiment. Its
schedules include a substantial proportion
of programmes from independent
producers. Channel 4 broadcasts for
approximately 140 hours a week, about half
of which are devoted to informative
programmes. The service, both nationally
and in Wales, is financed by subscriptions
from the ITV programme companies in
return for advertising time in fourth
channel programmes broadcast in their own
regions.
In Wales programmes on the fourth
channel are run and controlled by S4C,
formerly the Welsh Fourth Channel
Authority. Its members are appointed by the
Government. S4C is required to see that a
significant proportion of programming, in
practice 23 hours a week, is in the Welsh
language and that programmes broadcast
between 18.30 and 22.00 hours are mainly in
Welsh. At other times S4C transmits
national Channel 4 programmes.
Channel 4 and S4C’s distinctive remit to
screen diverse programmes has been
strengthened under the Broadcasting Act
1990 and the services are guaranteed by
special arrangements to protect revenue
levels. Channel 4 is to become a public
corporation from 1993, selling its own
advertising time and retaining the proceeds.
S4C will be government-funded.
Channel 5
A new national terrestrial television
channel—Channel 5—is to be established by
the beginning of 1994. Owing to limited
frequency availability it will cover only about
70 per cent of households.
The ten-year franchise will be awarded by
competitive tender subject to a quality
threshold. The new channel will have similar
programming obligations to Channel 3.
However, there is to be no requirement to
provide either regional or local programmes.
The ITC expects the franchise-holder to be
based outside the south of England. The new
channel will be financed through advertising,
subscription or sponsorship, or a
combination of all three.
Local Television
The Broadcasting Act 1990 makes provision
for the further development of local
television services. Local delivery franchises
will be awarded by competitive tender and
there will be no quality threshold. ITC
franchise-holders will be able to supply
national and local television channels using
both cable and microwave transmission
systems. Services delivered could include
DBS channels or Channel 5 in parts of the
country where it was not available on UHF.
Other services could be aimed at
424
TELEVISION AND RADIO
communities such as ethnic minorities and
Gaelic speakers.
Independent Radio
The underlying principles of independent
local radio (ILR) are similar to those of ITV
(see p 423). The programme companies
operate under licence to the Radio Authority
and are financed mainly by advertising
revenue. News coverage is supplied by
Independent Radio News. Licences for
existing operators will expire by 31
December 1996.
The Radio Authority took over
responsibility for independent radio from the
IBA on 1 January 1991. Like the
Independent Television Commission, it
supervises with a light touch. The new
authority will allocate licences by competitive
tender for up to three national commercial
radio services. One of these must be speech-
based and another has to include a large
proportion of music that is not pop music.
The first national radio franchise was
awarded to Classic FM in August 1991,
which will play mainly popular classical
music.
The Radio Authority is required to
encourage the provision of licensed services
which, taken as a whole, are of a high quality
and offer a broad range of programmes
calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and
interests. Powers to deter ‘pirate’ or illegal
broadcasters have been strengthened.
In the course of the 1990s, 200 to 300 new
stations could come on the air, some of
which could be neighbourhood and
community-of-interest stations. Areas to be
covered will initially be those which are
presently unserved or only marginally served
or which form distinctive communities within
existing ILR areas. Local audience demand
and the extent to which the service could
broaden the variety of local programmes will
affect local licence allocation.
In 1988 the Government approved the
issue of contracts for 23 new community-of-
interest and ethnic minority radio stations.
The first to go on the air, in 1989, was
Sunset Radio, aimed at Manchester’s multi¬
cultural population. Jazz FM became the
first of the new London music stations,
starting up in 1990.
Teletext
The BBC and independent television each
operate a teletext service, offering constantly
updated information on a variety of subjects,
including news, sport, travel, local weather
conditions and entertainment. The teletext
system allows the television signal to carry
additional information which can be selected
and displayed as ‘pages’ of text and graphics
on receivers equipped with the necessary
decoders. Both Ceefax, the BBC’s service,
and independent television’s Oracle service
have a subtitling facility for certain
programmes for people with hearing
difficulties.
The Broadcasting Act 1990 introduced a
new regulatory system for the licensing of
spare capacity within the television signal.
This allows more varied use of spare
capacity—data transfer, for instance—but the
position of teletext on commercial television
is safeguarded. Channels 3 and 5 will be
obliged to offer a subtitling service for at
least 50 per cent of their programmes by
1998, with further increases after that.
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers by
means of underground cables and are
normally paid for by subscription. The Cable
Authority was established in 1984 to issue
licences, supervise programme services and
promote cable development. By the time it
handed over its responsibilities to the Cable
Division of the ITC—on 1 January 1991—
it had awarded 135 new broadband (multi¬
channel) cable franchises. These cover two-
thirds of all homes and nearly all urban areas,
around 14 5 million households in total. Some
37 broadband franchises are now in operation
and over 900,000 homes have access to
broadband cable. The ITC is continuing the
Cable Authority’s practice of awarding only
one broadband cable franchise in any given
area so that the new franchisee is protected
from direct competition in the early stages.
Since the formation of the ITC 53
425
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
channel licences have been issued. Licences
are granted, on a non-competitive basis, to
programme services which are likely to meet
consumer protection standards and are run
by suitably qualified people.
The new broadband cable systems carry
up to 30 television channels, including
terrestrial broadcasts, satellite television,
channels delivered by videotape and local
services. Some are also able to offer
telephone services, home shopping and other
interactive services. Since January 1991 new
operators, and some established ones, have
had the choice of using microwave
transmissions to extend their coverage
beyond viewers who already have cable.
Cable investment must be privately
financed. Although all cable channels require
a licence from the ITC, regulation is as light
as possible to encourage the development of
a wide range of services and facilities, and
flexible enough to adapt to changing
technology. Safeguards protect the viability
of existing broadcasting services.
Broadcasting by Satellite
Several British-based satellite television
channels have been set up to supply
programmes to cable operators in Britain
and, in many cases, throughout Europe.
While some offer general entertainment,
others concentrate on specific areas of
interest, such as sport, music and children’s
programmes.
Direct broadcasting by satellite (DBS), by
which television pictures are transmitted
directly by satellite into people’s homes, has
been available throughout Britain since 1989.
The signals from satellite broadcasting are
receivable using specially designed aerials or
‘dishes’ and associated reception equipment.
A European Community directive requires
the use of the MAC/packet family of
standards for all DBS services (see p 431).
British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) carries
channels devoted to light entertainment,
news, feature films and sport transmitted
from the Astra and Marcopolo satellites. The
Astra satellites can transmit 32 channels in
all, nine of which are in English and are
available to cable subscribers. Other channels
broadcast sport, general entertainment for
women, and a service for children. MTV is
a pop video channel. BSkyB plans to
introduce additional channels using the
recently launched second Astra satellite.
The Marcopolo satellite carries BSkyB
broadcasts made under contract to the ITC
on the five DBS channels allocated to Britain
under international agreement. The company
has agreed to surrender any of these channels
on six months’ notice from the ITC, which
would then license a new user.
Educational Broadcasting
Both the BBC and independent television
broadcast educational programmes for
children and adults in educational
institutions and at home. Broadcasts to
schools deal with most subjects of the
curriculum, while education programmes for
adults cover many fields of learning,
vocational training and recreation.
Supporting material, in the form of books,
pamphlets, filmstrips, computer software,
and audio and video cassettes, is available to
supplement the programmes.
The BBC broadcasts television and radio
programmes made specially for students of
the Open University. The BBC Open
University Centre also produces educational
and training audio-visual materials in
collaboration with external agencies such as
the Department of Trade and Industry and
the Department of Education and Science.
The Open College, set up in 1987 with
government support, transmits courses on
Channel 4 ranging from basic literacy and
numeracy to high-level technological studies.
The Independent Television Commission
has a duty to ensure that schools
programmes are presented on independent
television.
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC does not give publicity to any
outside firm or organised interest except
when it is necessary in order to make
effective and informative programmes. It
must not broadcast any commercial
advertisement or any sponsored programme;
426
TELEVISION AND RADIO
it may, however, cover sponsored events.
After considering a report commissioned
by the Department of Trade and Industry on
cross-media promotion, the Government has
decided to refer the way the BBC promotes
its own publications to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. It has also asked the
newspaper industry to draw up a code of
practice on cross-media promotion.
Advertising and sponsorship are allowed
on independent television and radio subject
to controls. Codes of advertising standards
and programme sponsorship covering
commercial television and radio are operated
by the ITC and the Radio Authority.
Advertising
Advertisements are broadcast on independent
television in between programmes as well as
in breaks during programmes. Advertisers
are not allowed directly to influence
programme content or editorial control. Food
manufacturers and retailers are the largest
category of advertisers.
Advertisements must be clearly
distinguishable and separate from
programmes. The time given to them must
not be so great as to detract from the value
of the programmes as a medium of
information, education or entertainment.
Television advertising between 18.00 and
23.00 hours is limited to seven and a half
minutes an hour. The overall amount of
advertising throughout the day is normally
restricted to seven minutes an hour.
Independent television’s Oracle teletext
service (see p 425) carries paginated
advertisements.
The ITC and the Radio Authority operate
codes governing standards and practice in
advertising, and giving guidance on the types
and methods of advertisement which are
prohibited; these include political advertising
and advertisements for cigarettes or betting.
Television advertising for cigar and pipe
tobacco will be banned from October 1991.
At present religious advertising is not
allowed on ITV and Channel 4, and while
permitted on radio must comply with the
Radio Authority’s code on religious
advertising. From 1993 Channels 3 and 4
will be allowed to screen religious
advertisements.
Advertisements may not be inserted in
certain types of programme, such as
broadcasts to schools. Both the ITC and the
Radio Authority have the power to prevent
transmission of advertisements which they
consider misleading. The Broadcasting
Standards Council’s code of practice
(see p 428) covers advertisements.
Sponsorship
Sponsorship of certain programmes shown
by independent television is permitted,
provided that it conforms with ITC
guidelines and relevant national and
international laws.
The ITC’s sponsorship code takes as its
guiding principle the safeguarding of
programme integrity. News and current
affairs programmes may not be sponsored. In
the case of other programmes, sponsorship is
not allowed where there might be a clash of
interests. References to sponsors or their
products have to be confined to the
beginning and end of a programme and
around commercial breaks; they must not
appear in the programme itself. All
commercial radio programmes other than
news bulletins can be sponsored.
Government Publicity
The Government has no general privileged
access to radio or television but government
publicity material to support non-political
campaigns may be broadcast on independent
radio and television. This is paid for on a
normal commercial basis. Short public service
items, concerning health, safety and welfare,
are also produced by the Central Office of
Information for free transmission by the BBC
and independent television and radio.
Broadcasting Standards
The independence enjoyed by the
broadcasting authorities carries with it
certain obligations towards programmes and
programme content. Programmes must
display, as far as possible, a proper balance
427
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and wide range of subject matter,
impartiality in matters of controversy and
accuracy in news coverage, and they must
not offend against good taste. In addition,
broadcasters must now comply with
legislation relating to obscenity and
incitement to racial hatred.
Codes providing guidance on violence and
standards of taste and decency in television
programmes, particularly during hours when
large numbers of children are likely to be
viewing, are applied by the BBC and the
other regulatory authorities.
Under the 1990 Act the Government can
prohibit unacceptable foreign satellite
services receivable in Britain. Anyone in
Britain supporting such a service can be
prosecuted for a criminal offence.
Broadcasting Standards Council
The Broadcasting Standards Council was set
up by the Government to act as a focus for
public concern about the portrayal of
violence and sex, and about standards of
taste and decency. Its remit covers
television and radio programmes and
broadcast advertisements. A code of practice
has been drawn up by the Council on
these matters. It monitors programmes,
examines complaints from the public and
undertakes research. The Council has already
published the results of several public
attitude surveys.
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990 the
Council has been granted statutory powers
under which the BBC and other broadcasting
regulatory bodies’ codes of practice are
required to reflect the Council’s own code.
Broadcasters are obliged to publish the
Council’s findings on complaints in whatever
form it considers appropriate.
Programmes broadcast to Britain from
abroad are monitored by the Council.
Broadcasting Complaints Commission
The Broadcasting Complaints Commission is
financed by contributions from the BBC,
ITC, Radio Authority and S4C. It deals
with allegations of unfair treatment in
broadcast programmes and of unwarranted
infringement of privacy in programmes or in
their preparation. In 1989—90 it received 550
complaints.
Parliamentary and Political
Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television
and radio, either live, or more usually in
recorded and edited form on news and
current affairs programmes.
The proceedings of the House of
Commons have been televised since 1989.
They are produced by an independent
company appointed by the House of
Commons, which makes television pictures
available to the BBC, Independent Television
News and other approved broadcasters for
use in news and current affairs programmes.
House of Lords proceedings have been
televised since 1985.
The BBC and the commercial services
provide time on radio and television for an
annual series of party political broadcasts.
Party election broadcasts are arranged
following the announcement of a general
election. In addition, the Government may
make ministerial broadcasts on radio and
television, with opposition parties also being
allotted broadcast time.
Audience Research
Both the BBC and the independent sector are
required to keep themselves informed on the
state of public opinion about the programmes
and advertising which they broadcast. This is
done through the continuous measurement of
the size and composition of audiences and
their opinions of programmes. For television,
this work is undertaken through the
Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board,
which is owned jointly by the BBC and the
Independent Television Association, the trade
association for the ITV companies.
Regular surveys are conducted by both
the BBC and the independent sector to
gauge audience opinion on television and
radio services. Public opinion is further
assessed by the BBC and ITC through the
work of their advisory committees, councils
428
TELEVISION AND RADIO
and panels. Regular public meetings are also
held to debate services, and careful
consideration is given to correspondence and
telephone calls from listeners and viewers.
BBC World Service Radio
The BBC World Service broadcasts by radio
worldwide, using English and 35 other
languages, for 780 hours a week. The main
objectives are to give unbiased news, reflect
British opinion and project British life,
culture and developments in science and
industry. News bulletins, current affairs
programmes, political commentaries and
topical magazine programmes form the main
part of the output. These are supplemented
by a sports service, music, drama and general
entertainment. Regular listeners are
estimated to number 120 million.
The languages in which the World
Service broadcasts and the length of time
each is on the air are prescribed by the
Government. Otherwise the BBC has full
responsibility and is completely independent
in determining the content of news and other
programmes.
There are broadcasts by radio for 24
hours a day in English, which are
supplemented at peak listening times by
programmes of special interest to Africa,
South Asia and the Falkland Islands.
BBC World Service news bulletins and
other programmes are re-broadcast by more
than 250 stations in over 60 countries, which
receive the programmes by satellite. Two
World Service departments also specialise in
supplying radio material for re-broadcast.
One sells recordings to more than 100
countries, and the other mails some 260
tapes of original programmes to over 50
countries each week.
BBC English is the most extensive
language-teaching undertaking in the world.
English lessons are broadcast daily by radio
with explanations in over 25 languages,
including English, and re-broadcast by many
radio stations. BBC English television
programmes are also shown in more than
100 countries. A range of printed and
audio material accompanies these
programmes.
Another part of the World Service, BBC
Monitoring, listens to and reports on foreign
broadcasts, providing a daily flow of
significant news and comment from overseas
to the BBC and the Government. This
information is also sold to the press, private
sector companies, academic staff and public
bodies.
BBC World Service Television
In April 1991 the BBC launched a new
television service along the lines of BBC
World Service radio. It replaces BBC TV
Europe, a service based on BBC 1 and 2
transmissions. The new service comprises a
World Service Television News programme,
a selection of BBC 1 and 2 programmes and
English language teaching programmes
produced by BBC English.
World Service Television News is being
sold in English and different language
versions for re-broadcasting throughout the
world. It incorporates pictures from NBC
(National Broadcasting Company of the
United States) and Visnews (see below) and
draws on the resources of BBC Monitoring.
In addition to existing BBC television news
coverage, it includes specially recorded
material. The programme combines the
editorial priorities and global news agenda
established by BBC World Service radio
news with the facilities offered by the BBC
television news and current affairs service.
The BBC generates its own funding for
the new service; no licence fee or taxpayers’
money is involved.
COI Overseas Radio and Television
Services
The Central Office of Information (COI),
which provides publicity material and other
information services on behalf of government
departments and other public agencies,
produces radio programmes for overseas. A
wide range of recorded material is sent to
radio stations all over the world. COI
television services make available material
such as documentary and magazine
programmes for distribution to overseas
stations.
429
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
News Agencies
Visnews is the largest television news
agency in the world, supplying world
newsfilm to over 400 broadcasters in 84
countries and running bureaux in 31 major
cities throughout the world. The BBC and
Reuters are shareholders in the company.
Worldwide Television News, owned by
Independent Television News, the
American Broadcasting Company and
Channel 9 in Australia, supplies news
services to around 1,000 broadcasters in 75
countries. Both agencies provide services
through the Eurovision network (see below)
and by satellite.
International Relations
European Agreements
The Government will implement two
important European agreements on cross-
border broadcasting in October 1991: the
European Community Directive on
Broadcasting and the Council of Europe
Convention on Transfrontier Television.
These contain rules about programme
standards, advertising, sponsorship and
other matters. Programmes must not be
indecent, contain pornography, give undue
prominence to violence or be likely to
incite racial hatred. Nor should
programmes unsuitable for children be
broadcast at a time when they are likely to
be watching.
European Broadcasting Union
The BBC, ITC and Radio Authority are
members of the European Broadcasting
Union, which manages Eurovision, the
international network of television news
and programme exchange. The Union is
responsible for the technical and
administrative arrangements for co¬
ordinating the exchange of programmes
and news over the Eurovision network and
intercontinental satellite links. It also
maintains a technical monitoring station
where frequency measurements and other
observations on broadcasting stations are
carried out. The Union provides a forum
linking the major public services and national
broadcasters of Western Europe and other
parts of the world, and co-ordinates joint
operations in radio and television.
International Telecommunications Union
The BBC, ITC and Radio Authority
participate in the work of the International
Telecommunications Union, the United
Nations agency responsible for regulating
and controlling all international
telecommunications services, including radio
and television. It also allocates and registers
all radio frequencies, and promotes and co¬
ordinates the international study of technical
problems in broadcasting.
Other International Bodies
The BBC, ITC and Radio Authority are
associate members of the Asia-Pacific
Broadcasting Union, and the BBC also
belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting
Association, whose members meet every two
years to discuss public service broadcasting
issues.
Training
The BBC provides non-fmancial technical
assistance, particularly in training the staff of
overseas broadcasting organisations. The
Government finances overseas students on
broadcasting training courses at the BBC,
British Council2 and the Thomson Foundation
Television College in Glasgow, which sends
lecturers, and arranges courses, overseas.
Technological Developments
One of the most important recent
developments in television has been in news
coverage, where compact electronic cameras
have replaced film cameras, eliminating the
need for film processing and enabling
pictures to be transmitted directly to a studio
or recorded on video tape on location.
2 This aims to promote a wider knowledge of Britain and the
English language abroad and to develop closer cultural relations
between Britain and other countries.
430
TELEVISION AND RADIO
Other recent advances in television
broadcasting include:
• adoption of digital video tape recorders;
• increasing use of computer-aided
equipment for picture generation and
manipulation;
• use of portable satellite links to transmit
pictures from remote locations to
studios; and
• the introduction of stereo sound on the
NICAM 728 digital system, developed
jointly by the BBC, IBA and the British
Radio and Electronic Manufacturers’
Association.
The independent television networks are
being adapted for digital stereo sound. The
independent sector is also engaged in the
further development of digital techniques for
studio applications and inter-city links. In
satellite broadcasting, the MAC transmission
format was developed by IBA engineers, who
went on to devise refinements for the MAC
system compatible with widescreen
television. The 1,250-line high definition
television (HDTV) is being developed by the
EUREKA 95 group of British and other
European manufacturers. The BBC and IBA
co-operated in the development of teletext,
and teletext sets in 30 countries are based on
the British system. British Telecom’s public
viewdata service, ‘Prestel’, offers a broad
range of information transmitted by
telephone and viewed on the television
screen.

26 Sport and Recreation
The British invented and codified the rules
of many of the sports and games now played
all over the world, and today there is
widespread participation in and watching of
sport in Britain. British sportsmen and
women compete internationally in some 70
different sports and among their number are
around 70 world champions in 27 sports.
Large crowds attend occasions such as the
football and rugby league Challenge Cup
Finals at Wembley Stadium, international
rugby union matches at Twickenham (near
London), Murrayfield (Edinburgh) and
Cardiff Arms Park; the Wimbledon lawn
tennis championships; the classic horse races;
the Open Golf Championship; Grand Prix
motor racing; and international cricket
matches.
Sport is a major industry in Britain: in
addition to the professional sportsmen and
women, some 370,000 people are employed
in the provision of sports clothing, publicity,
ground and club maintenance and other
activities connected with sport. In total an
estimated £3,500 million is spent on sport
annually in Britain.
Participation
Levels of participation in sport have been
rising, due mainly to an increase in leisure
time and facilities, greater mobility and
improvements in living standards. A growing
awareness of the importance of regular
exercise for good health has also contributed
to this trend and is reflected in the upsurge
of interest in jogging, keep fit and dance-
related forms of exercise.
It has been estimated that 25 million
people over the age of 13 regularly take part
in sport or exercise, with men outnumbering
women. Walking, including rambling and
hiking, is by far the most popular recreation,
followed by swimming, football, golf, keep fit
and yoga, athletics, angling, squash,
badminton and cycling. Other widely
practised spare-time physical activities
include gardening and ‘do-it-yourself repair
and improvement work.
Women and Sport
A major priority in official development
plans for sport is to narrow the gap between
men’s and women’s participation in active
sport and recreation. A more positive
attitude towards physical fitness has led to
growing participation by women in athletics.
Women also take part more in ‘physical
contact’ sports such as football and rugby,
which were previously regarded as
‘unfeminine’. Sports from which they had
been excluded by tradition, rather than on
the grounds of physical differences, are
similarly increasing in popularity among
women: for instance, larger numbers now
play snooker and billiards.
Many sports have separate governing
bodies for women and competitive events are
normally organised in divisions for men and
women. One notable exception is
equestrianism, where women riders compete
on equal terms with men. Mixed events in
which men and women take part together are
traditional in sports such as tennis,
badminton and ice-skating, and have been
growing in popularity in golf.
Lacrosse and netball are played
predominantly by women; these, together
with tennis, badminton, athletics, hockey,
swimming and gymnastics, are the sports
most usually played by girls at school.
Pressure from schools is leading to the
inclusion of girls in formerly all-boy sports
teams, particularly soccer teams at junior
level. Men’s and women’s governing bodies
433
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
are amalgamating increasingly, and women
are encouraged to adopt leadership positions
in coaching and administration.
Televised Sport
Extensive coverage on television (2,700 hours
on the four terrestrial channels in 1990) has
helped to generate interest in a growing
number of sports and recreations. Sports
attracting the larger television audiences
include association football, cricket, athletics
and snooker. The advent of direct
broadcasting by satellite and the greater
availability of cable are increasing televised
coverage of sport substantially. At present
three satellite channels are devoted to sport.
Important sporting occasions (‘listed
events’), such as the Grand National horse
race, Olympic Games and cricket Test
matches involving England, have to be made
generally available to television audiences;
they may not be shown exclusively on ‘pay-
per-view’ television.
GOVERNMENT POLICIES
The Government has long recognised the
importance of physical recreation for the
health and general welfare of the community.
The social role that sport can play has
become more important at a time of rapid
change in work and leisure patterns. Success
in sport is also thought to strengthen
Britain’s international status and prestige.
Increased emphasis is being placed on the
need to provide new and improved sports
facilities in areas of urban deprivation. A
range of sports and recreational projects in
urban areas have been supported under the
Government’s Urban Programme. The
Derelict Land Grant scheme offers funding
towards sports and recreational facilities on
reclaimed sites. Water companies are
required to ensure that water and land under
their control are put to the best use tor sport
and recreation.
In 1987 the Government initiated a public
debate on the future direction of official
sports policy. It asked whether a correct
balance was being achieved between funding
sporting excellence and encouraging wider
participation, and whether enough was being
done to promote private sector investment in
sport, especially through corporate
sponsorship (see p 441). A major review of
sport and recreation provision in inner cities
was undertaken in 1988 by a government-
appointed group of business people, athletes
and sports administrators. The main
conclusions were that there was a need for
more small, local facilities and for ways of
enabling inner city communities to run their
own facilities.
A government statement of its policies on
sport and active recreation is expected to be
published late in 1991.
Organisation and Administration
Government policy on sport, active
recreation and children’s play is co-ordinated
in England by the Minister for Sport, a
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at
the Department of Education and Science
(DES). The Government transferred
responsibility for sport from the Department
of the Environment to the DES in 1990 in
order to give a greater emphasis to school
sport, which it considers to be the
foundation for continuing sporting activity in
adulthood. The Secretaries of State for
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are
responsible for sport in their countries.
Responsibility for the organisation and
promotion of sport is largely decentralised,
and many sports and recreation facilities are
provided by local authorities. The
Government gives financial and other
assistance through a number of official
bodies and schemes. This ‘arm’s length’
principle of funding safeguards the long-
established independence of sports
organisations in Britain. Some of these
bodies, such as the Sports Councils (see
p 437) and the Countryside Commission,
have specific responsibilities for sport and/or
recreation, and help other public and private
bodies to make facilities available. Others,
like the Forestry Commission, provide
recreational amenities in addition to their
main functions.
Government support for the development
of sport in Britain is channelled through four
434
SPORT AND RECREATION
independent bodies—the Sports Council (for
England and for general matters affecting
Britain as a whole), the Sports Council for
Wales, the Scottish Sports Council and the
Sports Council for Northern Ireland. In
Northern Ireland the Department of
Education makes direct grants towards the
capital cost of facilities to local authorities
and voluntary sports bodies.
The Minister for Sport co-ordinates
policy on children’s play in England. The
Sports Council is responsible for the
National Children’s Play and Recreation
Unit. This advises the Government on policy
and practice regarding children’s play and
play-providers and other bodies on such
issues as playground safety.
Sports in Education
Publicly maintained schools must provide for
the physical education of their pupils.
Physical education is one of the ten
foundation subjects of the National
Curriculum, which are compulsory for all
schoolchildren in England and Wales
between the ages of 5 and 16. Formal
programmes of study, attainment targets and
tests for physical education will be
introduced from 1992. In Northern Ireland,
physical education is one of the compulsory
subjects for 4- to 16-year-olds, and
programmes of study and attainment targets
are to be phased in from September 1991.
Physical education also features in the
recommended curriculum for Scottish
schools. As part of the Government’s review
of sport and active recreation (see p 434),
consideration is being given to ways of
increasing participation by schoolchildren in
sport both during and after school hours.
All schools (except those solely for
infants) are expected to have a playing field
or the use of one, and most secondary
schools have a gymnasium. Some have other
amenities such as swimming pools, sports
halls and halls designed for dance and
movement. The School Sports Forum was
established by the Sports Council in 1987 to
consider all aspects of the provision of sport
in schools.
Sports and recreation facilities are
available at institutions of higher and further
education, some of which have departments
of physical education. There are also ‘centres
of sporting excellence’, often at universities
and colleges, which enable selected young
athletes to develop their talents and which
cater, where appropriate, for their
educational needs.
To achieve the maximum use of sports
facilities, the Government and the Sports
Councils are encouraging greater community
use of sports halls and other facilities owned
by schools, colleges and institutions such as
football clubs. Stronger links are being
developed between schools and the wider
community to ensure that children have
access to sports amenities which clubs and
associations can make available outside school
hours.
Competitive Tendering
The Government is instituting competitive
tendering for the management of local
authority sports and leisure facilities to make
them more cost-effective and responsive to
consumer demand. School and college
facilities are exempted from competition, and
councils will retain controls over pricing,
admission and opening hours.
Safety at Sports Grounds
Safety at sports grounds is governed by
legislation. The main instrument of control is
a safety certificate which is issued by the
relevant local authority. When determining
the conditions of a safety certificate the local
authority is expected to comply with the
Home Office guide, Safety at Sports Grounds.
This was revised in 1990 to include
recommendations of the ‘Taylor Report’ on
the Hillsborough stadium disaster in
Sheffield in 1989, when 95 spectators were
crushed to death. The Government has
accepted all of the report’s safety
recommendations, including:
• reducing density on terraces;
• better training of and greater vigilance
by all those responsible for controlling
and stewarding spectators; and
435
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
• painting of all emergency exit gates in
perimeter fences in distinctive colours
and keeping them unlocked while
spectators are present.
In compliance with another of the report’s
recommendations, by 1994 spectators will
only be admitted to seated accommodation at
grounds in the First and Second Divisions of
the Football League and the Premier
Division in Scotland. The requirement for
seated accommodation will apply at Third
and Fourth Division League grounds by
1999. By reducing the pool betting duty (see
p 452), the Government is making available
£100 million over five years to assist clubs in
making the necessary ground improvements.
The Football Licensing Authority,
established under the Football Spectators Act
1989, will be responsible for issuing licences
for designated matches. A condition of a
licence is likely to be that the deadlines for
becoming all-seated are met. The authority
will also monitor the way in which local
authorities carry out the safety functions.
Spectator Violence
Spectator violence associated with football
both in Britain and overseas has been a
subject of widespread concern, and the
Government has worked closely with the
football authorities and the governments of
other European countries to implement
measures to combat the problem. The British
Government has also continued to press for
the closest co-operation with the football
authorities and the police and their
counterparts throughout Europe. Within the
Council of Europe, Britain contributes to the
work of the Standing Committee on the
European Convention on Spectator Violence,
which it chaired until 1990. Britain was the
first country to sign and ratify the
Convention. It has welcomed the
Committee’s recommendation urging tough
action against hooliganism, including
prosecution where appropriate.
Recognising the link between excessive
alcohol consumption and crowd disorder, the
Government introduced legislation in
Scotland in 1980 and in the rest of Britain in
1985 to establish firm controls on the sale
and possession of alcohol at football grounds
and on transport to and from grounds. The
Public Order Act 1986 gave courts in
England and Wales the power to prohibit
convicted football hooligans from attending
football matches. It also introduced a new
offence of disorderly conduct and banned
possession of fireworks and smoke bombs at
matches. Closed-circuit television at all
Football League grounds has greatly assisted
the police controlling crowds and is an
important evidence-gathering tool. The
National Football Intelligence Unit, formed
in 1989, co-ordinates police intelligence
about football hooligans and strengthens
liaison with overseas police forces. Courts in
England and Wales have powers to impose
restriction orders on convicted football
hooligans to prevent them travelling abroad
to attend specified matches.
New legislation makes it an offence to:
• throw objects at football matches;
• run onto the pitch without good reason;
and
• chant indecent or racist slogans.
Drug Misuse
The problem of drug-taking in sport in order
to improve performance unfairly has been a
cause of concern to the Government, Sports
Councils and governing bodies of sport. A
campaign to tackle the problem, launched by
the Sports Council, led to the introduction
of a new drug testing regime in 1988. This
provides for random testing of competitors in
and out of competition by independent
sampling officers, and the publication of
adverse findings. The Sports Council
provides financial support for the British
drug testing programme. It also funds the
International Olympic Committee (IOC)-
accredited laboratory at London University,
which carries out analysis and research into
methods of detection for new drugs that
unfairly aid performance.
International Co-operation
The Government and the Sports Council
have taken action against drug misuse at
436
SPORT AND RECREATION
international level. For example, they
supported the adoption of a Council of
Europe Anti-Doping Charter in 1984 and
chaired an international working party to
examine ways of promoting effective anti-
doping measures.
In 1990 a new Council of Europe Anti-
Doping Convention came into force to tackle
the problem of drug abuse in sport. This was
a British initiative, whose main aims are to
reinforce the ban on the use of drugs and
doping methods specified by the IOC and to
require signatory states to restrict the
availability of prohibited drugs. The
convention seeks to ensure that grants are
given only to those sports bodies with anti-
doping regulations. Signatory states are
encouraged to set up doping-control
laboratories meeting IOC standards, and
sports governing bodies are urged to
harmonise out-of-competition testing and
other anti-doping regulations with those of
the IOC. Testing at international events and
out-of-competition testing by international
sports bodies are also promoted under the
new agreement. Britain has already
implemented many provisions of this
agreement.
Gleneagles Agreement
In accordance with the statement on
apartheid in sport, agreed by the
Commonwealth heads of Government at
Gleneagles in Scotland in 1977, the
Government has sought to discourage
sporting contacts with any country where
sports are organised on the basis of race,
colour or ethnic origin. However, it has been
for individuals and organisations concerned
to decide whether to heed this advice.
SPORTS COUNCILS
The Sports Councils are allocating
government funds amounting to about
£70 million in 1991-92. They make grants for
sports development, coaching and
administration to the governing bodies of
sports and other national organisations, and
administer the national sports centres (see
p 438). Grants and loans are also made to
voluntary organisations, local authorities and
commercial organisations, to help them
provide sports facilities. British representatives
at international sports meetings are assisted by
the Sports Council, which encourages links
with international and overseas organisations.
The Councils are also concerned with
preserving and extending recreational and
sporting access to the countryside.
Facilities receiving support include sports
halls, indoor swimming pools, intensive-use
pitches, indoor tennis halls and school
facilities. The Indoor Tennis Initiative is a
major building programme to increase the
availability of indoor tennis courts. It is
sponsored by the Sports Council and the
tennis authorities.
Ten regional councils for sport and
recreation in England, on each of which
sporting, recreational, educational, and local
authority interests are represented, advise on
investment in, and the planning of, sporting
and recreational facilities and the promotion
of sport.
The Sports Council is exploring ways of
attracting greater private sector investment in
sport, including the use of incentive funding
schemes whereby public money is used to
generate revenue from private sources.
Campaigns
The ten-year strategy for the development of
sport in England was drawn up by the
Sports Council in 1982, and reviewed in
1988. It aims:
• to encourage further participation,
particularly among women and young
people;
• to provide adequate facilities for the
whole community, especially in the inner
cities and in deprived rural areas; and
• to continue to encourage high standards
of performance.
Similar strategies are being followed by
the Sports Councils for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The Sports Councils have
designated 1991 the ‘year of sport’.
Much of the Sports Council’s budget is
directed at increasing participation by the
general public.
437
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Council is also concentrating on
raising participation rates among inner city
dwellers, people with disabilities (see p 440)
and other groups experiencing difficulties in
gaining access to sporting opportunities. It
works towards improving coaching, sports
science and sports medicine as part of the
drive to increase standards of performance.
One of the Sports Council’s objectives is
to encourage C25 million more women
and 750,000 more men to take part in
sport by 1993—94.
The Sports Council’s ‘Action Sport’
programme, designed principally to
encourage socially disadvantaged people to
take up sport and recreation, has been
managed in partnership with local
authorities; around 60 schemes are still
running with the aid of Sports Council
funding. Many local authorities have gone on
to provide their own schemes without Sports
Council financial support. The Council has
also supported initiatives aimed at
strengthening links between football clubs
and their local communities. ‘What’s Your
Sport?’, a campaign to increase participation
in sports, was launched by the four Sports
Councils in 1987.
‘Team Sport Scotland’, administered by
the Scottish Sports Council, aims to
encourage team sports by promoting links
between schools, sports clubs and other
interested organisations.
Sports Centres
Five national sports centres, four in England
and one in Wales, are run by the Sports
Council, and offer a range of competition
and training facilities. As well as running
residential courses for national teams,
coaches and enthusiasts from all over Britain,
the centres are used extensively by local
sports clubs and the local community.
Combined facilities for a number of sports
are available at three of the centres: Crystal
Palace, in London; Bisham Abbey, in
Buckinghamshire; and Lilleshall, in
Shropshire. Crystal Palace has major
competition venues for athletics, swimming
and a variety of indoor sports; Lilleshall
houses the training school of the Football
Association. The other two are specialist
centres: the National Water Sports Centre at
Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, which
caters for rowing, canoeing and water-skiing;
and the Plas-y-Brenin National Centre for
Mountain Activities in north Wales.
The Sports Council for Wales runs the
National Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff
and the National Outdoor Pursuits Centre at
Plas Menai in north Wales. The Scottish
Sports Council operates three national sports
training centres: Glenmore Lodge, near
Aviemore, for outdoor pursuits; Inverclyde,
at Largs, for general sports; and a national
water sports training centre on the island of
Great Cumbrae, in the Firth of Clyde. The
Sports Council for Northern Ireland runs
one national facility, the Northern Ireland
Mountain Centre at Tollymore, in County
Down.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
CONCERNED WITH SPORT AND
RECREATION
Countryside Commissions
The Countryside Commission (for England),
the Countryside Council for Wales and the
Countryside Commission for Scotland are
responsible for conserving and improving the
natural beauty and amenity of the
countryside, and for encouraging the
provision and improvement of facilities for
open-air recreation. The Countryside
Commission has launched a series of policy
initiatives aimed at increasing people’s
enjoyment of the countryside. These focus
on the maintenance and sign-posting of
public footpaths and other ‘rights of way’
and the development of national routes for
long-distance walking and riding. Rural
communities are encouraged to build up local
facilities which promote public enjoyment of
the countryside. These initiatives operate
alongside established policies for helping
local authorities and private bodies to
provide country parks, picnic sites and
informal recreation facilities.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster
Countryside Committee advises the
438
SPORT AND RECREATION
Department of the Environment on the
preservation of amenities and the designation
of ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’.
British Waterways Board
The British Waterways Board is a publicly
owned body responsible for managing and
developing much of Great Britain’s inland
waterways, which are preserved primarily for
leisure use. Many leisure and recreational
pursuits are practised on waterways and
reservoirs and in waterside buildings; these
include angling and numerous types of
sailing and boating.
Local Authorities
Local authorities are major providers of land
and large-scale facilities for community
recreation: their estimated annual
expenditure on sport and recreation amounts
to about £ 1,000 million. Provision of
facilities was substantially increased in the
1970s to meet growing demand and to
encourage expansion of participation. The
facilities include parks, lakes, playing fields,
sports halls, tennis courts, golf courses,
swimming pools, gymnasiums and sports
centres catering for a wide range of activities.
Local authorities manage 1,700 indoor
centres, largely built in the last 20 years, as
well as numerous outdoor amenities for sport
and recreation (including 150 golf courses).
There has been a rapid growth in the
provision of artificial pitches, largely for
hockey use. The number of leisure pools is
also rising quickly: these often have wave
machines, waterfalls, jacuzzis and other
leisure equipment.
World Student Games
Sheffield city council hosted the World
Student Games in July 1991, which attracted
some 6,000 competitors and officials from
nearly 120 countries. A new athletics stadium
and swimming complex were constructed
for use during and after the Games. The
Sports Council contributed £3 million to
help cover costs and some £26 million was
provided by the Government for games-
related projects under various programmes
designed to promote urban renewal.
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by 395 independent
governing bodies, whose functions usually
include drawing up rules, holding events,
regulating membership, selecting and
training national teams and promoting
international links. There are also
organisations representing people who take
part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking and cycling.
Central Council of Physical Recreation
The Central Council of Physical Recreation
provides a forum for 280 national governing
and representative bodies of sport and
physical recreation in England. The
equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are the Scottish and Welsh
Sports Associations and the Northern Ireland
Council of Physical Recreation.
The Central Council discusses policy
issues with the Sports Council, the main
provider of its funding. A Community
Sports Leadership Award designed to
increase the numbers of people with
community sport development skills is
administered by the British Sports Trust on
behalf of the Central Council.
National Coaching Foundation
The National Coaching Foundation was
established in 1983 to provide educational
and advisory services for coaches in all
sports. Its work complements coaching
development carried out by national sporting
governing bodies. There are 16 national
coaching centres delivering the Foundation’s
services to coaches.
British Olympic Association
The British Olympic Association, founded in
1905, is the national Olympic committee for
Britain and its primary function is to
organise the participation of British teams in
the Olympic Games. The Association
439
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
comprises representatives of the 29 governing
bodies of those sports in the programme of
the Olympic Games (summer and winter). It
determines the size of British teams, raises
funds, makes all arrangements and provides a
headquarters staff for the management of the
teams. It also makes important contributions
in the fields of coaching, drug testing and
control, and sports medicine. The
Association’s British Olympic Medical
Centre supplies a medical back-up service for
competitors before and during the Olympic
Games.
In 1988 the British Olympic Association,
the Sports Council and the Central Council
of Physical Recreation agreed to form the
British International Sports Committee to
co-ordinate and promote British interests at
international sporting forums.
National Playing Fields Association
The National Playing Fields Association is a
charity with a Royal Charter, whose purpose
is to promote the provision of recreation and
play facilities for all age groups. It aims to
preserve, improve and acquire playing fields,
playgrounds and playspace, and to specialise
in the play and recreation needs of children
and young people, in particular those with
special needs. There are affiliated
associations in the English and Welsh
counties and branches in Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
The Government has awarded a grant of
£500,000 to the Association, in conjunction
with the Sports Council and the Central
Council of Physical Recreation, to compile a
register of recreational land as part of a
strategy to safeguard playing fields.
Sports Clubs
Recreational facilities are provided by local
sports clubs. Some cater for indoor
recreation, but more common are those
providing sports grounds, particularly for
cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis and
golf. Many clubs linked to business firms
cater for sporting activities. Commercial
facilities include tenpin bowling centres, ice
and roller-skating rinks, squash courts, golf
courses and driving ranges, curling rinks,
riding stables, marinas and, increasingly,
fitness centres. The Civil Service Sports
Council, with a membership of 200,000, has
extensive facilities at its disposal for a large
number of sports. In all the private sector
owns and runs some 500 major sports
facilities.
SPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH
DISABILITIES
Opportunities exist for people with
disabilities to take part in a variety of
physical and sporting activities. The
structure of sport for disabled people is
undergoing change. There are national
disability sports organisations representing
the seven main disability groups, but the
trend is towards sports-specific governing
bodies. For example, the Riding for the
Disabled Association caters for some 24,000
riders and the British Disabled Water Ski
Association offers training and competition
to a growing number of skiers.
The governing bodies of sport are
increasingly taking responsibility for both
able-bodied and disabled participants. The
British Paralympic Association, which liaises
closely with the British Olympic Association,
looks after the preparation and training of
paralympic and other international teams.
In 1989 the Government published a
major report calling for the reorganisation of
the structure of sport for people with
disabilities. Under this, disabled sportsmen
and women would be integrated into able-
bodied sport and the governing bodies would
assume responsibility for all participants in
their sport, whether able-bodied or disabled.
Disabled athletes would also be encouraged
to participate in sporting events either in
direct competition with able-bodied athletes
or in parallel events. In 1991 the
Government awarded a special grant to the
Sports Council to help promote the
integration of sport.
The British Sports Association for the
Disabled aims to encourage and enable
people with disabilities to take part in all
forms of sport and physical recreation.
Sports clubs for disabled people throughout
440
SPORT AND RECREATION
Britain are affiliated to the Association,
which helps to organise sporting and physical
activities at all levels. As well as offering
advice to local clubs and groups, the
Association arranges conferences, seminars
and coaching courses. The Scottish Sports
Association for the Disabled, the Federation
of Sports Associations for the Disabled
(Wales) and the Northern Ireland Sports
Association for the Disabled have similar co¬
ordinating roles.
In the last few years greater emphasis has
been placed on making provision for people
with a mental handicap, this work being co¬
ordinated by the United Kingdom Sports
Association for People with a Mental
Handicap. Non-competitive activities,
including outdoor pursuits, are also receiving
closer attention, evidence of which is seen in
the growing number of specialist centres,
such as those run by the Calvert Trust. More
community facilities are becoming available,
and disabled awareness courses are being
offered to professional and voluntary staff.
Britain has continued to play an active
part at international level since Sir Ludwig
Guttmann began sport for paraplegics and
established the first sports stadium in the
world designed for people with disabilities at
Stoke Mandeville in Buckinghamshire in
1969. At the Paralympic Games in Seoul,
Korea, held in 1988, the British team gained
62 gold, 67 silver and 53 bronze medals,
finishing third in the overall medals table.
More than 2,000 athletes with a mental
handicap took part in the European Summer
Special Olympic Games held in Glasgow in
1990. The 40th annual World Wheelchair
Games were staged at Stoke Mandeville in
July and August 1991.
PRIVATE SPONSORSHIP
Increasing numbers of sports benefit from
financial sponsorship from commercial
organisations, and its importance as a source
of funding is recognised by the Government
and the Sports Councils. The estimated
value of commercial sponsorship was £200
million in 1990. Motorsport and football
receive the largest amounts of private
sponsorship.
Sponsorship may take the form of
financing specific events, or of grants to
individual sports organisations or sportsmen
and women. The Sports Aid Foundation and
Sports Aid Trust raise and distribute funds
from industry, commerce and private
sponsors in order to assist the training of
talented individuals; grants are awarded on
the recommendation of the governing bodies
of sport. The Scottish and Welsh Sports Aid
Foundations and the Ulster Sports and
Recreation Trust have similar functions.
Sponsorship advisory services are run by the
Central Council of Physical Recreation.
Successive governments have negotiated
voluntary agreements with the tobacco
industry to regulate tobacco companies’
sponsorship of sport, the last one having
come into force in 1987. This is designed to
bring about a reduction in spending by
tobacco firms on sports sponsorship and
introduces a ceiling on promotional activity.
It prohibits sponsorship of events where a
majority of the participants are under 18
years of age or which are designed to appeal
mainly to spectators under 18. It bans the
depiction of any participants in a sport in
media advertising, and imposes strict
controls on siting of signs at televised events
and on the size of health warnings on these
signs.
POPULAR SPORTS AND
RECREATIONS
Some of the major sports and recreations in
Britain are described below. The increased
provision of sports centres has improved
opportunities for participating in indoor
sports such as basketball, volleyball, fencing,
judo, karate and other martial arts,
gymnastics, squash, table tennis and
shooting. Almost all outdoor sports have
continued to gain in popularity, including
such ‘high-risk’ activities as rock-climbing
and sub-aqua diving. The number of people
enjoying the recreational amenities of the
countryside, rivers and coastline is also
growing.
Sportsmen and women may be
professionals (paid players) or amateurs.
Some sports—like hockey and rowing—are
441
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
amateur, but in others the distinction
between amateur status and professional
status is less strictly defined, or does not
exist. The Amateur Athletic Association, for
example, allows payments to be made into
trust funds held by many top-ranking
athletes.
Angling
The most popular country sport is angling,
and there are about 4 million anglers in
Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout,
particularly in the rivers and lochs of
Scotland and in Wales. In England and
Wales the most widely practised form of
angling is for coarse fish such as pike,
perch, carp, tench and bream. Separate
organisations represent game (salmon and
trout), coarse and sea fishing clubs in
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland.
The National Federation of Anglers in
England organises national championships
for coarse fishing and enters a team in the
world angling championships. England won
the world team event in 1987 and 1988 and
the individual title in 1989 and 1990. Most
coarse fishing is let to angling clubs by
private owners, while those fishing for trout
and salmon may rent a stretch of river, join a
club, or pay for the right to fish by the day,
week or month. Coastal and deep-sea fishing
are free to all, apart from salmon and sea
trout fishing, which is by licence only.
Association Football
Association football was first developed and
codified in England during the nineteenth
century.
Association football is the largest
spectator sport and one of the most
popular participation sports.
It is controlled by separate football
associations in England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. In England over 335 clubs
are affiliated to the English Football
Association (FA) and 42,000 clubs to
regional or district associations.
The Football Association, founded in
1863, and the Football League, founded in
1888, were both the first of their kind in the
world.
In England and Wales the full-time
professional clubs play in four main divisions
consisting of 93 clubs and organised by the
Football League. A number of leading clubs
have been discussing the possible formation
of a separate premier league from the
1992-93 season. In Scotland there are three
divisions, with 38 clubs, belonging to the
Scottish Football League.
In Northern Ireland, 14 semi-professional
clubs play in the Irish Football League.
During the season, which lasts from August
until May, over 2,000 English League
matches are played; total attendances reached
20 million in 1990-91, having risen for the
fifth consecutive year.
The annual competitions for the FA
Challenge Cup, the Rumbelows League Cup,
the Tennents Scottish Cup, the Skol Cup
(formerly the Scottish League Cup), the
Irish Cup and the Welsh FA Cup are
organised on a knock-out basis. The finals
are played at Wembley Stadium, London; at
Hampden Park, Glasgow; at Windsor Park,
Belfast; and at the National Stadium,
Cardiff.
The Sports Councils have made grants
available to a number of clubs and local
authorities to enable them to modernise or
expand football facilities in areas of urban
deprivation. Grants for various
improvements such as all-weather pitches are
also made throughout Britain by the Football
Associations and the Football Trust, a body
financed by the football pools companies (see
p 452). The Government has reduced pool
betting duty on the understanding that the
revenue forgone by the Government is given
to the Football Trust to be used for ground
improvements.
Athletics
Amateur athletics is governed in England by
the Amateur Athletic Association (which,
formed in 1880, was the first national
governing body for athletics) and by the
Women’s Amateur Athletic Association.
442
SPORT AND RECREATION
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have
their own associations. International
athletics and the selection of British teams
are the concern of the Amateur Athletic
Association, which also administers
coaching schemes. For the Olympic Games
and the world and European
championships one team represents Britain.
Athletics is attracting increasing
numbers of participants, both men and
women, in part because of the success of
British competitors and the wide coverage
of athletics events on television.
The London Marathon, which takes
place every spring, draws leading
runners from all over the world and is a
mass-participation event (more than
23,000 runners took part in 1991).
Many British athletes, especially middle-
distance runners, have enjoyed
distinguished reputations: in 1954, for
example, Dr (now Sir) Roger Bannister
became the first man to run a mile in
under four minutes. More recently British
athletes won six silver and two bronze
medals at the 1988 Olympic Games in
Seoul, Korea. At the Commonwealth
Games held in Auckland in 1990, England,
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
competed separately and between them
gained 16 gold medals for athletics. At the
World Athletics Championships staged in
Tokyo in August and September 1991,
British athletes won gold medals in the
women’s 10,000 metres and the men’s 4 x
400 metres relay. In August 1991, Britons
held world records in the 800 metres
(Sebastian Coe), the mile (Steve Cram), the
decathlon (Daley Thompson) and the 4 x
200 metres indoor relay (Linford Christie,
Darren Braithwaite, Ade Mafe and John
Regis).
Badminton
The sport of badminton takes its name
from the Duke of Beaufort’s country home,
Badminton House, where badminton was
first played in the nineteenth century.
Badminton is organised by the Badminton
Association of England and the Scottish,
Welsh and Irish (Ulster branch) Badminton
Unions. There are also English, Welsh and
Scottish schools badminton associations.
Around 4 million people are estimated to
play the sport in Britain. From 1992
badminton will become a full Olympic
sport.
Basketball
Basketball is played, mainly indoors, by
both men and women. There are about
1,000 registered clubs and the sport is
played in most secondary schools and many
other institutions. In all, over 1 million
people participate and the sport’s popularity
has been increasing rapidly. The English
Basket Ball Association is the governing
body of the sport in England, and there are
similar associations in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The leading clubs play in
the National Basketball Leagues, and the
main events of the year are the Coca-Cola
National Cup Finals and the Carlsberg
Basketball Championships, both staged in
London.
Bowls
Bowls has been played in Britain since the
thirteenth century. The game of lawn
bowls is played on a flat green. In the
Midlands, the north of England and north
Wales a variation called crown green bowls
is played, so named because the centre of
the green is higher than its boundaries.
Lawn and crown green bowls are mainly
summer games; in winter indoor bowls
takes place on synthetic greens and is
growing in popularity. Once regarded as a
pastime for the elderly, bowls is
increasingly enjoyed by adults of all ages.
About 4,000 lawn bowling clubs are
affiliated to the English, Scottish, Welsh
and Irish (Northern Ireland Region)
Bowling Associations, which, together with
Women’s Bowling Associations for the four
countries, play to the rules of the
International Bowling Board. Other
associations, including the English Bowling
Federation, are not under the Board’s
443
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
control. The British Crown Green Bowling
Association is the governing body of crown
green bowls, and has 2,500 affiliated clubs.
The outstanding player in recent years
has been David Bryant, who has won three
world singles championships. Richard Corsie
was the winner of the World Indoor Singles
title in 1991.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form dates from 1865,
when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up
a set of rules eliminating much of the
brutality that had characterised prize-fighting
and making skill the basis of the sport.
Boxing is both amateur and professional, and
in both strict medical regulations are
observed.
All amateur boxing in England, including
schoolboy, club, association and combined
services boxing (in the armed forces), is
controlled by the Amateur Boxing
Association. There are separate associations
in Scotland and Wales, and Northern Ireland
forms part of the Irish Boxing Association.
The associations organise amateur boxing
championships as well as training courses for
referees, coaches and others. Teams take part
in international meetings including the
Commonwealth and Olympic Games, and
European and World championships. Richard
Woodhall won a bronze medal in the light-
middleweight class at the 1988 Olympic
Games.
Professional boxing is controlled by the
British Boxing Board of Control. The
Board appoints inspectors, medical officers
and representatives to ensure that regulations
are observed and to guard against
overmatching and exploitation. British
boxing has a distinguished record and at
various times British boxers have held
European, Commonwealth and world
championship titles. Dave McAuley is the
current International Boxing Federation
(IBF) world flyweight champion and Chris
Eubank is the World Boxing Organisation
(WBO) world super-middleweight champion.
Duke McKenzie has won world titles at two
different weights and is currently holder of
the WBO bantamweight world title.
Chess
Chess is growing in popularity and England
now ranks second among chess-playing
nations, having taken silver medals at the last
three chess Olympics. Scotland, Wales and
Ireland are separately represented. There are
local chess clubs and leagues throughout
Britain and the game is widely played in
schools and colleges. Important domestic
competitions include the British
Championships (for all ages), the National
Club Championships, the County
Championships and the Leigh Grand Prix.
The Hastings Chess Congress, dating from
1895, is the world’s longest running annual
international chess tournament.
The governing bodies of the game are the
British Chess Federation (responsible for
England and for co-ordinating activity among
the home nations), the Scottish Chess Associa¬
tion and the Welsh and Ulster Chess Unions.
Cricket
Cricket is among the most popular of
summer sports and is sometimes called the
English national game, having been played as
early as the 1550s. Among the many clubs
founded in the eighteenth century is the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which
continues to frame the rules of the game.
The Club is based at Lord’s cricket ground
in north London, the administrative centre
of the world game. Men’s cricket in Britain
is governed by the Cricket Council,
consisting of representatives of the Test and
County Cricket Board (representing first-
class cricket), the National Cricket
Association (representing club and junior
cricket), the Minor County Cricket
Association, the Scottish Cricket Union, the
Irish Cricket Union and the MCC.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and in cities, towns and villages
amateur teams play weekly games from late
April to the end of September. Throughout
Britain there is a network of league cricket
contested by teams of Saturday afternoon
players.
The main competition in professional
cricket is the Britannic Assurance County
444
SPORT AND RECREATION
Championship of three-day and four-day
games played by 17 county teams. There are
also three one-day competitions—the Benson
and Hedges Cup, the National Westminster
Bank Trophy, and the Refuge Assurance
League, played on Sundays. Some of the
best supported games are the annual series of
five-day Cornhill Insurance Test matches
played between England and a touring team
from Australia, India, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka or the West Indies. A
team representing England usually tours one
or more of these countries in the British
winter. Texaco Trophy one-day international
games also attract large crowds. A World
Cup competition takes place every four
years, with some of the smaller cricketing
nations as well as the major countries
competing; the next one will be staged in
Australia and New Zealand in 1992.
Cricket is also played by women and girls,
the governing body being the Women’s
Cricket Association, founded in 1926.
Women’s cricket clubs have regular local
fixtures, usually played at weekends, and
may participate in the national league and
club knock-out competitions. There are
regular county matches as well as an area
championship and a territorial competition.
Test match series and a World Cup
competition are played, with both major and
minor cricketing nations taking part.
Curling
The ice sport of curling originated in
Scotland, where it is now played by men and
women almost exclusively on purpose-built
rinks indoors. The governing body of the
sport in Scotland is the Royal Caledonian
Curling Club, which was formed in 1838; it
has over 22,000 members. Curling is played
in 24 other countries, including England and
Wales. European and World championship
competitions take place annually.
Cycling
Since the 1970s there has been a resurgence
of interest in cycling, both as a means of
transport and as a sport and recreation, and
this has led central and local government to
make greater provision for cycling. Activities
include road and track racing, cycle
speedway, time-trialling, cyclo-cross,
mountain biking, touring, bicycle polo and
bicycle moto-cross.
The British Cycling Federation is the
governing body for cycling as a sport, with
900 affiliated clubs. The Cyclists’ Touring
Club, formed in 1878, is the governing body
for recreational and amenity cycling and
represents cyclists’ interests in general. The
Scottish Cyclists Union controls the sport in
Scotland.
Equestrianism
Equestrian activities include recreational
riding, show jumping and carriage driving.
The art of riding is promoted by the British
Horse Society, which is concerned with the
welfare of horses, road safety, riding rights of
way and training. It runs the British
Equestrian Centre at Stoneleigh in
Warwickshire. With some 52,000 members,
the Society is the parent body of the Pony
Club and the Riding Club movements, which
hold rallies, meetings and competitions
culminating in annual national
championships. Leading horse trials,
comprising dressage, cross-country riding
and show jumping, are held every year at
Badminton (Avon), Windsor (Berkshire),
Gatcombe Park (Gloucestershire), Bramham
(West Yorkshire), Burghley House
(Lincolnshire), Blair Castle (Tayside) and
Blenheim Palace (Oxfordshire).
Show jumping is regulated and promoted
by the British Show Jumping Association,
which has over 17,000 members and 2,800
shows affiliated to it. The major show
jumping events each year include the Royal
International Horse Show at the National
Exhibition Centre, Birmingham; the Horse of
the Year Show at Wembley in London; the
Olympia International Show Jumping
Championships in London; and the
Hickstead Nations Cup and Derby meetings
at Bolney in West Sussex.
The authority responsible for equestrian
competitions (other than racing) at
international and Olympic level is the British
Equestrian Federation, which co-ordinates
445
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the activities of the British Horse Society
and the British Show Jumping Association.
British equestrian teams have an outstanding
record in international competitions. The
British three-day event team gained a silver
medal at the 1988 Olympic Games; Ian Stark
won the silver medal and Virginia Leng won
the bronze medal in the three-day individual
competition. At the World Equestrian Games
held in Stockholm in 1990 Great Britain
gained one gold, four silver and one bronze
medal.
Field Sports
British field sports include hunting (on
horseback and on foot), fishing, shooting,
stalking, falconry and coursing. Fox hunting
on horseback with a pack of hounds is the
most popular British hunting sport, and
there are 341 registered packs of hounds of
all kinds in Britain.
Game shooting as an organised sport
probably originated in the late eighteenth
century, and takes place in many parts of
Britain. Game consists of grouse, black-
game, ptarmigan, partridge and pheasant,
species which are protected by law during a
close season, when they are allowed to breed
on numerous estates supervised by
gamekeepers. It is necessary to have a licence
to kill game and a certificate issued by the
police to own a shot-gun.
The British Field Sports Society looks
after the interests of all field sports. Public
opposition to field sports is considerable and
is organised through such bodies as the
League Against Cruel Sports.
Golf
Golf originated in Scotland, where for
centuries it has carried the title of the Royal
and Ancient Game. The oldest golf club in
the world is the Honourable Company of
Edinburgh Golfers. The Royal and Ancient
Golf Club, the ruling authority of the sport
for most of the world, is situated at St
Andrews on the east coast of Scotland. Golf
is played throughout Britain and there are
golf courses near most towns, a few of them
owned by local authorities.
The main event of the British golfing year
is the Open Championship, one of the
world’s leading tournaments. Other
important events include the Walker Cup
and Curtis Cup matches for amateurs, played
between Great Britain and Ireland and the
United States, and the Ryder Cup match for
professionals, played between Europe and the
United States. Among the leading British
professional players are Nick Faldo, Sandy
Lyle and Ian Woosnam.
Sandy Lyle won the United States
Masters golf tournament in 1988, Nick
Faldo was the winner in 1989 and 1990,
and in 1991 Ian Woosnam took the title.
Laura Davies became the first British
woman, in 1987, to win the United
States Open Championship for women.
Greyhound Racing
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical
hare, one of Britain’s most popular spectator
sports, takes place at 36 major tracks
operating under the same rules. Meetings are
usually held three times a week at each track,
with at least ten races a meeting. The rules
for the sport are drawn up by the National
Greyhound Racing Club, the sport’s judicial
and administrative body. The representative
body is the British Greyhound Racing Board.
There about 50 mainly small tracks which
operate independently. Like the major tracks,
they are licensed by local authorities.
Gymnastics
Gymnastics is divided into four main
disciplines: artistic or Olympic gymnastics,
rhythmic gymnastics, sports acrobatics and
general gymnastics. Both men and women
compete in artistic gymnastics, although the
apparatus used differs. Men use the floor,
pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars and
horizontal bar, while women exercise on the
vault, asymmetric bars, beam and floor.
Rhythmic gymnastics is for women only and
consists of routines performed to music with
ribbon, balls, clubs, hoop or rope. Sports
acrobatics is gymnastics with people rather
than apparatus. General gymnastics is non-
446
SPORT AND RECREATION
competitive and is available to all age
groups and to people with special needs.
In recent years the sport has increased
in popularity, particularly among school-
children, and there are now about 1,000
clubs with some 79,000 members. The
British Amateur Gymnastics Association is
the governing body for men and women
gymnasts in Britain; the Welsh, Scottish
and Northern Ireland Associations are
affiliated to it, and the independent English
and British Schools’ Gymnastic
Associations are under its control.
Highland Games
Scottish Highland Games, at which sports,
dancing and piping competitions take place,
attract large numbers of spectators from all
over the world. The sports include tossing
the caber, putting the weight and throwing
the hammer. Among better-known
Highland Games are the annual Braemar
Gathering, the Argyllshire and Cowal
Gatherings and a meeting at Aboyne.
Hockey (Field and Indoor)
Variants of hockey have been played in
Britain for at least five centuries. The
modern game was started in the nineteenth
century by the Hockey Association (of
England), which was founded in 1886 and
acts as the governing body for men’s
hockey. Parallel associations serve in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Throughout England there are 820 men’s
hockey clubs, many with junior sections.
Large numbers of schools also play the
game; 500 are affiliated to the Hockey
Association. Cup competitions and leagues
exist at national, divisional or district, and
club levels both indoors (six-a-side) and
outdoors, and there are regular
international matches.
The controlling body of women’s
hockey in England is the All England
Women’s Hockey Association (founded in
1895), to which are affiliated some 950
clubs and about 2,500 schools; separate
associations regulate the sport in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. League,
county, club and school championships for
both outdoor and indoor hockey are played
annually in England. The first international
women’s hockey match took place in 1896.
Regular international matches are played, one
of which is held each year at Wembley
Stadium.
Men’s and women’s hockey are Olympic
sports; at the 1988 Games the British men’s
team won a gold medal.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two forms—flat racing
(throughout the year) and steeplechasing and
hurdle racing (normally from August to early
June). The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the Two Thousand
Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas,
both run at Newmarket; the Oaks (Epsom);
and the St Leger (Doncaster). The most
important steeplechase and hurdle race
meeting is the National Hunt Festival
Meeting held at Cheltenham in March. The
Grand National, run at Aintree, near
Liverpool, is the world’s best-known
steeplechase and dates from 1837.
The Jockey Club administers all horse
racing in Britain. Its rules are the basis of
turf procedure and it also licenses
racecourses. Racing takes place on most days,
excluding Sundays, throughout the year.
About 13,000 horses are in training. British
thoroughbreds continue to be a source of the
world’s best bloodstock.
Ice Skating
Ice skating became popular in Britain in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
and takes three main forms: ice dancing,
figure skating and speed-skating. The
governing body for the sport is the National
Skating Association of Great Britain,
founded in 1879. Participation in ice skating
is concentrated among the under-25s. There
are over 55 ice rinks in Britain, a relatively
small number compared with many other
European countries. In spite of this, British
couples have won the world ice dance
championship 17 times.

Judo
Judo, an individual combat sport derived
from the ancient Japanese art of ju-jutsu, is
growing rapidly in popularity in Britain, as a
sport and general fitness training method
and self-defence technique. Men
and women take part in judo at all levels.
Dennis Stewart won a bronze medal in the
under-95-kg class at the 1988 Olympics, and
at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland in
1990 England won 14 gold and two bronze
medals and Scotland one gold, three silver
and four bronze medals. Recent leading
British exponents of the sport include Karen
Briggs, Brian Jacks, Neil Adams, Neil
Eckersley, Ann Hughes and Diane Bell.
More than 900 judo clubs are registered with
the British Judo Association, which is the
official governing body of the sport
throughout Britain.
Keep Fit
Keep fit classes aim to improve stamina,
strength and suppleness through a variety of
fitness and creative movement activities. The
Keep Fit Association, formed in 1956,
receives funding from the Sports Council to
promote physical fitness and a positive
attitude to health in England. Its national
certificated training scheme for keep fit
teachers is recognised by local education
authorities throughout Britain. Autonomous
associations serve Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
Martial Arts
A broad range of martial arts, mainly derived
from Japan, the People’s Republic of China,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea, has been
introduced into Britain during the twentieth
century. It includes karate (the most popular
of the martial arts), kung fu, aikido and
kendo. Following the increase in interest in
the 1960s and 1970s, the Martial Arts
Commission was established in 1977 to
develop and control martial arts and maintain
high standards of safety. The Commission is
made up of representatives from 16 national
governing bodies, the Sports Council and the
education and local authority sectors. It has
130,000 affiliated members.
Motor and Motor-cycle Sports
Motor racing and rallying, and motor-cycle
racing, are popular spectator sports in
Britain. The governing body for four-
wheeled motor sport is the RAC (Royal
Automobile Club) Motor Sports Association.
The Association issues licences for a variety
of motoring competitions and organises the
Lombard RAC Rally, an event in the contest
for the World Rally Championship, and the
British Grand Prix, held at the Silverstone
racing circuit as part of the Formula One
World Motor Racing Championship.
British car constructors including Lotus,
McLaren and Williams have enjoyed
outstanding successes in Grand Prix racing,
and Britain has had six world champion
motor racing drivers. The British driver
Nigel Mansell has won a total of 21 Grand
Prix races. Other popular types of motor
sport include autocross, drag racing and
karting.
Motor-cycle sport, governed by the Auto-
Cycle Union in England and Wales and the
Scottish Auto-Cycle Union and Motor Cycle
Union of Ireland (in Northern Ireland),
caters for all forms of competition on two,
three or four wheels, from low-speed trials to
Grand Prix road racing. The major events of
the year are the Isle of Man TT races, the
British Road Race Grand Prix, the Ulster
Grand Prix and other world championship
events for trials, moto-cross, speedway and
track racing. The Auto-Cycle Union
provides off-road training by approved
instructors for riders of all ages.
Mountaineering
All forms of mountaineering, which includes
hill-walking and rock-climbing, are growing
in popularity. There are around 100,000
rock-climbers and 700,000 hill-walkers,
whose representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council; separate bodies
serve Scotland and Ireland.
Britain can claim to have invented the
sports of rock-climbing and alpine-climbing.
448
SPORT AND RECREATION
The first recorded rock-climbs in Britain
were made more than 100 years ago, and the
Alpine Club, founded in 1857 and based in
London, is the oldest mountaineering club in
the world. British mountaineers have played
a leading role in the exploration of the
world’s great mountain ranges.
Two national centres for mountain
activities are run by the Sports Council: one
at Plas-y-Brenin in north Wales and the
other at Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore in
Scotland. Popular areas for rock-climbing are
south-west England, the Peak District of
Derbyshire, the Lake District in north-west
England, Wales and the Highlands of
Scotland.
Britain’s best-known mountaineer is Chris
Bennington, who has climbed Everest and
led many successful expeditions throughout
the world. Other influential British
mountaineers include Doug Scott, Joe
Brown, Don Whillans, Johnny Dawes and
Lord Hunt.
Climbing on artificial structures is gaining
in popularity and has developed into the
sport of competition climbing. The first
competition world climbing champion was
Simon Nadin, who took the title in 1989.
Netball
Netball was introduced into England in 1895.
It was first developed in the United States as
an outdoor exercise. More than 60,000 adults
play netball regularly in England and a
further 1 million participants come from
schools. The sport is played almost
exclusively by women and girls both indoors
and outdoors.
The All England Netball Association,
formed in 1926, is the governing body for
the sport in England. The English Schools’
Netball Association is responsible for the
sport in schools. Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland have their own governing
bodies.
Rowing
Rowing is taught in many schools, colleges
and rowing dubs (including women’s clubs)
throughout Britain. The governing body of
the sport in England is the Amateur Rowing
Association; similar bodies regulate the sport
in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. There are
about 500 rowing clubs, and each year over
300 regattas and head races are held in
England, Wales and Scotland under
Association rules.
1 he University Boat Race, between eight-
oared crews from Oxford and Cambridge,
has been rowed on the Thames almost every
spring since 1836. The Head of the River
Race, also on the Thames, is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the world, with
more than 420 eights racing in procession.
At the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire,
founded in 1839, crews from all over the
world compete each July in various kinds of
race over a straight course of 1 mile 550
yards (about 21 km).
The National Water Sports Centre at
Holme Pierrepont, near Nottingham (see
p 438), has a rowing course of Olympic
2,000-metre standard, as does Strathclyde
Park in west-central Scotland. Britain won
the gold medal in the men’s coxless pairs at
the 1988 Olympic Games. At the World
Championships held in Vienna in August
1991 British rowers gained two gold medals.
Rugby Football
Rugby football takes its name from Rugby
School, in Warwickshire, where it is believed
to have originated in 1823. Since 1895 the
game has been played according to two
different codes: rugby union (a 15-a-side
game) is played by amateurs and rugby
league (a 13-a-side game) by professionals as
well as amateurs.
Rugby union is played under the auspices
of the Rugby Football Union in England and
parallel bodies in Wales, Scotland and
Ireland. Important domestic competitions
include the divisional and county
championships in England; the league and
national club knock-out competitions in
England and Wales; and the National League
and Inter-District Championships in
Scotland. 1 he Five Nations Tournament
between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland
and France is contested each year, and
overseas tours are undertaken by the national
449
BRITAIN 1992: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
sides and by the British Lions, a team
representing Great Britain and Ireland. In
1987 teams from 16 countries competed for
the first time in a world cup competition
held in Australia and New Zealand. The
final rounds of the next one will be staged in
Britain and France in October and
November 1991.
Seven-a-side rugby union has a strong
following. Tournaments include the
Middlesex Sevens, which is held every year
at Twickenham.
Rugby league, played mainly in the north
of England, is enjoying unprecedented
popularity as a spectator sport. The
governing body of the professional game is
the Rugby Football League, which sends
touring teams representing Great Britain to
Australia, New Zealand and Papua New
Guinea; annual matches are also played
against France. The Challenge Cup Final,
the major club match of the season, is played
at Wembley Stadium in London.
The amateur game is governed by the
British Amateur Rugby League Association.
Matches between England and France are
held each year and tours are arranged to
Australia and New Zealand. A national
league consisting of ten leading clubs was
formed in 1986, and a second division came
into existence in 1989.
Sailing
Sailing has always been popular in Britain,
and the Royal Yachting Association, the
governing body for the sport, has more than
70,000 members and 1,500 clubs and classes.
Sailing in dinghies, motor yachts,
windsurfers, powerboats and cruisers takes
place at clubs throughout Britain. At the
1988 Olympics Mike McIntyre and Bryn
Vaile gained a gold medal in the ‘Star’ class.
Skiing
Skiing takes place in Scotland from
December to May and also at several English
locations when there is sufficient snow. The
five established winter sports areas in
Scotland are Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee,
the Lecht and Aonach Mor, all of which
have a full range of ski-lifts, ski-tows and
chair-lifts as well as professional instructors.
Over 115 artificial ski-slopes are also in
constant use throughout Great Britain, and
interest in cross-country skiing has been
increasing. Britain has nearly 300 ski clubs,
and it is estimated that L5 million people
take part in the sport.
The governing body of the sport is the
British Ski Federation, and there are separate
national councils for England, Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
Snooker and Billiards
The character of the present game of
billiards was established in Britain at the end
of the seventeenth century. Snooker, a more
varied game invented by the British in India
in 1875, has greatly increased in popularity
and become a major spectator sport as a
result of heavy television coverage of the
professional tournaments. It is estimated that
between 7 and 8 million people now play the
game. British players have an outstanding
record in snooker and have dominated the
major professional championships. The main
tournament is the annual Embassy World
Professional Championship, held in
Sheffield. British winners include Steve
Davis (1981, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1988 and
1989), Joe Johnson (1986), Dennis Taylor
(1985), Alex Higgins (1972 and 1982),
Stephen Hendry (1990) and John Parrot
(1991). Mike Russell won the World
Professional Billiards Championship in
July 1991.
The controlling body for the non¬
professional game is the Billiards and
Snooker Control Council, which holds the
copyright of the rules. The World
Professional Billiards and Snooker
Association is responsible for professional
players, and organises professional events.
A growing number of women play
snooker and billiards. Their representative
body is the World Ladies Billiards and
Snooker Association, with around 250
members. A women’s world snooker
championship is played every year in
London, and the World Masters event,
staged in Birmingham, embraces men’s
450
SPORT AND RECREATION
and women’s singles and doubles as
well as mixed doubles. The Embassy
World Professional Championship will be
open to women from 1992.
Squash Rackets
Squash rackets originated at Harrow School in
the 1850s. Separate governing bodies are
responsible for the sport in England, Wales,
Scotland and Ireland. The governing body in
England for men’s and women’s squash is the
Squash Rackets Association, formed in 1989.
Squash enjoyed a period of very rapid
growth during the 1970s and remains a
popular sport. There are 9,250 squash courts
in England, and the estimated number of
players in Britain is 2 6 million. The main
tournament is the British Open
Championship. England currently holds the
world title for women’s team squash.
Sub-Aqua
Underwater activities include wreck and reef
exploration, underwater photography, marine
life study and nautical archaeology. The
British Sub-Aqua Club is the governing body
for all underwater techniques. It promotes
safe diving, training, science and sport. The
Club is the largest of its kind in the world,
with over 40,000 members and more than
1,250 branches in Britain and overseas.
Swimming
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people
in Britain, many of whom learn to swim at
public baths, schools or swimming clubs.
Instruction and coaching are provided by
qualified teachers who hold certificates
awarded by the Amateur Swimming
Associations in England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland, to which nearly 2,000
clubs are affiliated. Northern Ireland forms
part of the Irish Amateur Swimming
Association. The Associations control
swimming, diving, synchronised swimming
and water polo championships and
competitions.
For major international competitions, such
as the Olympic Games and the World and
European Championships, England,
Scotland and Wales compete together as
one team under the auspices of the
Amateur Swimming Federation of Great
Britain. At the 1988 Olympics, Britain won
a gold, a silver and a bronze medal. Nick
Gillingham currently holds the short-
course world record for the 200-metres
breastroke.
Table Tennis
The origins of table tennis are uncertain,
but it developed in Britain from around
the middle of the nineteenth century,
becoming an Olympic sport in 1988. In
addition to being one of the most popular
indoor sports for young people, it is played
by a broad age range of adults, with men
outnumbering women. Requiring relatively
simple and inexpensive equipment, table
tennis is played in schools, youth clubs and
private clubs. Britain’s leading professional
player is Desmond Douglas.
The governing body for men’s and
women’s table tennis in England is the
English Table Tennis Association, to
which some 8,000 clubs are affiliated.
There are separate governing bodies in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in
England in 1872 and the first
championships were played at Wimbledon
in 1877. The controlling body in Great
Britain, the Lawn Tennis Association, was
founded in 1888; Northern Ireland forms
part of the Irish Lawn Tennis Association.
The main event of the season is the
annual Wimbledon fortnight, widely
regarded as the most important tennis
event in the world. This draws large
crowds, with the ground at the All
England Club accommodating around
30,000 spectators. There are also national
and county championships and national
competitions for boys’ and girls’ schools.
The Federation Cup tournament involving
women’s teams from leading tennis nations
was held in Nottingham in July 1991.

Tenpin Bowling
Tenpin bowling is played at some 1,500
indoor bowling centres throughout Britain.
More than 25,000 people belong to the sport’s
governing body, the British Tenpin Bowling
Association.
Volleyball
Volleyball was established in Britain in the
1950s, having first been played in the United
States at the end of the nineteenth century.
The number of registered players in Britain
grew substantially in the 1980s, with men at
first far outnumbering women; today, of the
total of 25,000 registered players, about
11,000 are women. Volleyball is popular
among schoolchildren and university and
college students. Mini-volley is a version of
the game adapted to the abilities of children
under 13. Although volleyball can be played
outdoors, it is normally played in indoor
sports halls.
The English Volleyball Association
(formed in 1971), the Scottish Volleyball
Association (formed in 1964), the Welsh
Volleyball Association (re-established in 1981)
and the Northern Ireland Volleyball
Association (formed in 1970) act as the sport’s
governing bodies for both men and women.
GAMBLING
Various forms of commercial betting and
gaming are permitted in Britain under strict
regulations. In 1990-91 the total money
staked, excluding gaming machines, was
estimated at £10,000 million.
Betting takes place mainly on horse or
greyhound racing, and on football matches,
usually through football pools. Racing bets
may be made at racecourses and greyhound
tracks, or through some 10,000 licensed off-
course betting offices which take about 90
per cent of the money staked. A form of
pool betting—totalisator betting—is
organised on course by the Horserace
Totalisator Board (HTB). Bookmakers
and the HTB contribute a levy to the
Horserace Betting Levy Board, which
promotes the improvement of horse breeds,
advancement of veterinary science and
better horse racing.
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts
was set up by the pools promoters in 1991
to channel funds to benefit athletics, sport
and games (and the arts). The pools
promoters will pay the Foundation amounts
equivalent to a proposed reduction in pool
betting duty in addition to other donations
collected by them.
Gaming includes the playing of casino
and card games, gaming machines and
bingo. There are 120 licensed casinos
operating in Britain, 21 of them in London.
An estimated 3 million people, mainly
women, play bingo in commercial bingo
halls.
In addition, legislation allows local
authorities and certain other bodies to hold
lotteries.

handbook has an unrivalled reputation for
comprehensive coverage and factual
accuracy. Compiled by the Central Office of
Information with the co-operation of
government departments and other agencies,
it is updated every year and includes the
latest facts and figures on most aspects of
British life. Britain 1992 covers topical issues
such as the environment, the revival of inner
cities, and the harnessing and efficient use
of various sources of energy. Other chapters
provide information on social and economic
issues, overseas relations and defence,
education, the legal system and much
besides.
Illustrated with colour plates, numerous
