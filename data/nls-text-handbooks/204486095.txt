Introduction
Britain: an official handbook, 1967, is the eighteenth in the series
prepared and extensively revised each year by the Reference Division of the
Central Office of Information with the co-operation of other government
departments and of many national organisations.
The handbook, which is the mainstay of the reference facilities provided
by the British Information Services in many countries, was at first only
available overseas in a limited free edition. In 1954 it was placed on sale
throughout the world and it has since become widely known as an established
work of reference.
This 1967 edition, which covers events up to September 1966, gives, like
its predecessors, a factual account of the administration and the national
economy of the United Kingdom. It describes the activities of many of the
national institutions, both official and unofficial, and shows the part played
by the Government in the life of the community.
The handbook does not claim to be comprehensive, nor does it attempt
to cover Britain’s participation in Commonwealth or world affairs. The
factual and statistical information it contains is compiled from official and
other authoritative sources, and, while most sections of the book relate to the
United Kingdom as a whole, facts and figures for England, Wales, Scotland,
and Northern Ireland are also given separately when relevant.
Readers who require more detailed information should consult the Annual
Abstract of Statistics and the Monthly Digest of Statistics, issued by the Central
Statistical Office, and also other government publications and standard
works of reference, some of which are listed in the bibliography at the end
of the handbook. Readers are asked to note that the Central Office of
Information reference documents listed in the bibliography as free and
marked with an asterisk are available free of charge only at British Information
Offices overseas; they can, however, be obtained in the United Kingdom
from the Reference Division, Central Office of Information, on payment of
a small charge.

THE LAND AND THE
PEOPLE
THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
The British Isles form a group lying off the north-west coast of Europe with
a total area of about 121,600 square miles. The largest islands are Great
Britain proper (comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland)
and Ireland (comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west
are the Isles of Scilly; off North Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is
fringed by numerous islands and to the far north are the important groups
of the Orkneys and Shetlands. All these form administrative counties or parts
of counties of the mainland, but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the
Channel Islands between Great Britain and France have a large measure of
administrative autonomy and are not part of England, Wales, Scotland or
Northern Ireland.
England (excluding the county of Monmouth on the Welsh border) has a
total area (including inland water) of 50,327 square miles and is divided into
39 geographical or 46 administrative counties; Wales (including Monmouth¬
shire), with a total area of 8,017 square miles, has 13 counties; Scotland,
including its 186 inhabited islands, has a total area of 30,411 square miles
and is divided into 33 counties; and Northern Ireland, consisting of six
counties, has a total area of 5>459 square miles. Together, these counties
constitute the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with
a total area of 94,214 square miles. The total land area of the United Kingdom
(excluding inland water) is 93,018 square miles: England, 50,051; Wales and
Monmouthshire, 7,966; Scotland, 29,795; and Northern Ireland, 5,206 square
miles.
Care must be taken when studying British statistics to note whether they
refer to England as defined above, to England and Wales (considered together
for many administrative and other purposes), to Great Britain, which com¬
prises England, Wales and Scotland, or to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The position is further complicated by the fact that the county of Monmouth
is sometimes included with England. United Kingdom statistics and other
data sometimes include the Isle of Man, 227 square miles, and the Channel
Islands, 75 square miles, which strictly are not part of the United Kingdom
but are dependencies of the Crown. Since southern Ireland became indepen¬
dent, official statistics do not normally refer to the British Isles as a whole.
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o Groats, is in latitude 58° qo * The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old Observatory of Greenwich (London), while the
easternmost point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost
point of Ireland is approximately io° 30' West. It is just under 600 miles
in a straight line from the south coast of Britain to the extreme north and

rather over 300 miles across in the widest part. Owing to the numerous bays
and inlets no point in the British Isles is as much as 75 miles from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are everywhere shallow—usually less
than 50 fathoms (300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental shelf.
To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly
from 600 feet to 3,000 feet. These shallow waters are important because they
provide excellent fishing grounds as well as breeding grounds for the fish.
The North Atlantic Current, the drift of warm water which reaches the
islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out over the shelf and its ameliorating
effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect of tidal movement is also
increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite their small area, the British Isles contain rocks of all the main
geological periods. In Great Britain the newer rocks, which are less resistant
to weather and have thus been worn down to form low land, lie to the south
and east, and the island can therefore be divided roughly into two main
regions, Lowland Britain and Highland Britain.
In Lowland Britain the newer and softer rocks of southern and eastern
England have been eroded into a rich plain, more often rolling than flat and
rising to chalk and limestone hills, but hardly ever reaching a thousand feet
above sea level. The boundaries of this region run roughly from the mouth
of the Tyne in the north-east of England to the mouth of the Exe in the
south-west.
Highland Britain comprises the whole of Scotland (including the hills and
moors of southern Scotland as well as the mountains of the Scottish Highlands,
which extend from the Forth-Clyde valley to the extreme north-west), the
Lake District in north-west England, the broad central upland known as the
Pennines, almost the whole of Wales, and the south-western peninsula of
England coinciding approximately with the counties of Devon and Cornwall.
Highland Britain contains all the mountainous parts1 of Great Britain and
extensive uplands lying above one thousand feet. This high ground, however,
is not continuous but is interspersed with valleys and plains. Geologically
the mountains and hills consist mainly of outcrops of very old rocks (archaean
and palaeozoic), while the top strata in the valleys and plains are mainly more
recent (carboniferous age) and similar to those in the northern and western
parts of Lowland Britain.
These carboniferous strata are rich in minerals and include the coal
measures which have been the foundation of Britain s industrial expansion.
The outcrops and shallow seams of coal which have now largely been exhausted
were found on the edge of the plains and up the valleys leading to the high
land. Most of the present deep coal workings underlie the fertile lowlands.
Towards the end of Britain’s long geological history, when the ancestors
of present-day man had already settled in the country, came the great Ice
Age, and at one period or another during this time the whole of Britain north
of a line joining the river Thames and the Bristol Channel was covered by
ice caps and ice sheets. The ice naturally accumulated on the higher ground
and swept from the mountains of Scotland, northern England and Wales
any loose rock or soil which had previously been formed, so that, when the
ice eventually disappeared, the hills stood out as barren rocky areas, while a
thick mantle of glacial debris—boulders, boulder-clay, sands and gravels—
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 4,406 feet; in Wales, Snowdon,
3,560 feet; and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District, Cumberland), 3,210 feet.
The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard, 2,796 feet.

lay distributed widely over the lower ground. The ice had blocked up previous
drainage channels and left large lakes, which have since gradually dried up,
leaving deposits of sand, silt and mud, often affording soils of great fertility.
In Ireland, where the solid rocks are covered deeply by the debris left by
the ice sheets, the great central plain has large boggy areas, due to interruption
of the previous natural drainage. The mountains and hill masses of Ireland
are irregularly placed around central lowlands; in the higher parts the
moorland vegetation resembles that of the higher parts of Highland Britain.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety
of scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances,
particularly on the coasts. The ancient rocks of Highland Britain often reach
the coast in towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as
along much of the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are
notable features in other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of
Land’s End; the limestone masses and slates of the Pembrokeshire coast in
South Wales; the red sandstone of St. Bees Head on the Cumberland coast;
and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the island of Staffa in the Inner
Hebrides. Even around Lowland Britain there are striking contrasts. In some
parts the soft, white limestone—the chalk—forms the world-famous white
cliffs of Dover or the Needles off the Isle of Wight; while other parts of the
south and south-east coastline have beaches of sand or shingle. The eastern
coast of England between the Humber and the Thames estuary is for the
most part low-lying, and for hundreds of years some stretches of it have been
protected against the sea by embankments. These have occasionally been
breached, as in the flood disaster of January 1953, which was caused by the
abnormal concurrence of violent gales and exceptionally high tides.
The marked tidal movement around the British Isles sweeps away much
of the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries
of the short British rivers1 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. It lies in middle latitudes
to the north-west of the great continental land mass of Eurasia, but the
prevailing winds are south-westerly and the weather from day to day is
controlled mainly by a succession of depressions from the Atlantic which,
moving in a generally easterly or north-easterly direction, pass over or near
the British Isles. The climate is subject to frequent changes but to few
extremes of temperature. Although it is largely determined by that of the
eastern Atlantic, occasionally during the winter months easterly winds may
bring a cold, dry, continental type of weather which, once established, may
persist for many days or even weeks. During the summer months the Azores
high pressure system usually extends its influence north-eastwards towards
north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course, often
passing entirely to the north of the British Isles.
In Britain, south-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an
easterly quarter the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as
south-westerly ones although easterly winds are appreciably more frequent
in the spring than at any other time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction
may differ markedly from the general direction owing to local topography.
Winds are generally stronger in the north than in the south of the British
Isles, stronger on the coasts than inland, and stronger in the west than in the
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only 210 and
200 miles long respectively.

east. The strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the average speed at
Lerwick, Shetland Islands, varies from about 22 m.p.h. in January to about
14 m.p.h. in August, while at Kew Observatory, on the western outskirts of
London, the average speed varies from about 10 m.p.h. in January to about
7 m.p.h. in August. The stormiest region of the British Isles is along the
north-west coast, with over 30 gales a year; south-east England and the east
Midlands are the least stormy, with gales occurring on about 2 days a year
inland and on some 15 to 20 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level the mean annual temperature ranges from 47° F. (8° C.) in
the Hebrides to 520 F. (ii° C.) in the extreme south-west of England; it is
slightly lower in the eastern part of the country in the same latitude. The
mean monthly temperature in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetlands),
ranges from 390 F. (40 C.) during the winter (December, January and
February) to 530 F. (120 C.) during the summer (June, July and August):
the corresponding figures for Jersey (Channel Islands), in the extreme south,
are 430 F. (6° C.) and 63° F. (170 C.). The average range^of temperature
between winter and summer varies from 150 F. to 230 F. (7°-i20 C.), being
greatest inland in the eastern part of the country. During a normal summer,
the temperature occasionally rises above 8o° F. (270 C.) in the south, but
temperatures of 90° F. (320 C.) and above are infrequent. Extreme minimum
temperatures depend to a large extent on local conditions, but 20 F. ( 7 C.)
may occur on a still, clear winter’s night, io° F. (—12° C.) is rare, and
0° F. (- 180 C.) or below has been recorded only during exceptionally severe
winter periods.
The British Isles as a whole have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches, while
England alone has about 34 inches. The geographical distribution of annual
rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the Atlantic, the
mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain than the plains
of the south and east. Between 150 and 200 inches of rain fall on the summits
of Snowdon and Ben Nevis during the average year, whereas some places in
the south-east of England record less than 20 inches. Rain is fairly well
distributed throughout the year, but, on the average, March to June are the
driest months and October to January the wettest, the former period of four
months having about 60 per cent of the rainfall of the latter. A period of as
long as three weeks without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to
limited areas. In successive years, however, remarkably contrasting weather
conditions are sometimes experienced.
The distribution of sunshine over the British Isles shows a general decrease
from south to north, a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with
altitude. During May, June and July—the months of longest daylight—the
mean daily duration of sunshine varies from five and a half hours in western
Scotland to seven and a half hours in the extreme south-east of England;
during the months of shortest daylight—November, December and January—
sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a day in some parts
of the Highlands of Scotland and in the Peak District (Derbyshire) and two
hours a day on the south coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog
in winter.1 Until about 1956 dense fogs containing smoke and other pollution
from the burning of coal used to occur from time to time in London and
1 The number of mornings with less than 1,100 yards visibility ranges from less than 5
a year in areas of lowest incidence to about 55 in areas of the highest.

other centres of population. Since then, as a result of changes in fuel usage
and the operation of clean air legislation, these fogs have become much less
severe.
Many parts of the surface of Highland Britain have only thin, poor soils,
with the result that large stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands
of Scotland, the Pennines, the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in
parts of north-east and south-west England. In most areas the farmer has
cultivated only the valley lands and the plains where soils are deeper and
richer; villages and towns are often separated by uplands with few if any
habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of poor soil or rocky land, almost the
whole of Lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area
except where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land
drainage systems have been developed through the centuries to bring under
cultivation the fertile soil of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and
similar areas in East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
natural vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably
covered the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands,
forests of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open
moorland. In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively
diminished and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry
Commission in the past 40 years, woodlands now occupy only about 7 per cent
of the surface of the country. The greatest density of woodland occurs in the
north and east of Scotland, in some parts of south-east England and in
Monmouthshire on the Welsh border. Midland Britain appears to be well
wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees. The most
common trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine and birch.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Most of Britain, however, is agricultural land, of
which about a third is arable and the rest pasture and meadow, a varied
semi-natural vegetation composed of indigenous grasses and flowering plants.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or wire fences
and, specially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents
a pattern of contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate of Britain and
the even distribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely
dry up, grassland is green throughout the year and full of wild flowers from
spring to autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month in which some flowers
may not be found in hedgerows and sheltered woodland glades.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of north-western
Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals,
including the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct;
but red deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish High¬
lands and on Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are
found in Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow
deer (which are probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks
and are wild in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen;
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
there are foxes in most rural areas, and otters are found along many rivers
and streams. Both common and grey seals may be seen on various parts of
the coast, though not usually in the same localities. Smaller mammals include
mice, rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels (the imported grey
more numerous than the native red), hares, rabbits, coypu, weasels and stoats.
There are about 430 species of birds, including many song-birds. About
230 species are resident and the rest are regular visitors to Britain. The
chaffinch and the blackbird are probably the most numerous and are widely
and evenly distributed, but sparrows usually predominate near houses, and
huge flocks of starlings, which gather at certain seasons, sometimes congregate
in London and other large towns. These and some other species of small
birds have been on the increase for several decades owing to their success in
adapting themselves to a man-made environment, while small birds in
general have benefited by more considerate treatment from the public. 1 he
number of large birds, on the other hand, has tended to decline, except for
game birds which are specially preserved, such as pheasants and partridges,
and the red grouse which is found in moorland areas.
Many species of gulls and other sea-birds nest round the coast and gulls
often fly far inland in search of food or shelter in rough weather. The drainage
and reclamation of marshlands have diminished the natural habitat of duck,
geese and other aquatic birds. Such birds, however, now frequent reservoirs,
gravel pits and sewage farms in addition to the nature reserves and bird
sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and birds shot for sport in the open season.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Of these, only
one species of newt and the common viviparous lizard are indigenous; the
other species of reptiles and amphibians that are now firmly established came
to Britain from Europe. There are no snakes in Ireland.
River and lake fish include salmon, trout, sea-trout, perch, roach, dace,
grayling and pike.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects, most ot them small,
in the British Isles. Among the largest are the rare swallowtail butterfly
(3 to 4 inches) and the stag beetle (2^ inches). The insect fauna in Britain is
less varied than that of continental Europe and lacks a number of common
European species. With modern methods of pest control, extensive insect
damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks of diseases commonly spread
by insect vectors are exceptional in Britain but there is some anxiety among
naturalists that chemical protection against insects may be reducing the
creatures which feed on them, and their predators in turn.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit the British Isles are descended mainly from
the people who inhabited them nearly nine centuries ago. The last of a long
succession of invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of
Europe were the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian
Vikings who, after settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French,
and assimilating the French language and customs, crossed to England and
conquered it in 1066.

THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE y
It is neither possible nor suitable to attempt in this chapter to estimate the
relative importance of various early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans,
Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen, including the Danes—in the ancestry of the
present English, Scots, Welsh and Irish. It is significant, however, that over
most of England and the Lowlands of Scotland the language which soon
came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales,
Cornwall, the Isle of Man, the Highlands of Scotland and in Ireland
(see p. 17).
The available records do not permit of any precise estimates of the size of
population or of the extent or direction of population movement until the
beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the end
of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about two million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century a reasonable contemporary
estimate put the population of England and Wales at 5^ million and that of
Scotland at about one million. The main factor in this gradual growth of
population was a slow natural increase, the rate of which was retarded in
Britain, as in all countries before the development of medical science, by
high death rates and, in particular, by very high infant and maternal mortality.
Immigration from the continent of Europe has been an influence at certain
times and immigration from other Commonwealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century, information about the
British people—their number, sex, age, geographical distribution, births,
deaths, marriages, occupations, language and family structure—is relatively
plentiful and reliable. Most of it is derived from two main sources: the regular
flow of vital statistics, that is statistical information based on statutory
registration of births, marriages and deaths, and the periodic census of
population which gives a national snapshot at a particular moment of time.
The compilation of complete records of births, marriages and deaths is
carried out by registrars of births and deaths, some of whom also act as
registrars of marriages. In England and Wales there are about 500 super¬
intendent registrars in charge of registration districts and about 1,200 registrars
in charge of sub-districts. Registrars and superintendent registrars are
appointed by the county, county borough and metropolitan borough councils
but they act under the instruction of the Registrar General for England and
Wales, who is in charge of a central government department, the General
Register Office, concerned with regulating the registration of births, deaths
and marriages, with planning and carrying out population censuses, and
with the compilation and analysis of population and vital statistics. There
are corresponding authorities1 and similar arrangements (differing only
in detail) in Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the
Isle of Man.
Censuses of the people of Great Britain have been taken regularly every
ten years since 1801, except that there was no census in 1941 because of the
war. The latest census covering the whole of the British Isles was taken in
1961 by the appropriate authorities in England and Wales, Scotland, Northern
Ireland, the islands of the British seas and the Irish Republic. As well as
total population figures and local reports, tables have been published on
1 The various authorities are: the General Register Office, Somerset House, London;
1 rT^enera^ ReglStrY Office, Edinburgh; the General Register Division of the Ministry
ot binance of the Government of Northern Ireland; the Governments of Jersey of
Guernsey and its associated islands, and of the Isle of Man.
8 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
birthplace and nationality, age and marital condition, housing tenure and
household arrangements and also reports on incidence of Welsh speaking
in Wales and Monmouthshire and on scientific and technological qualifications.
Further tables have been published on household composition, occupation
and industry, workplace and education, and are expected on migration and
fertility. .
Because the traditional ten-year interval is now too long to wait for the
firm figures needed by Government and business for decision making, which
only a census can give, censuses were taken throughout Great Britain (on a
sample basis) and Northern Ireland in 1966.
The short demographic account of the United Kingdom given in this
chapter is based mainly on census reports and on the regular returns of births,
marriages and deaths, though some use has been made of other special
investigations, including the Reports of the Royal Commission on Population.
Total The enumerated population of the United Kingdom at the censuses taken on
Population 23rd April 1961, was 52,708,934, excluding persons in the Isle of Man and
the Channel Islands, which are not strictly parts of the United Kingdom.
The 1966 survey figures were not available at the time of going to press.
The population had increased by nearly 2^ million since 1951’ about
million since 1931, by about 8| million since 1921 and by about 451 million
—or about sevenfold—since 1700. The main causes of this increase were a
progressive reduction in death rates and a continuance of high birth rates
into the beginning of the twentieth century. Between June 1961 and June 1962
the population increased by 1 per cent, faster than at any time in the past 40
years, owing to natural increase and exceptionally high net gain from migration.
If a census had been taken in mid-1965 it is estimated that some 54,436,000
people would have been enumerated in the United Kingdom (adjusted for
members of the armed forces and others, 54,595,000). On the basis of present
trends it is now expected to go on growing, though probably by slightly undei
the 1961-62 rate of increase.
The population density of the United Kingdom as a whole is one of the
highest in the world: it was approximately 554 persons per square mile at
the time of the 1961 censuses; but in England there were approximately
863 persons per square mile.
Birth and Death For most of the nineteenth century the annual birth rate was about 35 per
Rates thousand of the population, and the annual death rate was just over 20 per
thousand. Both birth and death rates fell over the last 30 years of the century,
but the natural increase of the population changed but little. It rose from
12 per thousand in 1851 to 15 per thousand in 1881, and fell to 11 per thousand
in 1901.
These fertile years, with their comparatively high death rates in all age
groups, produced a population of low average age. At each successive census
the population of any age group exceeded the corresponding figure at the
preceding census, while the short expectation of life further reduced the ratio
of older to younger persons. When, therefore, death rates in all age groups
fell by an average of about a third, as they did between 1880 and 1910)
the results were a very low general death rate, which helped to maintain the
population increase in spite of a fall in the birth rate, and a gradual increase
in the average age of the population.
1 This commission was appointed in 1944; its main report was published in 1949.

BIRTH RATES AND DEATH RATES
After the first world war the birth rate fell to less than half the nineteenth
century rate. Even so, the population continued to increase slowly, though
its average age rose more rapidly.
Owing to the changing age composition, the general death rate has remained
nearly stationary since 1920 at around 12 per thousand of the population
though death rates have continued to fall heavily in every age group, particu¬
larly among pre-school children, school children, and adults in their thirties
and forties, with a consequent lengthening of the expectation of life from about
50 years at birth in 1900 to 1910 to about 71 years at birth in mid-1963. Since
1933 the steady fall in the number of births has ceased. During the second
world war the birth rate began to rise and reached a temporary post-war peak
of 20-7 per thousand population in 1947. It then receded again to slightly above
the pre-war level in the early 1950s, rose from 1955 to 18-8 in 1964, but was
18-3 per thousand population in 1965. The proportion of illegitimate births,
which reached a peak of 9-1 per cent of all live births in 1945, the last year of
the second world war, fell between 1945 and 1955, when it reached 4-5 per cent;
since then it has been rising again gradually and was about 7 per cent in 1965.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, public and private schemes to make the health services generally
available, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain
on mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.

Mortality from acute infectious diseases and from tuberculosis, and infant
and maternal mortality have declined very sharply. Mortality from the main
acute infectious diseases of childhood is less than a two-hundredth and
mortality from tuberculosis is about one-fifty-fifth of the rate prevailing in the
mid-nineteenth century. Infant mortality (that is deaths of infants under one
year old per thousand live births) has fallen by about 85 per cent since 1900.
Maternal mortality is now only about one-eighteenth of the 1934 rate. The
reported mortality from many of the chronic diseases of middle and old age,
such as cancer of the lung and coronary thrombosis, has risen during the
twentieth century, and this rise, though exaggerated by the improvement in
diagnosis, is at least partly real. Medicine has not yet discovered effective
measures to combat some of these diseases, and improvement in positive
health does not always bring increased immunity or resistance to them.
Over the past 30 years the proportion of the whole population who are
married has risen from 43 to 51 per cent, while the proportion of single
persons in the population over 15 years of age has fallen from nearly a third
to under a quarter. This change has been due mainly to an increase in marriage
rates among men and women in their late teens and early twenties. In 1964
some 57 per cent of the young women aged 20 to 24 were married; in 1931
only 25 per cent were married. Earlier marriage has led to a large increase in
the number of children born to women under 30 years of age and in recent
years has contributed to a substantial acceleration of the total flow of births
into the population.
The fall in birth rates in the latter part of the nineteenth and the early part
of the twentieth centuries was due mainly to a decline in the size of the family
(that is the number of children born per married couple) caused by the spread
of deliberate family limitation. Couples married a hundred years ago produced
on the average rather more than six liveborn children. The decline seems to
have set in with those married in the 1860s, and continued steady until the
average family size for Great Britain fell to below 2-i for those married in
1934-43. It rose again to 2-13 for those married in 1944. Later data suggests
some increase though the present position is not wholly clear since births
began to fall in 1965.
The generation of girls born about 1840, and married mostly between 20
and 30 years later, had about 40 per cent more children than were needed to
replace the original generation, while those born at the beginning of the present
century had only about 70 per cent of the number of children needed for
replacement. Since then the figure has been rising again and seems likely to
exceed full replacement with the generation born during the second world
war. The rise has been due mainly to the increased proportion of women
getting married and of children surviving to adult life.
The effect of the fall in the birth rate was to reduce the ratio of dependent
population to working population. This ratio was at a minimum in th^ I93os•
After 1936 the number of children leaving school for work fell sharply owing
to the drop in the birth rate after 1921, while the population aged over 40
continued to increase and the population aged over 64, born during an era of
high fertility and representing successive generations of steeply rising numbers,
increased very rapidly. The higher birth rates after 1942 arrested the com¬
pensating fall in the number of dependent children and have further reduced
the ratio of working to dependent population.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

Sex Ratio
Migration
At mid-1965 the age distribution of the British population was estimated
as follows:
Under 15 23-3 per cent
15 to 64 64-7 per cent
65 and over .. .. 12-0 per cent
An unusually small proportion of the population of the United Kingdom
(about 25 per cent) is now aged 20 to 39 years. Assuming a continued fall in
death rates and an aggregate net gain from migration of some 20,000 people
a year from the usual age groups, it is estimated that between 1965 and 1980
1. the number of people aged 20 to 39 will increase by about 15 per cent
to about 16 million;
2. the population aged 40 to 64 will decrease by about 6 per cent;
3. the number of old people (over 65) will increase by about 25 per cent
to about 8 million.
Total births of boys naturally exceed those of girls by about 6 per cent, but
stillbirth rates and mortality rates at almost all ages are higher for males, so
that in nearly all countries—and in Britain since records began—women
preponderate among the elderly and outnumber men in the total population.
Formerly indeed women outnumbered men in the United Kingdom in
every age group from adolescence onwards. Recently, however, the fall in
stillbirths and infant mortality has reduced the influence of these factors on
sex ratio so that the age at which women begin to outnumber men has been
advanced and is now about 45. On the other hand, the lengthening of the
expectation of life, which has been rather more marked for women than for
men, has increased the preponderance of women among the elderly—there
are now some five women over 70 years old to every three men—and made it
a weightier factor in the sex ratio of the whole population. This increase
in the number of elderly women, however, does not quite counterbalance
the increase in the number of boys and young men so that the ratio of females
to males has fallen from 108 : 100 in 1951 to 105 : 100 in 1965.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century until the 1930s the balance
of migration was markedly outward. Between 1815 and 1930 well over
20 million people left Britain for destinations outside Europe, mainly in the
Commonwealth and the United States. Many emigrants later returned and
large numbers of Europeans, mainly Russians, Poles, Germans and Hungarians,
entered the British Isles. Nevertheless, the net loss by migration from the
present area of the United Kingdom amounted to some four million between
1871 and 1931. Since then the balance of migration of Britain as a whole
has been inward, though Scotland and Northern Ireland have throughout
continued to have a net outward movement of population to countries
overseas as well as to England and Wales. The main net inflow to Britain
since 1931 occurred in two periods. The first was in the years 1931 to 1940
when emigration was very low, many former emigrants returned, there was
considerable net immigration from the Irish Republic, and extensive
immigration from Europe, including about a quarter of a million refugees
seeking sanctuary in Britain. The second, in the years from 1958 onwards,
resulted from a large increase in net immigration from Commonwealth
countries, particularly West Indian countries and Pakistan. In the three years
1960-62 total net immigration amounted to some 388,000 people, about
three-quarters of them from the Commonwealth and nearly half from the
12
Nationality
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
West Indies. It was in these circumstances that the Government introduced
the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which gave it power to restrict
the number of people from the Commonwealth and, in principle, the Irish
Republic who may immigrate into the United Kingdom without assured
prospects of employment or adequate means of self-support, and to deport
unsuitable immigrants (that is, those convicted of offences and recommended
for deportation by a court of law). Net Commonwealth immigration under
the Act in 1965 was 63,800.
At the 1961 census some 2-1 million residents in England and Wales were
reported definitely to have been born outside the United Kingdom rather
under one-third of them in other Commonwealth countries, about the same
number in the 26 counties now forming the Irish Republic, and the rest in
foreign countries, notably Germany, Poland, the United States and Russia.
The total number born outside the United Kingdom had increased by about
40 per cent since 1951, largely because of the inflow from Commonwealth
countries in the West Indies, Asia and Africa. Residents in England or
Wales born in these countries had increased from over 170,000 to about
530,000. In Scotland, under 115,000 residents had been born outside the
United Kingdom (about a third of whom were born in the Irish Republic). In
Northern Ireland the number of residents born outside the United Kingdom
is relatively small.
It has been estimated that there are currently up to a million Commonwealth
immigrants in Britain, many of them living in the congested parts of industrial
cities such as London, Birmingham and Bradford. They are making an
important contribution to the economy and public services by relieving
shortages of labour that would otherwise be critical; but the arrival of large
numbers during a relatively short period, and their concentration in certain
areas of full employment, has led to a suddenly increased demand for housing
where it is already scarce and caused additional pressure on the social services.
The central Government, local authorities and a variety of social agencies are
seeking in different ways to help immigrants and other citizens through this
period of adjustment and to deal with special social problems as they become
evident (see pp. 127 and 431).
British emigrants from Britain to Commonwealth countries in 1964 num¬
bered about 140,000; approximately 62,000 emigrated to foreign countries.
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, with insignificant exceptions,
persons who are born, or whose fathers were born, in the United Kingdom
or in a territory which was a colony of the United Kingdom on 1st January
1949, or at the date of birth if later, or in a United Kingdom registered ship
or aircraft, are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. Citizenship
may also be acquired: by descent (subject to certain requirements) from a
paternal grandfather born in the United Kingdom or Colonies or from a
more remote paternal ancestor in the male line; by registration, for citizens
of Commonwealth member countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor
children and for women married to citizens of the United Kingdom and
Colonies; in consequence of an adoption order; and by naturalisation. The
requirements for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation include five years’
residence in the United Kingdom or Colonies or five years’ Crown service,
good character, a sufficient knowledge of English and the intention to reside
in the United Kingdom or a colony or to remain in Crown service. Just over
23,000 persons acquired citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies
in 1964.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
!3
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizen¬
ship by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another
country; nor does a woman who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and
Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to an alien. Indeed, a citizen cannot
be deprived of his citizenship against his will except in very exceptional
circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisation or registration
as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is, however, at
liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the nationality
or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens. Until the passing
of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, they were free to enter and
remain in the United Kingdom without restrictions of any kind. Similar
treatment has been extended to citizens of the Irish Republic who, in the
United Kingdom, are not aliens.
Distribution of The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that
Population of all other parts of the United Kingdom combined. The distribution of the
population by country, as estimated at mid-1965 and as enumerated by
population censuses back to 1901, is shown in Table 1. The populations of
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were in every case greater in
1961 than in 1951 and in 1951 than in 1931, whereas in the ten years preceding
1931 the population of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland had declined.
The rate of increase in England, however, continues to be higher than in the other
three countries, largely because of migration from these countries to England.
Geography, history and increasing urbanisation have given rise to the
differences between these countries and to an uneven distribution of the
population within them. Table 2 shows the distribution of the population
by urban and rural districts and the populations of the standard adminis¬
trative regions, of the seven major conurbations and 17 larger cities, some of
which are the principal cities included in a conurbation. About 30 million
people live within the central area, about 60 to 65 miles wide and 200 miles
long, which runs approximately from the mouth of the Thames to the mouth
of the Mersey and contains five of the main conurbations, a number of other
sizeable towns and much rich agricultural land. Other areas with large
populations are the central lowlands of Scotland; 1,000 square miles in the
north-east of England from north of the river Tyne down to the river Tees;
south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the English Channel coast from Poole,
in Dorset, eastwards. On the other hand, most of the mountainous parts of
Britain, including much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and the
central Pennine Chain in northern England, are very sparsely populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
increasing. Though few places in the United Kingdom have had any
decrease of population in the past decade, there have been local differences
in the rate of increase. Many places in the midlands and south-east England,
some south-coast areas and some of the most prosperous parts of northern
England, Wales and Scotland have had increases well above the average
national rate, while many of the older industrial towns and remote country
areas in northern England, Wales and Scotland and some coastal resorts have
had relatively small increases. The differences result from the combined effect
of natural increase in almost all areas and net migration towards the expanding
employment opportunities of the midlands and south and towards certain
retirement areas, mainly on the south coast.

THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE

Urban Dispersal
Throughout Britain the population is predominantly urban and suburban,
although there may be access to large parks, commons and other expanses
of open country within the urban area.
During the nineteenth century the labour demands of newly developing
industry drew great numbers from the countryside; by the end of the
century three-quarters of the British population was living in towns and the
large conurbation was already the dominant type of British community. During
the twentieth century the suburbs of the towns in these population centres
have continued to spread and merge. Since 1921 nearly 40 per cent of the
population has lived in the seven great conurbations whose centres are the
cities of London, Manchester (South-East Lancashire), Birmingham and
Wolverhampton (West Midlands), Glasgow (Central Clydeside), Leeds and
Bradford (West Yorkshire), Liverpool (Merseyside), and Newcastle upon
Tyne. Even the 20 per cent of the population who live in areas classed
administratively as rural include many who regularly work, shop or go to
school in towns.1
A development which has been accelerating in recent years is the long-
established tendency for the number of people who actually have their homes
in the inner parts of an area (especially the town or city centre itself) to
decrease, and be balanced or surpassed by the increase of population in and
beyond the outer suburban fringes, where development commonly extends
without a break beyond the administrative boundaries and includes areas
which are administratively rural. For this reason the statistics of conurbations,
comprising continuously built-up, economically and socially interdependent
areas, are in many ways more illuminating than those for urban administrative
areas.
In some cases even the conurbation, as defined for statistical purposes,
does not cover the whole of developments on the outskirts. This applies
most strikingly to London. The population of Greater London showed an
almost continuous decrease from 1951; but there is a broad belt of almost
continuous population increase which now completely encircles it, includes
and passes beyond all existing London new towms and extends along every
major rail and road route from London. This belt contains both commuters,
who have moved their homes but continue to travel to work in inner London,
and people who have changed both home and workplace from inner London
to new or expanded towms. Other areas in which outward movement and
fringe development have been noticeably large are the outer areas of the West
Midlands and Merseyside conurbations and areas on the edges of Bristol,
Derby, Leicester, Norv/ich, Oxford, Portsmouth and Sheffield. Thus it is
that Table 2, as well as showing decreases since 1951 for the urban adminis¬
trative areas of Glasgow and other cities, shows such small increases since
1951 (because of this further spreading out of population) even in the officially
defined conurbations of South-East Lancashire, West Midlands, the West
Riding of Yorkshire, and shows decreases in other conurbations.
Factors in the further dispersal of the last 15 years have been the spread
of car ownership, expansion in public transport serving journeys to work,
private property developments to meet the demand for housing, and planned
transfers of population to the new towns around London, Glasgow, the
West Midlands and Merseyside and to selected expanding towns near to
the great cities.
1 Just over 3 per cent of workers in civil employment are engaged in agriculture.

“ The boundaries of some of the administrative areas have been altered from time to
time. The population figures given relate in general to the areas as these were defined
in the year noted at the head of each column. The figures for conurbations, however,
relate in general as nearly as possible to areas as constituted in 1961; some which differed
greatly have been re-defined.

d As defined for administrative purposes. In most cases these coincide with the economic
planning regions (see p. 246).
e Populations for 1931, 1951 and 1961 relate to an area of 721-7 square miles.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
is the first language of the majority of the population in most of the western
counties and was spoken by 26 per cent of the population at the time of the
1961 census. In Scotland, in 1961, nearly 81,000 persons, mainly in Ross and
Cromarty, Inverness, Argyll, and Lanark, spoke the Scottish form of Gaelic,1
while a few families in Northern Ireland spoke the Irish form of Gaelic.
The Manx and Cornish varieties of Celtic are no longer effectively living
languages, although, in the Isle of Man, Manx is spoken by a few people,
and is used in addition to English for certain official pronouncements.
English is spoken throughout the Channel Islands, but a Norman-French
patois is still also spoken there by some people. French is still the official
language of Jersey, used for ceremonial and official procedure; both French
and English are used in the courts. In Guernsey, however, English is now
used for almost all official proceedings.
A general summary of trends in social organisation, similar in scope to the
foregoing summary of population trends, is not practicable. It may be useful,
however, to review some of the evidence relating to the structure of British
households and social habits in Britain in order to provide a background to
the information given in later chapters on such matters as town and country
planning, housing, and transport.
The great majority of people enumerated in the 1961 census in Great Britain
(nearly 97 per cent) were living in private households2 (usually in families or
on their own). Less than one per cent of the population were in hotels or
boarding houses, about 1-5 per cent in hospitals or homes for the elderly or
disabled, and the remainder not in private households included people in the
Armed Services, in educational institutions and in various places of detention.
1 Most of the islands off the west coast of Scotland where Gaelic is spoken are included
in the counties of Ross and Cromarty, Inverness and Argyll.

Household
Arrangements
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Of the 16J million private households in Great Britain in 1961, 13,475,000
were estimated on the basis of the 1961 census to be of the simplest type,
comprising married couples, single people or lone parents with their children,
if any, and resident domestic servants, if any. More specifically, the 13,475,000
households comprised 7,863,000 married couples or lone parents with
children, of whatever age, 3,655,000 married couples without children, and
1,957,000 people living alone. This represents an increase of 1,942,000 house¬
holds since 1951, when there were 11,533,000 households of the simplest
type, comprising 6,877,000 married couples or lone parents with children of
whatever age and 4,656,000 married couples without children or people living
alone. Altogether some 9,362,000 households were estimated in the 1961
census to be without children under 15 or in full-time education and another
3,154,000 contained only one child. An exact comparison of these figures with
those for 1951 is not available. However, in 1951 there were 8,228,000 house¬
holds without children under 16 (instead of 15), but possibly including older
children in full-time education. Also in 1951 there were 3,080,000 households
with only one child.
The number of households (which has increased by 84 per cent since 1911)
and their small average size reflect a number of factors, including lower
birth rates, increased survival into old age, the higher proportion of married
people in the population and the general assumption that married couples
and old people in good health prefer and are entitled to have their own separate
homes. They are not to be taken as meaning there has been a general
weakening of family feeling, though family ties may link fewer people than
in former times. The volume of travel just before 25th December, the bulk of
which consists of people going to spend Christmas with their relatives, achieves
news value every year; only those involved know the hidden devotion in
thousands of homes where infirm old relatives or handicapped children are
cared for by their families. None the less, the small size of families, coupled
with a considerable degree of movement about the country for the sake of
study, work or housing, do make the role of neighbours and friends with
kindred interests of great importance.
The 16J million households enumerated in the 1961 census in Great Britain
were accommodated in 16 million dwellings, about 6| million of which were
owner occupied, 4 million rented from a local authority or New Town
Corporation and 4 million privately rented. Less than 3 dwellings in 100 in
England and Wales were shared by more than one household in 1961. In
Scotland only 2-6 per cent of households shared a dwelling. Over 96 per cent
of all households in Great Britain had exclusive use of a piped supply of cold
water and 76-5 per cent one of hot water, 73-5 per cent in England and Wales a
fixed bath (about 71 per cent in Scotland) and about 87 per cent in England
and Wales a water-closet (over 82-5 per cent in Scotland). The proportions were
higher in urban areas. A survey made in 1964 found that about one household
in five then had a telephone.
Most women, and many men living alone, do their own catering and house¬
work. Probably less than five per cent of households employ any regular
paid help and almost certainly less than one per cent have a resident servant.
Relatively few households (estimated to be less than one in 600), and those
mainly ones with small children, have a foreign girl living with them au pair
to give some help in the home while improving her English. Approximately
one household in 40 gets help through the local authority home help service
at some time in the course of a year because of the presence of an invalid,

an old person or a maternity case. Nowadays wives can normally expect some
help with household tasks from their husbands.
Much of the drudgery has been reduced by changes in habits and equipment,
for example the relative popularity of easily cleaned plastic surfaces in place
of wood, tiles and metal in need of polishing; the availability of ‘convenience
foods’,1 non-iron fabrics and babies’ disposable napkins; and the spread of
labour-saving devices. More than three households in four now have a
vacuum cleaner, two in five a refrigerator, over half a washing machine,
nearly all an electric iron, one in four an electric hair drier, two in five an
electric blanket and one in six an electric toast-maker. About one in five
has completely eliminated the traditional coal fire in the principal living-
room. Women who go out to work (about half the women of working age are
in employment) benefit particularly from the flexible opening hours of many
launderettes and from the spread of automatic machines selling milk, groceries,
stockings and other supplies at any time of the day or night.
Compared with previous generations most people have considerably more
time at their own disposal, higher real incomes, and more chance of
developing their potentialities.
Agreed hours of full-time work are usually from 40 to 42 hours a week.
Actual hours worked by men average somewhat longer because of voluntary
overtime working; actual hours worked by women and girls average a little
less. Most employees are entitled to at least two weeks’ paid holiday a year
in addition to public holidays. Probably more than half enjoy a five-day week,
which is widespread in manufacturing industry. Plans are being made for a
further extension of five-day week working in distributive trades offering
six days a week service. Housewives are probably, despite current aids in the
home, the section of the community with least leisure and fewest extended
periods of free time—even compared with those older schoolchildren entered
for examinations who spend hours nightly on homework.
At the other end of the scale, people who have ceased work or are
approaching retirement are showing considerable interest in courses offering
guidance on the constructive use of their increased leisure time.
Average earnings have risen more than prices in the last decade. Women’s
earnings have risen somewhat faster than men’s. The average earnings of
women in industry are approximately half the average earnings of men. In
many occupations the principle of equal pay for equal work is applied. The
real incomes of manual workers, especially unskilled workers and young
people under 18 years, have risen both in absolute terms and in relation to
the incomes of non-manual workers. The groups who are weakest economically
are retired people wholly or mainly dependent upon pensions, households in
which the father is absent or dead, and the families of low-wage earners with
a number of dependent children.
Opportunities for education and training have widened; these are
increasingly the keys to advancement. Of every 1,000 men in England and
Wales between the ages of 20 and 30 in 1961, 318 had continued at school
beyond 15 and between 81 and 82 had continued their full-time education to
the age of 20 or beyond. By comparison, among those aged 65 or more, only
108 in 1,000 were at school beyond 15 and only 28 continued their full-time

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
education to the age of 20 or beyond. Four-fifths of all university under¬
graduates in Great Britain in 1961-62 were ‘first generation’ students, neither
of whose parents had had a university education (one-fifth of the total had
fathers who were manual workers). None the less, children from culturally
articulate homes in which they benefit from parental experience do have
relatively more success than others in achieving qualifications at every stage of
the educational system. However, distinctions based on occupation have
become much less clear-cut. Differences between the way of life of manual and
other workers are less pronounced, while many manual workers families have
acquired habits which were formerly regarded as ‘middle-class’. There is less
disparity than there used to be in the range of possessions to be found in the
home. Modern production and marketing methods, coupled with the declining
proportion of ‘dirty’ jobs, have contributed to far greater homogeneity of
dress and appearance; style in clothes, for example, being more divided by
age-group than by income-group or occupation.
The general level of nutrition is high, and still rising. In Great Britain in
1962 the average diet of households of all classes was nutritionally more than
adequate.1 Average weekly food consumption per head included 5I pints of
milk and cream, over 3 ounces of cheese, nearly 38 ounces of meat, poultry
and bacon, nearly 22 ounces of sugar and preserves, over 115 ounces of fruit
and vegetables, 44 ounces of bread and over 6 ounces of butter. Tea remained
the principal beverage but the consumption of coffee, one-seventh that of
tea, was nearly four times what it was 30 years ago. There are other pointers
to a modification in the traditional conservatism of British diet in the increased
consumption of wine, the spread of foreign restaurants in all parts of the
country, and successful sales of the more exotic fruits and vegetables outside
traditionally cosmopolitan areas.
There is quite a variation in diet between different parts of Britain.
Scotland maintains its traditional penchant for cakes, and the consumption
of materials for making pies and puddings is above the national average in
the Midlands and the north of England. More coffee is drunk in the south of
England, which also consumes proportionately more fresh fruit and vegetables.
The consumption of mutton and pork decreases proportionately from south
to north and the consumption of beef increases. ?
Food consumption accounts for rather more than a quarter of all consumers
expenditure on goods and services in Britain. Clothing accounts for about a
twelfth. Features of recent years have been the growing range of ‘leisure’
clothes and a greater adventurousness in men’s wear; fur hats for men have
become widely acceptable in the last few winters.
Something of a counterweight to the greatly increased strength of the
production and distribution sides of a modern economy is the growth of
activity to help the consumer; this has received government support.
Which?, the magazine of the Consumers’ Association, which publishes
appraisals of selected consumer goods, has over 300,000 subscribers and an
estimated readership of three million. Over three-quarters of a million people
a year make a personal visit to the Design Centre in London to see its display
of well-designed British consumer goods in current production. State services
do not escape the scrutiny of voluntary groups such as the Association for
the Improvement of Maternity Services and the Association for the
Advancement of State Education.

Association, for example, 2,640 calories per head a day on average compared with a
recommended average of 2,400 a day, allowing for different levels of activity in adults.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
21
Home Interests
Television and
Reading Matter
A considerable proportion of people’s free time and money is spent in and
on their own homes. On a weekday evening roughly seven in eight of the
adult population are at home. More demanding standards of home comfort
are evidenced by the sharp increase in the installation of central heating
apparatus and by the popularity of wall-to-wall carpeting. About four out
of five families do most of their own decorating, which may often constitute
the hardest physical effort undertaken by sedentary workers. The sales of
hand-tools and of small power-tools and powered garden implements testify
to the extent and range of home carpentry and joinery and to the interest
and initiative that maintain Britain’s homes and gardens. In spite of the high
proportion of the population living in urban areas, at least half the families
in Britain have some garden, and the standard of both town and country
gardens is high. Over 3,000 local horticultural societies are affiliated to the
National Allotment and Gardens Society and there are a large number of
unaffiliated societies; altogether there are probably some 20 million spare¬
time gardeners. The numerous flower and vegetable shows held in town and
country are very popular and there is a large attendance at the most important
of them, including the annual Chelsea Flower Show.
Other home pursuits include reading, listening to the radio or record player
or tape recorder, watching television, entertaining friends,1 looking after
pets,2 and pursuing hobbies. Probably the most popular hobby in terms of
money spent is photography, which has shown a striking increase over recent
years. An estimated million people regularly express their competitive
instincts by entering promotional competitions of the type in which purchasers
of a particular product may attempt a puzzle and compose a slogan in the hope
of winning a car, a house, or a ‘dream’ holiday.
Over 80 per cent of families (and a somewhat higher proportion of the large
families in Britain) have a television set. The growing impact of television was
probably most noticeable in the second half of the 1950s; the number of
viewing licences was doubled and by 1961 totalled over million. Since
then the increase has been markedly slower, and by June 1966 the number was
a little over 13^ million.
Although it is generally acknowledged that the popularity of television has
resulted in far-reaching social changes, clear-cut indications of the nature of
such changes are lacking. Mass entertainments have suffered, especially
where the quality and amenities provided are not considered adequate. The
lives of those housebound by disability or the care of small children have
been much enriched. Viewers in general have been stimulated to an awareness
of events and happenings which was once confined to fairly narrow groups.
Television has become an important influence in the way in which the various
political parties make their appeal to the electorate. There is no evidence
that television has brought any decline in those hobbies, recreations and
spare-time interests which people in Britain pursue so enthusiastically; in
fact for many of them it may well have provided a stimulus.
The enormous diversity of special interests, from angling to yachting, is
illustrated by the variety of magazines and periodicals, ranging from papers
1 Indications of the rise in the scale and standard of home entertaining are provided by
the increasing sales of table wines (double those of the 1930s) and of expensive foods,
and by the standard of recipes in the numerous newspaper and periodical features
devoted to cookery.
“The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals estimated in 1965 that
nearly one household in two had a pet. The most favoured pets were budgerigars
(4>750>000)> cats (4,200,100) and dogs (4,100,000).

Britain: an official handbook
dealing with sports to journals of opinion on social, political, scientific and
economic affairs (all of which command circulations in the tens of thousands),
and including ‘fan’ magazines about current ‘pop’ music favourites, do-it-
yourself and gardening weeklies (each commanding circulations of over a
hundred thousand), and illustrated instructional periodicals which build up
into encyclopaedias of art, science or general knowledge. The traditional
women’s weeklies, with their special blend of light fiction and meticulous
advice about family health and modern baby care as well as fashion and
beauty still hold the loyalty of millions. Over a quarter of the total population
are registered members of public libraries; and an increasingly wide range
of titles, including works of scholarship, are bought in the comparatively
cheap paper-backed form which constitutes about a third of total book
production.
Increasing prosperity and leisure and the influence of television have affected
interest in playing or watching outdoor and indoor sports. The tendency is
for spectators to be attracted in large numbers only to the more important
events. This trend has been especially in evidence in association football,
which is by far the most popular spectator sport, and cricket. Higher standards
of comfort and amenity are being sought by the public and failure to P™vide
these may be reflected in falling attendances. But almost any sporting body
reports a growing desire to take part in outdoor recreations—golf, tennis,
riding, angling, bowling, rugby and association football are some examples—
and steadily rising sales of sports goods and membership of sports clubs
indicate the keenness with which open air leisure activities are pursued.
A feature is the enthusiasm with which new forms of sport and recreation,
some made more familiar through television or foreign travel, are adopted.
Among spectator sports, the rise of motor racing to wide popularity is notable
(the European Grand Prix in 1964 brought 100,000 spectators to the Brands
Hatch circuit). Ski-ing and sailing are examples of activities which, once
confined to a small number, now number their enthusiasts in hundreds of
thousands. A surge of interest in ten-pin bowling since i960 seems to have
stabilised; the number of rinks now stands at about 150.
Much of the gambling with small stakes, which is practised at least occasionally
by three adults out of four, is on the results of sporting events. The total
money staked by the public on organised betting and gambling (private
wagers and games of chance cannot be counted) is unofficially estimated at
over £900 million a year. About two-thirds of the money staked is on horse
racing. Betting on football matches, both at fixed odds and through the
football pools, is widespread, but usually for smaller stakes. A more recent
gambling craze is for Bingo, which is widely played in converted cinemas and
in club rooms and village halls, although total expenditure is not large. There
has in recent years been a considerable growth in the establishment of
commercial gaming clubs; the Government is considering introducing
regulatory legislation.
Cinema attendances (under 6j million a week in 1965) continue to decline,
but the cinema remains the most popular form of indoor entertainment
outside the home, particularly for young men and women and older children.
Attendances at theatres are much smaller. There are probably only some
200 theatres offering professional performances compared with some 2,000
cinemas. Nevertheless, there is an enthusiastic and growing public not only
for plays but for ballet, opera and concerts. Special art exhibitions attract

many people; the attendance at the Arts Council Picasso Exhibition in i960
remains a record (close on half a million).
Dancing is popular, especially with those under 25 years of age; it is
thought that about six million people go dancing every week. There are
estimated to be some 3,000 to 4,000 regular dance halls, including public
dance halls and halls operated by the major dance schools, which are open
at least three times a week, and about 4,000 other schools of ballroom dancing.
Public dances are also often held in other halls, while many of the clubs and
societies which abound in Britain hold dances from time to time in their own
or hired premises. In addition, Scottish and English traditional dances have
their own following.
Nearly 62 million ‘singles’ and ‘extended play’ (45 revolutions per minute)
gramophone records were pressed in Britain in 1965. It is on the weekly
sales of these records (almost entirely to young people) that the ‘pop music’
popularity placings, known as the ‘Top Ten’ and ‘Top Twenty’, are calculated.
Personal appearances by leading ‘pop’ performers draw huge attendances
both inside and outside the theatre or studio.
A number of people from all age-groups and occupations find their main
free-time interest in some form of sustained group activity connected, for
example, with the churches, trade unions, politics, social welfare and reform,
with study or other self-improvement or with cultural pursuits.
Clubs and societies, which may be primarily social or devoted to some
particular purpose, range from small informal groups to great national and
international organisations with branches throughout the country. Organisa¬
tions of national importance in social life and in the promotion of social
gatherings include, in addition to those connected with religious denomina¬
tions, the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds
and the Women’s Institutes. There are some 3,700 clubs, with nearly million
members (mainly but not entirely men), affiliated to the Working Men’s
Club and Institute Union. These clubs are primarily social and recreational,
though they also arrange lectures and classes. In recent years they have given
much attention to improving their premises and to arranging events of
sufficient attraction to compete with the comforts of members’ homes and
the standard of entertainment obtainable on television. Some 2,550 Towns¬
women’s Guilds, with a total membership of over 210,000, are affiliated to the
National Union of Townswomen’s Guilds. The guilds are educational as
well as social in purpose and they co-operate in many public welfare activities.
The declared objective of the National Federation of Women’s Institutes is
to improve rural life and amenities; the institutes make an important con¬
tribution to rural life by providing meeting places for countrywomen and by
organising social gatherings. In villages throughout England and Wales there
are over 8,800 institutes with nearly half a million members; in Scotland
and Northern Ireland there are Women’s Rural Institutes with similar aims
and interests.
About 31 million people in Britain take an annual holiday. Although the
seaside is still by far the most popular for holidays, the trend appears to be
towards visiting several resorts for short periods rather than staying in one.
Camping and caravanning have also increased greatly. Both tendencies are
closely allied to the growth of personal transport (see below). More and more
people the total is now 5 million—take more than one holiday during the
year. The number going abroad has also risen sharply and in 1965 totalled over
5 million—more than half as many again as a few years earlier. The popularity
B

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Private Transport
The Changing
Face of Britain
of holidays abroad may be attributable to several factors besides rising
incomes; the attraction of a warmer climate, which make Spain and Italy
the most sought-after destinations for British tourists, the many charter and
other airline services available, and the readiness of the travel trade to provide
relatively inexpensive inclusive holidays. In this connection, the learning of
foreign languages is popular among adults,1 aided by radio and television
programmes as well as by attendance at adult classes. Wider experience of
foreign travel probably contributes to the increased adventurousness in diet
and dress already noticed and to the acceptability of examples of the best
in international design in furnishings and decor now available in many
British shops.
Ownership of motor vehicles is now widespread. At the end of 1965 there
were about 9 million cars (an increase of 6| million in ten years) and about
if million motor cycles (including motor scooters) licensed on the roads in
Great Britain. The trend to touring holidays (it is estimated that three-fifths
of the people taking an annual holiday do so by car) is only one of the results.
The spread of car ownership, making many people more independent of
public transport, is not only affecting the whole pattern of leisure activities
but also leading to a new and more scattered distribution of houses, changing
the siting requirements of factories, shops and offices, and making large-scale
urban reconstruction and road development urgent. At the same time, by
reducing the economic returns on public transport, resulting in reduced
services, it is in danger of impoverishing the amenity of those who for reasons
of age, health, income or personal preference do not possess their own
transport. A grim by-product of the increasing volume of road traffic is the
toll of road accidents which, though not increasing so rapidly, exceeded
7,900 people killed and 390,000 injured in 1965.
Increasing population and social developments are affecting the physical
appearance of Britain. Towns and cities are being altered to accommodate
more traffic and house more people; experiments are being tried in remodelling
town centres with pedestrian precincts; new blocks of flats and office blocks
pierce familiar skylines. Town and country interpenetrate as new estates for
migrating townsfolk encircle the little-changed hearts of old villages. New
roads and motorways to carry the traffic on leisure and business, reservoirs
to supply the growing demand for water and lines to carry electric power for
the growing volume of appliances, all have to be accommodated, while the
convenient household detergent threatens to pollute rivers with its foam.
In a modern industrial society in a densely populated country it is not
always possible to reconcile the conflict between the community’s needs and
existing natural beauty or historic interest. Nor can the planning machinery
which exists to contain disturbance arid to preserve and foster the creation of
beauty, natural or man-made, achieve this unless enough people care. The
activities of amenity societies (such as the Civic Trust, the Council for the
Preservation of Rural England and its Scottish counterpart, and the Council
for Nature), and the wider public opinion which supports them, suggest that
a growing volume of people in Britain do care.
1 Instruction in two languages is available to children in 15 per cent of state-maintained
grammar schools, three in 35 per cent, four in 27 per cent and five or more in 23 per cent.
The most widely taught modern languages are French, German, Russian and Spanish,
in that order.

GOVERNMENT
GENERAL SURVEY
The United Kingdom is a monarchical State, whose origins and traditions
are to be found in the history of each of its four component parts: England,
Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. England was unified under a Saxon
king in the ninth century; Wales became part of that kingdom and Ireland
was joined with it under the same king before the end of the thirteenth
century; and the English and Scottish thrones were dynastically united in
the person of James I and VI in 1603. In 1707 the Treaty for the Union of
England and Scotland provided that the two countries ‘should be forever
united into one kingdom’, and one Parliament (the Parliament of Great
Britain) became the supreme authority in both countries. In 1801 the Act
for the Union of Great Britain and Ireland 1800, which joined the Irish
Parliament to the Parliament of Great Britain, established the United
Kingdom. In 1922 the 26 counties of Southern Ireland (now the Irish
Republic) became a completely independent country, outside the United
Kingdom. Meantime, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 had enacted a
constitution for Northern Ireland which perpetuated Northern Ireland
representation in the United Kingdom Parliament as the supreme authority
and, at the same time, provided that country with its own legislature and
executive, to deal with domestic affairs.
The United Kingdom is a unitary, not a federal, State but methods of
government are flexible and, to some extent, adapted to the needs of the
constituent countries. England and Wales on the one hand, and Scotland
on the other, continue as before the Union to have different systems of law,
a different judiciary, different educational systems, different systems of local
government, national churches on a different footing, and, for most domestic
matters, different government departments. In Scotland these departments
have headquarters in Edinburgh and are grouped under the Secretary of
State for Scotland, who is a member of the Cabinet.
There is also a measure of devolution in the administration of Welsh affairs
to the Welsh Office, under the Secretary of State for Wales, who is a Cabinet
Minister, assisted by a Minister of State and a Parliamentary Under¬
secretary. In Northern Ireland the law is derived from and similar to the
law of England but the judiciary is separate; the Northern Ireland government
departments are responsible to the Northern Ireland Parliament. The Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies, not part of the
United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and systems of local
administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same time, they have
a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of their proximity
to the mainland and the antiquity of their connection with the Crown. They
are treated as part of the mainland for certain purposes, such as wireless and
postal communication, and are ‘territories for whose international relations
Her Majesty’s Government is responsible’.
The United Kingdom Parliament has the ultimate responsibility for the
good government of the overseas dependencies within the Commonwealth
which are administered by territorial governments and are at various stages
26
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of development towards full self-government. The United Kingdom is also
one of the independent member nations of the Commonwealth,1 which all
acknowledge the Queen as the symbol of their free association and, as such,
the head of the Commonwealth; most of these independent countries owe
allegiance to the Crown.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by precepts and practices, known as conventions,
which are not part of the law of the land since violation of them would not
lead to proceedings in a court of law, but which are nevertheless indispensable
to the machinery of government. The rules of the constitution have never
been codified; principles and practice are both alterable, and the rules of the
constitution can be adapted to changing conditions at any time by the passing
of an Act of Parliament, or by the general acceptance of a new convention,
without serious disturbance to existing organs and forms.
The organs of government in the United Kingdom constitution are readily
distinguishable although their functions often intermingle and overlap. They
are:
1. the legislature, which consists of the Queen in Parliament, and is the
supreme authority in the realm;
2. the executive, which consists of: (a) the Cabinet and other ministers
of the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing national
policy; (b) government departments, most of them under the control
of ministers and all staffed by civil servants, which are responsible for
administration at the national level; (c) local authorities, which administer
and manage many services at the local level; and (d) statutory boards,
which are severally responsible for the operation of particular nation¬
alised industries or public services, and which are subject to ministerial
control in varying degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes,
and is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
The following pages describe these three organs of government in some
detail in order to show how the constitution of the United Kingdom works.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. Queen Elizabeth II
is a descendant of the Saxon king, Egbert, who united all England in the
year 829, and of Malcolm II, whose reign in Scotland (1005-34) was corre¬
spondingly important in that part of the realm.
According to the Royal Titles Act 1953, the royal title in the United
Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
1 The other members are: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Ceylon,
Ghana, Malaysia, Nigeria, Cyprus, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Jamaica, Trinidad and
Tobago, Uganda, Kenya, Malawi, Malta, Zambia, The Gambia, Singapore and Guyana.
Botswana, Lesotho and Barbados are expected to become independent members of
the Commonwealth in 1966.

Succession
Accession
Coronation
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The form of the royal title is varied for the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown, to suit the particular
circumstances of each.
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom, the Queen being
represented by a Governor in Northern Ireland. For the performance of
royal functions in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man the Queen is
represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In the other member nations of the
Commonwealth which owe allegiance to the Crown the Queen’s representative
is the Governor-General, who is appointed by the Crown on the advice of
the ministers of the country concerned and is wholly independent of the
United Kingdom Government. In the United Kingdom dependencies the
Queen is usually represented by Governors (but in some cases by High
Commissioners, Administrators or Residents), who are appointed by the
Crown, have varying executive and legislative powers, and are responsible
to the United Kingdom Government for the good government of the countries
concerned.
The title to the Crown derives from the Act of Settlement 1701, which
provided that ‘the Crown . . . shall remain and continue to the said most
excellent Princess Sophia1 and the heirs of her body being Protestants’.
Subsequent Succession to the Crown Acts have confirmed this declaration;
and although succession is not bound to continue in its present line, it cannot
now be altered (under a provision of the Statute of Westminster, 1931)
except by common consent of the member nations of the Commonwealth
which owe allegiance to the Crown.
The inheritance of the Crown is governed by rules of descent, which
provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in Order of Succession to the
Throne according to their seniority or, if there are no sons, the daughters
in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she becomes Queen-
Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully and effectively
as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of a king takes the
rank and style of her husband; but the converse does not apply and the
constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the husband
of the Queen-Regnant.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession
of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new
Sovereign is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of
the Privy Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the
Lord Mayor, aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London,
and the High Commissioners in London of the member nations of the
Commonwealth are also invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign follows the accession after an interval
which may last for a year or more. The ceremony has remained much the
same in substance for nearly a thousand years although the details have
frequently been modified to bring it into conformity with the customs of
the time. The service used at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 was
derived from that used at the coronation of King Edgar at Bath in the year 973.
The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence of
representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests

in the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading members of the
other Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary in
England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, the commander-in-chief
of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal head of the established
Church of England. In practice, as a result of a long evolutionary process
during which the absolute power of the monarchy has been progressively
reduced, the Queen acts only on the advice of her ministers which she cannot
constitutionally ignore. She reigns, but she does not rule. The United
Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of the fact that the trend of legislation
during the past hundred years has been to assign powers directly to ministers
without any necessity for royal intervention, there are still important acts
of government which require the participation of the Queen.
The Queen summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament; as a general rule
she opens the new session with a speech from the throne (although this may
be read by the Lord Chancellor if the Queen is unable to be present); and
she must give Royal Assent before a Bill which has passed all its stages in
both Houses of Parliament becomes a legal enactment. The Queen is ‘the
fountain of justice’ and as such, can remit all or part of the penalties imposed
on people convicted of crime. As ‘the fountain of honour’, the Queen confers
peerages, baronetcies, knighthoods and other honours,1 and makes appoint¬
ment to all important State offices, including those of judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, and diplomats, and to all leading positions in the
established Church of England. The Queen’s consent and approval are
required before a minister can take up office or a Cabinet be formed. In the
realm of international affairs, by virtue of her pre-eminence as head of the
State, the Queen has the power to conclude treaties, to cede or accept territory,
to declare war and to make peace.
These and similar acts of government involve the use of the royal preroga¬
tive2 which has been defined as ‘the residue of discretionary authority legally
left in the hands of the Crown’. Ministerial responsibility for the exercise
of this authority is shown in three constitutional ways in which the royal
will can be expressed: by Order in Council made ‘by and with the advice
of the Privy Council’; by Order, Commission or Warrant signed personally
by the Queen and generally bearing the signature of one or more responsible
ministers; or by Proclamation, Writs, Letters Patent, or other documents
under the Great Seal affixed by the Lord Chancellor in obedience to a Royal
Warrant countersigned by a minister.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not
detract from the importance of the participation of the Sovereign in the
smooth working of government; for although the Queen has no personal
authority and must show complete impartiality in every field, she must be
1 Most honours are conferred by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister; a
few (the Order of Merit, the Order of Companions of Honour, the Royal Victorian
Order, the Most Noble Order of the Garter, and the Most Noble and Most Ancient
Order of the Thistle) are in the Sovereign’s personal gift.
2 Other powers of the Crown relate to the creation of corporations by Royal Charter;
the construction and supervision of harbours; the guardianship of infants; the admin¬
istration of charities; coinage; the grant of franchises, for example, markets, ferries and
fisheries; the right to treasure trove; and the right of printing or licensing others to
print the Bible, the Book of Common Prayer and State papers.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
informed and consulted on every aspect of the national life. The Queen
holds meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences to her ministers and
other holders of office at home and overseas, receives accounts of Cabinet
decisions, reads dispatches and signs innumerable State papers.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made by Acts of Parliament for a Regent to be appointed to fulfil them
if the Sovereign is totally incapacitated, or is under the age of eighteen on
accession to the throne. The latest of these Acts—the Regency Act 1953
laid down that the first potential Regent should be The Prince Philip, Duke
of Edinburgh, and thereafter those in succession to the throne who are of age.
In the event of the Sovereign’s partial incapacity or absence abroad, provision
is made for the appointment of Counsellors of State (generally speaking, the
wife or husband of the Sovereign, and the four adult persons next in succession
to the Crown1) to whom the Sovereign may delegate by Letters Patent
certain royal functions. But Counsellors of State may not, for instance,
dissolve Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign),
nor create peers.
Ceremonial and Ceremonial has always been associated with the kings and queens of the
Royal Visits British Isles and, in spite of the changes that have taken place with the altered
outlook of both the Sovereign and the people, certain customs and usages
are the same today as they were many centuries ago. Royal marriages, the
birth of royal children and royal funerals are marked by ancient ceremonial,
although to a lesser degree than in former days. The birthday of the Sovereign
is officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on the Horse
Guards Parade and is also celebrated as Commonwealth Day. State banquets
take place when a foreign monarch or head of State visits the United Kingdom;
investitures are held at Buckingham Palace; and royal processions grace such
social occasions as the Ascot Race Meeting, known as Royal Ascot, and add
significance to the opening of Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from
Buckingham Palace.
The Sovereign is the leader of society by order of general precedence dating
from the fourteenth century and sustained until the present day by royal
ordinances, established custom and the public will. The Queen and other
members of the royal family visit many parts of the United Kingdom every
year, and their presence at the inauguration of scientific, artistic, industrial,
and charitable works of national importance ensures nation-wide interest and
support. They also pay State visits to foreign governments and undertake
lengthy tours in other countries of the Commonwealth.
PARLIAMENT
The supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom is the Queen in
Parliament, that is to say, the Queen and the two Houses of Parliament—
the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons.
The three elements of Parliament are outwardly separate: they are con¬
stituted on different principles; they do different work in different places and
they meet together only on occasions of symbolic significance such as the
coronation, or the opening of Parliament by the Queen in person, when the

added to the persons to whom royal functions may be delegated as Counsellors of State.

Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law¬
making organ of State, however, Parliament is a corporate body and cannot
legislate without the concurrence of all its parts (except in the case of Bills
passed under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949).
The Parliament at Westminster is representative of all the countries of the
United Kingdom. It can legislate for the United Kingdom as a whole, or
any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination of them.
It can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, but in these
islands and in Northern Ireland it is not the only legislature, for the Northern
Ireland Parliament has power to legislate for Northern Ireland on most
domestic subjects (see p. 41), and the ancient legislatures of the two Channel
Island Bailiwicks (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey) and of the
Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) legislate on domestic matters.1 Nevertheless,
the Parliament at Westminster retains supreme authority, and within practical
limits there is nothing that it cannot legally do.
By the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 the life of a United Kingdom
Parliament was fixed at five years (although it is usually dissolved and a general
election held before the expiry of the legal term); and since one Parliament
cannot bind its successor (for otherwise the succeeding Parliament would not
be sovereign or supreme), each assembly has a period of time of up to five
years during which it may legislate exactly as it chooses. During its life, it
can make or unmake any law; destroy by statute the most firmly established
convention or turn a convention into binding law; and legalise past illegalities
thus reversing the decisions of the courts. It even has power to prolong its
own life by legislative means beyond the normal period of five years without
consulting the electorate although such power is used only in circumstances
of national emergency, such as times of war.
In law, therefore, the supremacy of Parliament is absolute. In practice
Parliament does not exercise its supremacy in this way. Its members bear
in mind the common law which has grown up in Britain throughout the
centuries and they act as far as possible in accordance with precedent and
tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of Parliament that has
been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the proper authority
cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be likely to pass an
Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system of party
government in Britain ensures that Parliament legislates with its responsibility
to the electorate in mind.
A Parliament, in the sense of a parliamentary period, begins and ends with
a proclamation made by the Sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council.
Such a proclamation on the one hand dissolves an existing Parliament and,
on the other, orders the issue of writs for election and announces the date on
which the new Parliament is to meet. This cannot be less than 20 days after
the proclamation, but it may be more.
The resignation of a government usually entails the dissolution of Parlia¬
ment. Formerly the death of a Sovereign also involved dissolution, but since
1867 both Houses stand adjourned only until their members have taken the
oath of allegiance to the new Sovereign, which they do immediately after the
Accession Council has made the order for proclamation.
1 The legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man consist of the Queen, the
Privy Council and the local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the
member of the Privy Council primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each
legislative measure before it is submitted to the Queen in Council.

The House of
Lords
Britain: an official handbook
The time between the meeting of a Parliament and its prorogation or
dissolution is called a session. Parliament is usually prorogued by a com¬
mission under the Great Seal (see p. 29), which appoints the day and place
of its meeting in a new session. The date so appointed may be brought
forward or deferred by a subsequent proclamation. The effect of a prorogation
is at once to terminate all business (with certain minor exceptions) until
Parliament is summoned again. A Bill not completed in one session must
be reintroduced in the next, unless it is to be abandoned.
During a session either House may adjourn itself on its own motion to
such date as it pleases. An adjournment does not affect uncompleted business.
A reassembly of the House can be accelerated either by proclamation or by
virtue of powers specially conferred by each House on its Speaker.
The average number of sitting days for the House of Commons is about
160, divided by custom into the following periods: one from November until
Christmas lasting 30-40 sitting days, one from January to Easter of 40-50
sitting days, one from Easter until Whitsun of about 30 sitting days, and one
from Whitsun until the end of July lasting about 40 sitting days. Nowadays,
the session is sometimes concluded with a short period of up to 10 sitting
days in October, after the long summer adjournment. The House of Lords
sits, on average, for about no days in each session.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Temporal and the Lords Spiritual.
The Lords Temporal may be sub-divided into (1) all hereditary peers and
peeresses of England, Scotland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom who
have not disclaimed their peerages under the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life
peers and peeresses created by the Crown under the Life Peerages Act i95^>
and (3) Lords of Appeal in Ordinary who are appointed under the terms of the
Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 to assist the House in the performance of its
judicial duties and who remain members of the House after their retirement
from office. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York,
the Bishops of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the
Church of England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops.
Temporal peerages (both hereditary and life) are conferred by the Sovereign
on the advice of the Prime Minister. Hereditary peerages carry with them a
right to a seat in the House of Lords, provided the holder is 21 years of age
or over, but anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months of
succession, disclaim that peerage for his or her lifetime. Those who disclaim
their peerages lose their right to sit in the House of Lords but they are able
to vote at parliamentary elections and are eligible for election to the House of
Commons. . .
Not all holders of temporal peerages with a right to sit in the House ot
Lords attend the sittings of that House. Those who do not wish to attend may
apply for leave of absence, either for the duration of a particular Parliament
or for a single session.
Members in constant attendance at the House of Lords include elder states¬
men and others who have spent their lives in public service. They receive no
salary for their parliamentary work, but they are entitled to travelling expenses
from their homes to the Palace of Westminster (provided they attend at
least one-third of the number of sittings), and (with the exception of the
Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chairman of Committees and any member in
receipt of a salary as the holder of a ministerial office) they may claim payment
for expenses incurred for the purpose of attendance at the House (except for
judicial sittings) within a maximum of four and a half guineas (£4 14s. 6d.) a day.

System
33
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who sits
on the woolsack and is ex officio Speaker of the House. The Crown, by
commission under the Great Seal, appoints several members of the House
to act as deputy speakers in the absence of the Lord Chancellor. The first
of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of Committees, who is appointed
each session and takes the chair in all committees, unless the House other¬
wise directs. The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments,
who is charged with keeping the records of proceedings and judgments and
who pronounces the words of the Royal Assent to Bills; the Gentleman
Usher of the Black Rod, who enforces the orders of the House; and the
Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Lord Chancellor.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by almost
universal adult suffrage and consists of men and women from all sections of
the community. There are at present 630 seats in the House of Commons
(511 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, 12 for Northern Ireland).
Members of the House of Commons receive a salary (£3,250 a year) for their
parliamentary work and hold their seats during the life of a Parliament. They
are elected either at a general election, after a Parliament has been dissolved
and a new one summoned by the Sovereign, or at a by-election, held when a
vacancy occurs in the House as a result of the death of a member, or of his
acceptance of office under the Crown,1 or as a result of his elevation to the
House of Lords.
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected
by the members to preside over the House immediately after a new Parliament
is formed. Other parliamentary officers of the House are the Chairman of
Ways and Means, and the Deputy Chairman, both of whom may act as
Deputy Speaker; these officers are elected by the House on the nomination
of the Government and, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote other than
in their official capacity (see p. 36).
Permanent officers of the House, that is, those who are not members of
Parliament, include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official departments under his control and is
charged with such matters as keeping the records, endorsing Bills and signing
orders, and the Serjeant-at-Arms, who attends the Speaker in the House.
For electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies,
each of which returns one member to the House of Commons. Permanent
Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
keep constituencies constantly under review, submit periodic reports on a
general review of constituencies, and may, at any time, recommend changes
in the boundaries of any particular constituency or constituencies if, for
instance, it is necessary to bring constituency boundaries into line with altered
local government boundaries.
The law relating to parliamentary elections is contained principally in the
Representation of the People Act 1949. Under the provisions of this Act,
election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot in which
British subjects (except members of the House of Lords) and citizens of
the Irish Republic are entitled to vote (voting is not compulsory), provided
that they are 21 years old or over, and are not subject to any legal incapacity
1 If a member wishes to resign from the House, he accepts what is technically an office
of profit under the Crown.

Parliamentary

to vote. Those eligible to vote in any constituency are those who are recorded
on the register1 of electors for the constituency as resident in that constituency
on a date fixed by statute. Each elector may cast one vote, normally in person
at a polling station, although members of the armed forces, Crown servants of
the United Kingdom employed overseas, and wives of such persons, if resident
overseas with their husbands, may vote by proxy. Voting by post, or in certain
cases by proxy, may also be allowed if the voter cannot attend in person for
such reasons as physical incapacity or the nature of his work.
Anyone, male or female, who is a British subject aged 21 or over, and is
not otherwise disqualified may stand as a candidate at a general election.
Those who are disqualified include members of the House of Lords, clergy
of the Church of England, the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and
the Roman Catholic Church, undischarged bankrupts, and those expressly
disqualified by the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1957, for instance,
holders of judicial offices, civil servants, and members of the regular armed
forces and the police forces.
The conduct of elections, including the manner in which candidates can
be nominated for election, is governed by the 1949 Act, which also prescribes
a maximum for the election expenses which candidates may incur. This is
£450, plus 1 |d for each elector in a borough constituency and 2d for each elector
in a county constituency. The prescribed scale is not required to cover the
candidate’s personal expenses, for instance, the cost of his living at an hotel
during the election campaign.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain privileges and immunities designed to
protect the House from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties.
These privileges apply collectively to each House and individually to each
member.
In the House of Commons, the Speaker formally claims from the Crown
for the Commons ‘their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges at the
beginning of each Parliament. These include freedom from arrest in civil
proceedings for a period from 40 days before to 40 days after a session of
Parliament; freedom of speech in debate; and the right of access to the
Crown, which is a collective privilege of the House. Further privileges
include the right of the House to control its own proceedings (so that it is
able, for example, to exclude strangers if it so wishes); the right to pronounce
upon legal disqualifications for membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and the right to penalise those who commit a breach of its
privileges. .
The privileges of the House of Lords are: freedom from civil arrest,
freedom of speech in debate; freedom of access to the Sovereign for each
peer individually; and the right to commit for contempt. These privileges
are not formally claimed by the Speaker as in the House of Commons, they
exist independently without grant.
The party system has existed in one form or another since the seventeenth
century, and has now become an essential element in the working of the
constitution. _ • • 1
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political
parties, each laying rival policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a

published yearly by the registration officers, who in England and Wales are the clerks o
local councils and in Scotland are the land valuation assessors.

general election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for
election; any other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then
indicates, by its choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the
opposing policies it would like to see put into effect.
The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which is able to command a majority
of supporters in the House of Commons, forms the Government. By tradition,
the leader of the majority party is appointed as Prime Minister by the Sovereign,
usually on the advice of senior ministers; and its most outstanding members
in the House of Lords and the House of Commons receive ministerial
appointments on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority
party becomes the official Opposition with its own leader and its own council
of discussion or ‘shadow Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties
or any Independents who have been elected may support the Government
or the Opposition according to their party’s or their own view of the policy
being debated at any given time.
In the general election held in March 1966, 75-8 per cent of the electorate
voted, compared with 77 per cent in October 1964. The number and per¬
centage of votes cast for the principal parties is shown in Table 3.

" Others include the Speaker, Republican Labour (Northern Ireland), Communists,
Scottish and Welsh Nationalists, Independents, and members of individual parties,
few of which were represented by more than one candidate.
The distribution of seats in the House of Commons resulting from the
general elections of 1964 and 1966 is shown in Table 4.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament rests to a considerable
extent upon the fact that Government and Opposition alike are carried on
by agreement: that is to say, the minority agrees that the majority must
govern and therefore accepts its decisions; and the majority agrees that the
minority should criticise and therefore sets time aside for that criticism to
be heard. The detailed arrangements of government business are settled,
under the direction of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House (who
may be the Prime Minister or some other minister), by the Government
Chief Whip in consultation with the Opposition Chief Whip. The Chief
Whips together organise the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in the House of
Commons when the question of the possibility of finding time for debating
some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the business of the House
is primarily the responsibility of the Leader of the House, and it is his duty
to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters about
which it is concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Whips (the Chief
Whips and their assistants, chosen within the party or by the Prime Minister
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
for the Government party), whose duties include maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates. The Opposition Whips have no official position, but the Government
Chief Whip in the House of Commons is the Parliamentary Secretary to
the Treasury; of the other Government Whips, five hold titular posts as
Junior Lords of the Treasury and three are officers of the Royal Household.
There are also Government and Opposition Whips in the House of Lords.
The former, who hold offices in the Royal Household, sometimes act as
spokesmen for the Government in debates.

° When a candidate at the polls the Speaker remains aloof from party issues, standing
as ‘the Speaker seeking re-election’. In the past it was customary to al ow the Speaker
an unopposed election in his constituency but this is by no means settled practice and
since the end of the second world war the Speaker has, almost always, been opposed.
The Functions The main functions of Parliament are (i) to make laws regulating the life
of Parliament of the community, (2) to take formal action, cast in legislative form, to make
available finance for the needs of the community and to appropriate the
funds necessary for the services of the State, and (3) to put relevant facts
and issues before the electorate. By custom, Parliament is also consulted
before the ratification of certain international treaties and agreements (in
spite of the fact that the making of treaties is a royal prerogative exercised
on the advice of the Government and, in theory, is not subject to parliamentary
approval).
Parliamentary Both Houses of Parliament have their own standing orders, but procedure
Procedure is based on custom and precedent (much of which dates back to the beginning
of the sixteenth century and even earlier) rather than on written orders,
which merely supplement the practice in each House. The system of debate
is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every matter is determined
upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and resolved in the affirmative
or negative, as the case may be; members speak from wherever they have been
sitting and not from a rostrum; and members do not read their speeches.
The main difference is that in the House of Commons the Speaker has a
far greater measure of control.
In the House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no inherent
authority to check or curtail debate, such matters being decided by the
general sense of the House. In the Commons, on the contrary, the Speaker
has full authority to give effect, promptly and decisively, to the rules and
orders of the House. He must carefully guard against abuse of procedure
or any infringement of minority rights, and it is his duty to allow or disallow
any closure motion (that is, a motion to end discussion so that the matter may
be put to the vote). He has certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition
GOVERNMENT
37
Legislation
in debate, and to save the time of the House in various other respects. In
cases of grave disorder, he has power to adjourn the House or suspend the
sitting on his own initiative.
Voting in the House of Commons is carried out under the direction of the
Speaker, and it is his duty to pronounce the final result. If an equal number
of votes is cast, the Speaker must give the casting vote; he does this (if
possible) in such a way as to avoid change and leave the question to be decided
on another occasion. The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is
similar to that in the House of Commons, but the Speaker or chairman has
no casting vote. With the exception of questions relating to Bills and delegated
legislation, the House of Lords is governed by the principle that unless there
is a majority in favour, the question is decided in the negative. When the
House is sitting judicially (see pp. 81 and 84) the question is put in such a
way that, if the votes were equal, there would be no interference with the
order under appeal.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare
occasions; the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Pro¬
ceedings) and the speeches (The Official Report of Parliamentary Debates,
Hansard) are published daily.
Legislation can be initiated from either side of either House; but no Bill
involving taxation or the spending of public money can proceed very far
unless the Government agrees to introduce a ‘financial resolution’ to cover it.
This has the effect of giving the Government exclusive rights over a wide
field of legislation, and as a result most Public Bills are presented by the
Government. However, private members (that is, members of the House who
are not office holders in the Government) can introduce Public Bills on their
own initiative, and such Bills can be debated on certain days expressly set
aside for the purpose in each session.1 Peers can introduce Public Bills in the
House of Lords at any time during a session without notice. In addition,
persons and bodies outside Parliament can promote Private Bills relating
solely to matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
Bills may originate in either House, unless they deal with finance or
representation when they are always introduced in the Commons. As a rule,
however, Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons
before the Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature are
frequently introduced and debated in the Lords before being sent to the
Commons.
The process of passing a Public Bill is basically the same in the House of
Lords as in the House of Commons. The Bill receives a formal First Reading
on introduction; it is then printed; and after a period of time (which varies
between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the Bill) it
is given a Second Reading after the result of a debate on its general merits or
principles. In the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to the
Second Reading Committee to recommend whether or not it should be taken
as read a second time. After a Second Reading in the Commons a Bill is then
referred for detailed examination either to a standing committee or, if the
House so decides, to the whole House sitting in committee; in the Lords it is
referred to a committee of the whole House. When the committee stage is
finished, the Bill is reported to the House, and a further stage takes place during
1 Private members may propose a Bill after question time on notice given, or seek leave
to introduce a Bill under the ‘Ten Minute Rule’, that is, the Standing Order which
allows a brief speech proposing and another opposing the introduction of the Bill before
the House decides whether or not to grant leave.
38
Parliamentary
Committees
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
which the committee’s amendments may be altered, additional amendments
may be suggested and incorporated, and, if necessary, the Bill may be
recommitted to committee. Finally, it is submitted for a Third Reading and,
if passed, is sent on from the Commons to the Lords or from the Lords to the
Commons (depending on its place of origin), where it enters on the same
course again. Any amendments which the second House makes to the Bill
must be agreed to by the first House, or a compromise reached, before the
Bill becomes law.
In practice, the Lords pass without amendment all financial Bills, such as
the Finance Bill, which authorises annual taxation and amends existing
taxation, and the Appropriation Bill, which authorises expenditure on the
Supply Services from the Consolidated Fund.1 As a general rule, these Bills
are introduced upon resolutions in a committee of the whole House of
Commons and they may be initiated only by a Minister of the Crown.
When Bills have passed through their various parliamentary stages, they are
sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, now usually given by commission.
The Sovereign’s power to refuse assent has not been exercised since the early
eighteenth century.
The majority of Bills introduced in the House of Lords pass through the
Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature; they
are then returned to the Lords to be brought forward for Royal Assent.
However, should any Lords Bill be unacceptable to the Commons, it would
never reach the Statute Book, for no debating time would be allotted to it—
at any rate until a new government came into power, when it might be
revived. The Lords, on the other hand, are unlikely to be able to prevent a
Bill insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal
course of events, they either accept a Bill from the Commons and return it
unchanged; or they revise and improve it by amendments and return it for
the consideration of members of the other House, who frequently agree to
the amendments made. The Lords cannot require the Commons to agree to
amendments; nor can they delay a Bill indefinitely. They have no powers in
respect of Money Bills; and, since the passing of the Parliament Act 1949,
any other Public Bill which has been passed by the House of Commons in
two successive sessions may be presented for Royal Assent without the consent
of the Lords, provided that a year has elapsed between the date of the Second
Reading of the Bill in the Commons and the date on which it is finally passed
in that House. These limitations on the powers of the Lords are based on the
belief that the chief value of the Upper House, which is a non-elected assembly,
lies in bringing the wide experience of its members into the legislative process,
not in thwarting the elected House. In other words, proceedings in the House
of Lords give time for further reflection, and often elicit new points of view.
In substance, a Private Bill goes through the same procedure as a Public
Bill but most of the work is done in committee, where the promoters must
prove the need for the powers or privileges that they seek and where any
objections raised by opposing interests may be heard.
A committee of the whole House is presided over by a chairman instead of
the Speaker. Its function is to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after
their Second Reading. The Committees of Supply and of Ways and Means
are committees of the whole House of Commons; they discharge the financial
1 It is provided in the Parliament Act 1911 that all Money Bills sent to the House of
Lords one month before the end of the session shall receive the Royal Assent notwith¬
standing, if they are not passed by the Lords without amendment within the month.

duties of the House concerning the grant of public money and the levying
of taxation.
There are two other main kinds of parliamentary committee, both of
which exist to relieve their parent House of some of its more specialised and
complex work. They are:
1. Standing Committees, which are appointed by the House of Commons
as necessary, for the consideration of the second readings and committee
stages of Public Bills and, in the case of the Scottish and Welsh Grand
Committees, other business referred to them. With the exception of the
Scottish Standing and Grand Committees1 (which consider Scottish
estimates and other matters relating exclusively to Scotland), and the
Welsh Grand Committee2 (for which parallel arrangements exist),
standing committees consist of from 20 to 50 members nominated for
each Bill by the Committee of Selection (a body normally consisting of
11 members drawn from the main parties in the House at the beginning
of each session)—the parties being represented in proportion to their
numbers in the House. The procedure of a standing committee is
generally similar to that of a committee of the whole House.
2. Select Committees, which are appointed to inquire into and report to
the House on special matters. Select Committees may be appointed
by either House when the occasion for such an appointment occurs,
or they may be appointed at the beginning of a session to consider all
aspects of a particular subject that may arise during the session. The
latter type of committee is known as a ‘sessional’ committee and includes
the Committee of Privileges, the Estimates and Public Accounts
Committees, the Committees on Nationalised Industries, Statutory
Instruments, Procedure, and Public Petitions, and the House of Com¬
mons (Services) Committee. There are also the Selection Committee
(see above) and the Standing Orders Committee, which have duties
relating to Private Bills, and joint select committees of both Houses of
Parliament which may be appointed at the instance of either House.
In addition there are the parliamentary party organisations: the Parliamen¬
tary Labour Party, which is a corporate body comprising all members of the
party in both Houses; and the Conservative and Unionist Members Com¬
mittee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee, which consists of the back
bench membership of the party.
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on
parliamentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate
administrative details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the
risk that powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken
parliamentary government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in
Council or to authorities directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to ministers
of the Crown, to government departments for which ministers are responsible,
or to organisations whose legislation is subject to confirmation or approval by
ministers who thereby become responsible to Parliament for it. Moreover the
Act which delegates legislative power generally defines its precise limits and,
1 The Scottish Standing Committee consists of 30 members nominated from Scottish
constituencies with up to 20 other nominated members; in its plenary form, as the
Scottish Grand Committee, it comprises all the members for the Scottish constituencies
and not less than ten nor more than 15 others.
The Welsh Grand Committee consists of 36 members for constituencies in Wales and
Monmouthshire, with up to 25 other nominated members selected in order to make the
balance of parties in the committee approximate to that in the whole House.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in the more important cases, gives Parliament the right to confirm or annul the
statutory instruments1 (rules and orders) by which delegated legislation is
enacted. Certain Acts also require direct consultation, before such legislation
is made, with organisations which will be affected by delegated legislation.
The House of Commons is aided in its supervision of delegated legislation
by the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments (see p. 39). The Special
Orders Committee of the House of Lords examines and repoits on all
Statutory Instruments requiring affirmative resolution.
Parliamentary Control of the Government in power is exercised in the final analysis by the
Control ability of the House of Commons to force the Government to resign either
by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’ or by rejecting a proposal which the
Government considers so vital to its policy that it has made it a matter of
confidence’; but Parliament has not used this power in this way for many
years (see p. 36). A number of opportunities for a searching examination of
government policy by both the Opposition and the Government’s own back¬
benchers are, however, provided in parliamentary procedure. Such oppor¬
tunities include:
1. Question Time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in
rotation, answer questions put to them on matters for which they are
responsible. So much parliamentary time is devoted to scheduled public
business that questions are regarded as the best means of eliciting hitherto
unpublished information about the Government’s intentions, as well as
an effective way of airing, and possibly securing some redress of,
grievances brought to the notice of members by their constituents.
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the
House to initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public
concern. There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public
business every sitting day; on a day when public business ends before
the scheduled time the time saved may be used for adjournment
debates; and immediately before the adjournment for each recess
(Christmas, Easter, Whitsun and the Summer) there is a whole day
spent discussing topics selected either by the Opposition or by private
members. Moreover, if a member wishes to discuss a definite matter
of ‘urgent public importance’ he may, at the end of Question Time,
ask leave to move the adjournment of the House; if the Speaker accepts
the motion as being within the terms of the Standing Order and if, the
matter being referred to the House, 40 or more members rise to support
the motion, the matter is debated later the same day.
3. The practice whereby the consideration of the Estimates, in Committee
of Supply, has ceased to be a consideration of the financial requirements
of the Government and has become an occasion for the examination,
initiated by the Opposition, of some aspect of the Government’s
administrative policy, the cost of which has been included in the
Estimates.
The means by which Parliament, and more particularly the House of
Commons, exercises responsibility in the management of the revenues of the
State and payments for the public service are described in Chapter 14, Finance.

The Northern
Ireland
Parliament
Procedure and
Functions
The Parliament of Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign, a Senate and
a House of Commons. The Sovereign is represented in Northern Ireland by
a Governor, who summons, prorogues and dissolves Parliament in Her
Majesty’s name; the Senate is composed of two ex officio senators (the Lord
Mayor of Belfast and the Mayor of Londonderry) and 24 senators who hold
office for an eight-year term, 12 being elected by the House of Commons
every four years under a system of proportional representation; while the
House of Commons consists of 52 members, elected by a system of parlia¬
mentary franchise similar to that which operates in Great Britain. The House
continues in existence for a period of five years unless it is dissolved earlier.
The Northern Ireland Parliament has power to make laws for the peace,
order and good government of Northern Ireland in relation to all matters
except those especially reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom:
the Crown or succession to the Crown; foreign relations; defence; the
postal services; the Supreme Court; customs and excise; income and profits
taxes; coinage; standards of weights and measures; trade marks; submarine
cables; wireless telegraphy; aerial navigation; and lighthouses, buoys and
beacons. Under the constitutional practices which have developed since the
passing of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 the United Kingdom
Parliament does not legislate on matters within the powers of the Northern
Ireland Parliament unless the Government of Northern Ireland requests that
this should be done. But, because certain matters have been reserved to the
United Kingdom Parliament, provision was made in the Government of
Ireland Act 1920 for the continued representation of the Northern Ireland
constituencies in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; in
accordance with this provision, 12 members are returned to Westminster.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council,
was the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council declined in importance;
many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet, and much of its work
was handed over to newly created government departments. The present-day
Privy Council exists mainly to give effect to policy decisions made elsewhere.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy
Council (which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister as an honour to persons who have
reached eminence in some branch of public affairs in any country of the
Commonwealth. There are usually about 300 Privy Counsellors.
The Privy Council is convened by the Clerk of the Council and is usually
presided over by the Sovereign. Three Privy Counsellors form a quorum,
but, as a rule, not fewer than four are summoned to attend. The whole Privy
Council is called together only on the death of the Sovereign or when the
Sovereign announces his or her intention to marry.
The Privy Council is responsible for the submission for the Sovereign’s
approval of Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing
fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal
prerogative, for example, those embodying royal instructions to colonial
Governors; and those which are authorised by Act of Parliament and are a

form of delegated legislation. Members of the Privy Council attending
meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby become
personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders are based, this
rests with the ministers in whose departments the draft orders were framed,
whether they are present at the meeting or not. Certain Orders in Council
must be published in the London Gazette, an official periodical published by
the authority of the Government.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclama¬
tions, some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as
summoning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
There are a number of Privy Council committees whose meetings differ from
those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These committees, which have advisory functions, may be
prerogative, such as the committee which deals with legislative matters
submitted by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man; or
they may be provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford
and Cambridge and the Scottish universities, and that which deals with
applications for the grant of charters to municipal corporations.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out
in the Privy Council Office under the control of the Lord President of the
Council (see p. 43).
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal from
the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies and certain member States
of the Commonwealth, deriving its appellate jurisdiction in respect of such
appeals from the principle of English common law which recognises ‘the
right of all the King’s subjects to appeal for redress to the Sovereign in
Council’ if they believe that the courts of law have failed to do them justice.
The Judicial Committee is also the final court of appeal in a limited class of
ecclesiastical matters, from the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and from
prize courts1 in the United Kingdom and dependencies.
Appeals come to the Judicial Committee either where a right of appeal
has been specially created, for example, by statute, Order in Council or
Letters Patent, or by special leave of the Sovereign in Council on the advice
of the Judicial Committee. They are heard by a board of the committee,
whose members are generally selected from the Lord Chancellor, ex-Lord
Chancellors and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, although other members of
the Privy Council who have held high judicial office (including Chief Justices
and certain other judges from other Commonwealth countries who have been
sworn of the Privy Council) may also be asked to sit when business is heavy.
The Judicial Committee does not deliver judgment; it advises the Sovereign,
who acts on its report and approves an Order in Council to give effect thereto.
HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers charged for the time
being with the administration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Crown, and all other ministers
are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.

and Law Officers

Ministers of State
Junior Ministers
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. There
are, however, always some ministers in the House of Lords, partly because
there is a statutory limit to the number of ministers who may sit and vote in
the Commons while receiving salaries from the Crown, and also because
every Government must be assured of spokesmen to expound and justify its
intentions and its actions to the House of Lords.
The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to
time, both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The
usual ministerial offices may be classified under the following heads:
The Prime Minister, who is the recognised head of the Government but
has no department.
Departmental Ministers, some of whom are known as Secretaries of State.
There are at present eight Secretaries of State: the First Secretary of State and
Secretary of State for Economic Affairs; and the Secretaries of State for the
Home Department; Foreign Affairs; Scotland; Wales; Commonwealth
Affairs; Education and Science; and Defence. A few of the older posts have
special titles: the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the
Treasury and a number of other departments), the President of the Board of
Trade and the Postmaster General.
Non-Departmental Ministers, who include the holders of various traditional
offices—the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of
Lancaster,1 the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and Ministers
without Portfolio. These ministers have few or no departmental duties and
are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime Minister
may wish to entrust to them.
The Lord Chancellor has departmental functions; he is also in a somewhat
special position as a Minister of the Crown who is also head of the judiciary
in England and Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England
and Wales, the Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland,
the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of Defence, who are appointed for the Royal Navy, the Army and
the Royal Air Force under the Secretary of State for Defence.
Ministers of State, who are additional ministers in government departments
where the work is particularly heavy and complex, or where it involves
frequent travelling abroad. There are now: four Ministers of State for Foreign
Affairs; three at the Board of Trade; two in the Department of Education and
Science; and one each in the Department of Economic Affairs, the Home
Office, the Commonwealth Office, the Scottish Office and the Welsh Office.
The Chief Secretary, Treasury, is also ranked with Ministers of State.
Junior Ministers, who generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or,
where the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under¬
secretary of State. The primary function of most junior ministers is to relieve
their senior ministers of some of their burden by taking part in parliamentary
debates and answering parliamentary questions, and by assisting in their
departmental duties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and the
Junior Lords of the Treasury are in a different category as Government
Whips.
1 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since 1399, has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and
is separately administered by the Chancellor.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Prime
Minister
The Cabinet
Cabinet
Meetings
The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister during
the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the
holder of this office derives from his ability to command a majority in
Parliament and from his power to submit his own choice of ministers to the
Sovereign and to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. Nowadays,
by convention, the Prime Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
It is the duty of the Prime Minister to inform the Sovereign of the general
business of the Government; to preside over the Cabinet; and to exercise
a general supervision over departments, settling departmental differences
and approving important departmental decisions where reference to the
Cabinet is not required. The Prime Minister speaks for the Government in
the House of Commons on the most important topics and answers questions
on its general administration in that House.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommenda¬
tions to the Sovereign for the appointment of Church of England archbishops,
bishops and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as
for appointments to high judicial offices, such as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justices of Appeal. He also advises the Crown
on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lord Lieutenants of counties1 and
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General
Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower,
and some university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The
Prime Minister makes similar recommendations for appointments to various
public boards and institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation,
as well as to various royal and statutory commissions. In addition, he makes
recommendations to the Sovereign for the award of many civil honours and
distinctions and of Civil List pensions. He selects the trustees of certain
national museums and institutions.
The Cabinet is composed of a number of ministers (usually about 20) who
are selected by the Prime Minister personally. Its origins can be traced back
to the informal conferences that the Sovereign held with his leading ministers,
independently of the Privy Council, during the seventeenth century. After
the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an active role in politics in the eighteenth
century, and the development of organised political parties stimulated by
successive extensions of the franchise from 1832 onwards, the Cabinet
assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are2: the final determination of the policy
to be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive
in accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous
co-ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments.
The exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet
is a group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the
support of a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential.
Its members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose
information about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the
publication of Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they

have been in existence for 501 years they may be made available for inspection
in the Public Record Office) and a resigning minister desiring to make a
statement involving disclosure of Cabinet discussions must first obtain the
permission of the Sovereign through the Prime Minister. From a practical
point of view, this secrecy is essential in the interests of unprejudiced discus¬
sion, which can only be maintained if there is no risk of publicity for every
statement made and every point conceded.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is
not sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any
time, if a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. During Cabinet
meetings decisions are reached on major issues of government policy, and
on other issues which cannot be settled elsewhere. A great deal of the work
of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system, which ensures that
the amount of business coming before the full Cabinet is kept at manageable
proportions. The system involves the reference of any issue either to a
standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc committee composed of the
ministers primarily concerned, which considers the matter in detail and
either disposes of it or reports upon it to the full Cabinet with recommendations
for action. Ministers not in the Cabinet are called to attend its meetings when
matters affecting their departments are under discussion; they may also be
members of Cabinet committees.
Detailed accounts of Cabinet meetings are not prepared; only the substance
of documents submitted, with a summary of arguments and conclusions, are
recorded; even these records have a strictly limited circulation. The Secretary
of the Cabinet is responsible for keeping the records.
Ministerial responsibility means both the collective responsibility which
ministers share for the policy and actions of the Government and the individual
responsibility of ministers to Parliament for the work of their departments.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, imposes upon ministers the obligation to
act not as individuals but (in the interests of stability of government) as a
united group. It does not require every Cabinet minister to be present at
every Cabinet meeting; and the obligations of individual ministers may be
passive rather than active when the decision to be taken does not relate to
their spheres of administrative responsibility. At the same time, every
minister should be fully informed of the subject of discussion beforehand, so
that if he has any objections he may voice them at the meeting. He may not
repudiate, either in Parliament or in his constituency, policies which have
received Cabinet approval, nor may he adopt policies that have not been
agreed with the other departments concerned (including the Treasury). A
minister must also be prepared to vote with the Government on all issues,
and where necessary to speak in support or defence of its policy; if he feels
himself unable to agree or to compromise with the view of the majority of
his colleagues in Parliament or elsewhere he must resign unless the Cabinet
has agreed otherwise. A minister who does not resign in these circumstances
cannot later reject criticism on the ground that he did not personally agree
with the policy adopted.
The doctrine of collective responsibility also means that the Cabinet is
bound to offer unanimous advice to the Sovereign, even when its members
do not hold identical views on a given subject.
Legislation is to be introduced to reduce this period to 30 years.
46
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Internal
Organisation
The individual responsibility of a minister for the work of his department
means that, as political head of that department, he is answerable for all its
acts and omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of admin¬
istration, any injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be
criticised in Parliament, whether he is personally responsible or not. Since
the majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons, they are
available to answer questions and to defend themselves against criticism in
person. Departmental ministers who are in the House of Lords must be
represented in the Commons by someone qualified to speak on their behalf,
usually their Parliamentary Secretaries.
Departmental ministers are expected to take the final decision on all
matters relating to their spheres of administration, unless these are of such
political importance that Cabinet sanction is required. If any departmental
decision brings a minister under criticism in Parliament he may be upheld
by the Cabinet, which will then treat the matter as one of confidence in itself;
or he may be disowned, when he alone will be liable to lose office.
The responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any
departmental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament dis¬
courages the taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to
government policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation.
They may, and frequently do, work with and through local authorities,
statutory boards, and government-sponsored organisations operating under
varying degrees of government control.
A change of Government does not necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments, although a radical change in policy
may be accompanied by organisational change. The widening scope of
government activity in the past half-century, however, has led to the
formation of many new departments. A few have existed for over 200 years.
The work of some departments, for instance the Post Office and the Board
of Customs and Excise, covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other
departments, for example the Ministry of Labour, cover Great Britain
(England and Wales, and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland); others, such
as the Ministry of Health, cover England and Wales only, and there are
similar but separate departments for Scotland and Northern Ireland. There
is also a separate department with certain responsibilities for affairs in Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in
which questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent
official, and a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament.
For instance, Treasury ministers are responsible for a number of departments,
including Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, the Central Office of Information,
the Treasury Solicitor’s Department, the Department of the Government
Actuary, the Royal Mint, the National Debt Office, the Public Works Loan
Board, and the National Savings Committee. The staff of departments are
all members of the Civil Service, a body of Crown servants recruited into the
service as a career.
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging
GOVERNMENT

Advisory Bodies
Distribution of
Functions
The Cabinet
Office
its duties there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments,
however, have certain features in common: for example, the minister of a
major department is likely to have at the head of his officials a permanent
secretary (known as the Permanent Under-Secretary of State in those depart¬
ments where the minister is a Secretary of State), one or more deputy secre¬
taries, and a varying number of under-secretaries and assistant secretaries.
Usually major departments also have a principal finance officer and a
principal establishments and organisation officer. A number of establishment
divisions have their own organisation and methods (‘O and M’) branch, the
members of which act in an advisory capacity. Many departments also have
their own legal advisers or solicitors, and their own information division.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local
offices.
Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or com¬
mittees (several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect
information, mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before
coming to a decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases
there is a statutory obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee.
In most cases, however, advisory bodies are appointed at the discretion of
the minister concerned because he feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved. Some are expert committees; others
include civil servants and representatives of varying interests and professions,
for instance, industrialists, trade unionists, university and industrial scientists,
educationists, lawyers and local government councillors and officers.
In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recom¬
mendations on specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal
Commissions, whose members are selected on the grounds of their wide
experience and diverse knowledge, may be appointed (by Royal Warrant).
Royal Commissions examine written and oral evidence from government
departments and other interested organisations and individuals, and on this
evidence submit recommendations. The Government may accept the
recommendations in whole or in part, or it may decide to take no further
action or to delay action until a later date. Inquiries may also be undertaken
by departmental committees, appointed by the head of the appropriate
department.
The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the
main government departments. They are arranged in alphabetical order,
except for the Cabinet Office, the Department of Economic Affairs and the
Treasury (which, in view of their central position, are placed first) and the
Scottish and Northern Ireland departments (which are grouped at the end
of the section). Further information on their work is given in later sections
under the relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office, a Secretariat of permanent officials, and an instrument of
great importance in the co-ordination of policy at the highest level, operates
under the direction of the Prime Minister. Its functions include circulating
the memoranda and other documents required for Cabinet business, preparing
draft agenda for approval by the Prime Minister, recording the discussions at
48
Central
Statistical
Office
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cabinet meetings, circulating the minutes to members of the Cabinet (and a
limited number of other ministers and officials), keeping in touch with the
progress of action on Cabinet decisions and safeguarding the security of all
Cabinet documents. The Cabinet Office also includes an historical section,
which is responsible for the preparation of Official Histories of the War.
Attached to the Cabinet Office, and an integral part of it, is the Central
Statistical Office, which is charged with the collection from departments of
statistics relating to the national economy, their analysis, and their prepara¬
tion as an agreed body of statistics to assist the Government in formulating
its economic and financial policy.
The Department The Department of Economic Affairs is headed by the First Secretary of
of Economic State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, assisted by a Minister of
Affairs State and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary.
The Department is organised in five inter-related groups: two dealing with
economic co-ordination and the others with economic planning and with
industrial and regional policy. One of the Economic Co-ordination Divisions
deals with such domestic issues as the effects of fiscal policy, demands on the
resources of particular industries, and policies for manpower, transport,
productivity, and prices and incomes. The other is concerned with the
development of external economic policy. The Economic Planning Division
manages the preparation of the national plan and works on the preparation of
medium-term, long-term and very long-range forecasts of the development of
the economy. The industrial policy group is concerned with measures designed
to promote industrial efficiency and growth and works closely with the
Economic Development Committees. The regional policy group is responsible
for regional policy and planning, including the regional aspects of policies on
industry, employment, land use and transport.
The Department works in close co-operation with the Treasury and other
departments.
The Treasury Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the
First Lord of the Treasury (now always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor
of the Exchequer and five Junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners
never meet as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and by
the Financial Secretary. There is also a Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury, who is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
Functionally, the Treasury is divided into four groups: the pay group,
which deals with the pay and working conditions of the various classes of civil
servants and handles questions about the pay of staffs in other parts of the
public service; the management group, responsible for developing manage¬
ment services, whose activities include organisation and methods work,
inquiries into and comparisons of management practices over a wide field,
and work on recruitment, training, manning and grading in the Civil Service;
the finance group, which brings together all questions affecting home an
overseas finance; and a fourth group, concerned with balancing public expen¬
diture against national resources and organising the control of this expenditure
under such headings as defence, social services, agriculture and transport.
The Treasury has prime responsibility for short-term economic assessments
and works in close co-operation with the Department of Economic Affairs on
economic analysis and forecasting, and many other questions.

The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of
all government Bills, except those Bills or provisions of Bills extending
exclusively to Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Depart¬
ment. The Office drafts all financial and other parliamentary motions and
amendments moved by the Government during the passage of Bills through
Parliament; it advises departments on questions of parliamentary procedure;
and it attends sittings in both Houses of Parliament. In addition, it drafts
delegated legislation when specially instructed, and advises the Government
on legal, parliamentary and constitutional questions falling within its special
experience.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible in England
and Wales for administering government policy for agriculture, horticulture
and fishing. The Ministry administers deficiency payments schemes and
various grants and subsidies designed to improve the efficiency of the
industries, and also gives free technical advice.
Schemes for the control and eradication of animal and plant diseases are
also administered by the Ministry, whose responsibilities extend to Scotland
in the operational control of certain diseases of animals.
In England and Wales the Ministry also deals with certain questions relating
to legislation about food, including labelling and advertising, slaughter¬
houses, and the quality and cleanliness of milk. Questions relating to the
supply and manufacture of food, its consumption, composition, preservation
and nutritional qualities, are dealt with by the Ministry for Great Britain
or the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries and participates in the agricultural and fishing activities of a number
of international organisations concerned with agriculture, fisheries and food,
such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The Ordnance Survey is administered by the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, although it is itself responsible for its day-to-day affairs.
It is in charge of the survey and mapping of Great Britain—the maps and
plans resulting from the survey ranging in scale from 1/1,250 to 1/1,250,000.
The survey also undertakes a considerable amount of agency work in
compilation, drawing and printing for other departments, particularly the
Ministry of Defence and the Land Registry.
The Ministry of Aviation is responsible for the execution of government
policy on the aircraft industry, the guided weapons industry, certain aspects
of space research and technology and for procuring certain equipment for the
fighting services. It was also responsible for civil aviation.1
The Ministry’s civil aviation responsibilities included the regulation of
flying, the promotion of air safety and efficiency, the provision, administration
and equipment of state-controlled civil aerodromes and other ground services,
the organisation of research on, and development of, civil aircraft, the
negotiation of international air transport agreements, the registration of
aircraft, the licensing of aerodromes, operators and personnel, and research on

corporations and dealt with various policy and financial questions affecting
them. He also appointed the members of the Air Transport Licensing Board.
The Ministry’s defence responsibilities include the research, development
and production involved in supplying the fighting services with aircraft,
guided missiles, nuclear weapons and electronic equipment.
The Common- The Commonwealth Office advises the Secretary of State for Commonwealth
wealth Office Affairs on all aspects of Commonwealth relations. It communicates on his
behalf with other Commonwealth Governments and with the Commonwealth
Secretariat,1 keeps in touch with and advises other United Kingdom Govern¬
ment departments on Commonwealth policy, provides information to the
British press and public about Commonwealth activities, and deals generally
with matters affecting members of the Commonwealth both as a group and
as individuals.
The Commonwealth Office co-operates closely with other departments,
particularly the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Overseas Development, in
discharging its responsibilities in those dependent territories in the Common¬
wealth for which the United Kingdom is still responsible. Each of these

secondary and other education include dealing with the supply, training and
superannuation of teachers, the building of new schools and other institutions,
the school health service, the special educational treatment of handicapped
children, and the provision of school meals and milk. In these matters the
Department works in co-operation with local education authorities—the
Inner London Education Authority and the councils of counties, county
boroughs, and the outer London boroughs—whose duty it is to secure
adequate facilities for all forms of education in their areas. Its relations with
the universities are conducted through the University Grants Committee
(appointed by the Secretary of State to advise on State aid to universities).
Its activities in the field of civil science are discharged through a number of
research councils, including the Medical and the Agricultural Research
Councils, the Natural Environment Research Council (which carries out and
supports research in earth science and ecology), the Social Science Research
Council, and the Science Research Council (which carries out scientific
research and is responsible for research grants and postgraduate training awards
not within the fields of the other councils, and is also concerned with research

The Scottish Development Department is concerned with a number of the
services affecting the physical development of Scotland, such as town and
country planning, new towns, housing, roads, water supplies and sewerage,
coast protection, flood prevention, and the prevention of river and air pollution
(most of which are administered locally by town and county councils) and
with the policy of the Electricity Boards in Scotland. The Department is
responsible for general policy in regard to local government, including its
financial aspects such as valuation, rating, and the allocation of the Exchequer
general and equalisation grants.
The Scottish Education Department supervises the administration of the
Education (Scotland) Acts and guides, through the local education authorities
and other bodies, the development of public education in Scotland in all its
forms. The Department’s functions include: the supervision of the training
of teachers and the issue of teachers’ certificates; the regulation of teachers
salaries and the administration of the Teachers (Superannuation) (Scotland)
Regulations; the control and distribution of specific Exchequer grants in aid
of educational expenditure; and the award of students’ allowances to those
taking full-time degree and comparable courses. The Department also exercises
general supervision over the child care and adoption services, remand homes,
and approved schools and is concerned with the administration of the Royal
Scottish Museum.
The Scottish Home and Health Department is responsible for: (a) the
central administration of functions relating to law and order; and (b) the
health and welfare services in Scotland. Under (a) the Department is con¬
cerned with the police and probation services, criminal justice, legal aid and
the services needed by the courts, and is directly responsible for the adminis¬
tration of prisons and borstal institutions. It is also the central authority in
Scotland for the fire service, for civil defence, and for legislation concerning
shops, theatres, cinemas and licensed premises (which are directly maintained
by the Department in districts in which State management is in operation).

includes the supervision of local arrangements for the aged and handicapped,
and medical and surgical treatment for war pensioners.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Scottish Information
Office, which undertakes information services on behalf of the Scottish
departments and, to some extent, for Great Britain departments in Scotland,
and acts as the agent in Scotland of the Central Office of Information; the
Department of the Registrar-General for Scotland (the General Registry
Office); the Scottish Record Office; and the Department of the Registers
of Scotland. There are also Scottish branches of the Great Britain and
United Kingdom departments under the direction of controllers, who are
responsible for ensuring that the execution in Scotland of the policy and
procedure of their departments is in accordance with Scottish conditions and
needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the
Solicitor General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government
on Scottish questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the
purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned
with questions of legal policy and administration and is himself responsible
for the institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland,
and the control of summary prosecutions in the sheriff court.
In some of this work the Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate’s
Department, the members of which also act as legal advisers on Scottish
questions to certain government departments who have no Scottish legal
adviser of their own. The work relevant to prosecutions is centred in the
Crown Office in Edinburgh.
The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland are incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department and are responsible to the minister concerned and
to the Law Officers for the drafting of all government Bills in so far as they
affect the law of Scotland. Their responsibilities in this connection are
similar to those of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury.
Executive and administrative powers on matters under the jurisdiction of
the Northern Ireland Parliament are vested in the Crown, and exercised
by the Governor, acting on the advice of the Northern Ireland Cabinet,
through a number of departments. Each of the seven ministries (Agriculture,
Commerce, Development, Education, Finance, Health and Social Services,
and Home Affairs) is under the control of a Minister responsible to the
Northern Ireland Parliament. In addition, there are a National Assistance
Board and an Exchequer and Audit Department which, together with the
Ministries of Home Affairs, Education, and Agriculture, have functions
indicated by their titles. The other departments have duties of a varied
nature, which are summarised below.
The Prime Minister’s Department includes the Cabinet Secretariat, the
Information Service and the Economic Section. It corresponds with the
Government of the United Kingdom on major matters of policy and acts as
a channel of communication between the Governor and the Cabinet and
between the Cabinet and departments.

THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant in Britain is a servant of the Crown (not being the holder of
a political or judicial office), who is employed in a civil capacity and whose
remuneration is found wholly and directly out of money voted by Parliament.
The number of civil servants under this definition is about a million, for it
includes several hundred thousand government industrial employees in such
establishments as Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Navy dockyards. The
term ‘Civil Service’ is, however, generally used only to cover non-industrial
members of the staffs of the various government departments in the United
Kingdom or working overseas. The total number of non-industrial civil
servants employed in all departments, at home and overseas, is approximately
822,ooo1; nearly one-third are women.
1 Including part-time staffs—two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent to
one whole-time officer.

Although the civil servant is legally a servant of the Crown, in practice he
serves the minister in charge of the department in which he works by advising
on the formulation of policy; by carrying out policy decisions and by under¬
taking the many government activities which affect the life of the citizen.
From time to time the minister changes but the civil servant remains to serve
his successor. In Britain changes of government do not involve changes in
departmental personnel, since it is considered that continuity makes for
administrative stability.
The Civil Service in its present form is a product of the past hundred years.
Before then, departments were free to choose their own staffs, qualifying
standards were unknown, there was no central supervision, and political
jobbery was rife. Measures of reform instigated during the nineteenth
century included the substitution of open competition for the practice of
obtaining civil service appointments by favour or purchase, and the establish¬
ment of an independent body, the Civil Service Commission, to organise
recruitment to the service. The great expansion in State activity in the last
50 years, and the consequent increase in the numbers of civil servants and
the scope of their duties, have led to further reorganisation: recruitment
competitions have been adapted to a developing educational system;
co-ordination between the various departments has been improved; and many
commissions and committees of inquiry have been appointed by the
Government to make recommendations for increased efficiency in the conduct
of public business.1 Moreover, civil servants, though they remain employees
of their departments, have become members of an integrated service with
common conditions of employment and their traditions and standards of
conduct belong, not to individual departments, but to the Civil Service as
a whole.
Uniformity in the Civil Service derives mainly from the fact that the
Treasury exercises general control. One of the two Joint Permanent Secre¬
taries to the Treasury is the official head of the Home Civil Service and the
principal adviser of the Prime Minister on matters affecting the Civil Service
as a whole, and in particular on appointments to senior posts in the service.
The Treasury is responsible for the salaries and conditions of employment
of all civil servants; it controls the total number of staff and the creation of
higher posts, maintains a central organisation and methods division which
serves all departments which do not maintain an organisation and methods
branch of their own, and deals with general questions relating to training
after entry into the Civil Service. It is also concerned with the number of
departments and the distribution of functions between them.
Because modern government touches almost every aspect of life, the Civil
Service comprises officers with a wide variety of professional and technical
qualifications. Where officers of a particular type are required in more than
one department they are organised in general service or linked departmental
classes. This ensures similar grading and salary structures for the same type
of officer in each department. The main classes are:
1. The Administrative Class, which is responsible for advising ministers on
policy, for dealing with any difficulties which may arise in carrying out
1 The most recent is the committee appointed by the Government in February 1966
to examine the structure, recruitment, management and training of the Home Civil
Service.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
existing policy and for forecasting the probable effects of new measures
and regulations. This relatively small class numbers about 2,500, new
entrants come from the universities but civil servants from other classes
may be promoted to the administration class and currently about 40 per
cent of the class entered in this way. (The equivalent grade in the
Diplomatic Service (see below) number about 1,000.)
2. The Executive Classes (General and Departmental, numbering some
79,000), which are responsible for the day-to-day conduct of government
business, including, for instance, the higher work of accounts and
revenue collection, within the framework of established policy. Members
of these classes may, after entry, train for specialist work such as that of
auditor, actuary or statistician.
3. The Specialist Classes (General and Departmental), which number
about 123,000 in a variety of different categories, carry out the wide
range of specialised activities which are now undertaken by the Govern¬
ment. The categories include accountants, architects, doctors, engineers,
lawyers, surveyors and scientists in all branches of science. The
professionally qualified staff are assisted by a large number of technical
and drawing office staffs.
4. The Clerical Class (General and Departmental) comprises about 132,000
officers who undertake all the usual clerical work involved in running
departmental business: for instance, the preparation of accounts and
the keeping of records, the handling of particular claims in accordance
with known rules, and the summarising and annotation of documents
for the assistance of senior officers. The personal secretaries of senior
officers are included in this group, together with officers directly
responsible for the supervision of clerical work.
5. The Ancillary Clerical Classes (with about 112,000 members), which
include clerical assistants, shorthand typists and typists, duplicator
operators and machine-operating grades.
6. Messengerial and Minor Classes (with some 35,000 members) which, in
addition to messengers, include paper keepers, office cleaners an
similar workers.
In addition there are other departmental classes where employment is
peculiar to one department: for instance, the Post Office, with its postmen
(120,000), telephone operators (52,000), postal and telegraph officers (22,000)
and over 100,000 staff for the installation, maintenance and development of the
telephone, telegraph and wireless systems. Other examples are the Factory
Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour and the Schools Inspectorate of the
Ministry of Education and Science.
The Diplomatic
Service
The Diplomatic Service is a separate self-contained service of the Crown,
which provides the staff (comprising some 6,300 civil servants) for service in
the Foreign Office and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom
diplomatic missions and consular posts in foreign and in independent
Commonwealth countries. . , ,
The Service has its own grade structure, corresponding by salary with the
grades of the Administrative, Executive and Clerical Classes1 of the Home
Civil Service; it also has Secretarial, Communications and Security Guard

branches. Various specialists and advisers from home departments or the
armed forces may serve at overseas posts on secondment or attachment to the
Diplomatic Service.
The Government of Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which deals
with matters transferred to its jurisdiction under the Government of Ireland
Act 1920. Subject to regional differences, the Northern Ireland Civil Service
is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, but recruitment to permanent
and pensionable posts is effected through the medium of a separate Civil
Service Commission. Interchange of staff between the two Civil Services
occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for departmental agreement
in individual cases.
Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but
when vacancies cannot be filled by this means, the Ministry for Overseas
Development and the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and
Administrations are asked to recruit other candidates, principally from the
United Kingdom.
The recruitment of permanent civil servants in the Home Civil Service of
Great Britain and the Diplomatic Service is in the hands of the Civil Service
Commission which, in the selection of entrants, is independent of both
ministerial and parliamentary control; its members are appointed by the
Crown on the advice of the Government. The normal method of entry is by
open competition, conducted in accordance with regulations approved by
the Treasury and consisting of written examination or interviews, or both.
The main points of entry into the main classes of the Home Civil Service
are planned to correspond to definite levels in the British educational
system, and it is the Commission’s duty to study the requirements of the
Civil Service in the light of the education provided by the schools and
universities.
In a number of junior grades, departments recruit their own staff and the
Civil Service Commission will consider granting those recruited permanent
status, if they possess the prescribed qualifications. Temporary civil servants
are also normally recruited by the department concerned. No special qualifying
examinations are required.
In all except the smaller government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors who organise both general and technical courses,
ranging from courses of systematic instruction for recruits in all classes to
‘refresher’ courses covering technical subjects or broader subjects, such as
management, organisation and communications, for more experienced staff.
Young people are given opportunities to continue their studies under ‘day
release’1 schemes.
Methods of training include discussion groups, case studies, instructional
films and the preparation of self-instruction programmes (‘programmed
learning’). There are also exchanges to enable civil servants to study the
working of appropriate outside bodies. Officers in the early years of their
service may be transferred from branch to branch and, more rarely, from
1 Schemes by which young employees and apprentices are released by their employers

department to department, in order that they may gain as wide an experience
as possible of Civil Service activities, and there are openings for selected
officers to travel abroad or to study at universities, technical colleges and
other educational establishments. Facilities are provided for officers who take
up private studies to have some degree of assistance, depending upon t e
vocational value of the subject. . . . ,
Training is co-ordinated by the Training and Education Division of the
Treasury, which is also responsible, with the National Whitley Council, for
guidance’and some aid to departments in the organisation and performance
of their training through a team of Training Liaison Officers. The Division
also runs central courses for members of the administrative, professional and
scientific classes at different stages of their careers and trains departmental
instructors and other special groups, for instance, superintendents of typists,
secretaries and staff in establishment divisions.
Promotion
Conditions of
Service
A period of probation (lasting from one to two years according to grade, with
extensions in certain instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the permanent
Civil Service. Promotions from grade to grade are made by departments;
those from class to class partly through centrally conducted competitions
(open only to serving members of specified Civil Service classes), and partly
by departments themselves. Promotions to most of the highest positions in
the Civil Service, that is, permanent secretaries, deputy secretaries, Pri^clPa
establishments officers and principal finance officers, must be approved by the
Prime Minister; he is advised in these matters by the official head of the Home
Civil Service.
Machinery for negotiation on conditions of service affecting the Civil Service
as a whole is provided by the National Whitley Council, which is composed
jointly of official and staff representatives. Negotiating machinery for separate
sections of the service is provided through the various staff associations which
civil servants are encouraged to join (for instance, the Civil Service Clerical
Association, the Union of Post Office Workers, the Society of Civil Servants,
the Institution of Professional Civil Servants, and the Association of First
Division Civil Servants), and through departmental Whitley Councils.
In general, the civil servant receives a salary which is based on a tair
comparison with that paid for similar work outside the service and usually he
receives annual increments up to the maximum of the scale of the grade to
which he belongs. In addition, although a civil servant holds office at the
pleasure of the Crown and may therefore be dismissed at any time, in practice
he enjoys a considerable measure of security of tenure. Thus every permanent
civil servant, who is capable and efficient, may reasonably expect a full career
in the public service and a pension on retirement2—-though this, again, is
not a legal right. , ., u
Civil servants are required to work a specified number of hours each wee .
Overtime is paid to members of most of the lower salary groups if they work
longer than the required hours. The standard working week for office staffs
is 41 hours in London and 42 hours in the provinces. Annual leave varies

year. Sick leave on full pay, less any national insurance benefit received,
may be granted to permanent civil servants for up to six months in any twelve
months, and on reduced pay up to a maximum of one year’s sick leave in any
four years; any officer whose health is permanently impaired may be retired
on medical grounds.
The position and functions of a civil servant remain the same whichever
political party is in power; and it is his duty to serve the government of the
day irrespective of his own political opinion. The extent to which he is free,
as a private individual, to participate in political activities varies according to
grade. For this purpose civil servants are divided into three groups: those who
are completely free to engage in all kinds of national and local political
activities (although if they intend standing for Parliament, they must resign
their appointment before nomination day1); those who are free, subject to
the acceptance of the need for discretion and with the permission of the
department, to take part in most activities except parliamentary candidature;
and those who are debarred from national political activities though they may
seek permission to take part in local government and political activities. In
the non-industrial Civil Service, the completely free groups are the mani¬
pulative grades of the Post Office, and the minor grades such as cleaners and
messengers. The intermediate group includes mainly clerical and typing
grades, and the granting of permission by the department depends, broadly,
on the nature of the work done. The group which is not allowed to take part
in national political activities includes the executive, the professional, the
scientific and technical, and the administrative grades. In general, because
the reputation of the service must be closely guarded, permission to take part
in local political activities will also be refused to members of this group if the
local activities are conducted on the same party lines and through the same party
organisations as national political activities. Where permission is granted, it
is subject to a code of discretion and to the obligation to notify the department
of election or co-option to a local council.
Civil servants of every grade may, of course, exercise the right of all
citizens to register their private political opinions on appropriate occasions,
for instance, at general or local authority elections. They may also engage
in such private activities as they wish, provided that these do not in any
way conflict with their official duties, nor with the provisions of the Official
Secrets Acts 19 n and 1920, and the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906.
However, since a civil servant must not use his official position to further his
private interests, he is subject to certain restrictions in commerce and business:
for instance, he may not hold private interests in public contracts and he may
not use official information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without the
approval of his department.
The political views of civil servants are not as a general rule a matter of
official concern, but there are some civil service duties in which secrecy is
so vitally important to State security that the Government does not feel
itself justified in employing any one to carry them out whose reliability is in
doubt. For this reason no one who is known to be a member of, or actively
associated or in sympathy with, the Communist Party or with Fascist
organisations is employed in connection with secret work.
1 Any civil servant in this group who is not elected will be reinstated in his previous
capacity on application within a week of the declaration of an election result.
68 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL FIANDBOOK
Each government department is responsible for its own internal security
and the Security Service, which operates independently under a Director-
General who is responsible for its efficiency to the Home Secretary, deals
with national security. In addition, there is a Security Commission which, if
requested by the Prime Minister in consultation with the leader of the
Opposition, may investigate and report on breaches of security in the public
service and, in certain circumstances, advise whether any change in security
arrangements is necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Government on a local basis has been part of the administrative system of
the United Kingdom for many centuries. In its present shape much of it dates
back to the late nineteenth century, when the conception of a comprehensive
system of locally elected councils to manage various services provided for the
benefit of the community was first incorporated in statute law. Since that time
there has been a large increase in the population, and a massive transformation
in the range, complexity and scale of local authority functions. Because of
this local government in Greater London has already been reorganised and
Royal Commissions are now carrying out a comprehensive review of the
structure and functions of local government in England and Scotland
respectively. In Wales work on the reorganisation of local government is
also under way.
In Northern Ireland the Minister of Development has initiated a funda¬
mental examination of the structure of local government.
Relationship
between
Central and
Local
Government
Local authorities are set up under the authority of Parliament, and their
powers and duties are defined by Acts of Parliament. Basically councils are
responsible to the law and to the local electors and not to the central
Government. They determine their own budgets, and no minister of the
Crown has power to suspend or dismiss them, nor to inquire into the way in
which they organise their business. However, in respect of certain services,
Acts of Parliament dealing with local government give ministers of the Crown
defined powers, some of which are designed to secure a measure of national
uniformity in the standard of service provided, or to safeguard public health,
while others are for the protection of the rights of individual citizens. For
some services the minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for
some there are strictly limited powers; for others no provision at all is made
for ministerial supervision.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local
government give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory
circulars and by giving advice in individual cases.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government is the main link between
local authorities and the central Government in England; in Scotland the
Scottish Development Department is responsible for general policy in regard
to local government; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ireland the
Ministry of Development.
Principal Types The main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
of Local (outside the Greater London area) and Northern Ireland is a division of the
Authority country into county boroughs and administrative counties. The county
boroughs (mostly with populations of over 75,000) are separate from the
GOVERNMENT
Constitution
and Election
Councils
69
counties and independent of them. The administrative counties are sub¬
divided into county districts—non-county boroughs, urban districts and rural
districts, the last-named being further divided into parishes1 (except in
Northern Ireland). Scotland is divided into counties (including 4 counties
of cities) which are independently administered; large and small burghs, and
districts. Each local authority division is administered by its own elected
council. In England and Wales (outside the Greater London area) there are
58 county councils, 82 county borough councils, 270 non-county borough
councils, 535 urban district councils, 473 rural district councils,2 about
7,500 parish councils and some 3,300 parish meetings (in parishes not large
enough to have a parish council); in Scotland, 33 county councils (two pairs
being combined for certain purposes), 200 town councils (including 4 for
counties of cities) and 198 district councils (2 counties not being divided
into districts); and in Northern Ireland, 2 county borough councils,
6 county councils, 10 non-county borough councils, 24 urban district councils
and 31 rural district councils.
The Greater London area is administered by the councils of 32 London
boroughs and the City of London, and by the Greater London Council (GLC).
Local councils comprise a number of unpaid elected councillors (and, in some
of cases, aldermen elected by the councillors), presided over by a chairman who
has varied ceremonial and civic duties to perform in addition to his work
on the council. In most boroughs of England and Wales and Northern
Ireland the chairman is the Mayor; in the City of London and certain
important boroughs, the Lord Mayor; in the Scottish counties, the Convener;
and in the burghs, the Provost or Lord Provost.
The normal term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local
government is three years; aldermen normally hold office for six years. In
some local authority areas the whole council retires every third year and
another is elected immediately; in other areas elections are held annually,
when one-third of the councillors retire. Procedure at local government
elections in Great Britain is governed by rules laid down by the Representation
of the People Act 1949.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to
vote at a local government election provided that he or she is 21 years of age
or over on the qualifying date, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish
Republic, is not subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local
government elector for the area for which the election is held. In Great
Britain a person qualifies for registration as a local government elector if,
on the qualifying date for the register (compiled annually), he or she is resident
in the council area or occupies therein, as owner or tenant, any rateable land
or premises of a yearly value of not less than £10. In Northern Ireland, in
order to qualify for registration as a local government elector, a person must
have been born in Northern Ireland or, alternatively, have resided con¬
tinuously in the United Kingdom for seven years immediately prior to the
qualifying date and must have either a resident occupier’s or a general
occupier’s qualification.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer con¬
cerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. The procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar
1 There are usually some 20-30 parishes in a rural district.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to that for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are more
restricted. Each elector has one vote for each seat contested in his electoral
area; he need not record all his votes, but must not give more than one vote
for each candidate.
Most candidates for election as councillor stand as representatives of one
of the national political parties; a few stand as members of an association
representing some local interest, or as independents. All must be of British
nationality, over 21 years of age, and must (1) be registered as local government
electors in the register of electors for the area of the local authority to which
they seek election, or (2) have resided within that area during the whole of
the 12 months preceding the election (or within 3 miles in the case of parish
councils), or (3) in England and Wales, own freehold or leasehold land in the
area. Candidates are also subject to a number of statutory disqualifications
designed to ensure that unsuitable persons do not offer themselves for election.
Procedure at local government elections in Northern Ireland is governed by
the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1962 and regulations made there¬
under by the Ministry of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland. These regula¬
tions are, in general, similar to those which apply in Great Britain, though
differing in certain particulars; for instance, there is no postal voting and the
only persons who may vote by proxy are Service voters.
Most local authority areas are divided into electoral districts for local
council elections. Administrative counties are split up, in accordance with
orders made by the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Minister
of Housing and Local Government, or the Secretary of State for Scotland, into
‘electoral divisions’. Boroughs, urban and rural districts in England and
Wales, and burghs in Scotland, are either divided into ‘wards’, or, if they are
small, left as single units. In rural districts the wards are based on parishes
which, if large enough, may be split into parish wards. In these types of local
authority area each ward returns one or more members.
County divisions each return one member to the council. At present
each London borough elects two to four councillors to the Greater London
Council, but after the 1967 elections the London boroughs are to be divided
into electoral areas (covering in most cases the same areas as parliamentary
constituencies), each of which will return one councillor.
Functions and
Services
It is the primary duty of every local authority to provide and administer
such environmental and social services as Acts of Parliament require it to
provide and administer. It may provide additional services under the
permissive powers of a general Act or under powers granted to it by local or
Private Bill legislation.
The responsibilities of local authorities depend upon their type, as follows:
in England (outside the Greater London area) and Wales county borough
councils are all-purpose authorities, while both county councils and county
district councils have particular functions allotted to them,1 which they
exercise independently to a considerable extent, although there is a certain
degree of delegation from county councils to county district councils,
especially of duties connected with town and country planning and the
education, health and welfare services. Parish councils or parish meetings
have a few functions of local interest which they may exercise of right. In
Scotland the town councils of the counties of cities are all-purpose authorities;
1 For instance, county
defence services, while
councils are generally responsible for the police, fire and
the district councils administer most of the environmental
civil
and
sanitary services.
GOVERNMENT
71
elsewhere, the county councils, the town councils and the district councils
all share in local government work. In Northern Ireland the position is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales, except that local authorities
are not called upon to provide or administer police, civil defence or (except in
Belfast) fire services; moreover county councils do not in general delegate any
of their functions to county district councils.
In Greater London the basic units of local government are the London
boroughs; the GLC is responsible only for those services which, by their
nature, require unified administration and control over the whole area. In
the City of London (an area of approximately one square mile in the centre
of the metropolis) the City Corporation exercises the general powers admin¬
istered and duties performed by the London borough councils.
Local authority services may be classified under three heads: environ¬
mental, protective and personal. The environmental services are designed
to secure local good order, amenity and public health. They include the
inspection and abatement of nuisances, drainage, sewerage, street cleansing,
refuse collection and disposal, litter prevention, rodent control, the super¬
vision of water supplies, measures for ensuring food hygiene and for preventing
air pollution, and the provision of baths and washhouses. They also include
the services for bridge and highway construction and maintenance, for street
lighting, public safety on the roads, and the provision of recreation grounds,
parks and similar amenities. Town and country planning is the major
environmental service. The protective services are the fire service, the civil
defence service and the police service, while the personal services range from
health services, education and housing to the provision of public entertainment.
Services concerned primarily with health and welfare cover the provision
of ante-natal, post-natal and child welfare clinics, and some residential and
day nurseries; the provision and supervision of midwifery services, health
visitors and home nursing facilities; measures for the prevention of illness and
the aftercare of physically or mentally sick persons; the provision of domestic
help where necessary; the ambulance service; the provision of facilities for
vaccination and immunisation against certain infectious diseases; and the
services for the permanently disabled or handicapped, for the aged and infirm
and for children deprived of a normal home life. Education and culture are
promoted by the establishment and maintenance of various types of schools;
by the provision of adult education centres, and art and technical colleges; by
the award of grants and scholarships to students of all kinds; and by the
provision of libraries, art galleries and museums. Housing needs are met, as
far as possible, by building new houses (mainly to let), acquiring old houses
and converting them to provide additional accommodation, planning for slum
clearance, seeing that adequate standards are maintained in both newly built and
older houses, and generally ensuring that housing conditions are satisfactory.
Some local authorities also engage in trading services, such as passenger
transport, water supply, and harbour, dock and pier services; they also have
power to initiate schemes to attract industrial development.
The above is only a brief outline of local authority services. Fuller
information is given under the relevant subject headings in later chapters of
this book.
Internal
Organisation
of Local
Authorities
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own
internal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they
will discharge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system,
whereby questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and
72
Officers and
Employees
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
committees are appointed to carry out the detailed administration of the
various services. Parish councils and the smaller district councils are often
able to do their work efficiently in full session although they appoint
committees from time to time, when any special study or experience is
required. The more important of the committees of the larger authorities
may divide their work among sub-committees, which stand to the parent com¬
mittee in a relation similar to that of the main committees to the whole
council. The execution of the policy decided upon by the council and the
committees rests with salaried officers and employees, whose number may
vary from about half a dozen in a small rural district to several thousands
in the large counties and in the larger county boroughs and burghs.
Apart from one or two minor provisions regarding the representation of
specialists on committees and the length of time certain members may hold
office, committees of councils are free from legal restrictions; even those
which are mandatory committees are constituted according to individual
reauirements and not according to any set pattern laid down. For purposes
of classification, however, they may be divided into two kinds: ordinary
committees and joint committees. Ordinary committees may be further
divided into mandatory committees, the appointment of which is compulsory
under an Act of Parliament; other standing committees, which are appointed
in accordance with the standing orders of the council on a permanent basis
according to the extent of the council’s business; and special committees,
which a council may set up for a limited period to deal with a particular
problem that once solved is unlikely to recur.
Joint committees or joint boards consist of representatives of more than
one authority. They may be established, outside the Greater London area,
for services that can be more effectively administered over a wider area than
that controlled by a single council, for instance, town and country planning,
water supplies and the police service.
The powers and duties of local authority committees (which may be
advisory or executive) are usually laid down in the appointing council s
standing orders. A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees,
except its powers in connection with raising loans, levying rates, or making
financial demands on other authorities liable to contribute (raising precepts
in England and Wales and levying requisitions in Scotland) which are legally
reserved to the council as a whole. County and county borough councils
exercise their powers of delegation to a considerable extent, but in most
districts and parishes councils use their committees only in an advisory capacity.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of the council (and
of some committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered
if the council resolve that publicity for that matter would be prejudicial to
the public interest.
Generally speaking, councils are free to make such appointments as they
deem necessary for carrying out their work, although certain posts (for
instance, the clerk, the treasurer, and the medical officer of health) are
compulsory in almost all councils. Choice of personnel is left to a great extent
to the individual council: in theory, the appointment of certain chief officers
is subject to some central control but, in practice, the nominee of the council
is nearly always accepted.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or
chief officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial
kind; subordinate officers employed in a professional, clerical or technical
GOVERNMENT
73
capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical work for
which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually made
at the instance of the committee or committees particularly concerned;
most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who are also
responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engagements
are always made in conformity with the council’s set establishment and
committees are informed of any appointments which they have not made
themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within
the jurisdiction of the employing council (except for the rare case where the
proposed salary of an officer requires the approval of a government depart¬
ment, as in the case of the clerk of a county council in England and Wales).
They are based on recommendations made by the Whitley Councils (see
note on p. 66), of which the largest, in England and Wales, are the National
Joint Council for Local Authorities’ Administrative, Professional, Technical
and Clerical Services and the National Joint Industrial Council for Local
Authorities’ Non-Trading Services (Manual Workers) and, in Scotland, the
Joint Negotiating Committee for Chief Officials of Local Authorities
(Scotland) and the Joint Industrial Councils for Local Authority Services. In
England and Wales conditions of service and salary scales for senior local
government officers are determined by separate joint committees. The local
government service in Northern Ireland has its separate joint negotiating
machinery at various levels.
All local government officers are expected to maintain a high standard of
conduct; as public servants they ‘must not only be honest in fact, but must
be beyond the reach of the suspicion of dishonesty’.
Local
Government
Finance
Grants
There are three sources of local authority income: government grants
(about two-fifths); local rates, paid by occupiers of land and buildings (about
two-fifths); and rents from municipal houses, dividends and interest (about
one-fifth). Capital investment is, for the greater part, financed by borrowing.
Government grants occasionally take the form of capital grants, paid on
approval of claims made by local authorities for specific services, principally
roads and public lighting; more often they are made on an annual basis,
either as specific grants, that is, for a particular service, or as non-specific
grants. The latter include the general grant1 and the rate-deficiency grants
(equalisation grants in Scotland), the latter being paid to authorities whose
rateable resources in relation to population are below the average for all
authorities. These two grants account for about four-fifths of all annual grants.
Specific grants are paid as ‘unit’ grants (a fixed annual payment according to
the number of units provided) for houses or as ‘percentage’ grants (a percentage
of approved expenditure) for a small number of services—mainly school
milk and meals, the police service and the construction and upkeep of roads.
The largest single grant is the general grant, which is paid by the Minister
of Housing and Local Government to county, county borough and the
London borough councils in England and Wales and by the Secretary of
State for Scotland to county and town councils in Scotland. This grant is
apportioned among the authorities according to a formula that takes into
account the size of the population in their areas and also such factors as the
number of children of school age, of young children and of old people and of
1 A Bill has been introduced to replace the general grant, rate deficiency grants and
some specific grants by a new rate support grant.
74
Rates
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
exceptionally high or low densities of population. The total amount of grant
in any year is fixed in advance, after consultation between the ministers and
the local authority associations.
In Northern Ireland there is a system of grants towards the cost of specific
services (for example, education, roads, housing, health and welfare, water
supplies and sewerage), supplemented by a general Exchequer contribution
which compensates for derating and takes account of the needs and resources
of individual authorities.
Rates are a form of local tax paid by the occupiers of land and buildings
(except agricultural land and buildings) as contributions to the cost of local
services. They are levied by a poundage on the rateable value of property;
in England and Wales this is equivalent to its net annual value which, in
turn, is based on the rent which it might reasonably be expected to command
if let from year to year with the tenant bearing the rates and the cost of
insurance and repairs. Valuation for rating in England and Wales is under¬
taken by valuation officers of the Board of Inland Revenue, who are
independent of the local authorities. In the latest valuation lists (1963)
rateable values for all classes of property are based on current rental values.
Transitional assistance is being given for eight years by the Greater London
Council to the councils of the home counties (Essex, Surrey and Kent) of
which parts have been absorbed into the Greater London area to offset extra
rate burdens caused by the reorganisation of London government; and the
Ministry of Housing and Local Government has a scheme for reducing
disparities in the rates levied in Inner London. In addition, rate rebates are
available to people with small incomes. Charities pay half the full rate on
property they occupy for charitable purposes but may be given further reliefs
by the rating authorities, who are empowered to reduce or remit the rates for
a wide range of non-profit-making bodies.
Appeals from valuations may be made to local valuation courts, eac
consisting of three members of an independent local valuation panel, and
thereafter to the Lands Tribunal.
In Scotland valuation is on a basis similar to that in England and Wales;
but it is carried out by assessors appointed by the councils of counties and
counties of cities. Appeals lie to the valuation appeal committee of each
valuation area and thereafter to the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the
Court of Session. A Scottish Valuation Advisory Council has been established
by the Secretary of State for Scotland. In Northern Ireland the valuation
authority is the Commissioner of Valuation, whose department is part of the
Ministry of Finance. Industry and freight transport in Northern Ireland are
rated at a quarter of their net annual value.
In England and Wales the responsibility for levying and collecting the rates
lies with the councils of county boroughs and county districts, with the
London borough councils and with the City Corporation. The rate poundage
for each county district consists mainly of a district rate and a county rate,
calculated in accordance with the respective requirements of the two
authorities, and the proceeds of the latter are passed on to the county council.
In rural districts the rate levied in each parish takes into account precepts
issued by the parish council or parish meeting. In Greater London the GLC
raises revenue by precepting on the London boroughs and the City. Rates
in Scotland are levied by the town councils in burghs and by county councils
elsewhere; to cover their expenditure, district councils levy a requisition
each year to the county council; a town council has to meet an annual requisi¬
tion from the county council in respect of the burgh’s share of the expenditure

on functions exercised by the county council throughout the county, including
the burgh. In Northern Ireland county councils are responsible for making,
levying and collecting the rates, except in such parts of the county as fall within
the jurisdiction of the county borough, borough, or urban district councils.
Loans may be raised by local authorities for financing such items of capital
expenditure as are sanctioned by the Minister of Housing and Local Govern¬
ment, the Secretary of State for Wales, the Secretary of State for Scotland,
or, occasionally, the government department responsible for the service for
which the capital is required. The Greater London Council applies annually
for parliamentary sanction to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure.
In Northern Ireland the government department responsible for the service
also issues the appropriate loan approvals. Borrowing powers for specific
purposes may also be taken under Acts of Parliament of local application.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by issuing mortgages, by issuing
stock upon the Stock Exchange and by bonds which may or may not be quoted
on the Stock Exchange. Although these bonds may be for any period, local
authorities normally issue them for one year. Local authorities also have
right of access to the Public Works Loan Board (financed by the Exchequer)
for a proportion of their long-term borrowing and may borrow temporarily
for a limited proportion of their outstanding loan debt.
Internal control of finance is exercised on behalf of the council concerned
by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy of
the council under constant review. In England and Wales an external audit
is carried out (except for certain general accounts in most of the county
borough and about two-thirds of the borough councils) by district auditors
appointed by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. County
borough councils must use the services of the district auditor for accounts
which relate to police, children and education, and local health and welfare
services. In both county and non-county boroughs rating and coast protection
are also subject to district audit. For their other accounts borough councils use
mainly professional auditors; a few use ‘elective audit’, which provides for the
appointment of three auditors: two elected by the local government electors
and one appointed by the mayor. In Scotland the accounts of each authority
are audited by a professional auditor appointed by the Secretary of State for
Scotland and paid by the council concerned, and in Northern Ireland by
special local government auditors appointed by the Ministry of Development.
THE FIRE SERVICE
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to
a measure of central control exercised by the Home Secretary (in England
and Wales) and the Secretary of State for Scotland. The fire services in
Northern Ireland are controlled by two authorities, the Belfast Corporation
and the Northern Ireland Fire Authority, which are responsible to the
Minister of Home Affairs. Every part of the United Kingdom is covered
by a public fire brigade.
There are 131 local authority fire brigades in England and Wales and n in
Scotland. In England and Wales, under the Fire Services Act 1947, separate
fire brigades are administered by the county and county borough councils,
which are the fire authorities for their areas and have powers and duties which
they exercise either separately or as combined authorities where neighbouring

councils care to make such arrangements in the interests of the efficiency of
the service. The Greater London Council is the fire authority for the Greater
London Fire Brigade. In Scotland the local authorities are grouped in n
areas each with a single brigade; with the exception of Glasgow, where the
town council of the city is the responsible authority, each area is administered
by a joint committee representative of the councils of the counties and large
burghs in the area.
There are also fire-fighting organisations outside the local authority service;
for instance those maintained by the Service departments of the Ministry of
Defence, by the Ministry of Aviation and by some large industrial and com¬
mercial concerns.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland may make
regulations regarding the maintenance of discipline, training, appointments
and promotions, pensions, the design and performance of equipment, and the
uniformity of fire hydrants in local fire brigades, and their approval is necessary
for certain reductions in establishment schemes. In matters affecting the fire
brigades as a whole (excluding discipline and conditions of service), each
minister is advised by the appropriate Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council,
consisting of representatives of the local authority associations, representatives
of the chief officers (firemasters in Scotland) and other members of the
brigades, and other persons having special qualifications. The National Joint
Council for Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great Britain and the National
Joint Council for Chief Officers of Local Authorities’ Fire Brigades in Great
Britain are the negotiating bodies on conditions of service of members of the
brigades. Inspectorates of fire services advise the Secretaries of State on
operational and technical matters.
Each fire authority is required to draw up a scheme showing the establishment
of officers and other ranks (both whole-time and part-time), the number and
location of fire stations and the number and type of appliances considered
necessary for the provision of an all-over cover of its area. Establishments
vary considerably according to the fire risks in the area concerned and are
not always up to strength; in the whole of England and Wales there are about
24,400 whole-time and 16,900 part-time firemen, operating more than 3,500
fire-fighting appliances (including pumps, turntable ladders, water tenders,
and emergency and salvage tenders) housed in some 1,600 fire stations. In
Scotland there are approximately 2,800 whole-time and 2,600 part-time
firemen, 530 fire-fighting appliances, and 320 fire stations.
It is the duty of each fire authority to buy such vehicles and equipment as
are required. Equipment is standardised, and appliances are bought by fire
authorities to specifications which ensure that essential standards are main¬
tained and yet allow sufficient freedom of design to meet local requirements.
Each fire authority must appoint a chief fire officer (firemaster in Scotland)
to be the head administrative and executive officer for its fire services. The
appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary or by the Secretary of
State for Scotland. The chief fire officer or firemaster is responsible to the
fire authority for seeing that the fire brigade is organised and managed in
accordance with policy.
All brigades have a central headquarters for operational control. Control
is, however, usually exercised on a local basis by divisional officers in charge of
the geographical divisions into which most areas are divided. Each divisional

Personnel
Finance
GOVERNMENT 77
officer has at his disposal a staff of whole-time officers and men, often
supplemented—particularly in country areas—by part-time officers and men;
and he is responsible for mobilising this force in the strength necessary for
dealing with any outbreaks of fire in his division. Constant communication is
maintained between divisional and brigade headquarters and, if at any time
an outbreak of fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division, help is
sent from one or more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of
another fire authority. Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire
authorities, the nearest available force is sent to the scene of a fire, regardless
of area boundaries.
In England and Wales the number of fire calls (in 1965) including false alarms
and special service calls for such purposes as rescuing persons and animals
trapped in dangerous situations, dealing with crashed aircraft, and pumping
and salvage operations was about 334,600. In Scotland the number of fire calls
was 3E745-
Estimated fire losses in the United Kingdom in 1965 amounted to about
£75 million, some million less than the corresponding figure for 1964.
About three-fifths of the total number of firemen in local authority fire
brigades work on a whole-time basis. The part-time firemen include retained
firemen who, in return for a retaining fee, undertake to attend fires if called
upon, and volunteer firemen, who receive no remuneration. Many fire
authorities employ women on communications and mobilising duties; some
have also introduced schemes for the employment of junior firemen between
the ages of 16 and 18 years, with a view to their being enrolled as regular
firemen at the age of 18.
Recruits and junior ranks in the fire service in England and Wales receive
practical training in basic firemanship at training schools run by fire authorities.
In Scotland similar training is carried out at a central training school which
is the responsibility of the Scottish Home and Health Department. Advanced
and specialised training courses, including fire prevention courses, are provided
for the higher ranks at the Fire Service College, Wotton House, near Dorking,
Surrey, which is maintained by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and
Health Department as the central training institution for the fire services, and
at the College Annexe at the Fire Service Training Centre, Moreton-in-Marsh,
Gloucestershire. The Home Office Fire Service Department arranges facilities
for properly accredited officers from overseas fire services to study the
organisation, current training methods, appliances and equipment of the
British fire brigades.
A report of a joint committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory
Councils has given guidance on the broad lines on which local training schemes
should be based, leaving discretion on certain matters to local authorities.
The report suggests the adoption of syllabuses of practical fire service
training, physical, general and technical education.
The fire authorities bear the cost of maintaining the fire service, but they receive
an Exchequer contribution which is included in the aggregate amount of the
local authority general grant (see p. 73). For the purpose of arriving at the
amount of this contribution, the Government receives from fire authorities
(at the time when the grant is to be considered) details of the last known
actual expenditure for a year, together wdth estimates for the impending
general grant period.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Side by side with fire-fighting operations, fire authorities have important
responsibilities in respect of fire prevention. They have a statutory obligation
to maintain adequate arrangements for giving advice about fire prevention to
anyone who requires it, and have been made the enforcing authority for fire
precautions under a steadily growing number of Acts of Parliament, of which
the most notable are the Factories Act 1961, and the Offices, Shops and
Railway Premises Act 1963. There are provisions relating to fire and fire
prevention in a large number of other Acts with which fire authorities are
concerned, either in their own right as fire authorities or by virtue of the
advisory functions of their fire brigade.
Within brigades, the work of fire prevention is entrusted to a staff of fire
prevention officers. Other sources of advice on fire prevention include the
various insurance companies who advise their policy holders, and the Fire
Protection Association, a non-profit-making body established by the Fire
Offices’ Committee1 as an advisory centre on a nation-wide basis for industry
and the general public on protection of life and property against fire.
Research into all aspects of fire prevention and fire fighting, and in particular
into the relationship between the frequency and severity of outbreaks of fire,
the effects of fire fighting and the provision of protective equipment within
buildings, is undertaken by the Joint Fire Research Organisation under the
general direction of the Fire Research Board. The cost of the Organisation
is shared equally between the Ministry of Technology and the Fire Offices’
Committee who, jointly, nominate the members of the Fire Research Board.
The Organisation operates from a fire research station at which tests are
carried out.
In Northern Ireland the Belfast Corporation controls the Belfast Fire Brigade
and is responsible for the area inside the city boundary, and the Northern
Ireland Fire Authority covers the rest of the country outside Belfast.
The Belfast Fire Brigade maintains five whole-time stations and has an
establishment of 284 officers and men manning 14 appliances, while the
Northern Ireland Fire Authority has one whole-time station in Londonderry
and 44 other stations throughout the remainder of the area, and an establish¬
ment of 103 whole-time officers and men and 656 part-time firemen, manning
71 appliances.
The amount of fire service grant payable to the Northern Ireland Fire
Authority is 50 per cent of the loan charges in respect of capital expenditure
which do not exceed £90,000 and 25 per cent of the amount (if any) by which
the loan charges exceed £90,000, together with 50 per cent of the first £24.0,000
of other net expenditure and 25 per cent of the excess over that amount.
Expenditure in excess of the fire service grant is apportioned among the local
authorities liable to contribute to the funds of the Authority. Under the Fire
Services Acts, the Belfast Fire Brigade cannot qualify for the payment of fire
service grant.

LAW AND ORDER
79
THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary state, it does not have a single
body of law applicable universally within its limits; and in England and
Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland, respectively, separate systems are in
force (see p. 25). There are, however, similarities between the systems. As
between England and Wales on the one hand and Northern Ireland on the
other the similarity is general, due to the closeness of the association between
these countries since the twelfth century. As between Scotland and the rest
of the United Kingdom the differences are more extensive, although the
existence, during the past 250 years, of a common Parliament, a common
public opinion on broader issues, and a common court of appeal for civil
cases has resulted in substantial identity at many points.
A feature which is common to all the systems of law in the United Kingdom
(and differentiates them from some continental systems) is that there is no
complete code. The sources of law in all the British systems include statutes
dealing with particular subjects, and a large amount of unwritten or ‘common’
law, which can be gathered from numerous decisions of the courts and from
other sources. English law today is contained in about 3,000 Acts of
Parliament, several thousand Statutory Instruments and over 300,000
reported cases.
Statute law includes Acts of Parliament and delegated or subordinate
legislation made under powers conferred by Parliament. It is absolutely
binding on all courts of the United Kingdom, taking precedence over any
other source of law. A large volume of modern legislation, particularly in
the social field, applies throughout the United Kingdom.
The common law of England originated in the customs of the realm and
was built up by decisions of the courts. A supplementary system of law,
known as ‘equity’, came into being during the Middle Ages to provide and
enforce more effective protection for existing legal rights. It was administered
by a separate court and later became a separate body of legal rules. In 1873
the courts of equity were fused with the courts of common law, so that all
courts now apply both systems but, where they conflict, equity prevails.
In Scotland the basis of common law, which largely depends on the canon
law of Rome, helped by continental commentators, is embodied in the
writings of certain seventeenth, eighteenth and early nineteenth century
lawyers of great repute who, between them, described systematically almost
the whole field of private and criminal law as existing in their times. Broadly
speaking, the principles enunciated by these lawyers, together with the many
judicial decisions which have followed and developed from those principles,
form the body of Scots non-statutory law. Scotland has never had a separate
system of equity—equitable principles having always permeated the ordinary
rules of law.
A feature common to the legal systems of the United Kingdom is the
distinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. Criminal law
is concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole; civil law is
8o

AND WALES

BRITAIN : AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
the community between themselves.
The courts of ordinary criminal jurisdiction in England and Wales include.
magistrates’ courts, which try the less serious offences and conduct preliminary
inquiries into the more serious offences; courts of quarter sessions, which try
most of the more serious offences; and courts of assize, including the Central
Criminal Court (for Greater London) and the Crown Courts in Liverpool
and Manchester, which try the gravest offences and cases of special difficulty.
All trials at quarter sessions and assizes are conducted with a jury (see p. 92).
Most magistrates’ courts consist of two to seven lay magistrates known as
justices of the peace. The justices are unpaid; are not required to possess any
legal qualifications although they must undergo a period of training; and may
obtain advice on points of law, when required, from the clerk to the justices. In
some of the large cities there are also paid, or ‘stipendiary’, magistrates who
are professional lawyers and usually sit alone. In inner London there is a
unified system of magistrates’ courts, in which either a metropolitan stipendiary
magistrate or justices may sit. The great majority of offences (over 97 per cent)
committed are disposed of in magistrates courts.
Specially qualified magistrates sit in juvenile courts1 to hear cases involving
young persons under 17 years of age who are charged with any offence except
homicide or are brought before the court as being in need of care or protection,
as beyond control, or as persistent truants. These courts, which sit either in a
different room or building from other courts, or at a different time, and at
which only limited publicity is allowed, also deal with many applications for
the adoption of children.
Domestic Proceedings are also tried by not more than three justices, o
whom one should be a man and one a woman. The hearing of domestic
proceedings is separated from other business and, as in juvenile courts, the
public is excluded.
Courts of quarter sessions sit at least four times a year; in the busier places,
they meet much more frequently than this.
All counties have courts of quarter sessions and 98 boroughs also have
separate courts which exercise jurisdiction within their own boundaries. In
counties the courts are generally presided over by a bench of lay magistrates
under a legally qualified chairman. In boroughs the courts are presided over
by a single judicial officer, the Recorder, who is a barrister specially appointed
to act part-time in this capacity. In Greater London there are five areas, each
with its own quarter sessions, presided over by a full-time paid chairman or
deputy chairman.
Courts of assize are branches of the High Court presided over by High Court
judges and held at assize towns—generally in the county town of each county
and in certain of the other larger towns and cities. The judges go round
‘on circuit’ three times a year—on the autumn, winter and summer assizes.
Each town is visited once on each circuit; the larger towns are visited twice.
After the trial of criminal cases in each town, the judges deal with civi
cases.
1 The Government has put forward provisional proposals for taking children under 1 ,
so far as possible, out of the ambit of the criminal courts and for separating the arrange¬
ments for the trial and treatment of young people in the 16-21 age group from th
adult criminal courts and the adult penal system.

In Liverpool and Manchester, Crown Courts act both as quarter sessions for
the two cities and as assize courts for South Lancashire. The courts are
presided over by the Recorders of Liverpool and Manchester, who are
whole-time judicial officers. Where the work requires additional courts, the
Recorders may be assisted by Commissioners, who may be county court
judges.
The Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey in the City of London acts as
the court of assize for the criminal business of Greater London. The court
sits in virtually continuous session; more than one court sits at one time and
each is presided over by a salaried judicial officer.
Appeals may be brought on a point of law, by either the prosecutor or the
defendant, direct from the magistrates’ court to the High Court; but the more
usual appeal is that of a convicted person against his conviction or his sentence,
which is heard by quarter sessions.
Appeals against convictions or sentences by quarter sessions, assizes or
Crown Courts go to the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal (see p. 84).
Appeals on questions of law may be brought as of right, but on other grounds
only by leave of the court. The Lord Chief Justice or a Lord Justice of Appeal
presides in the Criminal Division and Queen’s Bench judges sit with Judges
of Appeal. On appeal against conviction the court has power to quash the
conviction and direct the appellant’s acquittal or, if the appeal is allowed on
grounds of fresh evidence only, to order a retrial. A further appeal from the
Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal to the House of Lords can be
brought if the court certifies that a point of law of general public importance
is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords that the point
is one that ought to be considered by the House.
There is no restriction on the right of a private citizen to institute criminal
proceedings, but most prosecutions in England and Wales are, in fact,
initiated and conducted by the police. In some cases the consent of the
Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions or, less frequently,
a government department is required. The Director of Public Prosecutions
is also concerned with prosecutions in all the more serious classes of indictable
offences (that is, offences involving formal written accusation); in courts where
a substantial number of cases with which he is concerned are tried, standing
counsel are appointed by the Attorney General to appear on his behalf.
At the Central Criminal Court in London, for instance, there is a panel
of counsel known as Treasury Counsel, who are retained to prosecute in the
Director’s cases.
In criminal cases arrest may be effected either on a warrant issued by a
judicial authority on information laid before it or, in certain cases, without
a warrant. In the latter circumstances, a police officer may release the defen¬
dant on bail, that is to say he may discharge him temporarily, subject to his
entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a reasonable sum
of money, to appear in court at the time appointed for the trial. Magistrates
also have discretion to grant bail, and this discretion is liberally exercised
in accordance with well-established principles. An arrested person must be
charged at once with the offence of which he is suspected; under the Judges
Rules,1 once a person has been charged with or informed that he may be
1 These Rules do not have the force of law but carry very great weight.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

prosecuted for an offence, no further questions relating to that offence may
be put by the police, save in exceptional circumstances for the purpose of
preventing or minimising harm or loss to any person or to the public, or for
clearing up an ambiguity in a previous answer or statement. Unless the offence
of which an arrested person is suspected is serious, he must be granted bail
if he cannot be brought before the court within a day.
If anyone is detained in custody and thinks that the grounds1 for his detention
are not lawful, he (or, if he is unable, someone acting on his behalf) may sue
out a writ of habeas corpus against the person who detained him, this person
then being required to appear before the court on the day named to show
cause for detention. An application for a writ of habeas corpus is normally
made to a divisional court. If no such court is sitting the application may be
made to a single judge (where possible to one sitting in court) who may, and in
some cases must, direct that the application should come before a divisional
court. An application on behalf of anyone under 21 is always first made to a
judge sitting in chambers or in private. A writ may be refused only by a divi¬
sional court.
Nearly all criminal cases are tried first in magistrates’ courts. Most involve
either summary offences which may be disposed of by the justices sitting
together without a jury, or the less serious indictable offences which may be
dealt with in the same way, if the defendant consents. For the more serious
offences the magistrates sit as ‘examining justices’ to determine if there is
sufficient evidence to justify committal of the defendant for trial in a higher
court before a jury.
Since criminal law presumes the innocence of the accused until his guilt
has been conclusively proved, the prosecution should not have any advantage,
apparent or real, over the defence. Every accused person has the right to
employ a legal adviser for the conduct of his defence and if he cannot afford
to pay he may be granted legal aid at the public expense. Anyone remanded
in custody may be visited in prison by his legal adviser. During the preparation
of the case, it is customary for the prosecution to inform the defence of any
relevant documents which it is not proposed to put in evidence and to disclose
them if asked to do so.
All criminal trials are held in open court and the rules of evidence (which
are concerned with the proof of facts and much the same in civil and criminal
trials) are rigorously applied.2 For instance, although the uncorroborated
evidence of one witness is, as a matter of English law, sufficient, conviction
in criminal cases solely on the evidence of an accomplice (or accomplices) is,
in practice, never allowed unless the judge has warned the jury of the danger
of convicting without corroboration.
During the trial the accused has the right to hear and subsequently to
cross-examine (normally through his counsel) all the witnesses for the
prosecution; to call his own witnesses who, if they will not attend the trial
of their own free will, may be ‘subpoenaed’, or legally compelled, to attend,
and to address the court either in person or through his counsel. But he
cannot himself be questioned unless he consents to be sworn as a witness
1 Lawful grounds include: in pursuance of criminal justice; for contempt of court or of
either House of Parliament; for disobeying a court order to pay a civil debt when able
to do so; detention of persons found to be mentally disordered; detention or children
by their parents or guardians. The writ of habeas corpus runs in both criminal and civi
cases.

Committee.

in his own defence. The right to cross-examine the accused, even when he
is so sworn, is limited by law, with the object of excluding inquiry into his
character or into past offences not relevant to the particular charge on which
he is being tried. Furthermore, although confessions made in the course of
previous judicial proceedings are admissible as evidence if they have been
made upon oath, no confessions made in any other circumstances should be
admissible unless it can be proved that they were made voluntarily, that is,
without fear of prejudice or hope of advantage.
In criminal trials by jury the judge determines questions of law, sums up
the evidence for the benefit of the jury, and acquits the accused or passes
sentence according to the verdict of the jury; but the jury alones decides
the issue of guilt or innocence. The verdict of a jury must be unanimous1;
if its members cannot agree, the case must be tried before a new jury.
If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no right of
appeal and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offence. If a
defence of insanity is accepted by the jury the verdict is ‘not guilty by reason
of insanity’ and the accused will be detained in a suitable hospital. From a
verdict of guilty or of not guilty by reason of insanity there is a right of appeal
on the part of the defendant to the appropriate court.
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in England and Wales are the county
courts, which are the courts for the lesser cases, and the High Court, where
the more important cases are tried. Most appeals go to the Court of Appeal
and from there may go to the House of Lords.
County Courts (of which there are nearly 400) are so located that no part of
a county is more than a reasonable distance from one of them. They are
presided over by a paid judge, who almost always sits alone, although he may
sit with a jury consisting of eight persons if either party wishes it and the court
makes an order to that effect. There are 85 county court judges now in office,
each having a circuit, which is either one court, or a group of courts, depending
on the amount of work to be done.
Generally speaking the jurisdiction of the county courts includes all civil
actions where the amount claimed is not more than -£500 or where, in actions
for the recovery of land, the rateable value of the land is not more than £500
a year. Cases outside these limits may be tried in the county court by consent
of the parties, or may be transferred to the High Court. Some actions, in
particular actions for libel and slander, cannot be brought in the county court.
In addition to the ordinary county courts, there are still a few local courts with
somewhat similar jurisdiction. Most of these are survivals from the medieval
borough courts, and have little or no work to do at the present time, but
the Liverpool Court of Passage, the Salford Hundred Court and the Mayor’s
and City of London Court are still well used.
The High Court of Justice forms part of the Supreme Court of Judicature.
Its jurisdiction is both original and appellate, and covers virtually all civil
causes and some criminal causes.
The High Court is divided into the Chancery Division, the Probate,
Divorce and Admiralty Division, and the Queen’s Bench Division. The work
is distributed between them in accordance with the Rules of Court (see p. 81)
and the practice of the courts. Although the rules do not give exclusive
jurisdiction in any matter to any one division, in practice each division has a

separate field of jurisdiction and the judges are attached to a particular
division.
The High Court is staffed by 62 puisne1 judges. The Lord Chancellor is,
in strict law, the president of the whole High Court (although, in practice,
he does not sit in any Division); he is also nominally head of the Chancery
Division, of which the Master of the Rolls2 is another nominal member; there
is a President for the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division; and the Lord
Chief Justice of England presides over the Queen’s Bench Division. For the
hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly. Appellate
jurisdiction is exercised either by divisional courts consisting of three (or
sometimes two) judges, sitting in one of the three Divisions of the High Court
or, in some cases, by a single judge.
Nearly all appeals from magistrates’ courts, ministerial decisions and the
decisions of judges sitting in Chambers3 are heard in the first instance in the
appropriate divisional court of the High Court,4 but all the more important
appeals in civil actions come before the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal,
which is part of the Supreme Court of Judicature, and some (with leave of the
Court of Appeal or of the House of Lords) before the House of Lords, which
is the ultimate court of appeal in civil cases in the whole United Kingdom.
The Civil Division hears appeals from the High Court, the county courts
and assizes in civil cases. The Lord Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, and most of the
Lords of Appeal in Ordinary are members of the court, but its effective head
is the Master of the Rolls, who is assisted by eleven Lord Justices of Appeal;
the Court sits in divisions, each with three judges.
The judges in the House of Lords are the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but often sit as a group of five, and some¬
times of seven. Lay peers may not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally takes place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber),
but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may sit. The president
is the Lord Chancellor.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved
person; no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is
required. The most common form of proceedings is an action commenced
by a writ served on the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant
that the plaintiff has a claim on him and states the nature of the claim. If the
defendant intends to contest the claim, he ‘enters an appearance’ by informing
the court to this effect and documents setting out the precise question in
dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court.
Because civil proceedings are a private matter, they can at any time be
abandoned or compromised without leave of the court5 and, in fact, in the
great majority of cases, the parties to a dispute are able to settle their differences
through their solicitors before the stage of actual trial is reached. Actions that

are brought to court are usually tried by a judge without a jury, except in cases
involving claims for defamation, false imprisonment, unlawful arrest, seduction,
or breach of promise to marry, when either party may insist on trial by jury,
or in a case of fraud, when the person charged may claim this right. In
trials where a jury is present, it is responsible for deciding questions of fact
(as in criminal trials) and also the amount of damages to be awarded to the
injured party.
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Refusal to obey a judgment directing the defendant to do something or to
abstain from doing something may result in imprisonment for contempt of
court. Arrest under an order of committal may be effected only on a warrant
of the court.
As a rule, the court awards the costs of an action (the barrister’s fees,
solicitor’s charges and essential disbursements) to the winning party, although
in practice he always pays part of them. In certain circumstances (for instance,
extravagance or negligence in the conduct of the case), the court may, in its
discretion, refuse to order that one party’s costs should be borne by the other.
Criminal cases in Scotland are heard either under solemn procedure, that is,
where proceedings are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury,*
or under summary procedure, where the judge sits without a jury. All cases
in the High Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff court
are tried under solemn procedure. Proceedings are taken under summary
procedure in the more minor cases in the sheriff court, and in the justice of
the peace and burgh (or police) courts.
These courts are established in burghs. The judges are town councillors who
are serving (or have served) in the office of magistrate of the burgh. In
Glasgow stipendiary magistrates act as judges of two of the courts.
These courts are organised on a county (and county of city) basis, the judges
being the justices of the peace for the county (or county of city).
Any court of summary jurisdiction sits as a juvenile court1 when hearing
charges only against persons under 17 years of age. Special justice of the peace
juvenile courts have been established in three counties and in the city of
Aberdeen.
Scotland is divided into sheriffdoms, each consisting of a county or combina¬
tion of counties, and these sheriffdoms are further divided into sheriff court
districts. A sheriffdom has a sheriff and a number of sheriffs-substitute who
act as the judges of the court. The sheriff courts exercise an extensive civil
jurisdiction, as well as a criminal jurisdiction.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court of first instance.
Any one of the following judges is entitled to try cases in the High Court:
the Lord Justice General (who is also the Lord President of the Court of
Session), the Lord Justice Clerk, or any one of the 14 Lords Commissioner
of Justiciary who are also judges of the Court of Session. The seat of the
court is in Edinburgh, but the judges go on circuit to preside at trials in
other towns.

may appeal to the High Court of Justiciary (a) against his conviction on any

ground which involves a question of law alone, or, with leave of the High
Court or upon the certificate of the judge who presided at the trial that it is a
fit case for appeal, on any ground, and (b) against his sentence, with the leave
of the High Court, unless the sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals are heard
by three or more judges, and there is no further appeal to the House of Lords.
A person convicted summarily may appeal to the High Court, but only on
questions of law and procedure, and not on issues of fact.
In Scotland the police make preliminary investigation of all cases of crime
discovered by or made known to them, but it is for the Public Prosecutoi
concerned (the Lord Advocate in the High Court, the Procurators Fiscal in
the sheriff court, and the justice of the peace fiscal and burgh prosecutor in
the justice of the peace and burgh courts respectively) to decide whether or
not to prosecute and, in the case of the Procurator Fiscal, to decide whether
to proceed summarily or to charge the accused by petition with a view to
proceedings on indictment.
The police in Scotland have the same powers of arrest as have the police in
England and Wales. The Judges Rules do not apply in Scotland, but when
an accused person is arrested, he should be cautioned and have the charge
read over to him. Thereafter, only the accused’s voluntary statements should
be used in evidence at his trial, and the court will reject any statements made
by him unless it is satisfied that they have been fairly obtained.
As in England and Wales, a person apprehended in Scotland must be
brought before the court competent to deal with his case with the least possible
delay. There is no equivalent in Scotland to the public preliminary investiga¬
tion before examining magistrates held in England and Wales prior to
committal for trial. Where a prosecution on indictment is contemplated, the
accused is brought before a magistrate for judicial examination. The
magistrate then commits the accused for trial, but he may first commit him
for further examination. Eight days may elapse between commitment for
further examination and commitment for trial.
Persons in custody, other than those charged with murder or treason, may
be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the jurisdiction
of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or the police.
Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be accepted at the discretion
of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a right of
appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail,
by the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the
amount fixed.
The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High Court
of Justiciary has power to release persons unlawfully detained and accused
persons must, in any event, be brought to trial within no days of committal.
In trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ diet takes place in the sheriff
court, when the accused is called upon to plead guilty or not guilty. If he
pleads not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ diet in the
appropriate court. If he pleads guilty, and it is a case which is to be dealt
with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a High
Court case it is continued to the second diet in the High Court for disposal.
The second diet is held at least nine days after the pleading diet, either
before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury. Evidence is led (without
opening speeches) and there are closing speeches for the prosecution and for
the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the jury. The jury may return

a verdict of not guilty or ‘not proven’, both of which result in acquittal, or
they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case the court proceeds to deliver
sentence. The verdict (unlike that of an English jury) may be by a majority.
Fairness to the accused is ensured by the fact that, with a few minor exceptions,
no person may be convicted without the evidence of at least two witnesses,
or corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances which clearly
implicate the accused person in the crime.
At summary trials the accused is asked to plead to the charge at the first
calling of the case and, if he pleads guilty, the court may dispose of the case.
Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or it
may appoint a trial diet for a later date.
The main courts of civil jurisdiction in Scotland are the sheriff courts which,
in their civil capacity, correspond roughly to the county courts in England
and Wales, and the Court of Session, which is the supreme civil court in
Scotland.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to nearly all actions and is
unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the sheriff-
substitute, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-
principal or directly to the Court of Session. Minor civil matters (actions
not exceeding £5 in value) may be tried by justices of the peace.
The Court of Session has universal jurisdiction, sits only in Edinburgh, and
has sole jurisdiction, inter alia, in divorce actions. The court is divided into
two parts: the Outer House, a court of first instance, and the Inner House,
which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner House is divided into two divisions
of equal status, each consisting of four judges—the first division being
presided over by the Lord President and the second division by the Lord
Justice Clerk. From the Inner House an appeal may lie to the House of
Lords.
The Scottish Land Court is a special court that deals with certain agricultural
matters. The court is presided over by a legal chairman, who has the rank
and dignity of a judge of the Court of Session.
In Scotland civil proceedings are initiated by the service on the defender of
a writ or summons, which sets out the nature of the decree which the pursuer
seeks, a statement of facts upon which the pursuer founds his claim, and a
statement of the legal propositions upon which the pursuer maintains he is
entitled to the remedy which he seeks. In Court of Session actions the next
step is the calling of the summons, which is the publication of the action in
the court lists. If the defender intends to contest the action, he must ‘enter
appearance’ within two days of calling and thereafter lodge defences to it.
In ordinary sheriff court actions ‘entering appearance’ is followed by the
‘tabling’ of the case, which involves a formal appearance in court. In summary
and small debt actions the defender is simply given notice of the date on
which the action will be heard. It is much more common in Scotland than in
England and Wales to have legal debates in court as to the competency or
relevancy of the written pleadings prior to the proof.
In Scotland a pursuer can abandon his case, including any matrimonial
case, at any time, but where abandonment is sought after the commencement
of the proof or trial, only with leave of the court. Trial by jury in civil action
in Scotland is more common than in England and Wales, being the usual
form of procedure in actions for damages for personal injuries.

COURTS IN
NORTHERN
IRELAND
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Both civil and criminal courts in Northern Ireland are similar to those in
England and Wales with some minor modifications to suit a smaller
community. The superior courts comprise the Supreme Court of Judi-
cature (consisting of the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal)
and the Court of Criminal Appeal. The High Court is the superior court
of first instance, is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s Bench
Division (including probate, matrimonial and Admiralty proceedings) and
the circuit courts (assizes) and is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice,
as president, and two judges. The Court of Appeal, which is the appellate
tribunal, is constituted of the Lord Chief Justice and two Lords Justices of
PThe inferior courts are the county courts and courts of summary jurisdiction
(petty sessions). Courts of quarter sessions have been amalgamated with the
county courts, which now exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction and
are presided over by county court judges, of whom there are five (two of
them having the title of Recorder-of Belfast and of Londonderry). At least
four sittings of the court are held annually in each division. Petty sessions
courts are composed of one resident magistrate (who corresponds to a
stipendiary magistrate in England and Wales) who sits alone except in some
specific cases, for instance in a special crimes court, where two may adjudicate.
Juvenile courts are composed of one resident magistrate and two lay members,
one of whom must be a woman.
SPECIAL COURTS
Coroners’
Courts
Coroners’ courts are common law courts convened when a person appears
to have died a violent or unnatural death or a sudden death of which the
cause is unknown, and in certain other circumstances.1 In such cases, it is
the duty of the local coroner (who may be a barrister, a solicitor, or a medical
practitioner of not less than five years’ standing, appointed by county,
county borough, or certain borough councils) to hold an inquiry into how,
when, and where the deceased died; he may hold an inquest m court for this
purpose, and he must do so if he has reasonable cause to believe that the
deceased has died a violent or unnatural death or has died in prison or in
circumstances for which an Act of Parliament provides that an inquest must
be held A jury must be summoned in certain cases, including those in whic
there is reason to suspect that the death was due to murder, manslaughter,
or infanticide, or was caused by an accident arising out of the use of a vehicie
on the public highway. If the jury returns a verdict of murder, manslaug ter
or infanticide by a particular person, the coroner must commit that person
for trial at assizes. If the death is merely a sudden death of which the cause
is unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest, but may order a post¬
mortem examination to ascertain the cause of death.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The Procurator Fisca
inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and
may report the result of his inquiries to the Crown Agent in order that
Crown Counsel may consider what proceedings, if any, are required.
In Northern Ireland coroners are appointed by the Minister of Home
Affairs and must, on appointment, be either barristers-at-law of not less than
five years’ standing practising in Northern Ireland or practising solicitors ot
the Supreme Court of Judicature in Northern Ireland of not less than \e
years’ standing.

LAW AND ORDER
Administrative
Tribunals
89
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a
rule, they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by
statute, which also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in
the social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions
on which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration,
or with another body of persons or an individual; consequently there has
been a substantial growth in the number of tribunals (there are over 2,000
in existence) and in the range of their activities during the past twenty years.
Their constitution follows a fairly general pattern: all, for instance, consist
of an uneven number of persons so that a majority decision can be reached;
members are usually appointed by the minister concerned with the subject
but other authorities (for instance, the Crown, the Lord Chancellor and the
Master of the Rolls) have the power of appointment in appropriate cases and
the Lord Chancellor, or the Lord President of the Court of Session in
Scotland, makes appointments in all cases where a lawyer chairman or member
is required; and, with some exceptions, members of tribunals hold office for
a period specified in the warrant or instrument by which they are appointed.
Administrative tribunals may be broadly classified as follows:
1. those which have permanent members appointed for their special
knowledge, and a chairman who must be a lawyer of experience: for
instance, the Transport Tribunal, which has jurisdiction over British
Railways passenger fares within the London area and London Transport
road and rail fares and also hears appeals relating to road carriers’
licences throughout Great Britain, and the Lands Tribunal, which has
jurisdiction in a variety of matters relating to the value of property;
2. those which are purely administrative: for instance, the Special Com¬
missioners of Income Tax, who hear appeals on income tax matters
from the rulings of the Inland Revenue officials;
3. those which deal exclusively with matters of interest to one government
department or public authority: for instance, the Pensions Appeal
Tribunals, which hear appeals against the rejection by the Minister of
Social Security of war service pension claims; and
4. those which consist of ordinary people appointed by a minister to
arbitrate between individuals: for instance, the Rent Tribunals, which
have jurisdiction in the determination of rents of certain properties.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline, such as the
General Medical Council and the Disciplinary Committee of the Law
Society, but these are entirely different in constitution from the statutory
tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Although there is no general provision respecting appeals from statutory
tribunals, the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958 and other Acts provide
for an appeal, at least on a point of law, from all the more important tribunals
to the High Court and, in Scotland, to the Court of Session. An appeal may
also lie to a specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of the Crown
or to an independent referee. An advisory body known as the Council on
Tribunals (appointed jointly by the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of
State for Scotland) exercises general supervision1 over the tribunals and
reports on particular matters, those peculiar to Scotland being dealt with by
the Scottish committee of the Council.

Board
Britain: an official handbook
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board consists of a chairman of wide
legal experience and five other legally qualified members appointed by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation
with the Lord Chancellor. Its function is to entertain applications for ex gratia
payments of compensation, in certain circumstances, to victims of crimes of
violence in Great Britain or on a British vessel or aircraft. Compensation,
which is assessed on the basis of common law damages and, usually, takes the
form of a lump sum payment, amounted to approximately £728,000 in the
first two years of the scheme. Over 4,000 applications were received.
Courts Martial
ADMINISTRATION
OF JUSTICE
Courts martial have jurisdiction, under the Army Act and the Air Force Act
of ICK5 (as amended) and the Naval Discipline Act of 1957, over serving
members of the armed forces and, in certain circumstances, their dependants
and other civilians who accompany them outside the United Kingdom.
Courts martial may not deal with charges involving treason, murder, man¬
slaughter or rape, if the offence is committed in the United Kingdom Civil
offences committed in the United Kingdom by members of the armed forces
are also normally dealt with in the ordinary courts.
A court martial (which consists of a president and members, all of whom
are serving officers) may be convened by any authorised officer. A judge
advocate is appointed to sit with the court in more serious cases brought under
the Army and Air Force Act (and at every trial brought under the Naval
Discipline Act) to advise upon law and procedure and, in the former case,
to sum up the evidence. The judge advocate is a civilian and a barrister
appointed by the Office of the Judge Advocate General in the case of the Army
and the Air Force or by the Judge Advocate of the Fleet in the case of the Navy.
Appeals lie to the Courts Martial Appeals Court, and from that court to
the House of Lords if the court certifies that a point of law of general public
importance is involved and it appears to the court or the House of Lords
that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
There is no Minister of Justice in the United Kingdom. In England and
Wales, responsibility for the administration of the judicial system when it
does not rest with the courts themselves, lies partly with the Lord Chancellor
and partly with the Home Secretary; in Scotland it lies with the Secretary
of State. In England the Lord Chancellor is concerned with the composition
of all courts, both criminal and civil, with parts of criminal procedure and
with everything relating to civil law, and the Home Secretary with criminal
law, preventing offences, apprehending offenders, part of the process of
trying them, and virtually the whole of their treatment. The Prime Minister
is also concerned in that he is responsible for recommending to the Crown
the highest judicial appointments. , T ,. ,
The administrative business of the Supreme Court of Judicature and the
appointment of the officers of the court (for instance, the masters, registrars
and clerks) is partly in the hands of the Lord Chancellor and partly in the
hands of the appropriate judges. The Lord Chancellor is concerned with
legal procedure in that he is a member of the Rule Committee which makes
the rules of the Supreme Court, appoints the County Court Rule Committee
and has power to alter or disallow the rules made by it. He is concerned with
law reform in that he appoints the members of the Law Commission for
England and Wales, which is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of
high standing, charged with the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its
systematic development and reform, including the possibility of codification,

the elimination of anomalies, the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enact¬
ments, and the reduction of the number of separate enactments. The Com¬
mission submits to the Lord Chancellor programmes of reform which may
recommend their further examination by itself or by some other body,
such as a Royal Commission or the existing Law Reform Committee or
Criminal Law Revision Committee.1 The Lord Chancellor may also ask the
Commission to prepare draft Bills or to advise government departments. In
the course of its work the Commission has power to consider the legal systems
of other countries.
Magistrates’ courts are mainly administered by the magistrates themselves,
chiefly through committees known as magistrates’ courts committees (com¬
mittee of magistrates in inner London); but the local authorities, with
financial assistance from the Government, are responsible for meeting their
costs, and the Home Secretary, besides exercising a general oversight, has
certain specific responsibilities, including the approval of boundary changes,
approval of the appointment of justices’ clerks, and deciding disputes on
financial matters.
In Scotland the Secretary of State appoints the staff of the High Court
of Justiciary and the Court of Session and is responsible for the staffing and
general organisation of the sheriff courts. He is also responsible, jointly with the
Lord Advocate, for appointing the members of the Law Commission for Scot¬
land (which has functions similar to those of the English Law Commission).
In Northern Ireland the administration of the superior courts has been
reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament. The judges are appointed by
the Crown and are removable only on an address of both Houses of that
Parliament. The Minister of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland is responsible
for the staffing and general organisation of the county and petty sessions
courts; the judges of the county court and resident magistrates of the
magistrates’ courts are appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland.
The operation of the law requires the participation of judges with whom,
aided in certain cases by juries, the decision of disputed cases rests; of the
officers of the court, who have general or specialised functions of an adminis¬
trative (and sometimes of a judicial) nature in the courts to which they are
attached; and of the barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors who are
entrusted with representing the interests of the parties to a dispute.2
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts (since the Crown
is the historic source of all judicial power) and the Sovereign, acting on the
advice of ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary. In
England and Wales appointments to the highest positions—the Lords of
Appeal in Ordinary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, the
President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division and the Lords
Justices who are the judges of the Court of Appeal—are made on the
recommendation of the Prime Minister, while the Lord Chancellor recom¬
mends the appointment of the puisne judges, the county court judges

and final stages, if he thinks fit. The more usual practice, however, is to be legally

Duchy of Lancaster), the chairmen of quarter sessions, the recorders of
boroughs, and the metropolitan and other stipendiary magistrates. Justices
of the peace are appointed on behalf of the Crown by the Lord Chancellor,1
who is advised, as to a county by the Lord Lieutenant2 with the assistance
of a local advisory committee, and as to the boroughs by separate advisory
committees.
In Scotland the Prime Minister makes recommendations for the appoint¬
ment of the Lord Justice General and Lord President and also of the Lord
Justice Clerk. Power of submission for appointment of all other judges lies
with the Secretary of State for Scotland. The Secretary of State is responsible
for the appointment and removal of justices of the peace.
Judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor who, as
well as being head of the judiciary, is a leading member of the Government
in power. With the exception of justices of the peace, judges have always been
appointed from practising barristers, advocates or solicitors and neither their
training nor their career is in any way dictated by the State.
Once appointed, judges normally hold office for life or until statutory
retiring age. However, in certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of mis¬
conduct or proven incapacity) judges of the inferior courts in England and
Wales may be removed from their position by the Lord Chancellor. In
Scotland the Secretary of State may issue an order for the removal from
office of a sheriff-principal on a report prepared by the Lord President of the
Court of Session and the Lord Justice Clerk, on the grounds of inability,
neglect of duty or misbehaviour, but this order is required to lie before both
Houses of Parliament for a period of four weeks and is subject to annulment
by a resolution of either House. A sheriff-substitute may similarly be removed
from office, but in his case no parliamentary procedure is necessary.
In England and Wales all superior judges (other than the Lord Chancellor
who, as a Cabinet Minister, changes with the Government) are subject to a
power of removal only by the Sovereign on an address presented by both
Houses of Parliament.3 Since 1701 only one such address has been moved
(against a judge convicted of misappropriation of funds, in 1830); and it can
be stated with confidence that Parliament would never use this means to
attempt to interfere with judicial independence. Similarly, although no court
in the United Kingdom would ever question the validity of an Act of
Parliament which had been legally promulgated and published it might,
through its interpretation of the statute, come to a decision contrary to the
policy of the Government which introduced the Act. In such a case the
Government could try to persuade Parliament to clarify or amend the statute
by new legislation. It would not be open to it to penalise the judge or to
try to influence the court in any other way.
A jury in England and Wales summoned to assizes or county quarter sessions,
or in a civil action, consists of 12 persons (except in county courts, where
juries consist of eight persons). In Scotland the jury consists of 15 persons
in criminal cases and 12 in civil cases and in Northern Ireland of 12 in criminal

militia. . tt- «

required to effect such a dismissal.

and seven in civil cases. Most householders in Britain (men and women
alike) are liable for jury service if they are British subjects between the ages
of 2i and 60, but persons following certain occupations can claim exemption.1
A jury is completely independent of both the judiciary and the executive.
In criminal cases the accused can have up to seven jurors (in Scotland, five)
changed without giving reasons and both defence and prosecution can object
for cause shown (for instance, lack of impartiality), but once members of the jury
have been sworn, they may not be subjected to interference of any kind. It is an
offence to threaten or attempt to corrupt a juryman either before or during a trial.
At certain inquests at coroners’ courts in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland and at fatal accident inquiries in Scotland, a jury is required to be
present to return a verdict on how, when and where a deceased person died.
Juries in this instance consist of from seven to eleven jurors. A jury is also
required at an inquest held by a coroner to decide whether objects of gold
or silver found in the ground are ‘treasure trove’.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Each performs distinct duties—solicitors undertake
legal business for lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems sub¬
mitted through solicitors and conduct proceedings in the higher courts—
though certain functions are common to both.
A barrister in England is required to have reached an accepted educational
standard, to have passed the legal examinations conducted by the Council of
Legal Education and to have become a member of one of the four Inns of
Court—Gray’s Inn, Lincoln’s Inn, the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple.
A barrister with a substantial junior practice may apply to the Lord Chancellor
for a patent appointing him Queen’s Counsel—a proceeding known as ‘taking
silk’. Most higher judicial appointments are made from among barristers who
have become Queen’s Counsel. The professional conduct of a barrister is
subject to the scrutiny of the General Council of the Bar; but disciplinary
powers are vested exclusively in the Benchers of the Inns of Court.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable
by the appropriate committee of the Law Society (the professional organisation
of solicitors) and he must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising
solicitor of not less than five years’ standing before he can begin his professional
career. The term of articles lasts for three or five years, depending upon the
educational qualifications of the student. An articled clerk must pass the
necessary examinations held by the Law Society and, unless he has been a
barrister or is a law graduate of a university, he is generally required to attend
a course of studies at a recognised law school. Once a solicitor is qualified,
he may become a member of the Law Society.
In Scotland a prospective advocate must show evidence of his general
scholarship (normally by holding an arts degree) and his knowledge of law
(normally by holding a law degree of a Scottish University). The conditions
applying for the admission of solicitors are broadly similar to those applying
in England and Wales. The analogous professional organisations are the
Faculty of Advocates and the Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern
Ireland; there is also a General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The
professional organisation for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of
Northern Ireland.

committee.

LEGAL AID AND
ADVICE
Legal Aid in
Civil Cases
Legal Aid in
Criminal
Courts
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Schemes for free legal assistance to persons of slender means and resources
have existed for centuries in some courts—to a limited extent in England and
Wales, and to a somewhat greater extent in Scotland.
Since 1949 in Great Britain and 1965 in Northern Ireland statutory schemes
for providing legal aid in civil matters have come into operation, until today
legal aid is available for nearly all types of civil proceedings in nearly all
courts of law. It is also available for oral legal advice and in certain circum¬
stances where the assistance of a lawyer is needed but which do not (or do not
yet) involve litigation.
Free legal aid in civil cases is available to persons with very small incomes and
capital, and contributory legal aid to those in higher income and capital
groups. The majority of people are financially eligible for legal aid.
The legal aid scheme in England and Wales is run by the Law Society under
the general guidance of the Lord Chancellor. It is operated by 12 area
committees and a network of local committees composed of barristers and
solicitors (who may be paid a fee), with a salaried staff. The cost is met from
the Legal Aid Fund, drawn from three sources: contributions from assisted
persons; costs recovered from opposite parties in litigation; and a grant from
the Exchequer.
Applicants for free legal aid must show that they have reasonable grounds
for asserting or disputing a claim. A successful applicant is allowed to select
from a panel a solicitor who, if necessary, instructs a barrister, and the case
is then conducted in the ordinary way. Certain types of action, including
libel and slander, are excluded from the scheme.
In Scotland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Law Society of
Scotland through a supervisory central committee, the Supreme Court
committee and 16 local committees. To obtain legal aid for litigation an
applicant is required to show ‘probable cause and produce in support of his
application a statement corroborated according to the requirements of
Scottish law. Assistance is available in connection with appeals to the House
of Lords from the Court of Session, in civil proceedings before the Court of
Session, the Lands Valuation Appeal Court and the sheriff courts and in
matters not involving litigation. Where litigation is not involved, the applicant
must show he has reasonable grounds for taking the proposed legal action.
In Northern Ireland the legal aid scheme is administered by the Incorporated
Law Society of Northern Ireland under the general guidance of the Ministry
of Home Affairs. The scheme provides for legal aid in proceedings in the
Supreme Court, the county courts and in certain civil proceedings in
magistrates’ courts.
In the criminal courts in England and Wales free legal aid is, at present,1
provided by the granting of either a legal aid certificate which entitles the
recipient to the services of a solicitor (or, in the case of a preliminary inquiry
into a charge of murder, of a solicitor and counsel) in defending a charge
heard summarily or at committal proceedings in indictable cases, or a defence
certificate which provides both solicitor and counsel in a trial on indictment.
The granting of these certificates is in the discretion of the justices or judge
before whom the applicant is to be tried, except in the case of a person
committed for trial on a charge of murder, when a defence certificate must be
granted if the defendant has insufficient means.
1 Changes in this system have been recommended by a departmental committee.
LAW AND ORDER
Legal Advice
Penalties
95
In appeal cases at quarter sessions an appeal aid certificate may be granted
by a magistrates’ court or quarter sessions. The granting of legal aid appeals
to the Court of Criminal Appeal rests with that court which may also grant
legal aid for the purposes of a further appeal to the House of Lords.
The cost of legal aid in magistrates’ courts is paid out of the Legal Aid
Fund. In the higher courts payments are made in the first instance out of
local authority funds and the cost is reimbursed by the central Government.
Legal aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland is available to all persons in
custody on their first appearance in the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff
courts and the special juvenile courts (see p. 85). Otherwise, it is granted for
proceedings in these courts at the discretion of the courts themselves except
in appeals, when the final decision whether or not it should be granted is in
the hands of the Supreme Court Committee of the Law Society of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland free legal aid is available in trials or indictments before
courts of assize and in county courts and in criminal proceedings before
magistrates’ courts. It is also available for appeals from magistrates’ courts to
the county court and in appeals from county courts and courts of assize to
the Court of Criminal Appeal.
Oral advice on legal matters is available, both in England and Wales and in
Scotland, free of charge to persons in receipt of national assistance and at a
very reasonable cost, that is, at 2s. 6d. for an interview of up to 30 minutes,
to those of limited means. Advice is given by practising solicitors paid out
of the legal aid funds of the two countries. The scheme is administered by the
two Law Societies, which also run voluntary schemes (for a fee of £1) for
those who do not qualify for statutory assistance.
TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS
The chief aims of the penal systems of the United Kingdom are to deter the
potential law-breaker and to reform the convicted offender. The element of
deterrence is intended to lie in the fear of detection, public trial, and possibility
of punishment rather than in the severity of the punishment itself. In England
and Wales a Standing Advisory Council, appointed by the Home Secretary, is
responsible for exercising a continuous review of developments in the penal
system.
Except in relation to murder and certain rare offences for which there is a
fixed penalty, the court has discretion to select the penalty (within maxima
prescribed by law) that it considers most suitable in the light of the circum¬
stances of the offence and the offender. In general, the courts have power to
impose either imprisonment or a fine for serious offences (both in certain
cases); while most minor offences are punishable by a fine only, with the
alternative of imprisonment if the fine is not paid. Moreover, the court has
discretion to discharge an offender absolutely, to place him on probation or (in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland only) to discharge him conditionally
(that is, subject to the condition that he commits no offence during a specified
period not exceeding 12 months). Summary courts, when they consider
sentencing a first offender to imprisonment, must be satisfied that no other
method of dealing with him is appropriate.
Special sentences of somewhat longer duration may be imposed on persis¬
tent offenders.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In England and Wales no offender under the age of 17 years may be
sentenced to imprisonment. Offenders aged 17 and under 21 are not sentenced
to imprisonment for any period between six months1 and three years (unless
they are persistent offenders, in which case a sentence of imprisonment of
18 months or more may be passed). In Scotland, no offender under 21 may be
detained in a prison. Methods of dealing with young offenders are described
on p. 99. . . o • • • r
The automatic penalty for murder in Great Britain is imprisonment for
life—this sentence being also the maximum sentence that may be imposed
for a number of other serious offences. Anyone subject to such a sentence is
liable to be detained for the rest of his or her life but the Home Secretary (or
the Secretary of State for Scotland) may, if he thinks fit, release such a prisoner
on licence at any time subject to the proviso that, in murder cases, the sentenc¬
ing court may recommend a minimum period of detention, and that the
ministers should, before granting a licence, consult the Lord Chief Justice m
England and the Lord Justice General in Scotland (as the case may be) and,
if possible, the judge who presided at the trial. The period of detention varies
according to the circumstances of the particular case and the question of
whether the prisoner’s release would be likely to involve risk to the public.
In Northern Ireland the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill proposes
to abolish the death penalty except for two categories of capital murder: murder
of a constable or other person in the service of the Crown in the course of
duty involving enforcement of the law, maintenance of law and order or the
administration or advancement of justice and murder done in the course of
furtherance of any seditious conspiracy or of the activities of an unlawful
organisation.
Administrative
Authorities
In England and Wales the Home Secretary is the minister generally responsible
for legislation relating to the treatment of offenders, for collecting statistical
and other information about the operation of the penal system, for reviewing
the advantages and defects of the various methods of treating offenders, and
for bringing information about these methods to the attention of the courts.
He is specifically responsible for supervising the approved schools, for pro¬
moting the efficiency of the probation service, and for providing, maintaining
and managing prisons, borstal institutions, detention centres, remand centres
and attendance centres. Prison policy is carried out by the prison department
of the Home Office through the agency of the prison service which mcludes
all prison officers up through the grade of governor to the senior officers at
headquarters, and members of particular professions, such as medical officers,
chaplains and social workers, with their own professional status.
The general supervision of penal institutions is the responsibility of visiting
committees or boards of visitors who must be appointed at every prison,
borstal institution, detention centre or remand centre, partly to ensure that
local interest in the administration of these establishments is preserved and
partly to provide some independent and unofficial check on the administration,
and particularly on the punishment, of inmates. For each prison to whic
offenders may be committed directly by a court, a visiting committee of
justices of the peace is appointed by the various courts of quarter sessions in
The Criminal Justice Act 1961 provides for the eventual abohtion of short term
sentences (less than six months) for young offenders—such sentences to be rep -

between three and six months.

the area, in numbers fixed by the Home Secretary. For all other prisons and
for borstals, detention centres and remand centres a board of visitors is
appointed by the Home Secretary; not less than two members must be justices
of the peace.
The penal systems in Scotland and Northern Ireland are based on principles
similar to those applied in England and Wales. In Scotland the system is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland
of the Ministry for Home Affairs.
The Prison Rules state that ‘the purpose of the training and treatment of
convicted prisoners shall be to encourage and assist them to lead a good and
useful life’. To this end prisoners in England and Wales are classified into
groups, according to their record, character and potentialities, and assigned,
so far as circumstances permit, to the establishment best suited to their needs.
The separation of male from female prisoners is required by statute; otherwise
classification is a matter for administrative direction. Untried prisoners are
separated from convicted prisoners and those under 21 are separated from
adults. Prisoners serving their first sentence, and those considered suitable to
associate with them, are classified as the Star Class and are separated from
other prisoners (the Ordinary Class).
Prisons are classified as general local, special local, regional training, and
central. All convicted prisoners are first received at the general local prison for
the area, where they are assessed and, in appropriate cases, transferred to
another class of prison. The function of the central prisons is to accommodate
all prisoners serving long sentences (a long sentence being defined as over
four years for most classes of men prisoners and over three years for women).
The function of regional training prisons is to accommodate selected prisoners
whose sentence is not long enough to qualify them for a central prison but is
long enough (12 months’ minimum) for a comprehensive course of training,
and who are judged likely to benefit from such a course. The function of the
special local prisons is to relieve overcrowding by accepting from general local
prisons convicted prisoners of any class who are not eligible for transfer to a
regional training prison or a central prison. All general local prisons are closed;
all other classes of prison include open as well as closed prisons.
To meet the need for additional accommodation caused by the rise in the
prison population and to facilitate the application of modern methods of
treatment and training an extensive programme for the construction of new
prisons and the modernisation of existing establishments has been embarked
upon. Since i960 the number of men’s prisons in England and Wales has
increased from 46 to 55 and a further 11, of which two are in the course of
building, are planned.
On reception under sentence, all prisoners, except those sentenced to im¬
prisonment for life, are credited with remission of one-third of their sentence1
(one-fourth in Northern Ireland in respect of sentences of less than two
years), provided that this does not reduce their sentence below 31 days (in
Scotland, 30 days). A life prisoner may be released on licence by the Home
Secretary or, in Scotland, by the Secretary of State (see p. 96). All prisoners
become entitled to certain personal privileges at successive stages in their
sentence.
1 The Government has put forward proposals under which prisoners could be released
on licence after serving one-third of their sentence or 12 months, whichever is the
longer, the licence to run until the date on which the prisoner would otherwise have
been released.

Training

Medical Services
Britain: an official handbook
For breaches of discipline in prison, the prison governor, the visiting
committee or the board of visitors have power to order, among other penalties,
forfeiture of remission (postponement of eligibility for release) and forfeiture
of privileges.
In prison training, efforts are being made to provide (i) work of a type likely
to help fit prisoners to earn their living after release, with technical training
in skilled trades for certain persons, (2) suitable educational facilities, and
(3) opportunities for the development of a sense of personal responsibility,
including (for suitable prisoners) training in open conditions.
The policy on employment in prisons is based on the principle laid down by
the Advisory Council on the Employment of Prisoners (appointed by the
Home Secretary and Secretary of State for Scotland) that prisoners should
be employed for a full working week in productive work similar to that found
in modern industry and organised on an up-to-date basis. Except in general
local prisons in England and Wales, where the hours are shorter, most
prisoners spend about 40 hours a week in the prison workshops or in other
employment such as building, farm work, domestic work and gardening in the
prison precincts. A number of prisoners are employed outside the prisons on
various types of (mainly agricultural) work.
In England, Wales, and Scotland, small payments are made to inmates for
the work they do, and good work is rewarded by payments above the minimum;
in Northern Ireland there is a progressive system of earnings, which is not
related to output nor to work done.
Specially selected prisoners, amongst those sentenced to long-term imprison¬
ment, are allowed to work in ordinary civilian jobs outside prison during the
months immediately preceding their discharge. These prisoners, some of
whom live in prison hostels, are paid normal wages from which they support
their families and meet their own expenses.
Educational arrangements are made in prisons in England, Wales and Scotland
by local education authorities, advice being given by the government depart¬
ments responsible for education in their respective countries. The local
educational authorities are fully reimbursed for their services which, in England
and Wales, consist of supplying a tutor organiser and most of the teachers. A
wide choice of evening classes and correspondence courses is available, and
prisoners are encouraged, if they show ability, to acquire recognised qualifica¬
tions. Vocational training courses and other educational facilities, such as
physical training, concerts, plays, films, lectures and group discussions, are
arranged separately. 111
Prisoners also use the prison libraries which depend largely upon the local
public libraries for their stocks.
Education in prisons in Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Home Affairs.
Medical attention is provided by full-time and part-time medical officers whose
duties include not only the care of the physical and mental health of prison
inmates, but also the oversight of those services which affect health in prisons.
A few prisons and borstals have their own psychiatric clinics (with qualified
medical staff, visiting psychotherapists and psychiatric social workers) to
which inmates may be transferred where necessary. In England and Wales
there is one psychiatric prison, with accommodation for some 350 people,
and a prison psychological service, whose officers are employed to assist
governors and medical officers in their work of examining and classifying
prisoners, and to advise on methods of training. The hospital facilities of

the National Health Service (see Chapter 5) are also available for the treatment
of prisoners in appropriate cases. Arrangements may be made, where
necessary, for prisoners to receive treatment after release.
Welfare in prisons is the general concern of the prison staff as a whole, and in
particular of the chaplains and assistant governors, but special responsibilities
attach to the resident welfare officers, who are probation officers seconded by
the probation and after-care service. The function of these officers is to
help the prisoner in his relationships with individuals and organisations outside
the prison, and to concern themselves with making plans for the prisoner’s
after-care, working closely in this connection with colleagues in the probation
and after-care service and with other agencies in the community whose help
the prisoner or his family may need either during sentence or after release.
A chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland, of the Church of Scotland
and in Northern Ireland, of the Church of Ireland and Presbyterian Church),
a Roman Catholic priest and a minister of the Methodist Church are appointed
to every prison. Ministers of other denominations are either appointed or
specially called in as required. Regular services are held and religious in¬
struction given. Chaplains not only visit every prisoner soon after reception,
shortly before release and regularly during the sentence, but they also pay
daily visits to all prisoners who are sick or undergoing cellular confinement
and any others who apply to see them.
While in custody prisoners may write and receive letters regularly and may
be visited by their relatives and friends at specified intervals. They may also
receive visits from prison visitors specially appointed for the purpose. The
voluntary work of prison visitors in England and Wales is co-ordinated and
guided by the National Association of Prison Visitors.
In England and Wales pre-release courses, at which experts hold open
forum with prisoners nearing their release on the domestic, social and
industrial problems with which they are likely to be faced, are conducted
at all prisons. Home leave, allowing five clear days at home, is extensively
granted to many categories of prisoners with sentences of two years or over
towards the end of their sentences to enable them to make family adjustments
and contacts with potential employers.
In England and Wales statutory supervision applies to prisoners released
from long-term imprisonment, to young prisoners and to young persons
discharged from borstals and detention centres. The sanctions for failure to
observe the conditions of supervision are recall to prison, borstal or detention
centre. Statutory supervision is carried out by probation officers of the
probation and after-care service, to which prisoners, not subject to compulsory
supervision, may also apply for help.
In Scotland after-care duties are likewise carried out by probation and
after-care officers.
In Northern Ireland the after-care of all prisoners is carried out by the
discharged prisoners’ aid societies with the help of probation officers.
Under the English legal system, a child under the age of ten cannot be
charged with an offence. A child between ten and 14 years old, who is
charged with an offence other than homicide, must be dealt with in a
juvenile court unless charged jointly with an adult. A young person (that is, one
between 14 and 17 years of age) charged with an indictable offence may be
dealt with summarily (as is usually the case) or committed for trial by jury.
In certain cases young persons may claim to be tried by jury, though this
right is rarely exercised.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Scotland all children and young persons between eight and 17 years of
age who are charged with offences must be dealt with in juvenile courts,
unless they have been charged in conjunction with adult offenders or are
proceeded against on indictment.
In Northern Ireland, likewise, a child or young person between the ages
of eight and 17 will normally be dealt with by a juvenile court unless charged
jointly with an adult or committed for trial by jury in the case of an indictable
offence. Such committal may take place at the request of the accused s parents
or at the discretion of the juvenile court.
Methods of treatment available in law for dealing with children and young
persons found guilty of committing an offence include: absolute discharge;
conditional discharge (in England and Wales and Northern Ireland); fines
imposed upon the offender or, in certain circumstances, upon his parents;
probation; committal to the care of a fit person (normally the appropriate
local authority) until the age of 18; or committal to an approved school
Offenders aged not less than 10 and under 21 years may be ordered to attend
an attendance centre; aged not less than 14 and under 21, they may be detained
in a detention centre; aged not less than 15 and under 21 (not less than 16 and
under 21 in Northern Ireland), they may be sent for a period of borstal
training; and aged not less than 17 and under 21 they may be given a prison
sentence ranging from up to six months to three years or more. In Scotland
offenders of 17 and under 21 found unsuitable for detention centre or borstal
training may be detained in a young offenders institution.
In England, Wales and Scotland remand homes are provided by local
authorities for the custody of boys and girls under the age of 17 before their
appearance in court, or between court appearances (while inquiries are
made as to the best method of treatment for them), while they are awaiting
vacancies in approved schools, or for a short period (up to a month) of punitive
detention In Northern Ireland the responsibility for providing or arranging
for the provision of remand homes rest with the Ministry of Home Affairs.
In addition to remand homes, remand centres are being established in
England and Wales (and are planned for Scotland), to which a court may send
young persons aged 17 and under 21 who would otherwise be remanded to
prison, and those under 17 who are unsuitable for remand homes.
The system of remand offers valuable opportunities for the observation
of any young offender on whose physical or mental condition a medical
report may be desirable to help the court in deciding the most suitable method
of dealing with the case.
Approved schools are boarding schools for boys and girls under the age of
17 who, the courts consider, need not only removal from home but also a
fairly long period of residential training. Boys and girls may be sent to
approved schools because they have committed an offence or are in need of
care or protection or on certain other grounds not involving the commission
of an offence. The schools may be provided by local authorities, by voluntary
organisations concerned with the welfare of children and young people on a
national scale, or by local committees formed by people interested in such
work. In England and Wales the schools must be approved by the Home
Secretary; in Scotland, by the Secretary of State for Scotland; and in
Northern Ireland, where they are known as training schools, by the Ministry
of Home Affairs.
The schools, which are for boys only or for girls only, are classified according
to age on admission, and within each age group there are separate schools tor

Roman Catholic children. Assignment to a school in the appropriate age group
is determined by such considerations as the location of the school in relation
to the home, the type of training provided, and the probable reaction of a child
or young person to the individual personalities of the staff.
A child under the age of 12 years and 4 months at the time of committal
may be kept in an approved school until the age of 15 years and 4 months;
if he is more than 12 years and 4 months he may be kept in the school for
three years from the date of committal or until he reaches the age of 19, which¬
ever is the shorter period. The upper age limit may be extended to 19^ in
certain circumstances, and the period of detention of an absconder is length¬
ened by any period spent unlawfully absent from the school.
The primary object of approved school training is the readjustment of boys
and girls for their return to the community, and contact with their homes is
maintained while they are in the schools. Managers of approved schools are
under an obligation to review the individual progress of the children in their
care with a view to releasing them as soon as they have made sufficient progress
in their training. After release children remain under the care and supervision
of the managers for two years or until they reach the age of 21, whichever is
the earlier.
Over 50 attendance centres have been established in England and Wales
to deal with boys between the ages of 10 and 17 found guilty of offences for
which an adult can be sentenced to imprisonment. This form of treatment is
designed to teach young offenders a respect for the law and to give them
some instruction in the proper use of leisure. Boys ordered to attend must
do so during their spare time on Saturday mornings or afternoons; they may
be required to attend for up to three hours on any one occasion and for a
total of not less than 12 hours (with certain exceptions) and not more than
24. The activities include a period of instruction in handicrafts, or a lecture
(for example, on first aid) and a period of physical training or disciplinary
tasks under supervision. Efforts are made at the centres to induce the boys
to join a youth club or other suitable organisation.
There are also two centres for youths aged 17 and under 21, which operate
on lines similar to those adopted at the juvenile centres, but the activities are
adapted to meet the needs of the older age group.
Detention centres provide a means of treating young offenders for whom a
long period of residential training in an approved school or borstal does not
seem necessary but who cannot be taught respect for the law by such measures
as fines or probation. In England and Wales junior centres are available for
boys of not less than 14 and under 17, and senior centres for boys aged
17 and under 21. One centre is also available for girls of 16 and under 21.
In Scotland there are two senior centres. Detention in England and Wales
may be for not less than three and not more than six months; if consecutive
sentences are passed, the total term may not exceed nine months at any
one time. Remission of up to one-sixth of the sentence may be earned for good
conduct. In Scotland the fixed period for all detention centre sentences is three
months.
As the intention is primarily deterrent, the life of a centre is strict and
vigorous, demanding a brisk tempo and the highest possible standard of
discipline and behaviour in every aspect of training. The keynote is positive
training in a routine which provides a normal working week of 44 hours,
including one hour daily devoted to physical training. Boys of compulsory
school age receive full-time education, and classes of further education are

provided for others in the evenings. Statutory supervision for up to 12 months
of young persons discharged from detention centres is undertaken by probation
officers.
The borstal training system consists of different borstals specialising in
different types of young offender, classified according to such criteria as age,
intelligence and criminal sophistication. There are also a few borstals for
special purposes, such as allocation or recall. In England and Wales the
period of detention ranges from six months to two years and is followed
by supervision for two years from the date of release. In Scotland, where
there is no minimum period of detention, the maximum is two years and the
supervision period is for one year from the date of release from the institution.
Sentences in Northern Ireland are for periods not exceeding three years
including the period under supervision; normally release does not take place
until at least nine months of the sentence has expired. The system is essentially
remedial and educational, based on personal training by a carefully selected
staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled trades; there is
much freedom of movement and many borstals are open establishments.
An initial period of classification ensures that each young offender is sent to
the institution best suited to his or her requirements.
Young prisoners’ centres, which provide special training suited to the age and
character of the offenders, are provided for those under 21, who are sentenced
to imprisonment. On release, the offenders are subject to supervision under
licence for a period equal to the amount of remission earned on the full
sentence, subject to a minimum of six months. Remission is granted at the
normal rate of one-third.
Probation
I
:
i
I
,
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender while he
remains at work or at school under the supervision of a probation officer,
whose duty it is to advise, assist and befriend him. A cardinal feature of the
service is that it relies on the co-operation of the offender. Before making a
probation order, the court must explain its effects and make sure that the
probationer understands that if he fails to comply with the requirements of
the order he will be liable to be dealt with for the original offence. A probation
order cannot be made without the consent of the person concerned unless
(in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland only) he is under 14 years ot age-
The order usually requires the probationer to keep in regular touch with the
probation officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious life It
may also require him to live in a specified place, or to submit to treatment for
his mental condition. A probation order is made for not less than one year and
not more than three years. . T
The services of probation officers are available to every criminal court. In
England and Wales the appointment of probation officers is the responsibility
of probation committees composed of justices and in Scotland of probation
committees composed of ex officio members and members appointed by the
local authorities, but first appointments are subject to confirmation by t e
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland respective^, n
Northern Ireland the Ministry of Home Affairs appoints probation officers.
Training facilities in England and Wales are provided by the Home Office on
the advice of the Advisory Council for Probation and After-Care and are made
available by arrangement to Northern Ireland officers. In Scotland training is
mainly provided during the first year of appointment and before the officer
enters on the duties of the service.

Criminological research, particularly research directed to the question of the
treatment of offenders, continues to expand. Most of it is financed by the
Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department by means of
grants amounting to about £100,000 a year, although a certain number of
research grants are also made by charitable foundations. Much of the work is
undertaken by the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge University, which
also provides a postgraduate course in criminology, and courses in criminology
for people engaged in work relating to the treatment of offenders or the
administration of criminal law. Other academic bodies now providing courses
in criminology for students and carrying out research in this field include the
universities of Durham, Reading, Oxford, Manchester and Southampton;
the London School of Economics, and University College in the University
of London; and the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Strathclyde in
Scotland.
The Home Office Research Unit, which also serves the Scottish Home and
Health Department, carries out a large programme of research of its own,
concentrating mainly on projects of direct interest to the home departments,
the results of which are given practical effect in administrative policy and
legislation. The unit also plays a central part in the allocation of Home Office
grants for research, and in the provision of technical advice, information and
facilities for other research workers in this field.
In addition to research, special inquiries into particular questions are con¬
ducted, as necessary, by advisory bodies or specially appointed committees.
Reports have been issued on such matters as corporal punishment, the non-
residential treatment of offenders under 21 years, and the organisation of
after-care for discharged prisoners. An inter-departmental committee is now'
sitting to consider the revision of the criminal statistics.
THE POLICE SERVICE
The police service of Great Britain is organised in a system of locally
administered forces subject to the influence and eventual control of the Home
Secretary in England and Wales and the Secretary of State for Scotland in
Scotland. In Northern Ireland the police force is controlled by an Inspector
General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs.
There are 148 regular police forces in Great Britain: 117 in England and
Wales1 and 31 in Scotland. Each of these forces (between which there is close
and constant co-operation) is responsible for a separate police area. In
England and Wales the forces are defined according to area of responsibility
as: county forces; county borough forces; combined forces, which are forces
whose area of responsibility extends over two or more counties or county
boroughs; the Metropolitan Police Force, which is responsible for an area of
approximately 15 miles radius from Charing Cross, but excluding the City of
London; and the City of London force. In Scotland there are county forces,
burgh forces and combined forces.
In England and Wales and Scotland police forces vary considerably in size
according to the area and population which they serve. Thus the Metropolitan
Police Force has a strength of approximately 19,000, while that of the smallest
force in Scotland is 20.
1 The Home Secretary has announced amalgamation schemes to reduce the number of
police forces in England and Wales from 117 to 49.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The actual strength of the regular police force in Great Britain is approxi¬
mately 80,000, including women. This is below the desirable figure, but the
improvement in recruitment shown in recent years has been maintained.
In addition to the regular police forces, there are the River Tyne police, the
police forces maintained by certain public services, such as the statutory
transport authorities, the Service and departmental constabularies, and the
special constabularies attached to each regular police force.
For each of the regular police forces there is a police authority with the duty
of securing the maintenance of an adequate and efficient force. In the counties
of England and Wales the authority is a police committee and in the county
boroughs a watch committee. Both are committees of the local council and
consist of councillors and justices in a proportion of two to one. Combined
police authorities, which also consist of councillors and justices, contain
representatives from each constituent area covered by an amalgamation scheme.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home
Secretary. In the City of London the Court of Common Council is the police
authority, although it usually appoints a standing committee to deal with all
police matters on its behalf.
In Scotland the police authority for the counties is the county council; in
the large burghs it is the town council; and where there are combined forces
there is a joint police committee.
Police authorities provide the buildings and equipment needed by their
forces and, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary or the Secretary
of State for Scotland, fix the authorised establishment. They also appoint
the chief constable and the assistant and deputy chief constables in their area,
subject to ministerial approval, and may retire them in the interests of efficiency,
if the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland agrees. Police
authorities must also keep themselves informed of the way in which chief
constables deal with complaints from the public against police officers. In
the Metropolitan Police District the chief officer of police and his immediate
subordinates are appointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the
Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police
forces, but are answerable to the police authorities for the efficiency with
which they are used.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have a general
duty to exercise their powers to promote the efficiency of the police. They
are empowered to retire a chief constable in the interests of efficiency, to
call for a report from a chief constable on any matters relating to the policing
of his area, and to require co-operation between forces on any police matter.
Uniformity in the conditions of service and in the administration of the
police is achieved through detailed police regulations which are made by the
Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland under statutory
powers. The police regulations cover such matters as organisation, discipline,
pay, allowances, pensions, clothing and conditions of service of the members of
all the regular police forces and of the River Tyne police. Some of these are
first negotiable on the Police Council for Great Britain; the others are dis¬
cussed on representative advisory bodies along with any general questions
affecting the police service.
In his supervisory responsibilities the Home Secretary is assisted by Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and ten inspectors. Eight of the
Police Officers
Police Cadets

LAW AND ORDER 105
inspectors are each responsible for a certain number of forces, and must be
satisfied of their continuing efficiency through annual inspection, ad hoc visits
and consultations when particular problems arise. The inspectors report to
the Home Secretary on the condition of all the forces, with the exception of
the Metropolitan Police Force. The Secretary of State for Scotland is similarly
assisted by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland and
one other inspector.
All police authorities receive a government grant equal to half their net
expenditure except the Common Council of the City of London, which
receives only one-third. The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for
Scotland are empowered to withhold the grant, in whole or in part, permanently
or for such time as they may determine, if they are not satisfied that a police
area is efficiently policed, that a force is properly maintained and administered,
or that the rates of pay or allowances are as prescribed or approved by them.
There are in Great Britain regular police officers, who usually serve for
25 years or more and thereafter retire on pension, and special constables, who
are volunteers performing short periods of duty without pay in their spare
time from their normal occupations.1
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men between the
ages of 19 and 30. Women entrants in England and Wales must be between
the ages of 19 and 35, and in Scotland between 20 and 30 years old. Men
over 30 years old, and women over 35, may, however, be appointed on the
recommendation of the appointing authority in special circumstances approved
by the Home Secretary in England and Wales. In Scotland the Secretary of
State may approve appointments of both men and women over 30 years old.
The standard police ranks in Great Britain, except in the Metropolitan
Police District, are: chief constable, superintendent, inspector, sergeant and
constable. Intermediate ranks may also be adopted in areas where varying
degrees of responsibility make them necessary. In the Metropolitan Police
District the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.
He is assisted by a deputy commissioner and four assistant commissioners.
Next in rank are commanders, then deputy commanders; the other ranks
are the same as in the rest of the country. In the City of London the ranks are
the same as in the provinces, except that the chief officer is the Commissioner
of Police and the second in command is an assistant commissioner.
No member of the police service may belong to a trade union, since it is a
basic principle of the service that its members must not only be free from
political bias, but must also be seen to be free of it. All ranks, however, have their
own representative associations which can make representations to ministers or
to police authorities on matters of interest or concern to their members.
Police cadets are recruited by most forces from among youths between 16 and
18 years of age. They have no police powers but are given some training in
police work, partly as useful preparation for subsequent appointment as
constables and partly to give them sufficient insight into police duties to
enable them to decide whether or not they wish to make a career in the police
service. Some forces also recruit girl cadets.
A number of police authorities employ civilians as shorthand-typists, switch¬
board operators, mechanics, canteen staff and cleaners, in order to release
uniformed personnel for police duties.
1 In Scotland the employment of special constables, other than in emergencies, is
subject to strict limitations.

Traffic wardens are employed in a growing number of areas to help the
police in dealing with the problems created by parked vehicles. In specially
designated areas traffic wardens issue fixed penalty tickets which give motorists
who have committed certain parking offences an option to pay their fine to the
clerk of the appropriate court instead of having their cases tried.
Every police officer in Great Britain is an independent holder of a public
office. His powers as a constable, whether conferred by statute or by common
law, are exercised by virtue of his office; he is not a servant of the police
authority. Chief officers of police in England and Wales have a vicarious
liability for any wrongful act committed by their subordinates in the
performance of their functions as constables.
The many and varied functions of a police officer as a constable range from
the protection of persons and property, road or street patrolling and traffic
control to criminal investigation and the apprehension of offenders.
All police forces have their own criminal investigation departments, and
many have other specialised departments, including motor patrols, river
police (in districts which include long stretches of navigable waterway), a
mounted branch (for maintaining order and safety in large crowds), and police
dogs.
During recent years a number of common services have been provided by
the central government departments for the benefit of all forces; they
supplement those provided by the police authorities for their own use and
by communal arrangements made between the forces themselves. The most
important of these services are: training services, which in England and Wales
provide ten residential training centres and a central police college and in
Scotland a central police college with courses of recruit training and higher
training; a forensic science service in England and Wales which provides
seven laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan Police Laboratory) for the
use of regional groups of forces; wireless depots, which in England and Wales
supply and maintain wireless equipment for the police; and central and
provincial criminal records which are available to all forces. Regional crime
squads, consisting of teams of experienced detectives from several forces are
employed to investigate major crimes involving inquiries in more than one
police area. Arrangements are also made for everyday assistance by one force
to another.
The Home Office Police Research and Planning Branch, headed by one of
Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Constabulary and staffed by senior police officers
and scientists, is charged with the planning of police methods, the develop¬
ment of new equipment and the study of new techniques throughout Great
Britain. Its current programme covers various aspects of criminal investigation,
traffic policing, establishments (force strengths), recruitment and wastage in
the Service, vehicle replacement, the evaluation of equipment requirements,
and the application of computers to police work. A considerable amount of
the work in which the Branch is engaged involves the use of operational
research techniques.
Services provided by the Metropolitan Police Force for other forces include
(i) the publication of the Police Gazette,1 which contains particulars of people
wanted for crime and details of stolen property, and is supplied without

charge to the police forces of the United Kingdom and to certain other Com¬
monwealth and foreign forces; (2) the organisation and control of the special
branch of the criminal investigation department at New Scotland Yard,
whose duties include the physical protection of royalty, some ministers, and
distinguished foreign visitors; and (3) the carrying out of extradition orders
made by the courts. The Metropolitan Police Force is also available, on
request, to assist any other police force in England and Wales in criminal
investigations. Similarly, the services of the Fraud Squad, run jointly by
the Metropolitan Police Force and the City of London Police, are available
throughout Great Britain for the investigation of serious company frauds.
The National Central Bureau, which handles the business of the International
Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) on behalf of Great Britain and the
British dependencies, is part of the Metropolitan Police Force. For certain
of these services, the Metropolitan Police Force receives an additional
Exchequer grant.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary comes under the direction of the Inspector
General, who is responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs. It undertakes
the policing of the whole of Northern Ireland, its cost being borne by the
Northern Ireland Exchequer.
The strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary is approximately 3,000. The
Inspector General has, under his immediate command, a deputy inspector
general, a commissioner for the City of Belfast, and a county inspector for
each of the six counties. The area is further sub-divided into districts, each
district coming under a district inspector and each sub-district under a head
constable or a sergeant. Conditions of service and pay follow closely on the
lines of the police service in Great Britain, and the general duties pertaining
to the various ranks are much the same. Although the more senior ranks bear
different titles, the ranks of head constable, sergeant and constable are broadly
equivalent to the three junior ranks in the police service of Great Britain.
The Ulster Special Constabulary, which may assist the Royal Ulster
Constabulary on special occasions, also comes under the direction of the
Inspector General. In the main, this force is a part-time body of some 10,500
part-time members with a small nucleus (no) of full-time personnel for
organisation and training purposes.

DEFENCE
Britain’s defence policy has two purposes: to guarantee the nation’s security
and to contribute towards peace and stability in the world as a whole. These
purposes are inseparable. Information about defence policy and the armed
forces is provided annually by the Government in a Statement on the Defence
Estimates.1 Policy provides for closely integrated well-trained, highly mobile,
all-regular forces equipped with the most modern weapons and organised on
up-to-date lines; and for a central strategic reserve maintained in Britain,
with means of transport, including airlift, to take it rapidly to the scene of
any emergency.
It is hoped that in the long run the security of Britain, like that of every
other country, can be assured by general and comprehensive disarmament
under the United Nations. Meanwhile, Britain is working for limited measures
of disarmament and arms control. To discourage the further proliferation of
nuclear weapons Britain aims at internationalising its nuclear strategic forces
and also seeks international agreement to check the conventional arms race.
World peace and stability can be promoted in the short run by strength¬
ening the peace-keeping powers of the United Nations. While this must
remain the principal objective, Britain must, until the United Nations is able
to exercise responsibility for maintaining world peace, accept responsibility
for its own defence and that of other countries to which commitments have
been made. This is done through a system of collective defence based on
international treaties and agreements.
Britain maintains forces in three areas of the world as contributions to the
collective security alliances of which it is a member—the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Western European Union (WEU), the
Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) and the South East Asia Treaty
Organisation (SEATO). It also has commitments arising from bilateral
treaties and Commonwealth responsibilities to assist in the defence of certain
countries, and, as a member of the United Nations, has accepted an obligation
to provide, in certain circumstances, armed forces for maintaining international
peace. All of Britain’s commitments are consistent with its obligations under
the United Nations Charter.
The following limitations on the use of military force by Britain are part
of the policy for defence described in the 1966 Defence White Paper.2
First, Britain will not undertake major operations of war except in co-operation
with allies. Secondly, Britain will not accept an obligation to provide another
country with military assistance unless that country is prepared to provide
Britain with the facilities necessary to make such assistance effective in time.
Finally, there will be no attempt to maintain defence facilities in an indepen¬
dent country against its wishes.
Under the North Atlantic Treaty 1949, Britain is committed to assist any
member country (13 European countries, the United States and Canada) in

September 1966.

the event of armed attack against one or more of them. A similar commitment
arises from the Brussels Treaty 1948. Under the revised Brussels Treaty 1954,
Britain is committed to maintain an army of 55,000 men and a tactical air
force on the continent of Europe, subject to safeguards allowing for review and
temporary withdrawals. Although Berlin is outside the North Atlantic
Treaty area, Britain and its allies accept that an attack on Berlin would be
equivalent to an attack on the treaty area. Britain’s contribution to NATO
includes over three-quarters of the operational and reserve fleets, a considerable
proportion of the Royal Air Force (RAF) front-line aircraft including the whole
of Fighter Command and the deterrent force of V-bombers, RAF Germany,
nearly all Coastal Command, and the British Army of the Rhine. The British
Polaris submarines now under construction (see p. 117) will be assigned to a
NATO Commander and when fully operational in 1969-70 will take over
responsibility from the V-bombers for Britain’s contribution to the NATO
nuclear force. A further contribution is the provision of facilities for a depot
ship in the Holy Loch (Firth of Clyde, Scotland) for the United States
Polaris submarines.
Under an agreement between the British and United States Governments
signed in i960, a joint Ballistic Missile Early Warning Station has been built
at Fylingdales Moor, Yorkshire, completing the chain of three early warning
stations that would supply information about missile attacks to western
defence headquarters. The others are in Thule, Greenland, and Clear,
Alaska.
Under the Baghdad Pact 1955, which gave rise to CENTO, Britain is com¬
mitted to co-operate with Iran, Pakistan and Turkey for security and defence.
There are also obligations arising from bilateral agreements (in which the form
of commitment varies) towards countries including Malta, Cyprus, Libya, the
Federation of South Arabia and certain unfederated States in the same area,
Bahrain, Qatar, Muscat and Oman, the Trucial States and Kuwait. Britain
makes annual contributions towards the defence ‘infra-structure’ of the
CENTO region, keeps a RAF nuclear bomber force in Cyprus expressly for
the defence of the region and provides various military training facilities.
Under the Manila Treaty 1954, which established SEATO, Britain is
committed to act in the event of an attack against any of the parties to the
treaty, which include Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand. There is also
a bilateral agreement with Malaysia under treaties of 1957 and 1963 (which
continues to be recognised by Singapore) for Britain’s assistance with external
defence, and a further responsibility for the protection of the Sultanate of
Brunei. In the SEATO area, Britain provides training facilities for military
personnel and, in particular, has built a strategic airfield in Thailand with the
help of Australia and New Zealand. Britain maintains forces in Malaysia,
including those in the Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve which
comprises the Commonwealth Brigade and associated naval and air units,
all of which are drawn from Britain, Australia and New Zealand. Singapore
provides bases for all three armed Services.
Although ties of sentiment and historical association have led Britain to
respond from time to time to requests for armed support from independent
countries of the Commonwealth, Britain’s formal defence obligations to the
Commonwealth (apart from specific agreements) are confined to its remaining
colonial responsibilities. This involves a responsibility for the external defence
and internal security of such territories as Gibraltar, Aden, Swaziland,
British Honduras, Mauritius, the Seychelles, the Falkland Islands, Hong
Kong and the other dependencies.

Organisation
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Prime Minister
and the Cabinet, under the ultimate control of Parliament. Defence problems
and their implications for foreign and economic policy are dealt with on the
Cabinet’s behalf by the Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy, under
the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.
In 1964 a unified Ministry of Defence, under a Secretary of State, was set
up, absorbing what were formerly four separate departments—the Ministry
of Defence, the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry. The
Secretary of State for Defence is assisted by three Ministers of Defence for
the Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force respectively, who have a
particular responsibility for the management of the individual Services but
who also assist the Secretary of State in any general defence matters which
he delegates to them. The Minister of Defence for the Army has particular
responsibility for matters concerning administrative organisation, rationali¬
sation, and the control of defence lands; the Minister of Defence for the
Royal Navy is concerned with co-ordination on personnel and logistic
questions; and the Minister of Defence for the Royal Air Force is concerned
with co-ordination of research, development and production, and for the
defence budget as a whole: he is also responsible for general oversight in the
field of strategic exports.
Command and administration of the armed forces is vested in the Defence
Council, under the chairmanship of the Secretary of State. The members of
the Defence Council are the three Ministers of Defence, the Chief of the
Defence Staff and the Chiefs of Staff, the Chief Scientific Adviser and the
Permanent Under-Secretary of State. The Defence Council deals mainly with
major defence policy. The principal military advisers to the Government are
the members of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which comprises the Chief of
the Defence Staff as chairman and the Chiefs of Staff of the three Services.
The Committee is responsible to the Government for professional advice on
strategy and military operations and on the military implications of defence
policy.
The management of the three Services is delegated to Admiralty, Army and
Air Force Boards of the Defence Council, of each of which the Secretary of
State is chairman, although the appropriate Minister of Defence normally acts
for him. Unified control of policy and management has made possible further
rationalisation of Service administration and operation and the whole structure
of defence organisation is being re-examined.
The Royal Navy has nine specialist branches: Seaman, Communications,
Engineering, Fleet Air Arm, Electrical, Supply and Secretariat, Medical,
Shipwrights and the Regulating Branch.
The Corps of the Royal Marines, which is part of the Royal Navy, is a body
of men trained for service on sea or land. Its official existence dates from
1664. The present-day functions of the corps are: to provide personnel for
Commandos; to provide crews for minor landing craft and certain other
parties required for amphibious assault; and to supply for Her Majesty s ships
detachments which take part in the routine duties, including guard duty, and
provide emergency landing parties.
The Army is organised into some 30 arms and services1 which include the
Household Cavalry, the Royal Armoured Corps (the historic Cavalry Regi-

ments and the Royal Tank Regiment), the Royal Regiment of Artillery, the
Corps of Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals (which provides land
and wireless communications), the five regiments of Foot Guards (the Brigade
of Guards), the Infantry of the Line (grouped into brigades and regiments),
the Army Air Corps (which operates light aircraft on reconnaissance and
undertakes aerial observation and liaison work), the Royal Corps of Transport
(which operates all types of logistic vehicles from locomotives to aircraft), the
Royal Army Medical Corps, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (responsible for
most equipment and stores), and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical
Engineers (responsible for most repairs).
The specialist branches of the Royal Air Force are the eight Home
Commands (see p. 112).
Defence accounts for about one-fifth of all central government ordinary
expenditure. The cost of the defence programme for 1966-67 (excluding home
defence) was estimated at £2,172 million, or 6-6 per cent of the gross national
product. Britain’s nuclear strategic forces account for less than 5 per cent of
this total. Net expenditure in foreign exchange for the maintenance of British
forces abroad and other military purposes was estimated at £293 million for
1966-67, and constitutes a heavy burden on the country’s balance of payments.
The Federal Republic of Germany agreed in 1965 to relieve this burden by
placing in Britain contracts for military (and some civil) goods to the value of
£171 million in the three years ending 31st March 1967. British proposals
for obtaining a complete off-set of the foreign exchange costs of the British
Forces in Germany have been put to NATO and WEU, and meanwhile
consultations are continuing.

elements of international defence organisations, subscriptions to these
organisations, and Britain’s share of infrastructure projects. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works Estimates cover works services for the three
Services and the Ministry of Aviation (see p. 49).
Operational control of the Forces in the Middle and Far East is exercised
through Unified Command Headquarters in Aden1 and Singapore respectively

by a single commander, who may belong to any one of the three Services; he is
supported by an inter-Service staff co-ordinated by a Chief of Staff. These
arrangements are one of the most important features of the increasing unity
of the Services.
The home and overseas commands of the Services are:
Portsmouth, Plymouth, Scotland (Rosyth) and Northern Ireland, and the
Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet. British naval forces in the North Atlantic
and Mediterranean area are assigned to NATO. Naval command in the
Middle East rests with the Flag Officer, Middle East, and in the Far East
with the Commander, Far East Fleet. Smaller naval forces operate under the
Commander-in-Chief, South Atlantic and South America Station, and the
Senior Naval Officer, West Indies Station.
Eastern, Northern, Northern Ireland, Scottish, Southern and Western
Commands. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR, assigned to NATO);
Gibraltar; Malta and Libya; Cyprus; Middle East Land Forces and Far East
Land Forces.
Bomber, Fighter, Coastal, Transport, Flying Training, Technical Training,
Maintenance and Signals Commands1; Royal Air Force, Germany (Second
Tactical Air Force, assigned to NATO); Near East Air Force; Air Forces,
Middle East; Far East Air Force.
The basic principle of Britain’s deployment is to retain in overseas theatres
the minimum forces consistent with commitments, and to hold ready in
Britain a Strategic Reserve, together with the air transport necessary to
reinforce at maximum speed to anywhere in the world. Of a total force of
421,000 (plus 32,000 in locally enlisted forces) the broad division between
service personnel based in Britain and overseas (including Germany) is as
follows:
Britain, 258,000; Europe, 63,000; Mediterranean and Near East, 22,000;
Middle and Far East, 69,000; elsewhere, 9,000.
The present deployment of the forces is summarised below.
Ships on home sea service, including destroyers, frigates, submarines and
coastal minesweepers. Their main tasks are to carry out training, trials and
fishery protection. They also have to meet certain NATO commitments.
The Army Strategic Reserve; certain other front line units and skeleton
headquarters, which can be sent anywhere in the world in any emergency;
training and maintenance units.
Royal Air Force bomber, reconnaissance and tanker forces of Bomber
Command; air-defence forces of Fighter Command; strategic and tactical
transport squadrons and ground-attack squadrons of Transport Command;
maritime reconnaissance squadrons of Coastal Command; squadrons of the
Royal Air Force Regiment.
A corps of three divisions in the Federal Republic of Germany and a brigade
in Berlin.
A tactical air force, including light bomber, reconnaissance and air-defence
squadrons; fighter reconnaissance aircraft; and support helicopters.

Destroyers, frigates and minesweepers, supplemented from time to time by
other major units of the Fleet.
Small Army garrisons in Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus; units in Libya
(shortly to be reduced in size in agreement with the Libya Government);
1,000 men in the United Nations force in Cyprus (about a fifth of the total).
Light bomber, reconnaissance and tactical transport squadrons and air-
defence forces; flight of helicopters for United Nations in Cyprus.
Aircraft carriers and commando ships, operating as necessary between the
Middle East and Far East Commands, covering the seas east of Suez.
Normally, three of these ships have been operating in the area at any given
time. The frigates and minesweepers on the station spend much of their time
in the Persian Gulf. They are supported from Bahrain and Aden. A Royal
Marine Commando is stationed at Aden.
The Commander-in-Chief has under his command 17,500 troops, most
of whom are stationed in Aden and Bahrain. Air Force units in Aden include
ground-attack, fighter-reconnaissance, tactical transport and maritime-
reconnaissance squadrons, and a squadron of the Royal Air Force Regiment.
At Bahrain, there are ground-attack and tactical transport squadrons. An
Army battalion is at present based in Swaziland.
In addition to ships mentioned in Middle East section above, there are many
destroyers (some with guided missiles), frigates, submarines, coastal mine¬
sweepers and support ships; two Royal Marine Commandos and two Royal
Marine special boat sections; ships of the Royal Australian Navy and Royal
New Zealand Navy, attached to the Fleet.
The Commander-in-Chief has under his command at any one time over
40,000 troops, of whom about 14,000 are Gurkhas and about 6,000 are men
enlisted in Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. Australia and New Zealand
also contribute troops to the Commonwealth Brigade; the end of Indonesian
confrontation of Malaysia is permitting withdrawals from this theatre. British
and Gurkha troops are serving in Eastern Malaysia and Brunei. A substantial
garrison, including a Gurkha brigade, is maintained in Flong Kong.
Light bomber squadrons of the Royal Air Force; reconnaissance aircraft;
air-defence force, including Bloodhound Mark 2 squadrons; ground-attack
and medium- and short-range tactical transport squadrons; Royal Air Force
Regiment squadrons; V-bombers deployed on rotation. Units of the Royal
Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force also form part of the
Far East Air Force.
A small naval force, normally of frigates, sometimes carrying a detachment of
Royal Marines. The ice patrol ship HMS Protector operates in the Falkland
Islands and Antarctic during the southern summer. There is one infantry
company in British Honduras.
Royal Navy submarines are based in Canada and Australia to assist in
anti-submarine training for the Royal Canadian and Royal Australian
Navies.
Defence policy provides for a force of about 400,000 professional servicemen,
with the highest possible proportion in effective combat units, backed by an
equal number of civilians. The forces consist entirely of regular volunteers.

Entrants to the non-commissioned ranks of the three Services are given
basic training, and further training is given during the course of their careers.
Young servicemen have the opportunity to read for the General Certificate of
Education ‘O’ level (see p. 156). Trade and technical training, though
primarily designed for Service purposes, leads in many cases to nationally
recognised qualifications; completion of many Service trade or technical
courses followed by experience is recognised by trade unions as a qualification
for membership by men who have left the Services.
Men may qualify for the rank of commissioned officer in several ways, with
some differences between the three Services. Commissions may be granted
for short, medium or long terms.
Promotion from the non-commissioned ranks is possible in all three
Services. In the Royal Navy and the Army the normal method of entry is
through cadetship in the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, or the
Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. This is followed by specialist training
which may include degree courses. The RAF trains cadets for long-term
commissions at the RAF College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire, but the majority of
DEFENCE
115
entrants to the flying and executive branches take Direct Entry Commissions
(of medium length). There is special provision in the three Services for the
entry of men with appropriate qualifications including doctors, dentists and
other graduates.
Selected officers of all three Services who have had previous staff training or
have been to the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich (London), the Army
Staff College at Camberley (Surrey), or the Royal Air Force Staff Colleges at
Bracknell (Berkshire) or Andover (Hampshire) go to the Joint Services Staff
College at Chesham (Buckinghamshire), where particular attention is paid to
the inter-Service aspects of staff work. A few specially selected and more
senior officers from the Services, the Civil Service, and from other Common¬
wealth countries are sent to the Imperial Defence College in London.
Considerable training is done through Joint-Service and inter-allied exercises,
on which increasing emphasis is being placed. Inter-allied exercises take
place under the auspices of the three regional alliances.
Women’s The three women’s services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), the
Services Women’s Royal Army Corps (WRAC) and the Women’s Royal Air Force
(WRAF), are integral parts of the Navy, Army and RAF respectively. Service
women serve alongside servicemen in Britain and overseas. Nursing services
are provided by Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval Nursing Service, Queen
Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps and Princess Mary’s Royal Air Force
Nursing Service.
Resettlement A Regular Forces Resettlement Service assists regular officers and servicemen
to find civilian employment on leaving the forces (see Chapter 16, Labour).

Reserve and
Auxiliary Forces
Royal Navy
The Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) consists of volunteer reserves—serving at
sea in the Merchant Navy or the fishing fleets or in civilian employment
ashore—who carry out training in time of peace to meet the Navy’s mobilisa¬
tion requirements. Other reserves include the Royal Fleet Reserve, composed
of certain ex-regulars; the Royal Marines Reserve; and the Women’s Royal
Naval Reserve. The Royal Naval Auxiliary Service, a civilian organisation
composed of men and women volunteers, is responsible in time of war for
minewatching duties around the coast and the waterways, and other duties.
Army There are two main regular reserves, the Regular Reserve and the Long Term
Reserve.
The Regular Reserve consists of men who have completed the Colour
portion of their service with the Regular Army but who are retained on a
Reserve to complete a total engagement of 12 years; as such they are liable to
recall to the Colours.
The Long Term Reserve (LTR) was created by the Navy, Army and Air
Forces Reserves Act 1964. All men who join the Regular Army are transferred
to the LTR on completion of their Regular and Regular Reserve service.
They remain in the LTR until the age of 45 and are liable to recall in an
emergency.
The Territorial Army and the Army Emergency Reserve (both volunteer
forces) are being replaced (under plans described in a White Paper,
Reorganisation of the Army Reserves, 1965) by a new Territorial and Army
Volunteer Reserve (T & AYR), comprising sections I, II and III. Part of the
reserve, to be called the Special Army Volunteer Reserve (T & AVR I), will
consist of volunteers from the Regular Army Reserve and from T & AVR II;

they will be an ‘ever-ready’ reserve, liable for six months’ service in emergency
at the discretion of the Secretary of State for Defence. T & AYR II will
consist of locally recruited ‘independent’ units (T & AYR IIA) and nationally
recruited ‘sponsored’ (more specialised) units (T & AYR IIB), both liable for
call up after Section A of the Regular Reserve. T & AYR I and T & AYR II
will be known as the Volunteers. T & AYR III, the Territorials, will be a
military home defence force (see p. 124).
The Royal Auxiliary Air Force consists of two maritime headquarters units
and a maritime support unit. The units are raised and maintained by local
Territorial and Auxiliary Forces Associations and functionally controlled by
Coastal Command. In addition the Royal Auxiliary Air Force General List
comprises officers specially selected for service in war appointments.
The Royal Air Force Reserve consists mainly of officers and airmen who
have served in the Air Force. It includes the Royal Air Force Volunteer
Reserve, whose members, like the officers, airmen and airwomen of the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force, have a liability to carry out training on a part-time basis.
University air squadrons (established at 17 universities) form part of the
Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.
The Royal Observer Corps is a predominantly civilian and voluntary
organisation, administered by Fighter Command. Its present strength is some
18,000 men and women whose principal task would be the measuring and
reporting of radioactivity in the event of nuclear attack. Some i,tjoo under¬
ground operations posts have been built for the Corps.
Cadet Forces provide pre-Service training for boys and, in addition, aim to
teach good citizenship.
The Combined Cadet Force (CCF) contingents are based on schools in
which education is continued to the age of 17 or over, and normally take boys
for three years between the ages of 14 and 18. During this time they receive
training in the Royal Navy, Army, or Royal Air Force sections of their choice.
There are also the Army Cadet Force (14 to i8|) which has ‘open’ detach¬
ments in towns and villages and ‘closed’ detachments in schools that do not
have CCF contingents (boys who have left school may join ‘open’ detach¬
ments), and the Air Training Corps (14 to 20). The Sea Cadet Corps, although
not a pre-Service organisation, helps boys between the ages of 12 and 18 who
wish to make their careers at sea.
The Ministry of Aviation (see p. 49) was responsible for the supply to the
Services of aircraft, guided weapons, nuclear weapons and certain radar and
other electronic equipment. The Ministry of Defence is responsible for the
procurement of other weapons, stores and equipment.
A substantial part of the equipment used by the Services is developed and
produced in Britain, some by private industry on a contract basis and some
by the Royal Ordnance Factories, the Royal Dockyards and other establish¬
ments operated by the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Defence.
Production of nuclear warheads is undertaken by the Atomic Energy
Authority (see p. 206) under contract with the Ministry of Aviation. In some
cases—particularly where development costs would be disproportionately
high—aircraft, weapons and other equipment are bought from overseas.
Conversely, British defence equipment has been adopted by allied and friendly
nations: for example, the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany,
Denmark and Sweden are using the British 105 mm. tank gun, and British
DEFENCE
II?
early warning radar equipment has been adopted by several countries and
by NATO.
Britain also undertakes manufacture in collaboration with other countries.
One example is the United States Bullpup short-range air-to-surface guided
weapon which is in service with the Royal Navy and is being manufactured in
Europe under a NATO international agency. Others are the manufacture, in
collaboration with France, of the Jaguar and the variable geometry aircraft
(see pp. 121—2).
Research and
Development
Establishments
Nuclear-
Powered

Research and development are undertaken at a number of specialised
establishments. Among the most important of those belonging to the former
Ministry of Aviation (see p. 49), are: the Royal Aircraft Establishments,
Farnborough and Bedford; the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern, and the
Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down,
Wiltshire. The Navy Department’s two research establishments carry out
research on ships, maritime equipment and weapons and also on certain kinds
of electronic equipment on behalf of all three Services. They are at Portsdown
(near Portsmouth), where the design and development of ship-borne gunnery
and guided missile systems are carried out, and at Portland (Dorset), where
all aspects of work on underwater detection are co-ordinated with work on
underwater weapons. Research establishments controlled by the Army
Department include the Royal Armament Research and Development
Establishment, Sevenoaks, Kent; and the Fighting Vehicles Research and
Development Establishment, Chobham, Surrey.
Much experimental work has been carried out by the Navy and the Atomic
Energy Authority on nuclear propelled submarines (see p.120), and a nuclear
submarine power unit prototype is in operation at Dounreay (see p. 208). The
Royal Naval College, Greenwich, has a low-power training reactor which
provides facilities for basic education in nuclear engineering and research.
Guided missiles are tested at the Ministry of Aviation’s research establish¬
ments, and guided and ballistic missiles at the Woomera range set up in
Australia under the Joint United Kingdom/Australia Guided Weapon Project.
Service firing trials of air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles are carried out at
Aberporth and at the Army gunnery range in Anglesey; a range for testing
surface-to-surface missiles has been set up on South Uist in the Hebrides.
Research into nuclear weapons began in Britain during the second world
war. It was continued, as an allied project, in the United States where the
first atomic bomb was produced. After a subsequent period of independent
development in both countries, collaboration was resumed in 1958, when an
agreement was concluded which made possible the exchange of information
on the design and manufacture of nuclear weapons. This was supplemented
by a further agreement in May 1959, which contained provisions to enable
Britain to buy from the United States component parts of atomic weapons
and weapons systems other than actual warheads, and to make possible the
exchange of nuclear materials between the two countries.
Britain’s present nuclear programme is based on an agreement of 1963
under which Britain buys from the United States a number of Polaris missiles,
to be fitted with British nuclear warheads, for submarines to be built largely
by Britain.
In 1963 Britain, with the United States, the Soviet Union and many other
countries, signed a treaty prohibiting testing of nuclear weapons in the
atmosphere, outer space and under water.

COMBAT FORCES The six groups of combat forces are described below:
Nuclear The nuclear strategic forces are the V-bomber force of Royal Air Force
Strategic Forces Bomber Command which will initially be augmented by the Polaris Fleet of
the Royal Navy (including headquarters, bases and facilities for their control
and support). Their cost in 1966-67 is estimated at £105 million. Their role is
to contribute to the nuclear strategic forces of the West, which exist to deter
any nation from mounting a nuclear attack against Britain or its allies. To
achieve this, the nuclear forces must be seen to be able to inflict an unaccept¬
able degree of damage on any nation contemplating a nuclear attack. At
present Britain’s nuclear strategic force is the V-bomber force and this is
assigned to NATO. Britain has proposed the formation of an Atlantic Nuclear
Force in which NATO’s strategic nuclear power would be controlled in a way
that would both meet the legitimate requirements of the non-nuclear members
to play their part and remove any incentive for the dissemination of nuclear
weapons. Under this proposal, Britain has offered to internationalise the bulk
of its nuclear strategic forces, including the entire Polaris submarine fleet, by
committing them irrevocably to NATO for the duration of the alliance.
Equipment
The V-bomber force comprises Victor B2 squadrons and Vulcan B2 squadrons,
equipped with either Blue Steel stand-off bombs or free-fall weapons.
Various modifications including a terrain-avoidance radar are being introduced
in all aircraft to permit them to operate below effective cover of enemy defence
systems. Squadrons not equipped to use the stand-off bombs are being re¬
equipped with a new nuclear weapon, which can be effectively and accurately
delivered from a very low level. A proportion of the force is always kept at
readiness. In addition to their nuclear strike role, V-bombers can carry
conventional weapons and, in an emergency, can be deployed rapidly for
operations in other theatres.
The first Polaris submarine is expected to be operational by 1968. The
force will ultimately consist of four submarines, two of which will always
be on patrol at a time. Each submarine will carry 16 long-range missiles.
Construction of the submarine base on the Gareloch (north of the Clyde
Estuary) should be completed on time in 1968. When the Polaris submarines
come into service they will take over the strategic role of the V-bombers,
which will then be used to supplement the FmA aircraft (see p. 122) in the
strike role.
European
Theatre Ground
Forces
Equipment
The European theatre ground forces consist of the BAOR and a brigade in
Berlin. Their role is to deter aggression in all its forms and to fight if deterrence
fails, in co-operation with NATO allies. Their cost in 1966-67 is estimated at
£173 million.
The Chieftain main battle tank is succeeding the Conqueror and Centurion
tanks; it incorporates many new features in protection and mobility. Two
armoured car regiments are equipped with the Vigilant anti-tank guided
weapon mounted on the Ferret scout car. Its successor will be the Swing fire.
The field artillery supporting the general war ground forces is receiving several
new weapons, including the British Abbot self-propelled 105 mm. gun (which
has good cross-country mobility, range, fire-power and protection for its
crew) and the American self-propelled 155 mm. Mi09 and 175 mm. Mi07
guns. Missile regiments equipped with the Honest John free-flight rocket and
the 8-inch howitzer provide surface-to-surface tactical nuclear support for the
ground forces, and medium-level air defence is being greatly improved by the

introduction of the Thunderbird guided weapon system. The new tracked
armoured personnel carrier is increasing the mobility and protection of the
infantry, who are also being provided with improved chemical and nuclear
defensive equipment. A portable version of the Vigilant anti-tank guided
weapon is in service with selected infantry battalions. A semi-automatic
multi-coloured trunk system for communications in the combat area will be
introduced in BAOR.
The naval general purpose combat forces are the ships of the Fleet1 other than
the Polaris submarines; the Fleet Air Arm (aircraft carriers, naval aircraft,
air personnel and shore naval air establishments); the Royal Marine Com¬
mandos ; and support ships and overseas bases, dockyards and supply depots.
Their role is to help to keep the peace and to protect and further trade
and other British interests; in an emergency to be ready to safeguard the
use of the sea and to support the Army; and to make an effective contribution
to the forces of NATO, CENTO and SEATO. Their cost in 1966—67 is
estimated at £309 million.
The two commando ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, the two assault
ships HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid, and the Royal Marine Commandos
are the amphibious forces. Commando ships are equipped with Wessex Mark 5
helicopters and landing craft. The Wessex carries both homing torpedoes and
dipping sonar (sound navigation and ranging) submarine detection equipment.
The commando troop-carrying version is armed with the SS 11, a French anti¬
tank guided missile. The United States Sioux helicopters are coming into
service.
Assault ships are also equipped to operate helicopters. A Landing Force
Headquarters can exercise command control from the ship until it takes up
position ashore. The ships can land troops with supporting arms and transport
and the landing craft, operating from a dock space at the stern of the ship, can
unload tanks, vehicles, equipment and stores across open beaches.
The carrier force, at present HMS Hermes, HMS Eagle, HMS Victorious
and HMS Ark Royal, is to be continued as far as possible into the 1970s as
the most important element of the Fleet for offensive action. The carriers are
equipped with the angled flight deck, the steam catapult, the automatic air¬
craft positioning device and the mirror and ‘Audio’ landing aids (all British
inventions). HMS Eagle also has Action Data Automation (ADA) giving
command and control facilities in advance of any system at present known.
The main strike and fighter strength is provided by the Buccaneer, Sea Vixen
and Scimitar aircraft, all fitted with the United States Bullpup air-to-surface
guided missile. The Buccaneer Mark 2, a long-range low-level strike aircraft
with an advanced weapon system, is gradually replacing the Scimitar. The
Sea Vixen Mark 1 carries the air-to-air missile Firestreak, but this is being
replaced by the Mark 2 which has an improved weapon system incorporating
the Red Top air-to-air missile, giving increased effectiveness against high¬
flying and supersonic targets. Eventually the United States Phantom, powered
by Rolls Royce Spey engines, will replace the Sea Vixen. The Whirlwind
Mark 9 helicopter is in service for search and rescue duties and the Wessex for
anti-submarine work.
In 1966 there were 145 ships in the operational Fleet (including 4 aircraft carriers,
2 commando ships, 1 cruiser, 6 guided missile destroyers, 9 other destroyers, 39 frigates
ancj 35 submarines) together with 32 engaged on trials and training and 45 support ships
and auxiliaries.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In the long term, the strike reconnaissance and air defence functions of the
carrier will be taken over by aircraft operating from land bases (see p. 122) and
close anti-submarine protection of the naval force will be given by helicopters
operating from ships other than carriers—for example, commando and assault
ships, cruisers, destroyers and frigates. Strike capability against enemy ships
will be provided by land-based aircraft and by a new ship-borne surface-to-
surface guided missile (see below).
Nuclear power propulsion has revolutionised the submarine, enabling it
to operate submerged for prolonged periods at sustained high speed. Two
are now in service (HMS Dreadnought and HMS Valiant) and will eventually
be joined by three more. Twelve Oberon class submarines, the most advanced
conventional-powered submarines in the world, are now in service and the
thirteenth and last will enter service in 1967. They are armed with a new type
of homing torpedo, backed by a complex fire system. Other operational
submarines include eight of the Porpoise class.
The Tiger class cruisers have fully automatic armament and the latest
control equipment. They are being converted to carry anti-submarine
helicopters. Destroyers and frigates, which constitute the largest part of the
Fleet, are the main surface protection against submarines and against enemy
surface and air forces. Of eight County class guided missile destroyers planned
for the Navy, four are in commission; two more to join them shortly are
equipped with the Seaslug Mark 2 surface-to-air missile and ADA. All the
ships carry a Wessex helicopter. For the future a new, more powerful class of
guided missile ship is on order—the Type 82 destroyer—to be equipped with
the surface-to-air guided weapon Seadart, the Ikara anti-submarine weapon
and new Anglo-Dutch radar. A small surface-to-surface guided weapon is to be
developed for use against missile-firing ships. Leander class frigates have
advanced anti-submarine equipment including variable-depth and medium-
range sonar and mortars, and like the Tribal class frigates they can carry Wasp
anti-submarine helicopters.
Support-ships replenish the Fleet and offer it maintenance and repair
facilities. They include submarine depot ships, equipped with workshops
and plant to support a squadron or more of submarines, a heavy repair and
maintenance ship and mine counter-measures support ships, all manned by
naval personnel. Ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Service provide afloat
logistic support such as fuel, food, ammunition, stores and spare gear. These
ships fly the Blue Ensign and are manned by Merchant Navy officers and
seamen. The dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham and Rosyth
provide the Navy with major supplies and repair facilities in Britain. Singapore
and Gibraltar are the main dockyards overseas.
Army general purpose combat forces consist mainly of the ground forces
deployed outside Europe to meet Britain’s treaty obligations and other
commitments; the Strategic Reserve; and other front-line units in Britain.
The British component of these forces totals some 78,000 troops; there are
also about 14,000 Gurkhas together with other forces locally enlisted in
Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malta. Their cost in 1966-67 is
estimated at £212 million.
The Strategic Reserve consists of two infantry brigades and one parachute
brigade with armoured-car, artillery and engineer support. It is capable of
undertaking operations ranging from internal security and counter-insurgency
to limited war and is available to support BAOR in the event of general war.
It is completely air-portable. Ground forces overseas have a variety of roles,

including protection of Britain’s overseas bases, internal security duties and
support of commitments. The largest group is in the Far East. Special Air
Service troops are highly specialised forces which can act independently and
react quickly to unforeseen contingencies.
The introduction of the light-weight rifle and light-weight sleeping equipment
and rations in the Far East has helped to lessen the infantryman’s load; a new
manpack radio has been issued. Other equipment now proving its efficiency
includes the remotely-controlled anti-personnel mine, the radio homing
beacon and the Green Archer mortar locator. The General Purpose Machine
Gun is replacing the Vickers and the Bren in infantry battalions. Equipment to
improve the Army’s ability to fight by night is being issued. Mobility is
being increased by improved engineer equipments that enhance the Army’s
power to cross natural and artificial barriers and by deployment of the
Stalwart high-mobility load-carrier. Following trials of hovercraft by the
Joint Service Hovercraft Unit in the Far East, the Army is forming a Hover¬
craft Unit, equipped with four Westland hovercraft modified for military use.
The introduction of the Sioux helicopter has greatly increased the Army’s
power of reconnaissance. Scout helicopters are used to carry patrols, casualties
and urgently needed stores. The Canadian fixed-wing light aircraft Beaver is
used for liaison purposes. The faster and more advanced Landing Ship
Logistic (LSL) is superseding the Landing Ship Tank (LST) for support
operations.
The Royal Air Force combat forces comprise all the front-line formations
and units except the V-bomber, transport and tanker forces. They fall into
five main categories: air defence, ground attack and fighter reconnaissance;
light bomber and tactical reconnaissance; maritime reconnaissance; head¬
quarters, bases and general training establishments; and general support,
including the Royal Air Force Regiment, which is responsible for protecting
bases. Their cost in 1966-67 is estimated at £229 million.
Fighter squadrons are equipped with Lightning Mark 2 and Mark 3 supersonic
aircraft, which carry Firestreak or Red Top air-to-air missiles. The Lightning
is fitted with a computer to aid bomber interception. In the long term, the
Lightning's successor will be the Phantom. Air defence is also the function of
the Bloodhound Mark 2 surface-to-air missile. Air defence squadrons are
controlled by ground radars. New military radars and centralised data-
handling equipment are being installed in Britain as part of the integrated
plans for air defence and national air traffic control. Overseas, new transport¬
able radars are supplementing static radar. The ballistic missile early warning
station at Fylingdales (see p. 109) would provide warning of a missile attack on
Britain and so enable the V-bombers to be alerted and despatched. It also
detects, tracks and identifies objects in orbit.
The ground attack and short-range Army support aircraft is the Hunter
FGA9; its weapons include cannons and rockets. Phantoms and the British
P.112J vertical take-off and landing aircraft will replace the Hunter in 1968 and
1969 respectively. Later, a strike version of the Anglo-French Jaguar light-
strike and trainer aircraft will release Phantoms to replace the Lightnings.
Overseas fighter-reconnaissance squadrons are equipped with Hunter FR10
aircraft.
Light bomber forces are assigned to NATO in a primary role of nuclear
strike, but they can also use conventional weapons to meet Britain’s require¬
ments outside the NATO area. Squadrons are also declared to CENTO and
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
SEATO. They are all equipped with Canberra aircraft, which can carry the
AS30 guided missiles. The United States’ FmA aircraft will be introduced
by January 1970 as a Canberra replacement, and will be supplemented by
Y-bombers until the introduction of the Anglo-French variable geometry
aircraft in a tactical strike-reconnaissance role in the mid-1970s.
Reconnaissance forces comprise the Canberra PR7 and Victor Mark 2 air¬
craft. Maritime-reconnaissance squadrons in Britain are equipped with
Shackleton Mark 2 and Mark 3 aircraft and squadrons overseas with the
Shackleton Mark 2. In addition to their reconnaissance functions they can also
be used for attacking surface ships and submarines, and as transport aircraft to
supplement Transport Command. The Shackletons are being modernised and
are due for replacement by the HS801 (derived from the Comet 4C) in 1969-70.
Air mobility forces are made up of the strategic and tactical transport forces,
tanker aircraft to refuel combat aircraft in flight, and communications aircraft.
Their cost in 1966-67 is estimated at £135 million.
The strategic transport force at present consists of Britannia and Comet
Mark 2 and Mark 4 aircraft. The Belfast and YC10 are being introduced.
Tactical transports include the medium-range Hastings and Beverley aircraft
(to be replaced by the United States Hercules in 1967) and the Argosy. The
short-range tactical transports are the Pioneer and Twin Pioneer aircraft and
the Belvedere, Whirlwind and Wessex helicopters. The Andover Mark 1
short-range military freighter is coming into service. The Victor tanker
aircraft can refuel two or three aircraft at the same time. The Basset {Beagle
B 206) and Andover C Mark 2 aircraft are now in use for communications.
HOME DEFENCE
The second world war showed the importance of having trained and organised
bodies of men and women ready to mitigate the effects of enemy air attacks
on the civil population; and the Civil Defence Act 1948 recognised that a
permanent system of civil defence was an integral part of the country s
defence plan. At the same time, the main defence objective, made imperative
by the development of nuclear weapons, is not to prepare for war but to
prevent it. • • 11 •
Expenditure and other information on home defence is given annually in
the Statement on the Defence Estimates (see p. m). Home defence expenditure
by civil departments in 1966-67 is estimated at ^i9'7 million.
The Civil Following a nuclear attack there would be enormous and immediate devasta-
Defence tion: there would also be millions of survivors in need of help. The civil
Programme defence programme is designed to ensure as many survivors as possible and to
safeguard their well-being by making the best use of essential supplies and
services after an attack.
Warning of Attack The United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation exists to warn
the public of the threat of air attack and fall-out. Warning would be given by
sirens and other devices from 18,000 points throughout the United Kingdom
and by BBC broadcasts. Information about nuclear bursts and radioactive
fall-out would be collected by the Royal Observer Corps. The Organisation
would also provide civil and military authorities in the United Kingdom (and
neighbouring NATO countries) with a scientific appreciation of the predicted
path and probable intensity of fall-out.

A scheme has been drawn up for the voluntary dispersal from the larger towns
of people who would be at a special disadvantage in times of enemy attack—
some 43 per cent of the population of the dispersal areas. These are mainly
children and their mothers, expectant mothers and those disabled, aged and
infirm people who are dependent on others taking part in the dispersal scheme.
It would be impossible to provide protection by shelter within any area of
complete devastation caused by nuclear explosion, and beyond the country’s
resources to provide specially constructed underground shelters all over the
country as a protection against blast, heat and fall-out. Nevertheless, protective
shelter against some of the effects of nuclear explosions could be provided
relatively simply for most households and advice on this is given in civil
defence publications.
Plans have been made for safeguarding essential supplies of food, electricity,
gas and water and for maintaining the functioning of ports, shipping and rail¬
ways. Provision is also being made for stockpiling, storing and distributing
oil and emergency medical supplies. Special attention is being given to
safeguarding telephone communications and broadcasting.
of Civil defence planning in Britain is the responsibility of a number of ministers
each of whom undertakes the duties which, in war time, would represent a
natural extension of his peace-time functions. The central Government has
enlisted the assistance of local government authorities, of industry and
commerce and of public bodies of many kinds, including voluntary organisa¬
tions such as the Voluntary Aid Societies and the Women’s Royal Voluntary
Service, for the local execution of the plans.
In England and Wales the Home Secretary co-ordinates the work of
government departments in home defence planning and supervises the civil
defence activities of the police and fire services, the Civil Defence Corps
and the Industrial Civil Defence Service. Other government departments have
direct responsibility for the civil defence applications of the services which
they control; for example, the Ministry of Health is responsible for the hospital
and first-aid services (including the National Hospital Service Reserve) and
the Post Office for telecommunications.
In Scotland the Scottish Home and Health Department deals with questions
corresponding to those dealt with by the Home Office in England and Wales,
and is responsible for such matters as the hospital and first-aid services.
In Northern Ireland the Civil Defence Act (Northern Ireland) 1950
places responsibility for civil defence matters on the Ministry of Home Affairs,
which may arrange for other departments to undertake some functions on its
behalf.
Co-ordination of government activity in war time would be undertaken in
the nine civil defence regions in England by Regional Commissioners, who
would assume full responsibility if control by the central Government were
disrupted. Similar arrangements would apply in Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland would be under one central control.
In England and Wales the regions are divided into two or more sub-regions
in each of which the main government departments, the police, fire service
and public utilities would be represented, so that effective government
would continue if communications with the regional headquarters were cut
off. Below sub-regional level, control is based on administrative counties and
county boroughs and, within counties, on county districts. The purpose of this
system of control is to direct life-saving operations after attack and to provide
124

a framework of civil administration to marshal and co-ordinate the use of
available resources to the best advantage for the continued survival of the
community.
In time of war the fire brigades maintained by local authorities would be
brought under central control and formed into a National Fire Service, which
would be expanded by the mobilisation of such members of the Auxiliary
Fire Service as were available for whole-time service. The strength of the
Auxiliary Fire Service in March 1966 was 13,096.
Auxiliary firemen are trained by officers and men of the regular brigades.
In addition, both regular and auxiliary firemen receive special training in
emergency fire-fighting at the Home Office Fire Service Training Centre at
Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire. Auxiliary firemen perform stand-by duty
at fire stations to enable them to respond, with regular members of the brigade,
to calls to fires and take part in exercises involving the control and operation
of large numbers of pumping and other fire-fighting appliances. Auxiliaries
are expected to do 50 hours’ standard training before taking advanced training
to qualify for a bounty of £10 to £15, according to rank; those not wishing to
qualify pass into the Auxiliary Fire Service Reserve and are required to attend
a minimum of one annual exercise or parade.
In time of war the police would continue to be responsible for the prevention
of crime, for the maintenance of law and order and for the control of essential
service routes. They are also likely to have duties in connection with dispersal,
care of the homeless and other specialised civil defence tasks. In all these
duties they would have the aid of the Special Constabulary.
The Secretary of State for Defence plans the part to be played by the armed
forces in home defence. In addition plans for a military home defence force of
between 20,000 and 30,000 men (T & AYR III, the Territorials, see p. 116)
were announced in 1966. This will supplement military units in the United
Kingdom, assist the police in the maintenance of law and order, and act in
support of the civil authorities in the event of a general war.

SOCIAL WELFARE
STATE AND VOLUNTARY SERVICES
In Britain the State is now responsible, through either central or local govern¬
ment, for a range of services covering family allowances, social insurance,
help for war victims, financial assistance when required, health and welfare
services for mothers and young children, the sick, mentally disordered,
elderly and handicapped and for families in difficulties of various kinds, and
the care of children lacking a normal home life (all described in this chapter);
and for education (see Chapter 6) and housing (see Chapter 7). Public
authorities in the United Kingdom are spending about ^6,500 million a year
on this range of services; that is, over £120 a year per head of the population.
Voluntary organisations, especially the Churches, were the pioneers of
nearly all the social services. They provided schools, hospitals, clinics,
dispensaries, and social and recreational clubs before these were provided by
the State. They made themselves responsible for the welfare of the very
young and the very old, the homeless and the handicapped. Gradually the
State accepted the primary responsibility for the major services, supplementing
the voluntary services and developing a comprehensive structure that ensured
a minimum standard of living and well-being for all citizens.
State and voluntary social services are now complementary and co-operative.
The State may work through voluntary agencies specially adapted to serve
particular needs and ensures that necessary standards are maintained. The
officers of central and local government, in carrying out their duties, co-operate
with the workers of many voluntary social service societies, while the resi¬
dential provision made by the State and by local authorities for the care of
the chronic sick and the aged is supplemented by voluntary homes of various
types. Most of the sick and elderly receive State pensions or benefits.
The Charity Commission, a government department, gives free advice to
trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their purposes or facilitate
their administration when necessary; it maintains central and local registers
of charities which are open to public inspection; and it works to promote
co-operation between charities and State services.
Voluntary The number of voluntary charitable societies and institutions in Britain
Organisations runs into thousands; they range from national organisations to small individual
local groups. Most organisations, however, are members of larger associations
or are represented on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees.
Some are chiefly concerned with giving personal service, others in the
formation of public opinion and exchange of information.
Organisations concerned with personal and family problems and mis¬
fortunes include the voluntary family casework agencies, of which the Family
Welfare Association, working mainly in London, is the best known; marriage
guidance centres affiliated to the National Marriage Guidance Council; and
the Family Service Units.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled in general is given by the British
Red Cross, the St. John Ambulance Brigade and the St. Andrew’s Ambulance

Association, but a number of societies exist to help sufferers from particular
disabilities, such as the Royal National Institute for the Blind, the Royal
National Institute for the Deaf, the National Association for Mental Health,
the constituent members of the Central Council for the Disabled and their
Scottish equivalents.
Bodies working on a national scale whose work is specifically religious in
inspiration include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the
Committee on Social Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of
England Children’s Society, the Church of England Council for Social Work,
the Young Men’s Christian Association, the Young Women’s Christian
Association, the Society of Friends, the Crusade of Rescue, the Society of
St. Vincent de Paul, the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and the Jewish
Welfare Board.
A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which ‘lends a hand’ in every kind of practical difficulty,
brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and old people, minds
children, and visits the sick in hospital, as well as doing relief work in
emergencies.
A central link between different voluntary organisations and official bodies
concerned with social welfare is provided in England and Wales by the
National Council of Social Service, which brings together most of the principal
voluntary agencies for consultation and joint action, either as a whole or in
groups of those concerned with particular aspects, such as youth work or old
people’s welfare. There are also the Scottish Council of Social Service and the
Northern Ireland Council of Social Service, which perform similar co¬
ordinating functions in the voluntary sphere. It was the National Council
of Social Service which set up the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux, of which there
are now over 450 in Great Britain. The primary role of the bureaux is to
give explanation and advice to the citizen who is in doubt about his rights
or who does not know about the State or voluntary service which could help
him.
While the voluntary worker giving full-time or part-time service has done
pioneer work in many of Britain’s social services and continues to play an
essential part, social services of all kinds increasingly depend for their operation
chiefly on the professional social worker, that is, the full-time salaried worker
trained in the principles and technique of social work. Training for many
forms of social work consists of a basic university degree, diploma or certificate
course in social science followed by a university course in applied social
studies or specialised training for a particular service. The latter is sometimes
organised by the profession concerned. The Council for Training in Social
Work also promotes the training, in the first instance, of workers in the local
authority health and welfare services and similar services run by voluntary
bodies. Full-time courses lasting two years, now being provided by 20
colleges of further education, lead to the Council’s Certificate in Social Work.
Voluntary organisations were the pioneers in the employment and training
of social workers, but government departments and local authorities now
employ a considerable number of trained social workers, for example, in
child care, youth work, medical social work, psychiatric social work, and
the probation service.
Since the 1950s many people have entered Britain from Commonwealth
countries in Asia, Africa and the West Indies to take up employment, some

with the intention of returning home when they have acquired savings
or additional skills but many coming to settle permanently with their
families; others bring their families over later. Immigrants from the Common¬
wealth and their families now comprise about two per cent of the total
population.
The Home Office is responsible for co-ordinating Government action
designed to help Commonwealth immigrants to settle in Britain and to deal
with a number of social problems which have arisen mainly because immigrants
tend to concentrate in the large industrial areas where work is readily available.
Some of these problems were the subjects of four reports issued by the
Commonwealth Immigrants Advisory Council (see Bibliography, p. 497).
This Council was superseded by the National Committee for Commonwealth
Immigrants set up in 1965 under the chairmanship of the Archbishop of
Canterbury with the aims of promoting and co-ordinating on a national basis
efforts directed towards the integration of Commonwealth immigrants into the
community.
The Race Relations Act 1965 introduced legal sanctions against certain
discriminatory behaviour. It provides for local conciliation committees to
enquire into complaints of racial discrimination in places of public resort and
to try to settle differences. Under the Act a Race Relations Board has been
set up to examine cases where conciliation is not achieved and, if necessary,
to report it to the Law Officers who may then take proceedings in the civil
courts.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National Insurance, Industrial Injuries Insurance, Family Allowances and
Supplementary Benefits1 together with (in a special category) War Pensions,
constitute a comprehensive system of social security in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Social Security, which was set up in August 1966 to replace
the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance and the National Assistance
Board, administers these services in Great Britain. Within the Ministry of
Social Security is a Supplementary Benefits Commission responsible for
guiding the new system of supplementary benefits. In Northern Ireland the
first three of these schemes are administered by the Ministry of Health and
Social Services and it is proposed to absorb the National Assistance Board of
Northern Ireland into this ministry. Pensions and welfare services for war
pensioners and their dependants are the responsibility of the Ministry of
Social Security throughout the United Kingdom. Appeals relating to claims
for insurance benefits, family allowances or war pensions, or to applications
for supplementary benefit, are not decided by the Ministries but by
independent authorities appointed under relevant legislation.
Although the development of public provision for social security in Britain
can be traced back for several centuries (the Poor Relief Act of 1601 may be
regarded as specially important in England and Wales), the modern system
of comprehensive provision is a creation of the twentieth century. Non¬
contributory old age pensions were introduced in 1908, and the first con¬
tributory pensions for old people, widows and orphans in 1926. A contributory
National Health Insurance Scheme was begun in 1912, and in the same year
a scheme of unemployment insurance was introduced which in 1920 was
1 Introduced in 1966 to replace National Assistance.

extended to cover the great majority of employees. By the beginning of
the second world war social security provision in Britain was among the
best in the world, but lacked co-ordination by the very fact of its piece¬
meal development, and not everyone came within its scope. In the immediate
post-war years a series of Acts introduced the present comprehensive system,
which became fully operative on 5th July 1948. Adjustments have been
made by a number of subsequent Acts. Statutory provision for the war
disabled goes back to the end of the sixteenth century, but the mam lines
of the present war pension provisions were laid down during the first world
war. ,
Family allowances and national insurance benefits or allowances, other than
maternity, unemployment or sickness benefit, are included in the taxable
income on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand, various income
tax reliefs and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the
support of dependants. War disablement pensions are not taxable.
The national insurance, industrial injuries and family allowances schemes of
Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man operate
as a single system. Reciprocal agreements on industrial injuries, family
allowances and most national insurance benefits are in operation with Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, the Federal Republic of Germany, Guernsey, Jersey,
Norway, Sweden and Yugoslavia. Agreements with France, Israel, Italy
Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey cover industrial
injuries and most national insurance benefits. With Australia and New Zealand
there are agreements on family allowances and most national insurance
benefits. An agreement with Cyprus covers all national insurance benefits and
one with the Irish Republic covers most national insurance benefits and certain
provisions on industrial injuries relating to seafarers. There is a limited agree¬
ment with Canada. Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man, as well as Great
Britain, are party to most of the agreements with other countries.
Family allowances are provided in Great Britain under the Family Allowances
Act 1965 (which consolidated the Acts of 1945-64), and in Northern Ireland
under its own legislation. Over 6 million allowances are being paid in Great
Britain to over 3! million families with two or more children, and in Northern
Ireland to 124,000 families. An allowance is paid for each child other than the
first child below the age limits. The age limits are 15 years for children who
leave school at that age, 16 years for certain incapacitated children and 19
for children who remain at school or are apprentices. The rate of the allowance
is 8s. a week for the second child below the age limits and 10s. a week for the
third and each subsequent child.
Family allowances are paid from the Exchequer and their object is to
benefit the family as a whole; they belong to the mother, but may be paid
either to the mother or to the father. There is no insurance qualification tor
title to the allowances, but there are certain residence conditions.
The National Insurance Acts apply, in general, to everyone over minimum
school-leaving age living in Great Britain. There are similar sc ernes in
Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. (The National Insurance Act 1965
consolidated the provisions of the National Insurance Acts 1946-64.)
The National Insurance scheme provides benefits in specified contingencies
where contribution conditions have been fulfilled. The benefits are paid for
partly by insured persons’ contributions, partly by contributions of employers
SOCIAL WELFARE
129
in respect of their employees, and partly by a contribution made by the
Exchequer out of general taxation.
The original system was based on flat-rate contributions and benefits.
Contributions varied only with the sex and insurance class of the insured
person and benefits were at standard rates. (In both cases lower rates apply to
those under 18.) Two modifications were subsequently introduced to provide
additional earnings-related contributions and benefits. For retirement, grad¬
uated contributions and pensions were introduced in 1961. For the first six
months of sickness, unemployment or widowhood the National Insurance Act
1966 introduced a scheme for earnings-related supplements to the flat-rate
benefit which came into effect in October 1966.
Contributors Contributors under the National Insurance scheme are divided into three
classes:
Class 1. Employed persons. Those who work for an employer under a
contract of service or are paid apprentices—over 23 million.
Class 2. Self-employed persons. Those in business on their own account
and others who are working for gain but do not work under the control
of an employer—nearly i| million.
Class 3. Non-employed persons. All persons insured who are not in class 1
or 2—nearly a quarter of a million.
This general classification is subject to certain modifications, made by
regulations, to meet special circumstances. Married women engaged only in
their own household duties are, in general, provided for by their husbands’
insurance and need not pay contributions. They can choose to pay contri¬
butions provided they were insured persons when they married. (Those who
were already married when the scheme began to operate on 5 th July 1948
cannot be insured in their own right unless they were then insured under
the old scheme and continued to pay contributions as non-employed persons,
or unless they have since taken up paid work.) Employed married women
may choose whether to pay separate flat-rate contributions themselves or to
rely on the cover provided by their husbands’ contributions, which make them
eligible for maternity grant, retirement pension at lower rate, widow’s benefit
and death grant. Students receiving full-time education and unpaid apprentices
need not pay flat-rate contributions. Up to the age of 18, contributions are
credited to them. Over that age they may, if they wish, pay as non-employed
persons (class 3) and thus safeguard entitlement to widow’s benefit and to
retirement pension at full rate. Self-employed and non-employed persons
whose income is not more than £260 a year can apply to be exempted from
liability to pay contributions. They too may pay as non-employed persons to
safeguard entitlement to pension.
An insured person ceases to be liable for national insurance contributions
at the age of 70 for men, 65 for women, or when he retires, or is deemed to
have retired, from regular employment after reaching minimum pension
a§e (^5 f°r men, 60 for women), whichever is the earlier. If such a person
does any work as an employed person thereafter, he must pay an industrial
injuries contribution; the employer still has to pay his full share of the flat-rate
contribution.
Contributions Flat-rate contributions are paid by means of national insurance stamps bought
from a post office and fixed, for each contributor, to a single contribution card.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
All three classes pay flat-rate contributions (see Table 7). The stamps for
class 1 contributors also include the employer’s redundancy contribution (to
help to provide for payments in certain circumstances to employees whose
work is terminated, see p. 434) an(^ se^ective employment tax paid by
employers (see p. 37^) 5 2nd for all contributors the National Health Service
contribution (which for convenience is paid with the National Insurance
contribution although the two services are separately administered). It is the
employer’s responsibility in the first place to see that the class 1 contributions
are paid, but he can deduct the employees’ share from their wages. The
self-employed and non-employed must stamp their own cards. Flat-rate
contributions are usually credited for weeks of unemployment, sickness or
injury, or if widow’s benefit is being paid.
Graduated contributions are payable by employed persons aged 18 or over
who earn more than ^9 a week (including married women); the range of
graduated contributions is given in Table 7. Those taking part in the graduated
pension part of the scheme pay contributions at the rate of 4! per cent of the
part of their weekly pay between £9 and £18 and half per cent of the part
between £18 and £30. The employer pays the same amount. Employees whose
job provides them with an occupational pension of at least £3 9s. yd. a year for
each year of service (^2 18s. for women) may be contracted out of the
graduated pension part of the scheme. Contracted out employees pay graduated
contributions at the rate of half per cent of that part of their weekly pay lying
between £9 and £30; they and their employers pay slightly higher flat-rate
contributions.
Graduated contributions provide a graduated addition to retirement pension
and meet the cost of earnings-related supplements to sickness and unemploy¬
ment benefit and widow’s supplementary allowance. The contributions are
collected through the same machinery as is used to collect Pay As You Earn
(deduction at source) income tax.
The scheme provides payments to contributors in case of unemployment (if
normally working for an employer), sickness (if normally working for an
employer or self-employed), and confinement and the weeks immediately
before and after (for women normally working for an employer or self-
employed and paying national insurance contributions at the full rate).
Retirement pensions are paid to people who have reached 65 (60 for women)
and who, if under 70 (65 for women), have retired from regular work; widows
receive benefit in the first 26 weeks1 after bereavement and subsequently
while they have young children or if they have reached the age of 50 when
widowed or when their children have grown up; and there are two kinds of
allowance in respect of orphan children where a widow’s pension is not
payable. The scheme also provides lump-sum cash grants for two expensive
contingencies—the birth of a child and a death (though not for the death of
someone already over minimum pension age when the scheme started).
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First,
before benefit can be paid at all, a minimum number of contributions must
actually have been paid since entry into insurance; secondly, the full rate
of benefit cannot be paid unless a specified number of contributions have
been paid or credited over a specified period. There are special rules to he p
a widow who does not become entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood
or when her children have grown up, to qualify for sickness or unemployment

Amounts
benefit in the period before she can have established or re-established herself
in insurance through her own contributions; there are also provisions to
help divorced women who were not paying contributions during their
marriage.
The basic amount of the majority of flat-rate benefits is £4 a week which
may be reduced if insufficient contributions have been paid, but is not
affected by other unearned income or the previous level of earnings. Earnings
received while the benefit is in payment, however, may cause its reduction or
withdrawal: unemployment benefit cannot be paid to a person earning more
than a specified amount from a subsidiary occupation; retirement pensioners
under the age of 70 (65 for women) have their pensions reduced in step with
earnings over certain specified amounts; sickness benefit, though not affected
by continued payment of wages during illness, is not normally payable to a
person doing any actual work. Exceptions to the basic flat-rate are the higher
rate of £5 12s. 6d. a week payable to widows during the first 26 weeks after
bereavement, the increased retirement pension earned by someone who has
continued at work and paid contributions beyond minimum pension age,
and the lower rate of £2 15s. a week unemployment or sickness benefit
payable to a married woman who is not either separated from her husband
and receiving maintenance of less than £1 5s. a week from him or else main¬
taining an invalid husband. The standard rate of retirement pension for a
woman on her husband’s insurance is £2 10s. a week.
Standard increases of flat-rate benefit are payable for dependants at the
rate of £2 10s. for an adult (generally a wife), £1 2s. 6d. for the first or only
child under the family allowances age limits and 14s. 6d., over and above
any family allowances payable, for other children. However, the amounts
payable to widows for their children are appreciably larger: £2 for each child
inclusive of family allowances.
The allowance provided for a child who has lost both parents (one of
whom must have been insured under the National Insurance Acts) is a
guardian’s allowance of £2 a week. It is paid to the person in whose family
the child is, for the time being, included. For certain fatherless children there is
a child’s special allowance also at £2 a week inclusive of family allowances;
this is payable to a woman whose marriage has been dissolved or annulled
and who has not remarried, if her former husband dies and she has a child
to whose support he was contributing before he died.
The graduated addition to retirement pension is at the rate of 6d. a week
for each £7 10s. of all graduated contributions (including the half per cent
graduated contributions under the 1966 Act) paid by a man and for each £()
of such graduated contribution paid by a woman (with, in each case, the
matching amount of graduated contribution coming from the employer).
The earnings-related supplements to flat-rate unemployment and sickness
benefit are one-third of a person’s average weekly earnings between £() and
-£30, but the supplements cannot raise the total benefit, including increases
for dependants, beyond 85 per cent of earnings. The supplement is also paid
to widow beneficiaries who have the appropriate record of earnings, if they
become unemployed or sick.
An earnings-related supplement is paid on top of the widow’s allowance to
widows whose husbands were under 70 and had not retired from regular
employment; this supplement is one-third of the husband s average weekly
earnings between £() and £30.
The rates of grants are varied: £22 maternity grant is payable for a con¬
finement and a further £22 grant for each additional child born at the same

confinement living 12 hours after its birth; and -£25 death grant on the death
of an adult (less for a child, or for an adult who was within 10 years of
minimum pension age when the scheme started).
In general, national insurance payments are paid as long as the situation
requiring them lasts. However, sickness benefit cannot be paid for more than
a year if less than 156 contributions have been paid (possible in three years
for a contributor continuously at work) and unemployment benefit is payable
for a maximum of one year. The supplement to unemployment and sickness
benefit is paid for a maximum of six months starting from the thirteenth day
of unemployment or incapacity for work. Maternity allowance normally
begins 11 weeks before the expected week of confinement and ends after the
sixth week following the expected week or the actual confinement if this is
later.
Similarly, widowed mothers’ allowances at the full rate cease when the
children reach family allowance age limits, though a mother can continue to
receive £4 a week for herself while she has living with her a son or daughter
above the age limits but under 19. The widow’s pension payable to the
childless widow, provided she is over 50 (and had been married at least
three years when her husband died), or the similar pension normally paid
to the widowed mother who has reached 50 when her widowed mother’s
allowance ends, continues until she has reached minimum pension age and
retired, or at most till age 65. If she has satisfied the conditions she then
becomes entitled to a retirement pension.
The Industrial Injuries Insurance scheme, which, in July 1948, replaced the
Workmen’s Compensation scheme (first introduced by the Workmen’s
Compensation Act of 1897), provides benefits for personal injuries caused
by accidents arising out of, and in the course of, employment, and for
prescribed diseases due to the nature of employment. It covers practically
everyone in class 1 of the National Insurance scheme and certain others.
Like the National Insurance scheme, the Industrial Injuries scheme is
financed partly from contributions (see Table 7) and partly from taxation.
The relevant acts are the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act
1965 and the National Insurance Act 1966. Similar cover against industrial
injuries and diseases in Northern Ireland is provided by Northern Ireland’s
legislation.
Injury benefit for an adult is £6 15s. a week plus £2 10s. for an adult
dependant, 2s. 6d. for the first or only child under the family allowances
age limits and 14s. 6d. for each other eligible child, in addition to any family
allowance payable. It is paid when the insured person is incapable of work as
a result of an industrial accident or prescribed disease, and payment can
continue for a maximum of 26 weeks beginning on the date of the accident
or development of the disease. A person entitled to sickness benefit who draws
injury benefit instead, also receives any earnings-related supplement (see p.132)
to which he is entitled.
Disablement benefit may be paid (but not at the same time as injury benefit)
when, as the result of industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a
loss of physical or mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the
disablement as assessed by a medical board; it varies from £6 15s. for 100 per
cent disablement to ,£1 7s. a week for 20 per cent disablement, but for disable¬
ment of less than 20 per cent a gratuity is normally paid, ranging up to £450.
i34
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement, at the weekly rate of £4; constant
attendance allowance of up to £2 15s. weekly normally, or at an intermediate
rate of £4 2s. 6d. or a special rate of £5 10s. a week in exceptionally severe
cases; a new allowance (introduced in 1966) of £3 a week paid to a person
entitled to constant attendance allowance at more than the normal maximum
rate and whose need for an allowance at such a rate is likely to be permanent;
a special hardship allowance of up to ^2 14s. for a person who is unfit to
return to his regular job or work of an equivalent standard; and hospital
treatment allowances which raise the benefit to that for a 100 per cent assess¬
ment during hospital treatment for the industrial disability. Increases of
benefit for dependants are payable with unemployability supplement and
hospital treatment allowance.
Death Benefit If the accident or disease results in the insured person’s death, death benefit
may be paid to the dependants.
For a widow a pension of £5 I2S< a week is payable for the first 26
weeks of widowhood. In addition she will receive any earnings-related
supplement (see p. 132) that would have been paid had she claimed widow’s
allowance under the main National Insurance scheme. Thereafter, the widow
can receive a pension of ^4 10s. a week if (1) entitled to a child s allowance or
over the age of 40 on ceasing to be so entitled, or (2) over 50 years of age or
permanently incapable of self-support at the time of her husband’s death, or (3)
not entitled to child’s allowance, but having residing with her a young person
under the age of 19 who was or could be treated as being in her late husband s
family, or (4) over 40 years of age when (3) ceases to apply, or (5) pregnant by
her late husband. If none of these conditions is satisfied, the widow may receive
a pension of £1 a week. If she had been living apart from her husband, the
pension is limited to the weekly rate of maintenance he was paying, if less than
the rate otherwise appropriate.
In addition, allowances are paid for children under the family allowances
age limits. For widows, these allowances together with any family allowance
payable amount to £2 a week for each child. For other beneficiaries, the rate
is £1 2s. 6d. for the first child and 14s. 6d. a week for each later child.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be
entitled to pensions (of up to £1 a week), allowances or gratuities.
SUPPLEMENTARY The Ministry of Social Security Act 1966 provided for a scheme of non-
BENEFITS contributory benefits to replace the system which had been administered by
the former National Assistance Board since 1948. The Act established within
the new Ministry of Social Security a Supplementary Benefits Commission
responsible for guiding the new scheme and for determining awards of benefit.
The parallel legislation in Northern Ireland made similar provision.
Every person in Great Britain aged 16 or over, with certain exceptions
relating to people in full-time work, attending school or involved in a trade
dispute, whose resources are insufficient to meet his requirements is entitled
to a supplementary benefit. The benefit takes the form of a supplementary
pension for those over the statutory retirement age, and of a supplementary
allowance for others. The benefit to which a person is entitled is the amount
assessed under the provisions of the Social Security Act, by which his require¬
ments exceed his available resources. The calculation of requirements is based
on different amounts for single people and family groups (for blind people
there are special higher amounts) with, in each case, an addition for rent. For
the old and most other long-term cases a special addition is made. The Act
SOCIAL WELFARE
135
contains rules for the calculation of a person’s available resources, whether of
income or capital (the main national insurance and industrial injury benefits,
family allowances and maintenance payments from a husband or the father
of the claimant’s children are taken into account in full but some part of all
other resources is disregarded). There is a right of appeal if the claimant is
dissatisfied with the determination of the Commission.
The payment of a supplementary allowance in the case of an able-bodied
man of working age may be subject to the condition that he registers for
employment at an employment exchange of the Ministry of Labour; the
allowance is then paid at the exchange. Otherwise the supplementary benefit
is paid weekly through the post office.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence
‘persons without a settled way of living’ to lead a more normal life. The
Commission provides temporary accommodation for them in reception centres,
sometimes through the agency of local authorities. For men who have been
unemployed for long periods and who are in receipt of supplementary
allowances or are using reception centres, it runs two non-residential and two
residential re-establishment centres where they are given help to fit them
again for work.
WAR PENSIONS
AND RELATED
SERVICES
Pensions and allowances for people disabled or bereaved through the
wars or Forces service since the second world war are paid under Royal
Warrants and other instruments administered by the Ministry of Social
Security.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private
soldier is £6 15s. a week, but the amount varies according to rank and the
degree of disablement. The latter is assessed by comparing the condition of
the person disabled by service with that of a normal healthy person of the
same age and sex. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to
the basic pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the
main ones being for unemployability (£4 7s. 6d. a week), constant attendance
(up to £2 15s. and, exceptionally, £5 10s. a week), comforts (10s. or £1 a
week), and lowered standard of occupation (up to £2 14s. a week). An addi¬
tional allowance of £3 a week is payable to war pensioners who are receiving
constant attendance allowance at a rate above the normal maximum. An age
allowance (at rates varying between 5s. and 15s. a week) is payable to disable¬
ment pensioners who are aged 65 or over and whose assessment is 40 per cent
or more.
Both the basic disablement pension and the supplementary allowances are
free of income tax, and children’s allowances are paid in addition to any
allowance payable under the Family Allowances Acts.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate
of pension for widows of private soldiers is £5 5s. a week, with additional
allowances for their children {£2 4s. for each child), and, in certain cases,
an allowance for rent (up to £2 a week). There is an additional allowance
of 1 os. a week for widows aged 70 or over. Parents or other relatives who were
dependent on a person whose death resulted from Forces service may receive
pensions if they are in financial need.
The Ministry of Social Security maintains a welfare service for war
pensioners and war orphans, which is available to help any who require
advice and assistance. War pensioners have priority for treatment of their war
disabilities in National Health Service hospitals subject only to needs of
emergency and other urgent cases.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Many voluntary associations and ex-Service organisations give financial aid
and personal service to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
The Ministry’s welfare officers work in close co-operation with these voluntary
bodies and with the specialist government welfare agencies.
HEALTH
The concern of the State with the nation’s health is chiefly a development of
the years since the passing of the Public Health Act of 1848. The second
half of the nineteenth century was notable for the growth of the environmental
or public health services, such as provision of pure water, sewerage, disposal
of refuse and cleaning of streets, and the first half of the twentieth century
for the development of publicly provided personal health services, as distinct
from environmental services, culminating in the introduction in 194^ a
comprehensive National Health Service available to every citizen. Scientific
discoveries of importance to medicine and health, including the development
of new drugs, and the improved services of the last 50 years, particularly
in maternity and child welfare, school health services and school meals, are
reflected in declining mortality rates (see p. 9) and improved physique.
Diseases now in the forefront of research programmes include cancer and
diseases of the central nervous system, such as muscular dystrophy. Efforts
are also being made to combat some of the most prevalent diseases which
include, besides the common cold and influenza, bronchitis, rheumatism and
heart diseases.
The Public Health Act of 1936 brought up to date and consolidated preceding
Acts; it constitutes the present basic public health code in England and
Wales. Local authorities (under the general direction of the Ministry of
Health or the Welsh Board of Health and the Ministry of Housing and Local
Government) are mainly responsible for its implementation and they have
extensive powers for the making and administration of by-laws on matters
of public health. The local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of
county and non-county boroughs, London boroughs and the City of London,
urban and rural district councils and, to a limited extent, parish councils.
Public health services in Scotland and in Northern Ireland have developed
on much the same lines as in England and Wales, although they are based on
separate Acts and there is a different allocation of services between the various
types of local authority (working under the direction of the Scottish Home
and Health Department and the Northern Ireland Ministry of Health and
Social Services). The Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897 and the Burgh
Police (Scotland) Act 1892 as amended by later Statutes constitute the basic
legislation for Scotland. The local authorities concerned are the councils of
counties and burghs. In Northern Ireland the councils of county and non¬
county boroughs and urban and rural districts are mainly responsible for
administering the Public Health Acts (Northern Ireland) 1878—1962.
Local authorities are responsible for the investigation by their Medical

THE NATIONAL
HEALTH SERVICE
*37
Port health authorities have a general responsibility for supervising the
operation of health control at seaports and airports, the primary object of
which is to prevent the introduction of infectious disease into the country.
This health control is undertaken by health authorities using the services of
medical officers, public health inspectors, rodent inspectors and others.
The purity, hygiene and description of food are controlled by legislation
consolidated for England and Wales in the Food and Drugs Act 1955, for
Scotland in the Food and Drugs (Scotland) Act 1956, and for Northern
Ireland in the Food and Drugs Act (Northern Ireland) 1958.
In England and Wales the Act and regulations made under it are, in general,
carried out and enforced by food and drugs authorities (county, county borough,
London borough and City of London councils and, generally, the larger
borough and urban district councils) in relation to composition, adulteration
and description, and by local authorities (county borough, London borough,
City of London, borough, urban district and rural district councils) in relation
to soundness, purity and hygiene; the Ministry of Health and the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are the central departments responsible
for advising and for making regulations under the Act. Places where food for
sale for human consumption is prepared, sold or stored must conform to
certain hygienic standards. Authorised officers of the councils concerned may
take for analysis or for bacteriological or other examination samples of any
food for sale for human consumption. Special regulations are in force for
certain foods such as milk, meat and ice-cream.
In Scotland the local authorities chiefly concerned are the councils of
counties and large burghs.
In Northern Ireland administration is in the hands of the county and
county borough health authorities, the central department being the Ministry
of Health and Social Services.
Local authorities are also responsible for the public health aspects of water
supply, sewerage and drainage; street paving and housing; and the abatement
of noise nuisance. They have power to establish smoke-controlled areas, to
secure cleaner air and to arrange with statutory water undertakings for the
addition of fluoride to water supplies to reduce dental decay.
The Acts setting up the National Health Service—the National Health
Service Act 1946, the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947, and the
Health Services Act (Northern Ireland) 1948—came into force simultaneously
on 5th July 1948.
The object of the National Health Service Act 1946 is ‘to promote the
establishment in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service
designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the
people of England and Wales and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment
of illness, and for that purpose to provide or secure the effective provision
of services’. The service was originally free to users but certain small charges
were introduced under subsequent legislation. The Government has
announced its intention of abolishing all charges. The service is available to
all according to medical need without regard to any insurance qualification.
National insurance contributors are required to pay a separate weekly national
health contribution under the National Health Service Contribution Acts
1957 to 1961 (see Table 7) but contributors and non-contributors are entitled
to the same full range of services. Visitors from other countries who come to
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain for treatment are expected to pay for it, but treatment can be given
under the emergency provisions of the National Health Service to any who
fall ill during a visit to Britain.
ORGANISATION OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH
SERVICE IN ENGLAND AND WALES*
.The services in Scotland and Northern Ireland are somewhat differently organised. In Scotland the responsible Minister is the
Secretary of State for Scotland, and in Northern Ireland the Minister of Health and Social Services
Health Service The services provided by the National Health Service fall into three mam
Administration groups: r u ul
in Great Britain 1 The hospital and specialist services for which the Minister ot Health or
Secretary of State for Scotland is directly responsible. These are
administered through 20 regional hospital boards and over 460 hospital
management committees, or, in the case of teaching hospitals in England
and Wales, boards of governors. The three special psychiatric hospitals
for people with criminal propensities are directly administered by the
Minister of Health.
2. The general practitioner services consisting of the family doctor service,
the dental service, the eye service and the pharmaceutical service, for
which the Health Ministers are indirectly responsible. They are adminis¬
tered by some 160 local executive councils on which doctors, dentists
and pharmacists are represented. Each council in England and Wales
has an ophthalmic services committee; in Scotland there are five joint
ophthalmic services committees.
The local authority health and welfare services.
In addition, the Minister of Health in England and Wales has power
to conduct, or assist others to conduct, research work and he provides a
public health laboratory service and a blood transfusion service. He is advised
by the Central Health Services Council and by standing advisory committees
on various aspects of the service. .. ,
Medical and dental schools are not under the control of the Minister; but
it is his responsibility to provide clinical facilities for the training of medica
students. The universities are responsible for the provision of teaching.
The Secretary of State has similar duties with regard to Scotland. The
teaching hospitals in Scotland come under the control of the regional hospital
SOCIAL WELFARE
139
Health Service
Finance

Services
boards, but special medical education committees consider matters relating
to medical teaching. The Scottish Health Services Council and the standing
advisory committees advise the Secretary of State and keep closely in touch
with the Central Health Services Council on common issues.
The Northern Ireland Health Services are described separately on page 145.
Estimated expenditure on the National Health and Welfare Services in Great
Britain was £1,398 million (gross) in 1965-66 and amounts to over 4 per cent
of the total national income. The greater part of the cost falls on the Exchequer,
to be met from general taxation, and a small part is met from local rates.
Other income is derived from the national health service contribution paid
with the national insurance contribution.
There are charges for treatment in the dental service (but not for examina¬
tion only or for treatment given to people under 21 years or to nursing or
expectant mothers), for dentures (except for children under 16 or still at
school, and expectant and nursing mothers) and spectacles (except children’s
spectacles in standard frames), and for some local health authority services.
Certain exemptions or refunds are made and anyone may apply to the
Supplementary Benefits Commission for help in meeting any of these charges.
Under the 1946 Act, a limited number of beds may be made available for
hospital patients wishing for privacy, provided that this accommodation is not
needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients. Charges for these
‘amenity’ beds are fixed by statutory regulations. Provision is also made at
certain hospitals for patients who wish to occupy private patients’ accom¬
modation on payment of the whole cost of this accommodation and treatment.
Such patients may make private arrangements for treatment by doctors of
their own choice.
Hospital medical staffs are either full-time and salaried, or part-time; part-
time medical officers are usually paid on a sessional basis and are free to accept
private patients. General medical practitioners in public service are remun¬
erated according to the nature and extent of the services they provide.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the basis of the prescriptions
they dispense. Doctors and ophthalmic opticians taking part in the supple¬
mentary ophthalmic service are paid prescribed fees for each sight test made;
opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the number and type
of pairs supplied.
The general practitioner services cover the medical attention given to
individuals by doctors and dentists of their own choice, from among those
enrolled in the service. Doctors and dentists normally work at their own
surgeries; practice in health centres established under the National Health
Service Acts is, however, being encouraged by the Government. About
23,000, or almost all, general medical practitioners (principals and assistants)
in Great Britain take some part in the service, three-quarters of them in
partnership.
Doctors previously in practice were entitled to join the service at its start
in the place where they were practising. Those now wishing to enter practice
have to apply through their executive councils to the central Medical
Practices Committee, so that a better distribution of doctors throughout the
country may be facilitated. The maximum number of patients’ names per¬
mitted to be on a family doctor’s list is normally 3,500; the average number
140

Hospital and
Specialist
Services
Hospitals
Rehabilitation
in England and Wales is about 2,400. It is normally through the patient’s
own doctor that access to most other parts of the health service is obtained.
There are over 10,400 dentists in England and Wales and over 1,000 in
Scotland in the general dental service.
Over 850 ophthalmic medical practitioners and nearly 7,000 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians in England and Wales, and 65 ophthalmic medical
practitioners and over 700 ophthalmic and dispensing opticians in Scotland
are engaged in the supplementary ophthalmic service. These services provide
for the testing of sight and provision of spectacles. Cases requiring treatment
are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
Nearly all retail pharmacists (numbering some 16,500 in Great Britain)
take part in the National Health Service. They are responsible for the dispens¬
ing of all prescriptions except for the small number dispensed by certain
general practitioners.
The hospital and specialist services provide hospital accommodation of all
kinds, including district general hospitals with treatment and diagnostic
facilities both for in-patients and out-patients, hospital maternity departments,
infectious disease units, psychiatric hospitals and units, convalescent homes,
and rehabilitation centres; all forms of specialised treatment; and the services
of specialist and other staff required for the hospitals.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service in Great
Britain were built in the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much
earlier charitable foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’s and St.
Bartholomew’s Hospitals in London. Much has been done in the last ten years
to improve and extend existing hospitals and a number of new hospitals have
been constructed. In 1962 long-term plans for hospital building were published
by the Government and revisions were made in 1963, 1964 and 1966. The
plans set out the probable future pattern of the hospital service and contain
assessments of the work to be undertaken in the ten years ahead; it is expected
that roughly ^1,000 million will be spent in England and Wales on hospital
building during the ten-year period beginning 1966-67 and £60 million in
Scotland for the first five years.
Over 2,500 of the existing hospitals in the National Health Service are
in England and Wales, including the 26 teaching hospitals in London (actually
groups of hospitals comprising about 100 hospitals, convalescent homes,
branches, annexes, or treatment centres) and the 10 teaching hospitals
elsewLere in England and Wales (comprising some 70 hospitals and other
establishments). They have nearly 464,000 beds available for use and a nursing
and midwifery staff of some 180,000 full-time and about 67,000 part-time
nurses and midwives. There are 375 hospitals in Scotland with over 26,000
full-time and about 9,000 part-time nurses and midwives.
A small number of hospitals remain outside the service for special reasons.
Most of these are run by religious orders. Some, such as the Italian and
French Hospitals, serve a special group of patients; others are maintained
for the chronic sick or for convalescents by charitable organisations. There
are also private nursing homes, which must be registered.
Rehabilitation is an important aspect of medical care and today hospital
treatment is not limited to the relief of pain or cure of pathological conditions
but aims at helping people to resume normal living as soon as possible.
Experience has shown that efficient medical rehabilitation reduces the stay in
hospital, the incidence of permanent disability and the period of incapacity
SOCIAL WELFARE
141
for full work. Specialised rehabilitation facilities are provided at the main
hospitals and in a few special centres. They have been applied with advantage
in the care of the chronic sick, the mentally disabled, the aged and the handi¬
capped and have enabled many patients to become self-sufficient or to be
discharged from hospital and to resume an independent life in their own homes.
The work is carried out under the guidance of the appropriate medical
specialist by physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupational therapists and
social workers, working as a team. The hospital departments work closely
with the Disablement Resettlement Service of the Ministry of Labour.
Medical rehabilitation includes the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, invalid chairs, certain types of
invalid vehicles, and other appliances. Nursing aids for the handicapped at
home, ranging from special carriages to feeding cups, can be borrowed through
the service.
Medical and
Psychiatric Social
Work
Blood Transfusion
Chest Radiological
Service
Most hospitals have social work departments staffed by workers trained to
apply the principles of social casework to the problems of the hospital patient.
Medical and psychiatric social workers co-operate with clinical and other
staff in the patient’s treatment by making social investigations as an aid to
diagnosis, taking social action to alleviate problems and anxieties surrounding
admission to hospital, and arranging when necessary after-care which will
ensure that the patient is helped to readjust to life, whatever his continuing
disability.
The National Blood Transfusion Service in England and Wales is adminis¬
tered by the regional hospital boards under the National Health Service.
Donors give their blood voluntarily without payment. There are two central
laboratories administered by the Medical Research Council on behalf of the
Ministry of Health: the Blood Group Reference Laboratory, which prepares
grouping serum and investigates blood grouping problems referred to it, and
the Blood Products Laboratory, which prepares dried plasma and plasma
fractions. In Scotland the Blood Transfusion Service is under the direction of
the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Association, which is an independent
voluntary body but is supported in the main by a grant from the Scottish
Home and Health Department. In Northern Ireland the Blood Transfusion
Service is operated by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.
A Chest Radiological Service, which is freely available, is provided by mass
radiography units, chest clinics and the radiological departments of general
hospitals. The mass radiography units alone X-ray about 3^ million people
each year, concentrating increasingly on specially susceptible groups in the
population.
Bacteriological and The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
Virological and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
Laboratory Services research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic
diseases. Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory
at Colindale, in north-west London, which includes the National Collection
of Type Cultures, the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories
specialising in the identification of infective micro-organisms.
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, where there is no separate public health
laboratory service, bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital laboratories.
Drug Safety Since 1964 the Committee on Safety of Drugs, set up by the Health Ministers,
has been responsible for considering reports of toxicity testing and clinical
trials of new drugs and for studying reports of adverse reactions to drugs in
142
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
use. Members of the manufacturers’ organisations have undertaken not to
start clinical trials or to market a new drug without or against the advice of the
Committee.
Local Health
and Welfare
Services
Services for
Mothers and
Young Children
Local authorities play a major part in promoting the health and welfare of
people in the community often in co-operation with voluntary organisations,
to which they may make grants, lend premises or give help in other ways.
Most of the needs for which the services are designed arise among four
broad groups of people: mothers and young children; the elderly; the mentally
disordered; and the physically handicapped. Other smaller groups include the
ill and convalescent at home, and the temporarily homeless. To ensure that
the services bring the maximum benefit to those who use them, local authori¬
ties work in close co-operation with the general practitioner and hospital and
specialist branches of the National Health Service.
The authorities responsible for health and welfare services are the councils
of counties, county boroughs, London boroughs and the City of London and,
in Scotland, counties and large burghs. Plans for the development of health
and welfare services in England and Wales over the ten years ending 1971-72
were published in 1963 and revised the following year. A second revision was
published in 1966 for the ten years ending 1975-76 {Health and Welfare.
The Development of Community Care. Cmnd. 3°22> HMSO, 1966). The
authorities have been asked to keep the plans constantly under review. In
Scotland fundamental studies of services are being carried out as a guide to
authorities in their plans for expansion.
Charges may be made for some local authority health and welfare services
(for example, domestic help, welfare foods for young or handicapped children
and nursing or expectant mothers, day nurseries, the loan of equipment and
laundering of bed linen for people being nursed at home, and chiropody
services) but arrangements are made for free provision to people with very
low incomes.
Vaccination against poliomyelitis by local health authorities is normally
restricted to people under 40 years of age (apart from people liable to special
risk who may be vaccinated at any age); those over 40 may be vaccinated, free
of charge under the National Health Service, by their general practitioner.
BCG vaccination against tuberculosis by local health authorities is available
to children of ten years and over and to others exposed to particular risk of
infection. Vaccination is also available against diphtheria, smallpox, tetanus and
whooping cough.
Maternity and child welfare centres offer regular supervision by doctors,
midwives and health visitors to expectant and nursing mothers and young
children. Special sessions are held for vaccination and inoculation and for
early testing of babies for deafness and other defects, and a feature of the
service is the education of mothers before and after the birth by means of
talks, discussion groups, demonstrations and classes. About 77 per cent of
babies born in England and Wales and 60 per cent of those born in Scotland
in 1965 were taken to the centres. Health visitors also visit the homes of babies
and young children to give advice on their care and health, and undertake school
nursing and tuberculosis visiting (for all age groups) as part of their duties.
The expectant mother may arrange to have her baby at home or in hospital
according to the advice given by the doctor or midwife, or according to her
own preference if sufficient hospital beds are available over and above those
required for priority cases, that is, those for whom domiciliary confinement
is inadvisable for medical or obstetric reasons or because of adverse home
Elderly
SOCIAL WELFARE 143
conditions. For a home confinement the services of either a general practi¬
tioner obstetrician or her own family doctor, if he is willing to undertake her
maternity care, besides those of a trained midwife and, if necessary, a consul¬
tant obstetrician, are now available to every mother.
The majority of premature babies are cared for in hospital but special
arrangements for premature babies who are fit to remain in their own homes
are made by many local health authorities who lend equipment and appoint
experienced nursing staff to supervise their care.
Domestic help (commonly called ‘home help’) is made available by local
authorities during periods of special need, for example, confinement or
during the absence of the mother when children might otherwise have to be
cared for away from home.
Some local authorities make direct provision for the special needs of
unmarried mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work
done by voluntary organisations and other bodies (see p. 146).
Under the welfare foods service expectant and nursing mothers, children
up to five years and one month and certain handicapped children can obtain
a pint of milk a day at a reduced price. Other welfare foods distributed by local
health authorities to the same group of people are dried milk, as an alternative
to liquid milk and at an equivalent price, orange juice, cod liver oil and, for
expectant and nursing mothers only, vitamins A and D tablets at cost price.
There are about 500 day nurseries for children under five in Great Britain
provided by local health authorities or voluntary associations working with
them. Private or factory nurseries must be registered with the local health
authority to ensure that their premises and management are satisfactory.
People who mind more than two children under five years of age in their
homes for payment must also be registered if the children are not relatives
and come from different households.
A number of services for elderly people in their own homes are provided by
statutory and voluntary bodies to help them to live there for as long as possible.
Local authorities supply, under the National Health Service Acts, home nursing
and domestic help and many arrange a chiropody service, sitters-in, night
attendants and special laundry services. Under the National Assistance
Amendment Act 1962 the authorities may provide day centres, clubs,
recreational workshops and meals for old people. Health visitors and social
workers employed by local authorities are spending an increasing proportion
of their time helping old people with their problems and in most areas ‘good
neighbour’ and friendly visiting services have also been arranged by the local
authority or a voluntary organisation.
Local authorities provide residential accommodation, under the National
Assistance Act, for the elderly and infirm and have powers to register homes
run by voluntary organisations or privately (see p. 146). The newer homes
provided by local authorities for elderly and other infirm people usually have
accommodation for 30 to 50 residents, but the present development is towards
homes of not more than 35 places for the elderly mentally infirm. Nearly
1,530 new homes have been opened in Great Britain since 1945.
For many years local authorities have, under the Housing Acts, provided
an increasing number of smaller dwellings for old people, and flatlets for
frail or infirm old people who can lead independent lives with some help.
County councils may make grants to county district councils towards the cost
of providing a resident warden and other welfare services for elderly people
occupying these special groups of dwellings.

The Mentally

The Physically
Handicapped
Health Centres
Treatment for mental disorder is provided as part of the National Health
Service. Patients can consult the family doctor, and receive specialist advice
at hospital out-patients clinics, as they would for any other kind of illness and
can enter hospital for in-patient treatment without formalities.
In England and Wales under the Mental Health Act 1959, and in Scotland
the Mental Health (Scotland) Act i960, mentally disordered patients can,
where necessary in the interests of their health or safety or for the protection
of other people, be compelled to enter hospital for treatment. There are
procedural safeguards to protect patients from unnecessary detention in
hospital; in England and Wales patients may apply to a Mental Health Review
Tribunal for discharge and in Scotland to the sheriff.
Local health authorities have a duty to make arrangements for helping the
mentally disordered in the community, for their care and after-care. Recent
developments in the treatment of mental illness, which enable patients to be
discharged from hospital more quickly provided support is available in the
community, are adding to the demands for these services. Arrangements
include training centres for mentally subnormal children and adults,
occupational centres for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and residential
accommodation for the mentally disordered of all ages. If necessary, the local
health authority can place a mentally disordered person under guardianship
within the community. In Scotland education authorities share the respon¬
sibility for providing training or occupation.
Under the National Assistance Act local authorities have a duty to provide
welfare services for people who are blind, partially sighted, deaf, hard-of-
hearing, or otherwise substantially and permanently handicapped. Voluntary
organisations give important help in providing these services. To become
eligible for the services a person must apply to the welfare department of the
local authority for registration as a handicapped person.
A wide range of facilities is available under authorities welfare schemes,
including advice on occupational, social and personal problems arising from
disability; assistance in overcoming the effects of disability; help in carrying
out adaptations in the home—for example, by fitting ramps, wide doorways,
ground floor toilets, guide rails, and the provision of various aids to living to
meet individual needs; social and occupational centres and clubs; teaching of
handicrafts and other occupations either at home or in centres; and the pro¬
vision of recreational facilities, outings and holidays. The blind welfare services
are staffed by social workers, known as Home Teachers of the Blind, who are
specially qualified to assist the blind in all matters including teaching them
craftwork and the use of embossed symbols for reading and writing. Services
for the deaf are also staffed by specialist welfare officers qualified to com¬
municate with the deaf.
Benefits available from other sources include financial aid, preventive and
medical treatment, special education, training for employment and placement
in suitable occupations.
(For the provision of special educational treatment for handicapped
children see p. 154, and the school health services and welfare clinics, which
keep a watch for abnormalities, p. 153.)
Twenty-four health centres which provide primarily for the association of
general medical practice with maternity and child welfare services and the
school health service have been set up by local health authorities in England
and Wales. The provision of the four health centres in Scotland is the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland.

AND WELFARE
SERVICES IN
NORTHERN
IRELAND
The Government is planning, in 1966, to set up a new Health Education
Council (for England and Wales) which will absorb the present Central
Council for Health Education. The new Council will give national support
for health education to the efforts of local agencies. Until it is established, the
present Council will continue to provide a central advisory service for local
authorities, and government departments will continue to help with publicity
material such as films and posters.
Health education is primarily the responsibility of local authorities and they
are increasingly employing specified officers to organise and promote health
education, much of which is carried out in child welfare clinics and by health
visitors.
In Scotland central services are provided by the Scottish Council for Health
Education and the Scottish Home and Health Department.
Free conveyance by ambulance in England and Wales between home and
hospital is provided, where needed, by local authorities either directly or by
arrangement with voluntary organisations. The Hospital Car Service
(organised by the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the British Red Cross
Society, and the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service) augments the ambulance
service in many areas for the conveyance of sitting patients. In Scotland
ambulances are run by the Scottish Ambulance Service (St. Andrew’s
Ambulance Association and the Scottish branch of the British Red Cross
Society) on behalf of the Secretary of State. In Northern Ireland they are
run by the Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority.
The National Health Service still has problems to contend with. The total
cost of the Service has continued to rise, because of such factors as increases
in prices and in staff salaries, the high cost of many new drugs and of modern
equipment, the increased use made by the public of the services provided, and
extensions and improvements of the Service. Despite a high rate of capital
expenditure on hospital buildings and equipment, more is required to improve
the general standard. More doctors, dentists, midwives and nurses are
needed by an expanding service. There is also some disparity between
different parts of the country; some areas have more family doctors than others,
more hospital beds for confinements of mothers who would prefer to have
their babies in hospital though they do not need specialist medical care,
and more extensive local authority services.
Against these problems should be set the steady improvement in the
country’s vital statistics to which the National Health Service has largely
contributed, the decrease in ill health from neglected ailments, and the
removal of anxiety about the cost of treatment, from which many of those
who now use the Service previously suffered. A major reform of conditions of
service for family doctors in the Service was agreed in 1966 to help them with
financial burdens and with their heavy work load.
The health services established under the Health Services Act (Northern
Ireland) 1948 correspond fairly closely to the medical care system estab¬
lished under the National Health Service in Great Britain and they are
financed in the same way as in the rest of the United Kingdom. Welfare
services are provided under the Welfare Services Acts (Northern Ireland)
1949-61.
The hospital and specialist services are administered by the Northern
Ireland Hospitals Authority (which corresponds approximately to a regional
146
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
VOLUNTARY AID
hospital board in Great Britain) through hospital management committees.
In hospital administration the role of the central Government is not quite
so immediate and direct as in Great Britain1: hospital property, for example,
is vested not in the Minister of Health and Social Services but in the
Northern Ireland Hospitals Authority, which has under its control 83 hospitals
containing in all about 17,000 beds. The administration of the general
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and supplementary eye services is in the
hands of the Northern Ireland General Health Services Board, which takes the
place of the executive councils in Great Britain. There are some 75° general
practitioners (with an average of 2,000 patients each), 310 dentists, 13
ophthalmic medical practitioners and 151 ophthalmic and 16 dispensing
opticians. Local health and welfare services are administered by the six county
councils and the two county borough councils in Northern Ireland. The range
of local authority services and the arrangements made by the Northern Ireland
General Health Services Board for the provision of services, and for the
remuneration of the people providing them, are similar to those already
described for the rest of the United Kingdom.
A number of voluntary organisations provide extensive health and welfare
services in co-operation with, or supplementary to, the provision made by
central and local authorities. .
In many areas invalid children, old people and others needing care in their
own homes are visited and helped by voluntary organisations. The National
Society for Mentally Handicapped Children, for example, gives help through
advice and services. The voluntary societies concerned with mental health
have formed the National Association for Mental Health which does consider¬
able advisory, educational and therapeutic work. There are specialist and
general societies concerned with the blind, the deaf and people with other
handicaps. The extensive work done for elderly people is co-ordinated by
Old People’s Welfare Committees which have been established in 1,600 areas.
They are affiliated to the National Old People’s Welfare Council, to which
there are corresponding bodies in Scotland and Northern Ireland. A National
Corporation for the Welfare of Old People, established by the Nuffield
Foundation (see p. 201), is now concentrating on services in the home. At
the present time some 2,300 homes for old and disabled people, run by
voluntary bodies or privately, are registered with local authorities under the
National Assistance Act. .
Most of the homes and hostels for unmarried mothers and their children
are provided by voluntary organisations, who employ specially trained
workers to help the mothers to plan their future.
A great deal of help is given to hospitals by voluntary bodies and individual
voluntary helpers. Many hospitals in England and Wales have their own
Leagues of Friends or similar bodies of voluntary workers who organise and
undertake a variety of services. Many hospitals also have help from the
British Red Cross Society, the St. John Ambulance Brigade, the Women s
Royal Voluntary Service, and other organisations. The operation of canteens
for out-patients, and trolley-shops and book and picture library services
for in-patients, visiting in the wards, receiving new patients, and mending
linen are among the tasks commonly undertaken. The majority of conva¬
lescent homes are, or were, originally provided by voluntary effort.
1 Legislation is under consideration which would bring the position in Northern
Ireland more closely into line with Great Britain in this respect.

There are a number of private health insurance schemes, membership of
which has grown considerably in recent years. It is estimated that some 1-5
million people are now covered by these schemes. Subscribers who wish for
private medical treatment outside the National Health Service can insure
against all or nearly all the cost of hospital treatment and certain medical
treatment outside hospital.
Only persons whose names are on the medical register can practise as doctors
under the National Health Service. Apart from registered medical prac¬
titioners, only persons whose names are on the dentists’ register can practise
the full range of dentistry in Britain; dental auxiliaries who have undergone
a two-year training course may do some simple work under supervision. The
minimum qualification for registration as a doctor requires five to seven years’
training in medical school and hospital, with an additional year s experience
as a resident assistant doctor in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years
at a dental school are required. The governing body of the medical profession
is the General Medical Council, first set up in 1858; that of the dentists is
the General Dental Council, which succeeded the Dental Board in 1956.
The British Medical Association is the main doctors’ professional association;
that of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a general trained nurse is three years. Training is available also in sick
children’s, mental, and mental subnormality nursing. An enrolled nurse takes
a two-year course. The examining body of the nursing profession is the
General Nursing Council. Midwives must have the certificate of the Central
Midwives Board. Most pupil midwives are already state registered general
nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the two-year midwifery training
period is reduced to one year and, for state enrolled nurses, to 18 months.
The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives are the
professional bodies for nurses and midwives. Health visitors are state registered
general or sick children’s nurses who have undergone at least the first part
of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing before taking a year s course in
health visiting, promoted by the Council for the Training of Health Visitors.
In order to describe himself as a pharmacist, a pharmaceutical chemist
must have his name entered in the register maintained by the Pharmaceutical
Society of Great Britain, the governing body of the profession. Qualifications
requiring four or five years’ academic study and practical training are
necessary for registration. Dispensing of medicines on National Health
Service prescriptions and the sale of certain specified medicines can be
carried out only by, or under the supervision of, a registered pharmaceutical
chemist. Under the Opticians Act 195^ a General Optical Council regulates
the professions of ophthalmic optician and dispensing optician; only
registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered medical practitioners) may test
sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes three years followed by a year
under supervision.
State registration is provided for chiropodists, dietitians, medical laboratory
technicians, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, radiographers
and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards (called, for
example, the Chiropodists Board or the Dietitians Board) under the general
supervision of the Councils for Professions Supplementary to Medicine.
A professional training lasting two or three years or more is needed to qualify
for registration. Only state registered members of these professions may be
employed in the National Health Service and some other public services.

Medical social workers must obtain the certificate of the Institute of
Medical Social Workers, or have taken a recognised university course to
qualify them for membership of the Institute. Psychiatric social workers are
required to have a certificate showing they have attended the mental health
course provided at certain universities. Speech therapists need a good general
education and three years’ professional training.
Medical research in Britain receiving support from government funds is
carried out by the Medical Research Council, the universities and their
associated medical schools, and also in hospitals in the National Health
Service. Further support for medical research is provided by private organisa¬
tions, of which the British Empire Cancer Campaign and the Nuffield
Foundation are among the largest. There is close co-operation between the
Medical Research Council and these organisations to ensure the best allocation
of their respective resources. A considerable amount of medical research is
undertaken by the pharmaceutical industry (see also p. 205).
Local authorities in Great Britain have a duty under the Children and
Young Persons Act 1963 to make available such advice, guidance and
assistance as may promote the welfare of children by diminishing the need
to receive or keep them in the authority’s care or to bring them before a
juvenile court. This help may include assistance in kind or, exceptionally,
financial help, and may be given through a voluntary organisation or directly.
However, if a child seems to be in need of care, protection or control because
of adverse circumstances in which he is not receiving the standard of care to
be expected from a good parent or because he is beyond the control of parent
or guardian, the local authority may initiate court proceedings and the child
may be committed by the juvenile court to the care of a ‘fit person’, usually
the local authority, till he or she reaches the age of 18. Local authorities have
a further duty, under the Children Act 1948, to receive into their care any
child under the age of 17 who has no parent or guardian, or who has been
abandoned or whose parents are unable to provide for him temporarily or
permanently. A child so received remains in the care of the local authority
until he is 18 years old unless the authority finds it to his advantage to return
him sooner to his parents or guardian or to entrust him to friends. Both
categories of children are to be treated so as to further their best interests and
afford them opportunity for their proper development.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents,
who receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If a foster home
cannot be found for a child, or he is not suitable for boarding out, he may
be placed in a children’s home provided by a local authority or a voluntary
organisation. Many children’s homes are now provided in small houses, on
housing estates or in ordinary streets, where a group of 12 or fewer children
live in the care of a housemother or houseparents, the husband following
his normal employment. Other children may be placed in hostels or lodgings
or in other accommodation specially suited to their needs. The desirability
of returning a child to his family circle as soon as possible is fully appreciated,
and work is carried out to rehabilitate the family where this is necessary.
To carry out its functions under the Children Act 1948 each local authority
(county, county borough and London borough council or, in Scotland, council
of a large burgh) is required to appoint a children’s committee and a children’s
officer to be responsible for the care and upbringing of children in the
authority’s care. Children’s officers are assisted by a staff of child-care officers

who undertake inquiries and who supervise children placed in foster homes.
Regulations for England and Wales safeguarding the boarding out of children
by local authorities and voluntary organisations and the conduct of children’s
homes have been made by the Home Secretary, and, for Scotland, by the
Secretary of State for Scotland. The cost of the local authorities’ child-care
service, including the provision of training for houseparents and child-care
officers, is shared between the local authorities and the Exchequer.
In Northern Ireland the Children and Young Persons Act (Northern
Ireland) 1950 gave to the welfare authorities of each county and county
borough (under the general direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs) the
duty of caring for homeless and neglected children. Legislation relating to
children and arrangements for their care follow the same general principles
as in Great Britain.
War orphans are the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Security
(see pp. 135-136).
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, con¬
tinue to play a valuable part in this work. The larger societies, such as
Dr. Barnardo’s, the Church of England Children’s Society and the Catholic
Child Welfare Council, are constituent societies of the National Council of
Voluntary Child Care Organisations, to which a large number of smaller
voluntary homes are also affiliated. In Scotland a valuable contribution is also
made by the Church of Scotland Committee on Social Service, and by other
voluntary organisations. Children’s homes provided by voluntary organisations
(of which there are nearly 630 in Britain) are required to be registered under the
Children Act (in Northern Ireland under the Children and Young Persons Act).
The boarding out of children and all children’s homes, whether local authority
or voluntary homes, are subject to inspection by the Child Care Inspectorate
of the Home Office, of the Scottish Office or of the Northern Ireland Ministry
of Home Affairs.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own homes
include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units, which
undertake prolonged and intensive casework with families. The old-established
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its Scottish
counterpart between them maintain inspectors and visitors throughout the
United Kingdom for the investigation of cases of reported cruelty to, or neglect
of, children in their own homes; when necessary, they resort to law after
consultation with the local authority, but they prefer to achieve their purpose
by warning and advice.
Provision for legal adoption was first made in England and Wales in 1926,
in Northern Ireland in 1929 and in Scotland in 1930. Over 20,000 adoption
orders are made annually by the courts in Great Britain and some 400 in
Northern Ireland; there are normally more would-be adopters than children
for adoption. Adoption is now regulated by the Adoption Act 1958 in Great
Britain and by the Adoption of Children Act (Northern Ireland) 1950 in
Northern Ireland. The Registrars General keep registers of adopted children;
adoption societies (over 80 societies arrange adoptions) must be registered with
the local authority (in Northern Ireland with the Ministry of Home Affairs).
Local authorities, through their children’s committees, have had the power
since 1959 to act as adoption agencies and increasingly do so.

EDUCATION
There are over nine million children and young people in full-time attendance
at schools, universities, colleges of education or technical colleges in Britain.
The great majority of schools, attended by over 90 per cent of school children,
are publicly provided or assisted. Most technical colleges and other centres
of further education are also publicly maintained. Universities are autonomous
self-governing institutions but are aided from public funds.
The bulk of expenditure on education in Britain comes from public funds
although many of the older-established schools and colleges continue to
benefit from private endowments. In 1965-66 estimated total pub ic
expenditure on education, including university education (but excluding
school meals and milk), was £1,613 million.
In England and Wales the main development of publicly provided primary
education dates from 1870, and that of secondary education from the beginning
of the present century. In 1833 the Government began to make annual
grants to the voluntary societies which were providing schools, and the
Elementary Education Act of 1870 accepted the principle of compulsory
education By the end of the nineteenth century elementary education had
become virtually both compulsory and free of charge. Public provtston of
secondary education (already begun in Wales) started in England under the
Act of 1902. The Education Act of 1944 now governs public education in
England and Wales. The Scottish and Northern Ireland educational systems
both have long histories independent of that of education in England, but
the same general policy is now being implemented throughout the United
Kingdom, with some national variations. The governing acts are the Education
(Scotland) Act 1962 (a consolidating measure) and the Education Ac
(Northern Ireland) 1947.
All aspects of education in England and Wales, and of universities, civil
science, sport and the arts (see p. 51) throughout Great Britain are the
responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education and Science. (The
Secretary of State for Wales is concerned with the supervision of the national
educational policy in Wales.) The Secretary of State for Scotland and the
Minister of Education for Northern Ireland have corresponding educational
responsibilities, except that the Secretary of State for Scotland is consulte
about Scottish universities but is not responsible for them. . .
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is
divided between the central government departments, local education
authorities, and various voluntary organisations. The relation between these
three groups is based on consultation and co-operation, both by direct contact
between the parties and through Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Education who
act as liaison officers, particularly between local education authorities and the

to higher education are not deterred by lack of financial means. They are also
responsible for the provision of further education (see p. 157).
The planning of the curriculum is largely in the hands of the head teacher
of each school and the individual teachers (see pp. 152 and 153).
The Schools Council for the Curriculum and Examinations, representative
of all educational interests in England and Wales, acts as an advisory body and
carries out research and development work on curricula, teaching methods
and examinations in primary and secondary schools. In Scotland a similarly
representative Consultative Committee on the Curriculum advises the
Secretary of State for Scotland on the development of the curriculum.
In England and Wales colleges of education (for teacher training) are under
the financial and administrative control of local education authorities or
voluntary organisations, but the organisation of courses is based on university
institutes of education. The Scottish colleges of education are under the control
of specially appointed governing bodies; in Northern Ireland they are under
the control of the Government or voluntary agencies.
The universities are administratively independent of the Department of
Education and Science (and in Northern Ireland the Ministry of Education);
the Government exercises its responsibilities in relation to the universities
through the University Grants Committee (see p. 161). Their governing bodies
are appointed according to the terms of their individual charters.
Parents in Britain are required by law to see that their children receive
efficient full-time education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of
5 and 15. (The school-leaving age is to be raised to 16 in 1970-71.)
At present there are over 8f million school children at about 40,000 schools.
In England and Wales there were over 7 million children in publicly main¬
tained schools in 1965, besides some 125,000 others at schools receiving
direct grants from the Department of Education; there were also about
458,000 children of all ages at about 3,560 independent schools. In Scotland
896,600 children were attending publicly maintained or assisted schools and
nearly 18,000 were at independent schools. In Northern Ireland 306,000
children were attending publicly maintained or assisted schools; there were
few at independent schools.
The number of school children in Britain is increasing mainly because the
birth rate continued to rise steadily after 1955, so that primary school numbers
are very high. Each year, too, more children stay on at school beyond the
minimum leaving age and raising the school-leaving age will probably increase
the school population by 425,000. The school population is expected to rise,
altogether, by 2 million by 1975. There is, therefore, a continuing need for
more teachers and more school buildings.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland it is usual for boys and girls to
be taught together in primary schools but about half the secondary schools
are for boys or girls only. Mixed schools are more common in Wales and in
Scotland, where all but a few city schools take both boys and girls. In the
independent sector more than half the schools are co-educational; but of
those providing secondary education the majority are either for boys or for
girls.
Schools supported from public funds are of three kinds in England and
Wales: county schools (the largest group) which are provided and maintained
by local education authorities wholly out of public funds; voluntary schools
(mostly ‘aided’ or ‘controlled’ schools) which have been provided by a
F

voluntary body, usually of a religious denomination,1 and direct-grant schools
which are completely independent of local education authorities but receive
a grant-in-aid from the Department of Education and Science. These last
(the smallest group) mostly provide education of the grammar school type; they
include some schools of ancient foundation. In Scotland most of the schools
supported from public funds are provided by education authorities and are
known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type of independent
school, see p. 155). There are also a few grant-aided secondary schools
comparable to the English direct-grant schools. In Northern Ireland county
schools, managed by local education authorities, and voluntary schools,
under voluntary management, are both grant-aided by the Government.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
schools maintained by local education authorities (that is over 90 per cent
of the school population) and books and equipment are supplied free.
The direct-grant grammar schools take pupils paid for by local education
authorities as well as those whose fees are paid wholly or partly by parents.
(For independent schools, see p. 155.) In Scotland education authorities may
charge fees in a limited number of schools provided that this does not
prejudice the provision of free education for all who are entitled to it. In
Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending grant-
aided schools, with the exception of grammar schools, where qualified pupils
receive from the local education authorities scholarships which cover the
whole or most of the fees charged by the school.
In England and Wales there is no organisation of curricula or direction of
teaching methods by either the Department of Education and Science or the
local education authorities who are responsible for ensuring that there are
sufficient schools available for their area. However, teachers are advised by
Her Majesty’s Inspectors, who are responsible for the inspection of all schools
including independent schools; they review and report on the content and
value of the education provided and are available as advisers. Local education
authorities also employ inspectors to advise on the schools which they main¬
tain. Further advice and encouragement for school-based research and
development is becoming available to teachers through the Schools Council.
In Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in general the same
as that of the Inspectorate in England and Wales. The extent and balance of
the curriculum is kept under continuous review by the Consultative Com¬
mittee on the Curriculum. In Northern Ireland the curriculum of each
grant-aided school is subject to the approval of the Ministry of Education.
In both countries considerable latitude is afforded in the scope both of the
curriculum and the teaching methods employed.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools
receive religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship
unless their parents wish them to be withdrawn. In county schools, and in
certain circumstances in voluntary schools, religious instruction of an

schools and for the cost of all building work at controlled schools. Aided schools have
more independence than controlled schools and are responsible for part of the cost of
external repairs and any building work (see p. 156). Over a third of the 30,000 schools
maintained by local education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary schools
and the majority of these are Church of England schools. There are some 2,000 Roman
Catholic voluntary schools and smaller numbers belonging to other religious bodies.

undenominational Christian character is given. In all kinds of voluntary school
there is opportunity for denominational instruction. In Scotland, subject to
safeguards for the individual conscience, matters relating to religious instruc¬
tion are in the hands of the education authorities; in the more populated areas
there are separate schools for Roman Catholics. In county schools in Northern
Ireland clergy have a right of access to give religious instruction to children
of their denomination for a limited period each week.
At many of the independent schools services in the school chapel and
religious teaching, mainly Anglican, are an important part of school life.
Physical education, including organised games, is a part of the curriculum
of all schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must
have the use of a playing field and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
Organised games include tennis, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse and netball.
The School Health Service provides periodic medical inspection and
arranges, in co-operation with the National Health Service, for free medical
and dental treatment for all children attending schools maintained by local
education authorities. Treatment facilities include dental clinics and child
guidance centres.
Milk (normally one-third of a pint a day) is given free to all school children
who wish to have it, and the Schools Meals Service provides a midday dinner
at a subsidised price (remitted where there is need) to over 65 per cent of the
pupils in county and voluntary schools. Education authorities have power to
provide free transport for children who live more than a certain distance from
the schools they attend.
Nursery schools provide informal educational and play facilities for a small
proportion of children between two and five years old but many more are
needed to meet the demand. At five, the age at which education becomes
compulsory, children in England and Wales go to infant schools or depart¬
ments until they are seven and then on to junior schools or departments
until the age of about 11 (also in Northern Ireland; 12 in Scotland where
primary schools are not divided into infant and junior schools).
The controversial subject of the age of transfer from primary to secondary
schooling is included in the terms of reference of the Central Advisory
Council for Education (England) which, under the chairmanship of Lady
Plowden, is considering primary education in all its aspects; the Council’s
report is expected early in 1967. In the meantime, under the Education Act
1964, local education authorities and voluntary bodies in England and Wales
may, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State for Education and
Science, organise new schools so that the age of transfer is not necessarily
at 11.
The content of curricula is very largely a matter for the schools themselves
and many interesting developments are taking place in the teaching of
mathematics, science and foreign languages as well as in physical education,
drama and art. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland there are no compul¬
sory secular subjects but generally a curriculum includes the teaching of
reading, writing, arithmetic, English, music, art and handwork, nature study,
history and geography. Additionally, in Wales, the Welsh language is taught.
(Children who speak Welsh at home normally receive the early stages of their
primary education in Welsh and are taught English as a second language.)
In Scotland the scope of the curriculum is outlined in the Schools (Scotland)
Code, but it is for each head teacher and his staff to determine precisely what

is to be included and what part it is to play in their pupils’ educational
development.
The public or state system of education aims to give all children an education
suited to their particular abilities. A change in the means by which this should
be achieved in England and Wales was announced by the Government in
1964, when it was stated that, as a matter of national policy, all secondary
education should be reorganised on a comprehensive basis.
Comprehensive schools are not selective and provide a wide range of
secondary education for all or most of the children of a district. They can be
organised in a number of ways and the Government gave guidance on
acceptable forms in a circular issued in 1965- f heY include the comprehensive
school that takes the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; the
‘two-tier’ system in which all pupils transfer at 11 to junior comprehensive
schools and at 13 or 14 to senior comprehensive schools; and the compre¬
hensive school with an age-range of 11 to 16 combined with a sixth-form
college for pupils over 16.
The comprehensive system is replacing the ‘separatist’ system, which
consists of the following types of secondary school to which children are
allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11 (hence the term ‘eleven-
plus’) : grammar schools which provide an academic education orientated
towards university entrance (these include a small number of direct-grant
grammar schools); secondary modern schools which were originally designed
to give a general education with a practical bias; a few secondary technical
schools offering a general education related to industry, commerce and
agriculture; and schools providing all three, or any two types of education,
in separately organised streams and known as multilateral or bilateral schools.
Until recently, Scottish secondary schools fell mainly into one of three
categories or were a combination of all three: (1) junior secondary schools
providing courses, normally lasting three years, for pupils likely to leave school
at the statutory leaving age (15, rising to 16 in 1970-71); (2) schools which,
in addition to junior secondary courses, provide courses leading to the
Ordinary grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education, and (3) senior
secondary schools which provide Certificate courses of four, five or six years.
As in England and Wales secondary education is now being reorganised on
comprehensive lines although, as indicated, many schools already provide all
types of courses.
Under the present system the responsibility for supervising the allocation of
pupils to the secondary courses best suited to them rests with a transfer
Board consisting of representatives of the education authority and of teachers,
and working in accordance with a scheme approved by the Secretary of State
for Scotland. A parent who is dissatisfied with the Transfer Board s decision
may appeal to the Secretary of State for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland there are grammar schools, secondary (intermediate)
schools, which are the equivalent of the secondary modern schools in England
and Wales, and technical (intermediate) schools, which offer the same facilities
as secondary technical schools in England and Wales. Some changes in
organisation are likely as the result of the 1964 White Paper, Educational
Development in Northern Ireland.
Special educational treatment is provided for children who require it because
of any physical or mental handicap, including maladjustment, either in
ordinary schools or special schools (including hospital schools). For children

at special schools attendance is compulsory up to the age of 16, and a number
of schools retain children beyond this age. There are about 1,000 special
schools in Britain, including hospital schools, day and boarding schools.
There are also boarding homes for handicapped children attending ordinary
schools.
There are ten categories of handicapped pupils in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland and nine in Scotland for whom local education authorities
must provide special educational treatment: blind, partially sighted, deaf,
partially hearing, delicate, educationally subnormal, epileptic, maladjusted,
physically handicapped and children suffering from speech defects. There is
no separate category for the delicate in Scotland.
Independent schools receive no grants from public funds but all are open to
inspection and must register with the Department of Education and Science
(or the Scottish Education Department) which has power to require them to
remedy any objectionable features in their premises, accommodation or
instruction and to exclude any person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or
to be the proprietor of a school. In default, the Department can, in effect,
close a school but schools have a right of appeal to an Independent Schools
Tribunal against any of the Department’s requirements. The schools in
England and Wales whose standards are regarded by the Department as
broadly comparable with those required of the grant-aided schools are, on
application, granted the status of ‘recognised as efficient’. Such schools (some
1,540 of 3,560 registered) contain about two-thirds of the pupils in independent
schools. There is no ‘recognised as efficient’ status in Scotland.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages and abilities; a high propor¬
tion, particularly among the recognised efficient schools, provide a boarding
education. These include the preparatory schools and the public schools.1
The preparatory schools cater mainly for boys from about 8 to 13 years of
age who are intending to enter public schools. The largest and most important
of the independent schools are the public schools, although the term includes
some, mostly direct-grant schools, which are not independent schools. There
are just under 300 public schools about half of which are for girls. The boys’
schools in particular include a high proportion of boarding schools and it
is among these that the most famous schools are numbered. Fees generally
range between £300 and £550 a year. In 1965 the Government set up a Public
Schools Commission to advise on the best way of integrating public schools
with the state system of education.
The minimum school-leaving age for all but children at special schools
(see above) is, at present, 15; it will be raised to 16 in 1970-71. Most grammar
school pupils remain at school until they are 16 and the rest leave between the
ages of 17 and 19. The number of pupils in all schools staying on beyond the
minimum leaving age has been steadily increasing, as has the number of
pupils who stay until the end of the secondary school courses and go on for
further education.
There is no national leaving examination in England or Wales, but secondary
school pupils (and candidates not attending school) may take the General
Certificate of Education (GCE) or the Certificate of Secondary Education
1 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of Head¬
masters’ Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of
Girls’ Schools Association. They should not be confused with the state-supported
public schools in Scotland.
56 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
(CSE). The GCE, which is on a single subject and not a grouped subject
basis (that is, no subject is obligatory and individual subjects may be taken at
different times), is conducted at ‘Ordinary’ (O) and ‘Advanced’ (A) levels.
Most candidates for the O-level are about 16 years of age, although many
take it earlier, at the discretion of their head teacher. Most grammar, direct-
grant and independent school pupils and an increasing number from other
secondary schools take the ordinary examination, and passes in various subjects
are widely accepted for entry to courses of vocational training. The advanced
examination is at university entrance level (supplemented by special papers
to help university authorities in selecting students) and is accepted also for
purposes of entry to many forms of professional training. The CSE, instituted
in 1965, is designed for pupils who have completed five years’ secondary
education but who are not taking GCE; it is also on a single subject basis and
is controlled by teachers serving in the schools providing candidates. The
highest grade of pass in the CSE is intended to be of the same standard as a
pass in the GCE O-level. Control over the definition of scope and standards
of examinations is exercised by the Schools Council for the Curriculum and
Examinations (see p. 151) to ensure national comparability. It does not lay
down model syllabuses or examination papers but it can put forward ideas
and promote research and development.
In Scotland courses in senior secondary schools lead to examinations
conducted by the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board.
School pupils in the fourth year of secondary courses sit an examination at
16 years for the award of passes on the Ordinary grade of the Scottish Certificate
of Education, and pupils in the fifth year can obtain passes on the Higher
grade of the Scottish Certificate of Education. Examinations at both grades
are open to candidates who have left school.
In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Junior Certificate Examination
at about the age of 15* and the Northern Ireland General Certificate of
Education at about the age of 17.
School Building Local education authorities and voluntary bodies are responsible, under the
general supervision of the central departments, for providing the schools and
other buildings needed for public education in their areas. The central
departments announce the levels of annual building programmes, frame
regulations, fix cost limits and decide on the size and nature of the
authorities’ individual programmes in the light of national priorities; they also
offer guidance to authorities by means of building bulletins and in other ways.
An extensive school building programme has been carried out in recent
years. This has resulted in the completion of over 8,000 new schools in
Britain since 1947; together with extensions, alterations and remodelling of
existing schools, about 4-5 million new places have been provided, at a cost
of about £1,100 million. In England and Wales new work to the value of
£131 million has been authorised to start in 1967-68, and £15° million in
each of the years 1968—69 and 1969—7°- Scotland the comparable authorisa¬
tions are £24 million in each of the three years. In Northern Ireland expen¬
diture is expected to be over £6 million a year.
Grants of up to 80 per cent of the approved cost are normally available
from the Department of Education and Science for the building of new
voluntary aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to existing
aided schools. The Northern Ireland grants amount to 65 per cent of the
total cost of the expenditure by voluntary bodies on both new schools and
improvements.

The extensive school building programme has been accompanied by new
ideas and methods in design and construction. Industrialised building
techniques have been widely adopted. The new schools are light, airy and
colourful, with a high standard of finish and generous provision of teaching
area and outdoor games space.
Further education is a broad term which covers all education beyond the
secondary stage; it may be full-time or part-time, vocational or non-vocational.
It includes adult education (see p. 158) and higher education (defined on
p. 161). For convenience, advanced work at the level of higher education, but
carried out at institutions regarded as within the further education system,
is dealt with below.
In England and Wales local education authorities maintain about 500 colleges,
including colleges of further education and technical and commercial colleges,
which provide courses at every level up to that of a degree. In 1966 the Govern¬
ment announced plans to concentrate advanced work in a limited number of
institutions to be called ‘Polytechnics’ (see p. 164).
Five national colleges which provide specialised education appropriate to a
particular technology are administered by independent governing bodies and
financed by the industry and the Department of Education and Science.
They are the colleges for rubber technology; heating, ventilating, refriger¬
ation and fan engineering; agricultural engineering; the National Foundry
College; the National Leathersellers College. The former National College
of Food Technology became part of the University of Reading in April
1966.
In Scotland there are about 80 local further education colleges offering
full and part-time day courses and a number of evening courses and 13 Central
Institutions for further education doing advanced work.
In Northern Ireland there are 32 institutions of further education, of
which seven conduct advanced level courses, and 145 out-centres.
Since most of the technical colleges and other further education establish¬
ments in Britain are either maintained or aided from public funds, tuition
fees are moderate, and often remitted for young people under 18 years of age.
Many full-time students are helped by awards from local education authorities.
The awards are generally based on the results of the General Certificate of
Education or a corresponding examination; they are assessed to cover tuition
fees and a maintenance grant, but parents who can afford to contribute
towards the cost are required to do so. There are also some scholarships
available from endowments, and others are awarded under schemes organised
by particular industries or companies for the most promising of their young
workers.
Capital expenditure on further education institutions in England and Wales
totalled £206 million in the ten years to 1965-66. In Scotland £2-2 million
was allocated for capital expenditure on institutions of further education in
1965-66. In Northern Ireland in the period 1955-65 capital expenditure
amounted to over £4 million.
In 1965 there were 267,500 full-time and sandwich course (see p. 158) students
and i-8 million (including evening) part-time students in technological,
technical, art and commeicial colleges in Britain (1-4 million in England and
Wales, 313,000 in Scotland and 51,300 in Northern Ireland). The total number

Education
of students on advanced courses in England and Wales was 149,700, in
Scotland 14,000, and in Northern Ireland 2,460.
The courses provided are full-time, sandwich (up to five years in length,
generally consisting of alternate periods of about six months of full-time study
in a technical college and supervised experience in industry), block release (on
similar principles, but for shorter periods), day release (generally attendance
at a technical college for one day a week during working hours), and evening
classes.
Sandwich courses are popular at advanced levels. For lower level courses
day release and block release courses are replacing evening courses to a large
extent and are likely to become more widespread as a result of the Industrial
Training Boards being established under the Industrial Training Act 1964 to
promote and supervise standards of training (see p. 431).
There is a wide variety of courses for young people in various trades and
occupations, leading to appropriate qualifications at the end of a course
of up to five years. Some experiment is taking place with courses of a more
professional character which are suitable for technicians or for those who aim
ultimately at membership of a professional institution. There are many others
leading to the National Certificates approved by joint committees consisting of
representatives of the education departments and the appropriate professional
body (for example, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers). These courses
are normally at two levels, ordinary and higher. The Ordinary Certificate
courses last two years part-time and students usually follow them between
the ages of 16 and 19; the level of the certificate is generally considered to
approach that of GCE A-level. The Higher National Diploma, which requires
a further three years’ full-time or sandwich study, is recognised as being near
degree level; the Higher National Certificate (after two further years’ part-time
study) is lower in standard and more narrowly based. (For degree courses, see
p. 163.)
A fair proportion of evening institutes and some independent colleges offer
courses in shorthand, typing and book-keeping. Most local technical colleges
offer some lower level work; higher level work is generally concentrated in
technical colleges with a department of commerce or in specialised colleges
of commerce. Young entrants to clerical and other non-technical posts can
take an examination for the Certificate in Office Studies.
Some business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies; large numbers of the candidates taking
such courses do so through correspondence courses. In England, Wales and
Northern Ireland there are part-time courses leading to the Ordinary
National Certificate and Higher National Certificate in Business Studies.
There are also more advanced full-time and sandwich courses leading to the
Ordinary National Diploma and Higher National Diploma in Business Studies.
In Scotland, broadly similar courses lead to the Scottish National Certificate
and the Scottish Advanced National Certificate in Business Studies awarded
by the Scottish Council for Commercial Education.
Adult education is generally taken to mean courses of non-vocational education
for people over 18. Such courses are provided—either separately or in
conjunction—by local education authorities, various voluntary bodies of
which the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA) is the most notable, certain
residential colleges, and the adult education (‘extra-mural) departments of
universities.

The residential colleges, the university departments and the voluntary
bodies, such as the WEA, recognised by the education departments as com¬
petent to provide adult education, receive government grants. So too do
various national bodies which promote educational activities of a non-political
kind, such as the National Federation of Women’s Institutes. Many of these
bodies also receive grants from local education authorities for services
rendered locally.
A major share in the provision of adult education is increasingly being
assumed by local education authorities. Most of it is on a part-time basis,
mainly in the 8,000 or so evening institutes, which have a total of over a million
students, and also in schools of art, adult education centres, community centres,
literary institutes and youth clubs. There are 28 short-term residential
colleges in Great Britain, maintained or aided by local education authorities,
providing courses varying in length between a weekend and a fortnight. Many
of the courses are practical, but there are widespread opportunities for
academic study.
The Village Colleges pioneered in Cambridgeshire and variously adopted
in Cumberland, Monmouthshire, Leicestershire and Peterborough are a local
education authority development in rural areas. The colleges are secondary
schools planned also as community centres, providing educational, social and
cultural centres for adults in the areas served. Community centres, though
aided by the local education authorities, are usually managed by community
associations many of which are affiliated to the National Federation of
Community Associations.
Six residential colleges (five in England and Wales, one in Scotland) provide
courses of one or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The colleges
vary in character, although they all aim at providing a liberal education.
A number of voluntary bodies provide adult education as part of their
services. The Women’s Institutes and Townswomen’s Guilds, for example,
generally offer courses in social studies, arts, drama and handicrafts. These
too are aided by local education authorities.
In general, courses at the highest levels in liberal studies are provided by
the extra-mural departments of the universities, many of which have full-time
staff appointed for this purpose and can call on the services of other members
of the university staff; and by the Workers’ Educational Association, which
also employs organising tutors and works closely with the university extra¬
mural departments. In 1965, 220,000 students in Britain attended such courses.
the National Institute of Adult Education provides in London a centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many organisations in England and
W ales which are interested in this subject. It is largely financed by contri¬
butions from local education authorities and assisted by a grant from the
Department of Education and Science. The Scottish Institute of Adult
Education is the corresponding body in Scotland.
Changes in the structure of adult education in Northern Ireland and
increased government grants are resulting from acceptance of the main recom¬
mendations of the report, published in 1964, of the committee under Sir
Charles Morris.
Teachers are appointed by local education authorities or school governing
bodies or managers. In 1965 there were about 328,600 full-time and 33,000
part-time (equivalent to 16,000 full-time) teachers in publicly maintained
primary and secondary schools in Britain, an average of one teacher to 24
jfto BRITAIN; AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
pupils; but because of the shortage of teachers, particularly those for younger
children, and their uneven distribution throughout the country, many classes
have more than the statutory maxima of pupils (40 pupils for primary and
30 for secondary school classes in England and Wales; in Scotland 45 for
primary, 40 for classes in the first three years and 30 for classes in subsequent
years of secondary departments). The rise in school population has created
a need for more and more teachers; although greater numbers are entering the
colleges of education (see p. 163), more university graduates are turning to
teaching, and many married women, formerly teachers, are returning to the
profession, yet more are needed if the Government s aim of eliminating
oversize classes is to be achieved. In 1965 there were over 36,000 full-time
teachers in grant-aided establishments of further education in Britain, other
than colleges of advanced technology and central institutions (see p. 161),
and, because of the special conditions, many more part-time teachers. Most
teachers in technical colleges have industrial and professional experience.
There are national salary scales for teachers in schools and other educational
institutions maintained from public funds in England and Wales, in Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland.
Teaching Aids Radio broadcasts to schools and colleges of further education are well
and Educational established. In 1965-66 the School Broadcasting Department of the BBC sent
Techniques out 62 different radio series, some of which were repeated within each week;
they were used by about 74 per cent of schools (32,000) in Britain. Television
reaches about 30 per cent of schools (some 13,000); 19 weekly programmes,
all repeated the same week, were broadcast by the BBC and 13 series of weekly
programmes, many of which were repeated, were produced by the three main
independent companies (Rediffusion Limited, Granada and Associated
Television) and networked nationally. In addition, local series of programmes
were produced by three of the regional companies (Scottish, Grampian and
Ulster Television).
Radio provides a great variety of educational programmes for adults, both
vocational and non-vocational; most of them are grouped in the Study
Session’ hourly programmes on five nights a week. Television programmes
for similar audiences have grown fast; they are mostly shown on Saturday
and Sunday mornings and in the evening during the week. There ha\e also
been a number of experimental projects sponsored between the BBC, some of
the independent television companies, universities, local education authorities
and a voluntary body, the National Extension College. (For the proposed
University of the Air, see p. 165.)
Both the BBC and ITA have educational advisory bodies and there is
consultation between the two broadcasting services to prevent duplication of
education programmes.
More recent developments include the use of aids which take over part of
the repetitive teaching functions, allowing more of the teacher s time to be
devoted to individual pupils. There has been a rapid development in the use
of programmed learning and a National Centre for Programmed Learning
has been established in the Department of Education at the University of
Birmingham. Language laboratories (using tape recorders in individual
booths) are being used at all levels of the educational system. Closed ciicuit
television is in regular use at several universities, medical schools, colleges of
education, technical colleges and schools; and in a major development in
Glasgow, two universities, two colleges of education, the College of Dramatic
Art and the city’s schools are all experimenting with it.

There is a trend in schools and colleges towards co-ordinating different
methods of audio-visual presentation, including radio, television, films, colour
slides, wall charts, maps, models and recording tape. For example, the BBC’s
‘Radiovision’ programmes for schools, introduced in 1964, uses coloured
film strip synchronised with sound programmes. The National Committee for
Audio-Visual Aids in Education is the main promotional body in England
and Wales; it runs a national information and exhibition centre and an
experimental development unit. In Scotland these functions are undertaken
by the Scottish Film Council and its associated bodies.
The system of higher education includes universities, colleges of education
and advanced courses at various colleges in the further education system.
(Advanced courses are dealt with on pp. 164-5 and higher education in
Northern Ireland on p. 165.) The expansion of higher education has been
accelerated by the Government’s acceptance of the target figures up to 1973-74
and the substance of certain other important recommendations of the Commit¬
tee on Higher Education under Lord Robbins’ chairmanship. The Committee’s
report, published in 1963, suggested that by 1973-74 there should be 390,000
places in higher education, of which 218,000 should be in university
institutions. In 1965 the Government decided that 122,000 of the remaining
places should be for training teachers, a move that will almost double the
number of teachers in training.
The colleges of advanced technology (CATs) and two Scottish central
institutions have been added to the grant list of the University Grants
Committee (see below). They are at various stages in the process of attaining
university status.
Further expansion of technological education and the selective development
of institutions is being encouraged. These include the Imperial College of
Science and Technology (University of London), University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology and Strathclyde University.
Colleges of education are undergoing the most rapid expansion of all the
institutions of higher education. It is now possible for some of their students
to take degrees by means of a four-year course.
The number of universities in Great Britain will shortly be over 40. Although
the Government is responsible for providing nearly three-quarters of univer¬
sities’ income it does not control their work or teaching nor does it have
direct dealings with the universities. The grants are distributed, and the
Secretary of State is advised on university matters, by the University Grants
Committee, whose members are drawn from the academic and business
worlds, though universities as such are not represented on it.
The English universities (including the former CATs which are in the
process of attaining university status and whose new names are given where
known) are: Aston (Birmingham), Bath, Birmingham, Bradford, Bristol,
Brunei (London), Cambridge, Chelsea College of Science and Technology
(London), City (London), Durham, East Anglia, Essex, Exeter, Hull, Keele,
Kent at Canterbury, Lancaster, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, London,
Loughborough University of Technology, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne,
Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford, Sheffield, Southampton, Surrey,
Sussex, Warwick, and York. There is a University of Wales; the Welsh College
of Advanced Technology which, like the other CATs, is to attain university
status; and St. David’s College, Lampeter, whose arts degree courses are
aided by grants through the sponsorship of the University College of South
j52 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Wales and Monmouthshire. The Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Edin¬
burgh, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt (Edinburgh), St. Andrews, Stirling (due to take
its first students in 1967), and Strathclyde (Glasgow). Queen’s College,
Dundee, preparing to become a university independent of St. Andrews on
1 st August 1967, will be Scotland’s fourth new university.
There are three other institutions where the work is predominantly of
university standard: University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology, whose students read for degrees of the University of Manchester,
and the two postgraduate business schools which are supported jointly by
industry and the Government. These are the Manchester School of Manage¬
ment and Administration which started its first course in October 1965 and
the London Graduate School of Business Studies, associated with the London
School of Economics and the Imperial College of Science and Technology,
which started in February 1966.
The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish Universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
As universities administer themselves according to the terms of their
individual charters or Acts their forms of government vary. Oxford and
Cambridge are each composed of a number of residential colleges which are
corporate bodies governed by their own fellows and distinct from the
university. Most of the fellows of the colleges, however, are university
teachers or officers and the majority of university teachers are also fellows of
colleges. Only the universities have the right to confer degrees, and they
provide central libraries and laboratories as well as much formal instruction.
Government of these universities is entirely in their own hands. The Univer¬
sities of London (with over 26,000 students, by far the largest in Britain) and
Wales are federal; academic and financial matters concerning the whole
university are controlled by the central authorities, which include lay
representatives; the constituent colleges and institutions manage all other
matters for themselves. At most of the other universities, especially those
which owe their foundation to local initiative, the lay element has an important
role in university administration. Oxford, Cambridge and Keele have high
proportions of students in residence. At most other universities the proportion
is less than half. Nearly a third of all full-time students in Great Britain are in
colleges or halls of residence, just over half are in lodgings and the remainder
live at home.
University Finance The Government contributes over 70 per cent towards the current income
of universities and about 90 Per cent towards their capital programmes.
Money for recurrent purposes is given in the form of a block grant to the
University Grants Committee, which then allocates it between the universities.
In addition to those for building work, grants are also made for purchasing
sites and properties, for professional fees and equipment. Further sums are
raised by the universities themselves.
Recurrent grants for 1966—67 are estimated at some ^13° rnillion ^112
million excluding the CATs, over a fourfold increase in ten years). Capital
grants for 1966-67 are estimated at ^70 million (£64 million excluding CATs,
a ninefold increase in the same period). In recent years about 70 per cent of
capital expenditure in each year’s programme has been for buildings to accom¬
modate teaching and research in the various faculties; over half for science
subjects and technology. The remaining 30 per cent has been for general service
buildings, such as halls of residence, student unions, refectories, and libraries.

Courses in arts and science are offered by most universities. At nearly all
universities courses are available in one or more applied sciences: Imperial
College, London, University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology, the University of Strathclyde and the former colleges of
advanced technology concentrate on technology although some of them are
now offering a number of courses in social studies, modern languages and
other non-technological subjects. About 44 per cent of full-time university
students (excluding those at CATs) in Great Britain are taking arts or social
studies courses and 41 per cent are studying science or technology; a further
10 per cent are studying medicine and the remainder dentistry, agriculture,
forestry or veterinary science.
University degree courses generally extend over three or four years, though
in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science five or six years are required.
The first degree of Bachelor (Master for Arts, in the older Scottish univer¬
sities) is awarded on the completion of such a course, depending on satisfactory
examination results. Further study or research is required at the modern
universities for the degree of Master and by all universities for that of Doctor.
Actual degree titles vary according to the practice of each university. Diplomas
and certificates are awarded after shorter courses in some subjects.
University teaching combines lectures, practical classes (in scientific
subjects) and small group teaching in either seminars or tutorials, the last
being a traditional feature of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
Most members of the academic staffs devote time to research and at all
universities there are postgraduate students engaged in research.
Admission to the universities is by examination and selection; there is no
religious test and no colour bar. Women are admitted on equal terms with
men, but at Cambridge their numbers are limited by statute. The general
proportion of men to women students is nearly three to one; at Oxford it is
six to one, and at Cambridge ten to one.
Despite recent expansion programmes, applications for places at universities
for arts studies still exceed the number available. Prospective candidates for
nearly all the universities apply for places through the Universities Central
Council on Admissions (set up by the universities themselves in 1963) instead
of to individual universities; this organisation passes copies of each application
to all the universities (maximum six) named in it, sends the universities’
decisions back to candidates and then forwards applications from candidates
who have failed to secure a place to universities known still to have suitable
vacancies. The only students to apply directly are Scottish candidates for the
Scottish universities except Edinburgh, which takes its students through the
Council’s machinery.
At the beginning of the academic year 1965-66 there were 167,000 full-time
university students including 16,500 from the former CATs and Heriot-Watt
College. Over 27,000 were postgraduate. There were also about 25,000 part-
time students, about three-fifths of whom were working for university-level
qualifications.
In 1965-66 there were about 20,000 full-time university teachers in Great
Britain; about 10 per cent of them were professors. The ratio of staff to
students was about 1 to 10.
Teachers in maintained schools must hold qualifications approved by the
education departments. In England and Wales the majority qualify by
undertaking a three-year course of studies at a college of education. Plans are
164
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
being worked out to give wider opportunities for college students to obtain a
degree (Bachelor of Education (BEd)) as well as a professional qualification
by means of a four-year course. University graduates and certain specialist
teachers are qualified by their degree or specialist qualification although many
do an additional one-year course at a university or college of education. There
are special shortened courses for well qualified older students. In Scotland all
men teachers and all teachers in secondary schools must be graduates (or have
equivalent qualifications) and must have taken a course of teacher training.
Women primary school teachers may qualify by taking a three-year course
at a college of education. Under the Teaching Council (Scotland) Act 1965,
a General Teaching Council has been set up to take over almost complete
powers over the profession excluding salary matters but including the function
of compiling a register of teachers, admission to which will replace the former
system of qualification by certificate.
In England and Wales there are 155 colleges of education (14 of which are
for day students only; at least one more day college is expected to open in
1966-67); 26 university departments of education, four colleges for training
teachers for technical institutions and 16 art teacher training centres. In
1965—66 there were over 72,700 students in the colleges of education (including
3,400 in the day colleges), nearly 4,700 in the university departments of
education, and about 1,900 in the technical and art training establishments:
a total of some 79,300 students in all. In Scotland there are nine colleges of
education; a tenth is due to open in October 1966. The number of students
in training is being expanded from 7,800 in 1964 to over 11,000 in 1973-74.
As a result of the colleges’ rapid expansion in the eight years to 1966,
student numbers rose from 28,000 to nearly 73,000 and are likely to exceed
80,000 in 1966-67. The target of teaching training places for 1973-74 is
114,000. Other measures to help provide enough teachers for the rising school
population are mainly aimed at attracting back into teaching former teachers,
now married, and increasing the numbers of part-time teachers. More day
training colleges are being opened, some training is to be organised on a
part-time basis and there are more refresher courses, and more nursery classes
for children of potential teachers.
The education departments, universities, local education authorities and
other bodies provide a variety of short in-service training courses for
practising teachers.
Other Higher Many students in Great Britain (over 163,000 in 1965-66) take advanced
Education courses outside universities in a wide variety of subjects including architecture,
art and design (see p. 219), catering, engineering, natural sciences and business
studies. In 1964 the Council for National Academic Awards was established
with powers to award degrees and other academic distinctions to students who
successfully completed approved courses at educational establishments other
than universities. There are now over 80 courses, most of them in science and
technology (where the Council has carried on the work of the National Council
for Technical Awards which it superseded) but also on subjects such as arts,
social studies, business studies, law and librarianship. The Council must
ensure that its degrees are comparable with those of universities. The Council s
powers extend to the whole of Great Britain.
Government proposals for the development of a distinctive sector of higher
education within the further education system, to complement the universities
and colleges of education, were outlined in a White Paper, A Plan for
Polytechnics and Other Colleges, in 1966. They provide for the designation of a

limited number of major centres to be developed as comprehensive academic
communities catering for full-time, sandwich and part-time students at all
levels of higher education.There would be an important role for other colleges
particularly in specialist fields and a wider spread of centres catering for part-
time higher education students.
Management studies are provided by universities and technical colleges,
by individual companies and by trade and industrial federations (for the two
postgraduate business schools, see p. 162). Certain independent colleges
specialise in management training. Several universities have introduced
management studies into the curriculum and courses for the postgraduate
Diploma in Management Studies are run by certain technical colleges. In
Scotland courses leading to the Certificate of Business Administration are
provided for students in junior supervisory positions.
The Government is considering the establishment of a University of the
Air, an open university offering degree, refresher and similar courses in
which series of radio and television programmes would be combined with
other adult educational provision.
Scholarships and other awards are now very widely available, for it is the
national educational policy that no able boy or girl shall be prevented by
lack of means from taking an advanced course at a university or elsewhere.
Over 90 per cent of university students in Great Britain are aided from public
or private funds.
In England, Wales and Scotland all British students with certain qualifica¬
tions are eligible for awards from public funds in order to attend full-time
at a university, college of education or major further education establishment.
In England and Wales local education authorities provide awards. In Scotland
students’ allowances for advanced courses are awarded by the Scottish
Education Department. The amount of award depends upon the income of
the student and his parents. Studentships for advanced postgraduate study
are offered annually by the Department of Education and Science, the
Science Research Council, the Social Science Research Council and by the
Scottish Education Department.
Higher education in Northern Ireland is also expanding. The Government
accepted most of the recommendations put forward in 1965 by the committee,
under Sir John Lockwood’s chairmanship, on higher education in Northern
Ireland. The Government agreed that there should be between 8,000 and
9,000 full-time university places by 1973-74 an(l that there should be a second
university, at Coleraine.
Technological studies are to be concentrated at the existing university,
Queen’s, Belfast, and the Lockwood Committee recommended that the new
university should concentrate on the biological sciences. The Government
also accepted in principle the committee’s proposals for teacher training. An
education centre for non-graduate teachers is to be established within the
new university and the general teacher training colleges are to be renamed
colleges of education and brought into closer association with Queen’s
University. Higher education outside the universities is to be centred on a
new Ulster College, ultimately envisaged as an association of the colleges of
technology, art and domestic science and other colleges providing a Northern
Ireland service.

Coleraine), had a total of 5,000 students in 1965-66. Between 1957 and 1965
nearly £8% million was spent on university building projects and further
expansion over the next 15 years is planned. Recurrent expenditure in 1965-66
was estimated at £2 million. Government grants are made by the Ministry
of Education which usually first seeks the advice of the University Grants
Committee. Teacher training takes place in one university department of
education and six training colleges, with over 100 and 2,000 full-time students
respectively in 1965—66. Technological education outside the university
sphere is given under the sponsorship of the Joint Authority for Higher
Technological Studies. Under the proposed reorganisation this work will be
transferred to the Regional College of Tecnnology and the Joint Authority
will be wound up. University and further education scholarships are awarded
by local authorities and postgraduate awards and teacher training scholarships
by the Ministry of Education, the conditions of award being identical with
those for Great Britain.
Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
educational services is supported financially by the educational departments,
local education authorities, philanthropic organisations, universities and
teachers’ associations. The Social Science Research Council is an additional
channel for government support.
The greater proportion of educational research is done in the universities,
particularly within departments or institutes of education and departments
concerned with sociology, psychology, statistics and problems of physical and
mental handicap. Outside universities, the major research institute is the
National Foundation for Educational Research, an autonomous body which
derives its income mainly from corporate members, including local education
authorities, teachers’ organisations and universities and from an annual grant
from the Department of Education and Science, i here are also the Scottisn
Council for Research in Education and the Northern Ireland Council for
Educational Research. The Schools Council sponsors a number of projects
in England and Wales.
There is no single central organisation for the co-ordination of educational
research, but the central departments, by their allocation of funds for projects,
exercise some influence on the direction of research effort. In 1965—66 the
Department of Education and Science had a total commitment of about £1-2
million spread over 120 projects, and current expenditure exceeded £250,000;
the Scottish Education Department’s grant to the Scottish Council and other
research bodies totalled £30,000.
Among philanthropic organisations that provide generously for research
are the Nuffield Foundation (see p. 201) and Ford Foundation, the Gulbenkian
Trust, the Leverhulme Trust, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie
United Kingdom Trust.
There are many opportunities for overseas students to study in Britain and
for British students to study abroad and British teachers are encouraged to
serve overseas for a period.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In
the academic year 1964-65 there were about 68,500 overseas students in
Britain, of whom about one-quarter were at universities, another quarter at
technical colleges and the remainder training as teachers, doctors and nurses,

for the law, or in industry. About two-thirds of all overseas students were
from the Commonwealth.
A wide range of public and private fellowships and scholarships for advanced
study in Britain are awarded annually to students and research workers
from other Commonwealth countries. Under the Commonwealth Scholarship
and Fellowship Plan, the Governments of certain Commonwealth countries
have made awards available at their own institutions of higher education to
men and women from other Commonwealth countries. The British Govern¬
ment made available an average of 500 of these scholarships to be held in
Britain at any time in the period 1960-66 and has expanded the programme
to cover 600 scholars and fellows for 1966-67, the additional number being
provided in the fields of medicine and surgery. In addition some 550 teachers
and others are training in Britain under the Commonwealth Bursary Scheme.
An example of smaller government schemes is the Athlone Fellowship Scheme,
under which about 40 fellowships a year are awarded to Canadian engineering
graduates for up to two years’ further study, training and research in
institutions or industries in Britain.
About 500 British Council1 scholarships, tenable usually for one year in
Britain, are offered annually to graduates of overseas universities. Twenty-four
Marshall Scholarships for two years’ study at any university in Britain are
offered annually by the British Government to graduates from the United
States of America and over 60 Rhodes Scholarships are awarded annually to
Commonwealth and United States graduates for two years of study at the
University of Oxford. Other universities and colleges themselves offer many
scholarships for which graduate students of any nationality are eligible.2
Fellowships and training awards for study in British institutions are
available under the Central Treaty Organisation, the Colombo Plan, the
Special Commonwealth African Assistance Plan and British technical
assistance programmes for many other countries. Large numbers of awards
for study or training in Britain are made under the United Nations Programmes
of Technical Assistance and the Colombo Plan.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee, set up after the
Commonwealth Education Conference of 1959, supplements normal direct
dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth. Further
Commonwealth Education Conferences were held in 1962 and 1964.
Overseas students in Britain are in general treated on the same footing as
their local British colleagues and are subject to the same regulations and
conditions. In a number of cases the students’ own national representatives in
London (Office of the High Commissioner or Embassy) accept certain special
1 The purpose of the British Council (founded in 1934) is defined in its Royal Charter as
the promotion of a wider knowledge of the United Kingdom and the English language
abroad and the development of closer cultural relations between Britain and other
countries. The Council is governed by an executive committee of 30 members,
broadly representative of many elements of the life of Britain and including nine
members nominated by ministers. It is financed almost entirely from public funds.
The activities of the Council, which has staff in 77 overseas countries, are concerned
with: English language teaching and other educational work; fostering personal contacts
between British and overseas people, especially in the educational, professional and
scientific fields; running, or helping to maintain, libraries of British books and period¬
icals overseas; and presenting overseas the best in the arts in Britain. Its work in
Britain is concerned mainly with professional visitors and with the welfare of overseas
students.
“ The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes every two years a list of
postgraduate awards tenable at universities in Britain, and awards at overseas univer¬
sities for which British students are eligible; it is entitled United Kingdom Postgraduate
Awards (see Bibliography).

responsibilities for their students. The British Council acts as agent for the
overseas departments of State in matters affecting overseas students’welfare and
provides certain services (meeting on arrival and an accommodation bureau).
The British Council has overseas students’ centres in London (where a new,
and larger, building was opened in 1963) and in other university cities. The
Council organises a varied programme of lectures, discussions and social and
other activities. Many British people like to invite students to their homes and
the British Council arranges introductions. In the vacations there are courses
in many parts of the country which offer opportunities for getting to know
more about British life in town and country. In term time there are visits to
various places of interest, and theatre and concert parties are arranged.
Among many voluntary organisations which offer a welcome to overseas
students are the East and West Friendship Council, Rotary, Round Table,
the Victoria League, the Royal Over-Seas League, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the National Union of Students, the English-Speaking Union and
Churches of all denominations. The London Conference on Overseas
Students, for which the British Council provides the secretariat, co-ordinates
their work in the metropolis. In some London boroughs and in other large
cities there are committees which help students to make contact with local
residents and organisations. Similar conferences have come into being in other
large cities in Britain. These organisations also help by entertaining overseas
students and by providing hostels. In 1961 the British Government set aside
I2I million for the Overseas Students Welfare Expansion Programme
administered by the British Council to help organisations to provide residential
accommodation for overseas students. A further million was made
available in January 1966. By April 1966 grants to 90 projects comprising
over 4,000 places had been approved in principle and over 2,500 of these
places were already in use.
Under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, a number of
scholarships are made available annually to United Kingdom students by the
Governments of other Commonwealth countries for study in their universities,
colleges and other institutions of higher learning. At present Commonwealth
Scholarships are being held by United Kingdom students in Australia,
Canada, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Rhodesia and Sierra Leone. In 1964 the Commonwealth Education Conference
introduced the Study and Serve Scheme, designed to enable British students
to undertake a year’s postgraduate study at universities in the developing
Commonwealth countries on condition that they also work for a year in
appropriate employment in the country concerned.
For many years the United States has offered awards for British students,
the best known being the Fulbright travel grants for postgraduate study at
American universities. Notable among recently established scholarships are
the Kennedy scholarships, to enable British students to study at three American
universities, and the Churchill travel scholarships, for men and women in all
walks of life. Fourteen Commonwealth countries offer awards to British
students under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan. British
students are also offered scholarships at institutions of higher education in
22 European and nine non-European countries (see footnote, p. 167).
Over 1,100 teachers left Britain by the end of 1965 for posts in schools,
colleges of education, technical colleges and universities in developing
countries, including 1,000 who left to serve in the developing countries of the

Commonwealth. The number of British teachers recruited to serve in these
countries has nearly trebled in three years. Steps taken by the Government
to encourage school teachers to serve for a period overseas have included the
establishment of a National Council for the Supply of Teachers Overseas and
the introduction of special measures to safeguard their interests both while
abroad and on their return home. Recruitment is carried out by the Ministry of
Overseas Development, the British Council and the voluntary teacher
recruiting agencies, such as the Catholic Overseas Appointments and the
Overseas Appointments Bureaux.
There are about 1,000 British university teachers serving overseas, most of
them recruited through the Inter-University Council on Higher Education,
the Association of Commonwealth Universities or the British Council.
Government encouragement also includes support for the work of the
Committee on University Secondment and the introduction, in 1964, of
Special Commonwealth Awards, which are made to leading scholars from
British universities who are willing to work for a minimum of two years in
important posts in the universities of developing Commonwealth countries.
Outside the schemes, an increasing number of graduate and qualified
volunteers, also cadet volunteers (school leavers), 1,314 in 1965-66, are going
overseas for one or two years, a large number to teach. Many of them go with
the support of voluntary bodies (like Voluntary Service Overseas) which
receive financial assistance from the Government.
Interchange schemes, under which teachers in Britain exchange posts for
a year with teachers overseas, include one with the United States and another
with Commonwealth countries, whereby each year over 100 British teachers
exchange posts with teachers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Official exchange schemes also operate between Britain and several European
countries both for teachers and for temporary assistants’ posts for language
specialists.
Britain provides, on request, assistance to the developing countries in several
other ways, including the loan of educational experts for technical and
consultant services and specialist missions, through various educational
organisations and the Ministry of Overseas Development. Financial assistance
is also given for building and equipping educational institutions; recent
examples include the ^5 million grant for educational development in Nigeria
and the £1 million grant for the University of Zambia.
YOUTH SERVICES
The object of youth services in Britain is to provide for the leisure-time
activities of young people under 21 years of age, and to offer them opportuni¬
ties—complementary to those of home, formal education and work—for
discovering and developing their personal resources, so that they may be
better equipped to be responsible members of the community. Membership
of youth organisations is voluntary and the facilities they offer are sufficiently
varied to appeal to every type of boy and girl.
Responsibility for youth services in Britain is shared by the education
departments, local education authorities, voluntary organisations and the
Churches. There is no attempt to impose uniformity or to create any national
youth organisation. A number of youth organisations have spontaneously
i yo

developed over the last century, mainly by voluntary effort. Government
encouragement in England and Wales dates from the 1930s. In 1939 outh
Service (as it is known in England and Wales) was created as a partnership
of voluntary organisations, local education authorities and central government.
The status of Youth Service as an essential part of the educational system of
Great Britain was confirmed by the Education Act 1944 and the Education
(Scotland) Act 1945; in Northern Ireland, youth welfare work is promoted
under the Education Act (Northern Ireland) 1947, and the Youth Welfare,
Physical Training and Recreation Act (Northern Ireland) 1962.
The education departments provide grants in aid of the administrative
and training work of national voluntary youth organisations, towards the
expense of training full-time youth leaders and towards the cost of premises
and equipment of youth clubs provided by voluntary bodies.
Local education authorities co-operate with voluntary organisations in
their areas: most give some financial help and lend premises and equipment;
most also employ youth organisers to help in the promotion and encourage¬
ment of youth work. Wbere voluntary services are considered inadequate,
local authorities themselves organise youth centres and clubs. Most local
authorities have appointed youth committees on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented.
In addition to grants received from the State and local authorities, voluntary
organisations may receive help for special projects from charitable trusts,
notably from the King George’s Jubilee Trust (see p. i72)- Most of the
funds of the voluntary organisations are raised by their own efforts.
Since i960 developments in the Youth Service have been greatly influenced
by the recommendations of a committee set up to examine the service, under
the chairmanship of the Countess of Albemarle.1 On the advice of the Youth
Service Development Council, formed as a result of one of the committee s
recommendations, the Department of Education and Science is making
larger grants towards the headquarters expenses of national voluntary youth
organisations and special grants for voluntary projects, some of which are
experimental; it authorised a building programme for the period 1960-66
at an estimated cost of ^20-5 million and co-operated with a local education
authority in designing an experimental club; and, to supplement existing
facilities, established a national training college at Leicester for youth leaders.
Local authorities’ contributions to the Youth Service have also increased,
their expenditure for 1965-66 was estimated at £5-8 million. Progress made
in the Youth Service since the publication of the i960 report is being
considered by a committee of the Youth Service Development Council.
The Albemarle Committee’s inquiry extended only to England and Wales,
youth provision in Scotland having already been the subject of reports by
advisory bodies; but some of its main recommendations applied to Scotland,
while others reflected the existing Scottish position. A Standing Consultative
Council on Youth Service in Scotland,with functions similar to those of the
Youth Service Development Council for England and Wales, was set up by
the Secretary of State for Scotland in December 1959. It was reconstituted
in 1964 and given wider scope as the Standing Consultative Council on
Youth and Community Service. In 1963 permanent arrangements for training
in youth leadership for full-time youth leaders and organisers were made.
More money is being made available from central funds to national voluntary
organisations in Scotland and, as in England and Wales, increased expenditure

on youth services by Scottish education authorities (estimated at £1 million
in 1965-66) is taken into account in calculating the Exchequer general grant.
A White Paper on the development of youth services was presented to the
Northern Ireland Parliament in 1961, in which local education authorities were
urged to take a more active part in youth work than they had previously done.
Such changes as required statutory authority were given effect in the Youth
Welfare, Physical Training and Recreation Act (Northern Ireland) 1962.
The functions of the Youth Committee, set up in 1944, were taken over by
the Youth and Sports Council and extended to reflect the larger part to be
played in youth welfare by the local education authorities and sports organisa¬
tions. Statutory provision was made for larger Ministry grants towards the
training costs and salaries of full-time youth leaders and for expenditure on
playing fields.
The voluntary organisations vary greatly in character since nearly all of them
were formed to serve specific groups of young people; some of them provide
educational and religious activities as well as social and recreational pursuits
for their members, and all of them seek to inculcate high ideals of personal
conduct and service to the community.
Twenty-seven national voluntary youth organisations with memberships
of at least 10,000 are constituent members of the Standing Conference of
National Voluntary Youth Organisations, a consultative body which takes
action only in the name of its member bodies and with their consent. A further
26 bodies are associate or observer members, for example, the Church of
England Youth Council, which represents about 272,000 young people who
are members of clubs sponsored by the Church of England. The corresponding
body in Scotland is the Scottish Standing Conference of Voluntary Youth
Organisations, in Northern Ireland the Standing Conference of Youth
Organisations, and in Wales the Standing Conference for Wales of Voluntary
Youth Organisations. These major organisations have a total United Kingdom
membership of about 3 million young people under 21.
Among the youth organisations with a mainly religious origin and purpose
are the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) and Young Women’s
Christian Association (YWCA), with about 48,000 and 18,000 members under
21 respectively; the Boys’ Brigade (149,000), the Church Lads’ Brigade
(13,000), the Girls’ Life Brigade (63,000), the Girls’ Friendly Society (20,000),
Girls’ Guildry (28,000), the Methodist Association of Youth Clubs (163,000),
the Salvation Army Youth Organisations (105,000), the Catholic Young
Men’s Society of Great Britain (25,000), the National Council for Catholic
Youth Clubs (37,000), the Young Christian Workers (17,000), the Grail
(14,000), and the Association for Jewish Youth (18,000).
The Boy Scouts Association and Girl Guides Association have world-wide
affiliations; they are undenominational and non-political, and were founded
by Lord Baden-Powell in 1908 and 1910 to develop character and good
citizenship in boys and girls. Their total United Kingdom membership
under 21 is about 477,000 scouts and 586,500 guides.
The National Association of Boys’ Clubs, with about 2,000 affiliated clubs
and 155,000 members, and the National Association of Youth Clubs, with
over 3,000 affiliated clubs and 234,000 members, are concerned mainly with
the 14 to 20 age-group. Each affiliated club has its own rules, but all aim at
giving young people opportunities to develop into mature members of
society. Representatives from clubs form local committees and these send
representatives to the national members’ councils.

Other
Organisations
Concerned with
Youth Work
The pre-Service organisations for boys (the Combined Cadet Force,
Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps) combine social, educational and
physical development with training for possible entry into the armed forces;
their combined membership is about 125,000. The Sea Cadet Corps, although
not a pre-Service organisation, helps boys who wish to make their career at
sea; its membership is about 16,800. The Girls’ Venture Corps, with about
4,000 members, formed in 1964 from the Girls’ Training Corps and the
Women’s Junior Air Corps, has an Air Wing offering aviation courses.
The National Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs in England and Wales
has about 38,000 members between 10 and 25 years old, the Scottish
Association of Young Farmers’ Clubs has about 7,500 and Northern Ireland
Young Farmer Clubs over 4,000 members: in addition to encouraging
interest in agriculture and appreciation of country life, the clubs provide
training in the arts of citizenship and develop ability to serve the community.
The Welsh League of Youth {Urdd Gobaith Cymru) has a membership
of about 43,000; its aim is the ‘development of Christian citizenship among
the youth of Wales’.
The Youth Hostels Associations in England and Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland have a netw'ork of hostels for walkers and cyclists, particu¬
larly intended for young people of limited means. They seek to promote
knowledge and love of the countryside, and are closely linked with each other
and with similar organisations in other countries.
Adult organisations with youth sections include the British Red Cross
Society, St. John Ambulance Brigade and the political parties.
King George’s Jubilee Trust was established in 1935 by King George V, to
promote the welfare of the younger generation. Since its inauguration it has
disbursed over £1-7 million to the headquarters of the principal voluntary
youth organisations and to many local projects, particularly those of an
experimental nature.
In 1966 about 117,000 young people between the ages of 14 and 20 took
part in the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, which is a scheme operated by local
authorities, schools, youth organisations, industrial firms and other bodies,
and is designed as a challenge to boys and girls to reach certain standards of
achievement in three progressive stages in leisure-time activities. The scheme
for boys covers sections on public service, pursuits and interests, expeditions
and fitness. The scheme for girls is divided into sections on design for living,
interests, and adventure and service. A number of Commonwealth countries,
including Canada, Australia and New Zealand, now operate the scheme.
The Outward Bound Trust maintains in Great Britain five schools for boys
which offer 26-day character-building courses, based on adventure and
overcoming testing experiences. There is a similar school for girls, with
modified courses. About 5>000 b°ys and 850 girls take part each year. The
courses are mainly for boys and girls aged 16 to 19 years; but there are also
junior courses for boys and girls aged 14 to 16 and senior courses for young
people up to 25 years old.
The aims of the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the Scottish Council
of Physical Recreation and the National Playing Fields Association bring them
into touch with many youth organisations (see Chapter 19).
In addition to organisations on a nation-wide basis, there are a large
number of town, district or village social clubs run by voluntary groups for
general or particular purposes; photographic societies, folk dance, table
tennis or jazz clubs, for instance.
PLANNING AND
HOUSING
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
Britain is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and it is
essential to plan land use for a satisfactory national distribution of employment
and population, to undertake a programme of urban renewal, to build new
towns and to preserve the amenities of the countryside.
From 1909 successive Acts of Parliament recognised the principle of the
planned use of land, but because the pattern of development over much of
the country had already hardened into large unplanned urban concentrations
the powers granted to planning authorities were inadequate for the task
in hand.
The 20 years between the two world wars were decades of rapid social
and industrial change and of developments in industry, engineering, house¬
building, and motor transport; the population was increasing and becoming
more mobile; there was a widespread demand for improved standards of
accommodation and consequently a greater need for systematic planning than
had hitherto been required. At the beginning of the 1930s a major effort was
made to strengthen planning law and to extend the planning powers of central
and local authorities. This resulted in the Town and Country Planning Acts
of 1932 which remained the basis of planning law for 15 years.
Although inter-war planning legislation improved sanitary and environ¬
mental conditions and did something to preserve amenities, its general effect
was unsatisfactory mainly because it failed to deal adequately with the problems
involved in compensating property owners who stood to lose by the intro¬
duction of positive planning schemes. Local authorities often hesitated to
exercise their powers effectively for fear of being involved in financial liabilities
beyond their means, and as a result there was still much unregulated urban
development and spoliation of the countryside.
Renewed efforts to tackle these problems were made immediately before
and during the second world war. Between 1937 and 1942 three expert com¬
mittees were appointed to study and report upon (1) the unregulated growth
and spread of industry, (2) the hampering of planning by the financial and
administrative difficulties of compensation and betterment and (3) the
encroachment of urban development upon the countryside. After the second
world war other committees studied the question of new towns and national
parks.
Almost all the principal planning recommendations of these committees
have now been incorporated in Acts of Parliament, as follows: the New Towns
Acts 1946 to 1964; the Town and Country Planning Acts 1947 to 1963; the
Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Acts 1947 to 1963; the National
Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949; the Town Development
Act 1952; the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act 1957; the
Local Employment Acts i960 and 1963; the Caravan Sites and Control of
Development Act i960; and the Control of Office and Industrial Development

Act 1965. Town and country planning in Northern Ireland is governed by
the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland) 1931; the Planning (Interim
Development) Act (Northern Ireland) 19445 the Planning Acts Amendment
Act (Northern Ireland) 1944; the New Towns Act (Northern Ireland) 19655
and the Amenity Lands Act (Northern Ireland) 1965.
The Town and Country Planning Act 1962 (which consolidated earlier
planning legislation in England and Wales), and the Town and Country
Planning (Scotland) Act 1947, are the principal Acts that govern the pattern
of land use in Great Britain. They provide for the co-ordination of planning
by means of development plans drawn up by local planning authorities and
approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary
of State for Scotland or the Secretary of State for Wales; and they control
development by making it subject, generally, to the permission of a local
planning authority or of a central government department. They also give
extensive powers to public authorities to acquire and develop land for planning
purposes, and deal with certain questions of amenity, for instance, the
preservation of buildings of special historic or architectural interest, and of
trees and woodlands, and the control of advertisement display. The Land
Commission Bill 1966 provided for the establishment of a commission with
wide powers to acquire, manage and dispose of land for development, and to
impose a levy on land transactions in order to recover for the community a
share of development value.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts local planning authorities
(in England and Wales, the councils of counties and county boroughs, the
London authorities and, in some areas, joint planning boards; and in Scotland,
councils of counties and of large burghs, and the councils of the two small
burghs of St. Andrews and Thurso) are required to prepare and submit
development plans covering the whole of their areas to the appropriate
Ministers for their approval. Each development plan consists of a written
statement of intentions illustrated by maps describing the major projects in
the plan and is accompanied by a report giving the background to the plan
in terms of existing land use, communications and similar matters. Plans
normally cover a period of about 20 years; they must be reviewed at least once
in every five years, and may be extended and altered at any time so that they
are kept up to date. Control of development is exercised by local planning
authorities in accordance with the development plans.
Proposals for changes in their plans must be advertised by the planning
authorities and the ministers concerned must consider objections and repre¬
sentations from the public. Usually a public local inquiry has to be held
before the proposals are decided. A Planning Advisory Group1 has proposed
that the procedure might be made more efficient if the Minister of Housing
and Local Government retained the duty of approving the plans broad
principles and strategy while the local planning authorities would assume
responsibility for adopting local plans.
Machinery for planning on a regional basis has been set up by the Govern¬
ment (see p. 244). Studies showing the economic and social resources in
several regions have been made and certain areas, where land, communi¬
cations and facilities are favourable, have been proposed as places where
development should be concentrated.

and 1963 and the Industrial Development Act 1966 contain provisions
relating to the location of industry and offices. General problems of industrial
development are dealt with jointly by a number of government departments,
but the consent of the local planning authority is, as a rule, required for any
new industrial building, any extension of a building or any change in the use
of an existing building. Financial incentives to encourage the location of
industry in particular areas have been made available by successive govern¬
ments. Special control of office building in and around London and in
Birmingham was instituted under the Control of Office and Industrial
Development Act 1965 and has since been extended by an Order made by
the Board of Trade to the whole of south-east England and the Midlands;
in 1966 a more general Building Control Bill provided for a licensing system
for certain commercial projects worth more than £100,000. An Order
temporarily reducing the limit to £50,000 is to be made.
The New Towns Act 1946 gave the Minister of Housing and Local
Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland power to make an
order designating any area of land (which may include any existing town
or other centre of population) as the site of a proposed new town, and in
1965 the same power was given to the Secretary of State for Wales. The
appropriate minister must consult the local authorities in and around the
area about the proposal. Once the site has been designated, the minister
appoints a development corporation (consisting of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and up to seven other members) to be responsible for the develop¬
ment of the new town.
The development corporations have powers in general (subject to the
consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, the Secretary of
State for Scotland or the Secretary of State for Wales) to acquire, by agreement
or compulsory purchase, land or property within the designated areas, or, in
some cases, land near to or outside those areas, and they may provide houses,
flats, commercial and industrial premises, estate roads and other buildings or
services essential for the development of the towns. In England and Wales the
development corporations need not obtain planning permission from the
local planning authorities; nor, in Scotland, need the corporations of
Cumbernauld, East Kilbride and Livingston new towns.
The capital cost of developing the new towns is advanced to the corporations
from public funds and is repayable over 60 years out of the income from the
property. The corporations submit annual reports (which include copies of
their audited accounts) to the ministers who lay them before Parliament.
As each new town in England and Wales is substantially completed the
development corporation is dissolved and, under the terms of the New
Towns Act 1959, its assets and liabilities are handed over to a central agency
—the Commission for New Towns. The Commission has assumed respon¬
sibility for Crawley, Hemel Hempstead, Welwyn and Hatfield. It is responsible
for maintaining and enhancing the value of the land entrusted to it; but in
discharging its functions it is required to have regard to the purpose for which
the towns were established, and to the convenience and welfare of the people
working and living in them. The Government proposes to abolish the
Commission so that the local authorities might have greater responsibilities
in the completed new towns. No new towns central authority has been
proposed for Scotland, where new town development is at a less advanced
stage.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Twenty-one new towns have been, or are being, established in Great Britain;
seventeen in Bngland and W ales and four in Scotland. Eight of the new towns
in England and Wales (Basildon and Harlow in Essex; Hemel Hempstead,
Stevenage, Hatfield and Welwyn in Hertfordshire; Crawley in Sussex, and
Bracknell in Berkshire) are designed to help in absorbing excess population
from the Greater London area; of the others, Corby in Northamptonshire,
Aycliffe, Peterlee and Washington in Durham, and Cwmbran in Monmouth¬
shire are to serve the special needs of their areas; Skelmersdale in Lancashire
and Runcorn in Cheshire are to meet the overspill needs of Liverpool,
Redditch in Worcestershire and Dawley in Shropshire will take population
from Birmingham. Proposals have been announced for a development of
Dawley with the area around Wellington-Oakengates and further large-scale
expansions are to take place in the Leyland-Chorley area of Lancashire to
take population from Manchester, around Bletchley in north Buckingham¬
shire to provide housing for people from London, and in mid-Wales. The
Government has also proposed big expansions of the towns of Ipswich,
Peterborough, Northampton and Warrington under the New Towns Acts.
Proposals for large new areas of development to relieve the pressure on
London are under review. These include the Southampton-Portsmouth,
Ashford and Swindon regions recommended in the South-East Study
(see p. 500). Studies are also to be made of the possibilities of development
in the Dundee area and the regions of the Humber and Severn rivers.
The Scottish new towns (East Kilbride in Lanarkshire, Glenrothes in
Fife, Cumbernauld in Dunbartonshire, and Livingston in West Lothian)
are helping to house people from Glasgow. Livingston is also to be a focus for
industrial activity in the central belt of Scotland. There is a proposal under
consideration for a further new town at Irvine in Ayrshire.
In Northern Ireland it is planned to create a new city, Craigavon, and
to expand a number of key towns including Antrim and Ballymena (see p.180).
The new towns represent a notable achievement in positive land use.
They are generally recognised as one of the most successful post-war experi¬
ments, both socially and industrially, and as a profitable long-term investment.
Nearly half a million people have moved into the new towns during the past
decade and to meet their needs an extensive building and civil engineering
programme has provided houses, flats, factories, schools, shops, churches,
roads, water supplies and sewerage on a very large scale. Additional services
such as gas and electricity, police, fire and bus stations, postal, telegraph and
telephone facilities, new health centres and libraries have been provided as
well as public buildings including the town hall and law courts; and most of
the towns are well equipped with parks and playing fields of various kinds.
All towns have become concerned with the increasingly high level of car
ownership of their inhabitants and are making more adequate provision for
parking and the segregation of pedestrians from motorists.
A number of the more developed towms are becoming regional centres
and, as the populations grow large enough to give the necessary support,
offices and hotels as well as full entertainment and recreational facilities such
as skating rinks, dance halls, bowling alleys, swimming pools, sports stadia,
golf courses and youth centres are gradually being provided.
Under the New Towns Act 1946 Parliament approved a consolidated
fund of £50 million to provide for advances to the development corporations
for work on the new towns. This fund was increased by subsequent Acts
and now stands at £550 million. A total of about £430 million had been
advanced to the corporations by March 1966.

The Town Development Act 1952 makes provision for the relief of con¬
gestion in large industrial towns in England and Wales (such as London and
Birmingham) by encouraging the transfer of population from these areas to
places suitable for expansion where employment is provided. Schemes have
been approved for providing some 130,000 dwellings in this way, of which
about one-third have been completed or are under construction. Most of the
expanding towns, for example, Basingstoke in Hampshire, Thetford in
Norfolk and Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, are already well established. No
further small expansion schemes within 40 miles of London are envisaged.
The Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act 1957 makes similar
provision for Scotland. Schemes have been approved for some 30,000
dwellings; about half of these have been completed.
Redevelopment of outworn and obsolete areas is taking place in
many towns: Glasgow, for example, has started a programme of
rebuilding 30 areas, housing nearly a third of its population and accom¬
modating much of the industry and commerce of the city. The Buchanan
report (see p. 345) which assessed the conflicting demands of traffic and
environmental standards has influenced many authorities’ redevelopment
plans. A centre for environmental studies has been set up by the Government
to consider the problems of urban renewal in the light of a fast growing mobile
population.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of the large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
special character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, the policy
has been adopted of establishing ‘green belts’ around all or part of certain
urban areas. There is a general proscription against most new development
in these areas but the need for more land for housing is so great that a
certain limited use of green belt areas for residential building has to be
considered. However, a balance between amenity and housing needs must be
struck.
Responsibility for the presentation of the historic, scenic and architectural
beauties of Great Britain is vested mainly in the Minister of Housing and
Local Government, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of
State for Wales, and the local planning authorities. Lists of buildings of
architectural or historic interest are being compiled and so far more than
180,000 buildings have been listed. The respective Ministers (on the recom¬
mendation of the appropriate Historic Buildings Council) are responsible
for administering the grants available for the repair and maintenance of
buildings of outstanding historic or architectural interest and their contents.
Grants totalling over £6 million have been made towards the cost of urgently
needed repairs to over 1,200 historic buildings in England, Scotland and
Wales. The Ministry of Public Building and Works is responsible for the
maintenance of royal parks and palaces and for the protection of ancient
monuments (under the Ancient Monuments Acts). Over 700 of the more
important protected monuments in Britain (they are visited by nearly
9 million people annually) are in the care of the Ministry.
Under the Town and Country Planning Acts 1947 local planning
authorities have power for instance to protect trees and woodlands by
means of tree preservation orders (some 5,000 of which are in force throughout
Great Britain), to prevent mineral workings becoming permanent eyesores by
attaching suitable conditions to planning permissions, and to restrict or

regulate the display of advertisements in the interests of amenity or public
safety. Local authorities are also empowered, under the Clean Air Act 1956,
to declare ‘smoke control areas’, in which the emission of smoke from chimneys
constitutes an offence. Local authorities are also surveying coastal areas
under their responsibility to establish which parts should be protected and
which are more suitable for development.
Voluntary amenity societies, wholly dependent upon the support of their
members, include: the Council for the Preservation of Rural England,
the Association for the Preservation of Rural Scotland and the Council for
the Preservation of Rural Wales; the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths
Preservation Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the Protection
of Ancient Buildings; the Pilgrim Trust; and the Historic Churches Preserva¬
tion Trust. The National Trust for England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
which was founded in 1895 and now has some 157,000 members, is (apart
from the Crown and the Government) the largest land-owner in the United
Kingdom. It owns and protects from harmful development 400,000 acres of
land and some 190 historic buildings and gardens for the benefit of the public
often acquired through gifts (sometimes by arrangement with the Treasury
in lieu of death duties). It is at present engaged on a £2 million campaign,
Enterprise Neptune, to preserve 900 miles of coastline.
There is also a National Trust for Scotland, an independent body founded
in 1931, which has about 27,000 members and has under its care over 60
properties, covering in all over 79,000 acres.
The Civic Trust, financed through covenants from leading industrial
firms, was founded in 1957 encourage high quality in architecture and
planning and to stimulate public interest in the protection of beauty in town
and country. It has, for example, produced plans for the redevelopment of
town centres and for a recreational area in the Lea Valley. The Trust makes
use of local initiative; it has separate sections in the north-east, north-west
and Wales and advises some 550 local civic societies.
The responsibility for nature conservation rests with the Nature Conservancy,
which is a committee of the Natural Environment Research Council (see
p. 209). The Council derives its powers in this field from its royal charter and
the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, as amended by
the Science and Technology Act 1965. The object of conservation is to
influence soils, water, vegetation and animal life by means of research,
experiment and control (see p. 210).
The Nature Conservancy is responsible for 113 nature reserves in Great
Britain, covering 235,500 acres, of which over 58,800 acres comprise the
Cairngorms, the largest reserve in Britain and one of the largest in Europe.
Nine other areas (mostly in the north) are managed by local authorities,
using their powers under the National Parks Act in consultation with the
Conservancy.
Twelve forest nature reserves have also been set up; of these eight have
been created by agreement between the Forestry Commission and the
Nature Conservancy and consist of forest land managed under joint super¬
vision.
The Council for Nature (established in 1958) is a foundation of some 440
natural history and conservation societies concerned with threats to wild life
in Britain. It receives grants from the Department of Education and Science,
the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust.

National Parks The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 provided that
and Access to selected areas of beautiful country in England and Wales should become
the Countryside national parks, where the characteristic landscape would be safeguarded and
facilities for open-air recreation provided or improved.
A National Parks Commission was set up by the Act and given the job of
selecting these National Parks. Ten have been established: the Peak District,
the Lake District, Snowdonia, Dartmoor, the Pembrokeshire coast, the North
York Moors, the Yorkshire Dales, Exmoor, Northumberland and the Brecon
Beacons. They cover a total area of 5,254 square miles, almost one-eleventh
of the area of England and Wales. They have various forms of administration,
based on representation of the local planning authorities of the areas in
which they are situated, as well as members nominated by the Minister
of Housing and Local Government or by the Secretary of State for Wales.
The Commission also has power to designate other areas in England and
Wales as ‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’. By 1966 20 such areas had
been designated covering more than 3,000 square miles.
The land in these Parks and areas remains in private ownership, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by the
local authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the natural beauty
of the landscape by high standards of development control, and by positive
measures attracting Government grants such as tree planting and preservation,
removal of eyesores and improvement of derelict land. In National Parks,
public enjoyment is promoted, for example, by the provision of car parks and
camping and caravan areas and the setting up of information centres with
the help of Government grants. All National Parks and some designated
areas have Warden services.
Responsibility for making proposals for long-distance routes, footpaths or
bridleways also rests with the National Parks Commission; once the proposals
are approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government or by the
Secretary of State for Wales, it falls to the local authorities to give effect to
them. Ten routes—in all, nearly 1,300 miles—had been approved by 1966.
Large stretches of these paths are already public rights of way; the first
long-distance footpath to be completed (the Pennine Way, which stretches
for some 250 miles) was opened in 1965. The establishment of further routes
is under discussion.
In a White Paper, Leisure in the Countryside {England and Wales), the
Government proposes to set up a Countryside Commission to replace and
extend the work of the National Parks Commission. The new body will be
responsible for promoting public enjoyment of the countryside generally.
Measures envisaged include the creation of country parks to meet the needs
of motorists and to relieve pressure on the National Parks; and the extended
use of reservoirs, canals and derelict land for leisure activities.
There are no National Parks in Scotland but five areas have been recom¬
mended as such by the Scottish National Parks Survey Committee. They
are: Loch Lomond—Trossachs; Glen Affric—Glen Cannich—Strath Farrar;
Ben Nevis—Glen Coe—Black Mount; the Cairngorms; and Loch Torridon
—Loch Maree—Little Loch Broom. Close supervision is being maintained
over development in these areas by means of Scottish National Parks
Directions, which require the local planning authorities concerned to refer
proposed developments to the Secretary of State for Scotland for consideration.
It is also proposed to set up a Countryside Commission for Scotland to
reconcile the needs of conservation and of development, paying special
attention to the importance of the tourist industry there.

Preservation of
Amenities
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Forestry Commission has formed, and opened to the public, seven
Forest Parks in some of the finest country in Britain: Argyll, Glen Trool,
Glen More, and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the Forest
of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and Wales;
Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park (adjoining the Northumber¬
land National Park to the westward), which includes forests on the borders
of Northumberland and Cumberland in England and of Roxburgh in
Scotland. The total area of the seven parks approaches half a million acres.
Camping facilities are provided in all the parks.
The historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a Forest Park, is
also open to the public.
Under the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland) 1931 local authori¬
ties are empowered to prepare planning schemes for their areas in order to
secure proper sanitary conditions, amenity and convenience in the laying out
and use of the land.
The planning provisions of the 1931 Act are permissive, but the Planning
(Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland) 1944 brought under planning
control all land not subject to a scheme under the 1931 Act and empowered
local authorities to secure more effective control of development until planning
schemes came into operation.
Since 1944 progress has been made by the authorities in the preparation of
outline advisory plans. These plans indicate broadly the proposals for their
areas and provide a foundation for more detailed plans. They also facilitate
the control of development until planning schemes are completed.
Interim development control is exercised in accordance with the 1944 Act,
which requires that, where application is made to an authority for permission
to develop, the authority may grant the application conditionally or un¬
conditionally or may refuse it altogether. In the event of a refusal or
conditional approval, the applicant may appeal to the Ministry of Development
for Northern Ireland (the department primarily responsible).
Planning in Northern Ireland has entered a new phase in recent years with
the publication of Sir Robert Matthew’s Belfast Regional Survey and Plan, in
April 1964, and the Report on Economic Development in Northern Ireland,
in February 1965. These reports have led to a greater emphasis on regional
planning in Northern Ireland and their general thesis of preserving and
enhancing Northern Ireland’s physical environment has been accepted by
the Government.  
The Government and local authorities are co-operating in limiting the
growth of the Belfast urban area and plans are being prepared for a new city,
Craigavon, linking the two boroughs of Lurgan and Portadown in County
Armagh. Plans are also being prepared for the expansion of a number of
other key towns including Antrim, Ballymena, Coleraine, Londonderry and
Newry. The New Towns Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 which provides
machinery for the development of new towns may also be applied to the
expansion of certain of the existing towns.
A White Paper, The Administration of Town and Country Planning in
Northern Ireland, published in 1964, contains proposals for a central planning
authority responsible for the overall planning of Northern Ireland which
would work with a number of local development committees in the detailed
planning of each area.
The Amenity Lands Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 enables the Ministry of
Development to acquire or control areas of natural beauty or amenity, to

designate National Parks; to create nature reserves; to provide facilities for
visitors to such areas; to put areas of outstanding natural beauty or of scientific
interest under a special form of planning control; and to secure the clearing
of derelict sites in rural areas. The Ministry of Finance has responsibility
for the preservation of ancient monuments and historic buildings.
The Ministry of Development co-operates with the Ministry of Commerce
in the selection of industrial sites in order to secure the best possible use of
the land and to facilitate the efficient provision of housing and other services,
especially communications, in connection with industrial development
(seep. 257).
Northern Ireland’s first forest park at Tollymore Park, Newcastle, County
Down, was opened to the public in 1955. Situated at the foot of the Mountains
of Mourne, it covers an area of 1,200 acres. It contains an arboretum com¬
prising a wide variety of native and exotic trees, and an exhibition of natural
history, and is rich in mountain, river and parkland scenery. Caravan facilities
and a camping site for youth organisations are available.
HOUSING
There are some 18 million dwellings in Britain: 15,750,000 in England and
Wales, 1,700,000 in Scotland and about 420,000 in Northern Ireland. Over
one house in four is owned by public authorities (in Scotland the figure is
almost one in two), nearly half are in owner occupation and most of the
remainder (mainly older houses) are rented from private landlords.
Between 1945 and March 1966 about 5J million new houses and flats were
built; one family in three now lives in a post-war dwelling. Most of the new
dwellings in Britain are houses (usually of two storeys); the remainder are
flats or maisonettes, mostly in blocks of from 2 to 20 storeys, although a few
blocks may be higher. High blocks are generally built in central urban areas
where they replace old, overcrowded dwellings. In the new towns and on
new housing estates they provide focal points and help planners to achieve
higher densities of population per acre, where desirable, while still providing
open spaces.
Accommodation in a house designed for a family of four or five people
includes one or two living rooms, a kitchen, a store, a bathroom and a water
closet and two or three bedrooms. A typical 3-bedroom house built by a local
authority in England and Wales in 1965 had a superficial area of about 930
square feet and cost £2,579 to build.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme is borne by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in
England, by the Secretaries of State in Scotland and Wales and the Minister
of Development in Northern Ireland. Local authorities are responsible for
ensuring that the provision of housing in their areas is adequate. In England
and Wales and Northern Ireland the local housing authorities are the councils
of county boroughs, boroughs, urban districts and rural districts, the
Greater London Council, the London borough councils and the Common
Council of the City of London. In Scotland all town and county councils
are housing authorities. The actual building of dwellings is undertaken by
the local authorities (or by building firms under contract to them) and by
private builders, usually for sale to owner-occupiers. In recent years about
one-quarter of the dwellings built by local authorities have been for old
people.
182
The Housing
Programme
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Government has set a target of building 500,000 dwellings a year m
Britain by 1970—an increase of 28 per cent over the total of 591.000 omit
in 1965—half in the public sector and half in the private. Although the
numbers of households and dwellings in Britain are roughly equal they are
unevenly distributed and there is a heavy demand for housing m the areas
of economic prosperity. There is also a continuing need for accommoOanon.
amounting to some 150,000 dwellings a year, for the growing numner o:
households as the population increases and living standards rise. In additM*.
it is estimated that about 3 million dwellings are required to replace shnns
and old houses which lack essential amenities in industrial areas. A fuither
750,000 or so dwellings are required to overcome shortages and provide a
margin for mobility as well as to replace losses due to redevelopment.
In two White Papers on the housing programme published in 1965. one
dealing primarily with England and Wales and the other with Scotland, the
Government said that the output of new housing in the public sector in
Britain should be expanded to 250,000 by 1970, primarily to jneet the urgem
need for low-rented accommodation in large towns. The Government has
acknowledged the increasing demand for dwellings for owner-occupation arcL
by agreement with the builders and building societies, aims at the provision
of some 250,000 annually by 1970 in the private sector in Britain.
Research and
Development
Research into building techniques and into new methods of house construction
as well as into the needs of families, is carried out by the Researcn anc
Development Groups of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government snu
of the Scottish Development Department, the Building Research station, the
architects’ departments of major local authorities and the research groups m
big constructional firms. All government building research and development -
co-ordinated bv the Directorate-General of Research and Development at tne
Ministry of Public Building and Works. In 1963 the Ministry set up the
National Building Agency to help in speeding up the rate ot public unu
private building by giving technical advice. In July 1966 the .nmsay -tt
Housing and Local Government, the Scottish Office and the ;; elsn Office
assumed responsibility for this agency which will devote itseit exuusi.ely
to housing. Methods of increasing productivity are under smdy dt ecooonnc
development committees set up for the civil engineering and buildingmiuslMS
and by a committee of the Ministry of Public Building and W otte, winch is
concerned with small builders who undertake the maintenance ami improve¬
ment of existing houses where, for example, prefabneated plummng -1
bathroom units can be used.
Industrialised
Building
It is expected that there will be an increasing shortage of manpower m
the construction industry as a result of the heavy demands put on rt by -me
housing programme. Local authorities are forming consortia to maxe the
best use of systems of industrialised housing, with standardised compone^
in their building programmes. The Government believes that by 1970 s:_.c
40 per cent of housebuilding should be by these methods, which orrer me
advantages of very rapid construction on the site, greater independence 01
weather conditions, and the use of fewer skilled w-orkers man • am_:r_
building methods require. 
[n addition to local authorities, this includes new town authorities, tne scocisk

although rents generally are lower. The Government is taking steps to
encourage the expansion of such schemes.
Loans to enable people to buy their houses by a system of instalment purchase
are available from various sources, including building societies, insurance
companies, industrial and provident societies and local authorities. The loca
authorities are expected to concentrate their resources on people with special
housing needs who are unable to obtain loans from other sources.
Building societies, of which there are about 630, are the most important ot
these agencies. They do not build houses themselves but provide long-term
loans on the security of property bought for owner-occupation Many are
now prepared to make advances of up to 95 per cent of the value of the houses
in certain cases. Loans are usually repayable over periods of up to 25 or even
<50 years, by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and interest, the
societies’ funds are derived mainly from investment of relatively modest sums
bv the general public. The Government has announced its intention ot intro¬
ducing a scheme to help people with small incomes to buy their dwellings on
mortgage. Under the scheme borrowers will have the option of either claiming
income tax relief on interest payments on their loan (as at present—a system
which helps people who pay a high rate of tax more than those who pay
little or none), or receive through the lending agency a Government subsidy
designed to reduce in effect the rate of interest they would be paying.
In England and Wales dwellings may be bought on freehold or leasehold
terms. This means roughly that a freeholder buys both the dwelling and the
land on which it stands (there are special provisions for flats) while the
purchaser of a building lease buys only the right to the use of the dwelling
for a stated period, and agrees to pay an annual ground rent to the owner of
the ground for the use of the land on which the dwelling stands at the end
of the period the ground landlord regains the use of the land and, therefore,
the ownership of the dwelling on it. Under the Government s proposals for
the reform of the leasehold system, leaseholders of an original long lease
(more than 21 years) who have occupied a house for at least five years may,
with some exceptions, buy the freehold compulsorily from the ground land¬
lord at site value plus any development value, or extend the lease for 50 years.
In certain of the exceptional cases—for example, where the landlord obtains
possession of the house before the end of the 50-year extension-the lease¬
holder would be compensated by the landlord for the leasehold interest.
The Housing Act 1961 authorised Exchequer loans to approved non-profit-
making housing associations for the building of houses to let at unsubsidised
rents. This provision was increased and extended by the Housing Act 1964
under which a Housing Corporation was set up to stimulate the formation o
housing societies. Building societies advance to a housing society two-thirds
of the cost of each approved housing scheme, the Corporation providing t e
remaining third. The housing societies build dwellings either to let at
unsubsidised rents or for co-ownership by a group of occupants. Co-owner¬
ship gives the occupants most of the advantages of house ownership at
a lower cost. The Corporation also has power to buy land for the housing
societies.
Improvement Private owners in England and Wales can obtain Exchequer assistance for
Grants and Loans the improvement of houses or conversion of large ^"^E^eqnS
for housing. Cash grants may be made by local authorities, with bxcnequer

at a cost of over £100 per dwelling. The grants may amount to half the cost,
with a maximum grant of ^400 for each dwelling or £500 if a house of three
or more storeys is converted.
Local authorities are obliged to make ‘standard grants’ for the provision
in houses built before 1945 of ^ bath, wash basin, water closet, hot-water
supply and food store; these cash grants cover half the cost of the work,
subject, normally, to a maximum grant of ^155 (^350 in certain circumstances),
or smaller sums if some of the five items already exist. Grant for the provision
of some of these facilities may be made where further improvement is not
practicable. Grants for improvements to houses owned by local authorities
are available from the Exchequer but on an annual basis over 20 years. The
Acts under which these improvement grants are available are the Housing
(Financial Provisions) Act 1958, the House Purchase and Housing Act 1959,
and the Housing Acts 1961 and 1964. From 1949 to March 1966 nearly
1 million grants had been made.
Improvement grants and standard grants are also provided in Scotland and
Northern Ireland with, in addition, provision for accommodation for farmers
and approved workers.
Local authorities also have power to make loans under the Housing Acts for
the acquisition, conversion, improvement, repair and alteration of houses.
Under the House Purchase and Housing Act 1959 they may make loans of up
to 100 per cent of the house’s value.
Control of Rents Rent control was originally introduced in 1915 as a temporary war-time
measure and successive Acts have varied its scope. Under the Rent Act 1957
there was a large measure of decontrol but the Rent Act 1965 re-introduced
control over most privately rented unfurnished dwellings—those of annual
rateable value up to £400 in London and £200 elsewhere. Tenants have a
wide degree of security of tenure and the rent may be fixed on application
by landlord or tenant. Rents are determined by locally appointed rent officers
or, failing agreement between the officer, landlord and tenant, by independent
rent assessment committees appointed by the minister concerned. Once
determined, the rent is not normally reviewed for at least three years. For
furnished premises under the rateable value limits a tenant may go to a rent
tribunal for determination of a reasonable rent and may be given security of
tenure for up to six months with a possibility of further periods if the
tribunal so decides. Eviction without a court order from furnished or
unfurnished premises of any rateable value and harassment of occupiers are
criminal offences with severe penalties.
Measures of control and de-control also apply in Northern Ireland. In 1951
legislation was passed which permitted prescribed increases in the rent of
controlled houses, provided that they were maintained in good repair; and
the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Rent Restriction Law (Amend¬
ment) Act (Northern Ireland) 1956 permitted an increase of one-third in the
rent levels fixed by the 1951 Act where the landlord had recently incurred
expenditure of a certain amount on repairs. The 1956 Act also released from
control houses with a net annual value of over £§0 (with certain safeguards)
and houses with a net annual value of over £26 of which the landlord was in
actual possession when the Act came into force, or of which he subsequently
obtained possession.
Slum Clearance About two million people have been rehoused since the mid-1950s as a result
of slum clearance programmes. It is expected that in about ten years’ time
the great majority of the housing authorities in Great Britain will have
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
succeeded in getting rid of all their present slums. In certain areas, however
particularly the older industrial towns, including Birmingham, Liverpool and
Manchester, three of the biggest cities in the country, the proportion of unfit
houses is so high that clearance may take much longer. Local authorities in
these areas are being given special help by the central departments to clear
their slums and to undertake major programmes of urban renewal. Their
housing programmes for the next few years have been doubled or trebled
compared with recent years and the ministers are making more building lan
available to them by the designation of new towns nearby.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists,
or can be provided by them, for people displaced from slum clearance areas.
Where an unfit house is demolished by order of the local authority and the
owner retains his land, he normally receives no compensation. If the local
authorities acquire an unfit property in order to demolish it themselves and to
rebuild on the land, the normal basis of compensation is the market value
of the house as it stands or the value of the site after clearance, whichever
is the less. In England, Wales and Scotland the slum clearance code provides
for special payments for condemned houses which have been well maintained
although inherently unfit and business occupiers may receive hardship
payments in certain cases. In Northern Ireland provision is made for pay¬
ments to owner-occupiers, business occupiers and for good maintenance
of older houses.

THE CHURCHES
is?
The Church of
England
Every person living in Britain possesses the right of religious freedom as
described in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: he
may change his religion at will, and may manifest his faith in teaching,
worship and observance without interference from the community or the
State. Churches and religious societies of all kinds may own property, conduct
schools, and propagate their beliefs in speech and in writing.
Freedom of conscience in religious matters was achieved gradually from
the seventeenth century onwards; in many cases relaxation in the adminis¬
tration of laws discriminating against minority religious groups preceded the
repeal of the legislation concerned. Heresy ceased to be a civil offence with
the passing of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677, and the Toleration
Act of 1688 granted freedom of worship to Protestant dissenters. In 1828
the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts freed nonconformists from
political disabilities and made it possible for them to be appointed to public
offices; Roman Catholics gained political emancipation under the Roman
Catholic Relief Act 1829; the Jewish Relief Act 1858 enabled Jews to become
members of Parliament; while religious tests that had been imposed on
prospective students and members of the academic staff of the universities
of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham were successively abolished by Acts of
1854, and 1871. Nowadays, there is no religious or denominational bar
to the holding of public office, except in the case of the Lord Chancellor,
where there is some doubt whether existing statutory provisions would permit
this office to be held by a Roman Catholic.
In the services administered by the State, such as the armed forces, the
national hospitals and the prisons, the clergy of the established Church of
England or the Church of Scotland provide the principle ministrations and
are paid a salary by the State for this part of their work. Priests of the Roman
Catholic Church and ministers of other denominations may also be appointed
or specially called in as required. Voluntary schools (see p. 151) provided by
churches of any religious denomination may be wholly or partly maintained
from public funds.
There is no precisely accurate or uniform method of assessing the number
of adherents to the various churches in the United Kingdom, since no inquiries
are made about religious beliefs in population censuses or other official
returns, and each church adopts different criteria in counting its members.
The membership figures given in the following sections should therefore be
taken as approximate.
The Church of England is the established church, and claims to be the
ancient catholic church of the land. At the Reformation in the sixteenth
century, it repudiated the supremacy of the Pope, but retained the historic
episcopate, and the creeds and sacraments upon which its doctrines are based;
therefore it claims to be both ‘catholic’ and ‘reformed’. Its form of worship
is embodied in the Book of Common Prayer, which was first compiled in 1549.
The Church is uniquely related to the Crown in that the Sovereign, who
must be a member of the Church of England, is called ‘Defender of the
Faith’ (a statutory title as protector of the Church) and promises on his or
188
Church
Organisation and
Government
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
her accession to uphold it. The coronation of the Sovereign is performed by
the Archbishop of Canterbury; prayers for the Sovereign and other members
of the royal family are said in all the statutory services of the Church; Church
of England archbishops, bishops and deans are appointed by the Sovereign on
the advice of the Prime Minister1; and all clergymen take the oath of
allegiance to the Crown.
The Church is also linked with the State through the House of Lords,
in which the archbishops of Canterbury and York and 24 senior diocesan
bishops have seats (see p. 32). This makes it possible for the views of
the Church leaders to be expressed freely on any moral issue raised in
connection with the corporate conduct of the State as well as on specifically
ecclesiastical issues—a matter of particular significance in view of the fact
that the clergy of the Church of England (together with those of the Church
of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church) are
legally disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons.
The Church is not free to change its form of worship, as laid down in the
Book of Common Prayer, without the consent of Parliament2; canons (Church
rules) cannot be made or amended without the consent of the Queen; and
the measures of the Church Assembly (as distinct from its regulations) also
require the Royal Assent.
The Church of England is organised by geographical areas into two provinces
and 43 dioceses. The Province of Canterbury contains 29 dioceses and that
of York 14. Each diocese is subdivided into ecclesiastical parishes, of which
there are about 14,400 in all. The Archbishop of Canterbury is Primate of
All England and bishop of his own diocese of Canterbury; the Archbishop of
York is styled Primate of England and is bishop of his own diocese of York.
The baptised membership of the Church is about 27! million, that is two-
thirds of the population born and resident in the two provinces but only about
45 per cent of this number is confirmed.
Spiritual authority in the Church rests with the bishops. The authoritative
bodies in matters of doctrine, belief and practice are the Convocations of
Canterbury and York, each presided over by its archbishop, and consisting
of an upper house of bishops, and a lower house of representatives of each
cathedral chapter, archdeacons and elected clergy. The Convocations meet
not oftener than three times a year.
The legislative and central administrative body of the Church is the
National Assembly of the Church of England, which is commonly called the
Church Assembly. It was set up in 1919 at the request of the two Convocations,
and was given power to legislate by measure by the Church of England
Assembly (Powers) Act 1919. It can discuss any matter connected with
the Church of England, but may not make any doctrinal statements, nor
infringe upon the rights of the Convocations. It consists of three houses:
bishops, clergy and laity. The first two houses are composed of the members
of the Convocations; the house of laity consists of men and women elected
every five years by the lay members of diocesan conferences, and the con¬
stitution allows for ten co-opted members.
1 The Church Assembly has appointed a commission to consider what constitutional
modifications are desirable and practicable in the present relationship between Church
and State.
2 The authorised Prayer Book remains that of 1662, but since the passing by the
Church Assembly of the Prayer Book (Alternative and Other Services) Measure 1965,
the Church may, through its Convocations and the House of Laity of the Church
Assembly, give authority for the experimental use of new forms.
THE CHURCHES
Church Finance

The Church Assembly usually meets three times a year. Measures, after
passing through various stages in the assembly, are presented to an ecclesias¬
tical committee of both Houses of Parliament, consisting of 30 members,
of whom 15 are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and 15 by the Speaker
of the House of Commons. This committee lays the measures, together with
a report upon them, before both Houses. If both Houses so resolve, the
measure is sent to the Sovereign for Royal Assent, after which it has the
same force and effect as an Act of Parliament. Parliament, though it may
reject a measure, has no power to amend it.
The Church Assembly is the centre of an administrative system consisting
of boards and councils dealing with various aspects of the Church’s work,
such as education, recruitment and training for the ministry,1 and Church work
at home and overseas. The Church Assembly, through the Schools Council
of its Board of Education, is responsible for some 7,100 Church of England
schools of all types, for approximately half of which the Church bears a
quarter of the cost of improvements, alterations and repairs.
Parochial church councils were set up in 1921 to associate the laity with
the government of the Church in the parish. The members of these councils
are appointed by the parochial electors, that is persons who are baptised, are
not members of any other church, are 17 years of age and over, and have
applied for membership of the electoral roll of the parish where they habitually
reside or worship. The estimated number on the parish electoral rolls is
about 2f million.
The Church of England has its own ecclesiastical courts. Their jurisdiction
today consists largely of faculty cases, with very occasional cases of discipline
against clergy, either for moral or ecclesiastical offences. A faculty is necessary
for any specific alteration or addition to the fabric or ornaments of a church
or to a churchyard.
There are 25 Church colleges of education in England and two in Wales,
all of which are run by independent governing bodies. With substantial
grants from the Department of Education and Science a major programme of
expansion, including the opening of two new colleges, has been taking place;
this has raised the total number of students in the colleges to over 13,000.
The cost to the Church, mainly from funds provided by the Church Assembly,
has been about £3 million.
The Church Assembly has also completed a programme of modernising
and improving theological colleges (of which there are 26) and establishments
for the training of women in the pastoral work of the Church, and has provided
grants for the greater part of the cost.
Each parish is responsible for its own finances, and also contributes an
annual apportioned quota to diocesan funds, and each diocese similarly
contributes to the Church Assembly. In the diocese, the financial authority
is the diocesan board of finance, which administers the money contributed
by the parishes, and acts as trustee on behalf of the parochial church councils,
which have only limited powers of holding property. The Central Board of
Finance administers the Church Assembly Fund, supported by diocesan
contributions, and devoted to the maintenance of central services, including
capital expenditure on training colleges and theological colleges and the
grants for training candidates for ordination.
1 A commission, consisting of not more than 20 members (bishops, clergy and laity) has
been appointed to study what reforms are necessary in the deployment and payment of
the clergy.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The State makes no payment direct to the Church as such, though it
pays for the services of chaplains in the armed forces and in prisons and
hospitals, and contributes substantially to the maintenance of Church schools
and training colleges.
The endowment income of the Church is mainly administered by the
Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for the payment of
clergy stipends (which average just over ^1,100 a year) and the provision of
finance for pensions, new churches, parsonage houses and, to a small extent,
Church schools. The total net income from the Commissioners’ investments
(nearly £20 million in 1965) has greatly increased during the past ten years;
in broad terms, this has meant a rise in the stipends of the poorer clergy and
that the Commissioners have been able to embark on schemes of assistance
for providing better parsonage houses, for Church buildings in new areas of
population, and for better pensions for clergy and their widows. The present
basic pension for a clergyman is £550 a year and £275 for a clergy widow.
Retired Church dignitaries receive larger pensions.
The Anglican Communion comprises 19 autonomous provinces in the United
Kingdom and overseas, with a total membership of over 40 million.
In the British Isles, in addition to the established Church of England,
there are unestablished Anglican Churches in Ireland, Scotland and Wales:
the Church of Ireland has 14 dioceses; the Episcopal Church in Scotland,
7 dioceses and some 98,000 members; and the Church in Wales, 6 dioceses
and some 165,500 Easter communicants.
The Lambeth Conference for unofficial consultation between all Anglican
bishops meets every ten years; it is presided over by the Archbishop of
Canterbury. The conference has no executive authority, but enjoys great
moral prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other
communions, and on the attitude of the Anglican Churches to political and
social questions are widely studied.
The Executive Officer of the Anglican Communion is the secretary of the
Anglican Advisory Council on Missionary Strategy, and exercises general
supervision on behalf of the consultative body of the Lambeth Conference
over all matters affecting the welfare of the Anglican Communion which
call for attention between the meetings of the conference.
The established church in Scotland is the presbyterian Church of Scotland.
It has been described as ‘the supreme example of a church which is
established and yet is free’. Its position, defined in the Treaty of Union
1707, was further safeguarded by the Church of Scotland Act 1921, under
which it has complete internal self-government within the terms of the
schedule to the Act, ‘Articles Declaratory of the Faith of the Church of
Scotland’.
Whereas in episcopacy church government is a hierarchy of persons, in
presbyterianism there is a hierarchy of courts. All ministers are of equal
status, and each of the 2,016 churches is governed locally by the Kirk Session,
consisting of the minister and elected elders (of whom there are about
48,000); above this is the Court of the Presbytery, then the Court of the
Synod, and finally the General Assembly, which meets annually and consists
of elected ministers and elders presided over by an elected Moderator who
serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the General Assembly
by the Lord High Commissioner. The Church of Scotland has complete
freedom in all spiritual matters and the right to appoint its own officers and

to decide all matters of doctrine and discipline. Its decisions are not subject
to parliamentary debate or modification.
The training for the ministry, which lasts at least six years, has given the
Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The membership of the Church of Scotland
is estimated at about 1,250,000.
The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is now commonly used to describe those churches
in England which were more generally known in the past as ‘nonconformist’
churches; and protestant churches in Scotland (except the established
Church of Scotland), Wales and Northern Ireland. The main Free Churches
are the Methodist, Baptist and Congregational Churches, and the unestablished
presbyterian churches throughout Britain. In addition, there are a number
of other protestant denominations in the United Kingdom as well as such
religious associations as the Society of Friends and the Salvation Army,
which have certain links with the main Free Churches.
The word ‘nonconformist’ signifies dissent from certain of the formularies
and practices of the established church. In general, the Free Churches base
their reason for existence on their distinctive convictions regarding organisation
and worship.
The largest of the Free Churches, the Methodist Church, which originated
in the eighteenth century following the evangelical revival by John Wesley,
took its present form in i932> with the union of the majority of separate
Methodist Churches. It has over 701,000 adult full members. The supreme
authority is the annual conference and the system of government is in many
ways presbyterian, the leaders’ meeting corresponding to the kirk sessions,
with circuit meetings and district synods resembling presbytery and synod.
One of the characteristics of Methodism is its strong emphasis on lay
leadership. There are some 24,100 trained lay preachers sharing the work of
about 4,150 ministers and preaching in many local churches.
Methodist Churches which did not join the union in 1932 include: the
Independent Methodists, in which ministerial service is on a purely voluntary
basis and women (many of whom are ministers) have full equality with men;
and the Wesleyan Reform Union (with some 5,500 members) which, while
retaining the essential Methodist doctrine, gives autonomy to each of its
157 individual churches.
The Congregationalists are the oldest community of dissenters in Britain.
In 1831 most of their churches were formed into the Congregational Union.
Local churches have formed county and national unions, whose secretariat
and assemblies have much influence, but no compulsive authority over them,
since great importance is attached to the autonomy of local church meetings.
Adult membership is approximately 198,000.
Like the Congregationalists, the Baptists are for the most part grouped
in associations of churches and the majority of these belong to the Baptist
Union formed in 1813. Baptists differ from Congregationalists in that they
practise the baptism of believers only; they do not baptise infants. The
Baptist Churches have about 300,900 members.
The Presbyterian Church in Ireland has a membership in Northern Ireland
of about 420,000. The Presbyterian (or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of
Wales, which arose from the revivalist movement led by Howell Harris in
1735, numbers some 125,200. The Presbyterian Church of England has nearly
192
Other
Denominations
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
69,000 members; its highest court is its general assembly; women are
admitted to the eldership and ministry.
Other presbyterian churches in Britain include: the Free Church o
Scotland; the United Free Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church
of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed
Presbyterian Church of Ireland; and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian
Church of Ireland.
Among other Protestant denominations in the United Kingdom are: the
Unitarian and Free Christian Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also
in the United States of America as Disciples of Christ), which have been an
organised community in Britain since early in the nineteenth century; the
British Province of the Moravian Church, which is an international missionary
church; the Free Church of England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which
was formed in 1844 as a direct result of the Oxford Movement; the Society
of Friends; and the Salvation Army.
The Society of Friends (Quakers) came into being in the middle ot the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox. A distinctive feature
is the way of worship: outward sacraments are not observed and there is no
separate ministry. The Society places great emphasis on work for peace, and
their influence in many parts of the world, especially in social reform and m t e
relief of suffering, is very wide in relation to their numbers. There are 441
Quaker Meetings in Britain and over 21,000 members; and the Society has
nine schools (the pupils and staff of which are not exclusively Quaker).
The Salvation Army, founded in 1865 (as the Christian Mission), is a
religious movement, composed of men and women who seek the spiritual
and social betterment of their fellows, primarily by preaching the gospel to
those hitherto untouched by religious effort. The movement, in which
military rather than ecclesiastical terminology is used, has branches all over
the world, and its social work (particularly that connected with the welfare of
members of the British armed forces serving overseas) is well supported.
The Christian Scientists, who are in no way connected with any other
church, have about 330 branch churches and societies in Britain.
The Roman The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became
Catholic Church temporarily extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the
Scottish hierarchy became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was
restored in 1878, while the Irish hierarchy never became completely extinct.
The normal government of the Roman Catholic Church, namely by territorial
archbishops and bishops, is once again the rule in the whole of the United
Kingdom. . , . , . , . .
The central territorial unit of the Roman Catholic hierarchical organisation
is the province or archdiocese under the metropolitan, who is always an
archbishop. The chairman of the bench of bishops in England and Wales is
the Archbishop of Westminster. A province normally comprises several
dioceses, each under a bishop aided by a chapter of canons and others, and
by priests in charge of the parishes into which the diocese is subdivided. In
England and Wales there are five provinces and archdioceses (Westminster,
Liverpool, Birmingham, Cardiff and Southwark), 14 dioceses, and nearly
2,300 parishes; in Scotland there are two provinces and archdioceses (St.
Andrews and Edinburgh, and Glasgow), six dioceses, and about 400 parishes;
in Northern Ireland there are six dioceses (several of which have territory
partly in the Irish Republic and partly in Northern Ireland since there is one
hierarchy for the whole of Ireland) and about 170 parishes. In the whole of
THE CHURCHES
Jewry
193
the United Kingdom there are some five million adherents (including children)
to the Roman Catholic faith.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education
of its children in their own faith, and requires that the children of marriages
between its own members and members of any other denomination should be
brought up as Roman Catholics. Many schools for Roman Catholic children
in the United Kingdom are staffed by members of the religious orders for
men and women, who also undertake other social work such as nursing,
child care, and the conduct of homes for the aged.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but were
expelled at the end of the thirteenth century by an edict of Edward I. The
present Anglo-Jewish community dates from 1656, the earliest arrivals being
the Sephardi (from Spain and Portugal). At the end of the seventeenth
century an Ashkenazi community (from Germany and East Europe) was
established, which increased rapidly and spread to the principal provincial
cities. As a result of the virtual destruction of whole Jewish communities on
the Continent during the second world war, the present Anglo-Jewish com¬
munity of some 450,000 is the largest group of Jews in Europe.
The Anglo-Jewish community is divided into two schools of thought,
each of which has its own form of worship and its own services: the Orthodox
(the original groups) and the Reform. The Reform Movement, which attaches
less religious importance to some of the ancient rituals and practices of the
Jewish faith, began in 1840. It was followed in 1901 by the establishment of
the Liberal Jewish Movement which, in addition, lays emphasis on the
re-interpretation of traditional Judaism in the light of modern thought and
custom. Of the Jews in Great Britain who belong to any kind of synagogue,
about 80 per cent are Orthodox. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest
group (Ashkenazi) within Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the
Sephardi group.
Synagogues in Britain number approximately 250. There has been an
increase in the number of Jewish denominational schools, which are now
attended by about one in seven Jewish children; other Jewish children attend
the ordinary State or independent schools and receive extra-curricular
instruction in the Jewish faith.
Other Religious
Communities
The Muslims
Many immigrants to Britain from overseas Commonwealth countries and
foreign countries have established centres for worship for their own communi¬
ties in the United Kingdom, and especially in London. The Christian
communities include the Greek, Russian, Polish and Serb Orthodox, with
some Estonian and Latvian Orthodox, and also the Armenian Church. There
are also churches belonging to the Lutheran Churches of Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Norway and Sweden, and centres where Estonian, Latvian and
Polish Lutherans worship according to their creed. In addition, the French,
Dutch, Swiss, Hungarian and Polish Reformed Churches are represented in
Britain, the first three having their own places of worship. There are also a
number of other religious sects of British or foreign origin; figures of
membership in Britain of most of them are not available.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews,
are the Muslims and the Buddhists.
The Muslims are the more widely represented, their number in Britain
being estimated at about 250,000, for whom over 90,000 are in London where
the London Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre, the Shiah Islamic
194

Assembly Centre and the East London Mosque are situated. The Shah
Jehan Mosque is at Woking, Surrey, and there are mosques or Islamic centres
in many of Britain’s larger cities.
There are several thousand adherents of Buddhism in Britain. The Buddhist
Society has its headquarters in London, with a Shrine Room; there are also
Shrine Rooms in the three Vihara in London, one of which is run by Thai
monks and supported by the Thai Government.
An outstanding feature of recent years has been the growth of co-operation
between the churches and a new stage in the development of Christian
fellowship between the churches of the Anglican Communion and the
Roman Catholic Church was marked by the encounter (in March 1966)
between Pope Paul VI and the Archbishop of Canterbury, at which it was
proposed to inaugurate a dialogue between the churches, aimed at removing
the causes of conflict and re-establishing unity.
The British Council of Churches, composed of official representatives
from almost all the churches of the British Isles, except the Roman Catholic
Church, and presided over by the Archbishop of Canterbury, facilitates
common action between the churches and seeks to further the cause of
Christian unity. In addition, most, though not all, of the Free Churches m
England and Wales are members of the Free Church Federal Council, the
aims of which are to promote unity and joint action between the Free Churches,
and to provide a channel through which the Free Churches can communicate
and negotiate with central and local government authorities as a united
body. The report of the conversations held during the past six years between
representatives of the Church of England and the Methodist Church visualised
union between the churches in two stages: the first to be a period of full
communion during which the two churches remain distinct, and the second to
be the achievement of organic union. Discussions on changes in organisation
to allow of closer relations have also been taking place between the Church
of England, the Church of Scotland, the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and
the Presbyterian Church of England.
The Archbishop of Canterbury is advised on these matters, both at home
and abroad, by the Missionary and Ecumenical Council and the Church of
England Council on Foreign Relations.
The Anglican, Presbyterian and Free Churches in the British Isles also
participate in the World Council of Churches, which was constituted at
Amsterdam, Netherlands, in 1948. The council links together 171 churches in
over 50 countries for co-operation in action and the study of common problems.
The Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding
between members of the two religions and deals with problems arising in the
social field.

PROMOTION OF THE
SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
THE PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
The Government is the main source of funds for scientific research as a
whole though private industry contributes a larger proportion of funds for
civil research. Considerable sums are also provided by public corporations,
independent trusts and foundations, and learned societies. The Government
also keeps under review facilities for training scientists and ensures that
adequate research is directed to matters of national interest.
THE PATTERN OF According to the latest triennial survey conducted by the Department of
EXPENDITURE Education and Science and published in the first report of the Council for
Scientific Policy (Cmnd. 3007) (see Bibliography p. 502) total expenditure on
research and development has risen from £300 million in 1955-56 to ^756-6
million in 1964-65; but as shown in Table 8 the proportion this represents
of the gross national product (2-6 per cent) has during the last three years
remained unchanged for the first time. The percentage of the total carried
out by government agencies has continued to decline, falling to 25-4 per cent
compared with 28-7 per cent nine years previously. This is due to a relative
drop in the proportion accounted for by defence. Research carried out in the
universities has risen from £14-4 million in 1955-56 to £55-9 million in
1964-65, and their proportion of the national total has risen from under
5 per cent to 7-4 per cent. The share performed by industry has remained
constant at about two-thirds, but the proportion financed by Government
has declined from 55 per cent in 1958-59 to 38-2 per cent in 1964-65. The
figures show that over the last triennial period the main growth areas have
been in the universities and in research financed privately by industry; and
that the rapid growth of research in universities has not been paralleled by
growth in other Government-financed programmes. The proportion of the
total spent by the research councils amounted to £43-7 million in 1964-65,
or 5-8 per cent of the total. It has been increasing by about 13 per cent a
year.
THE GOVERN¬
MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
Under the Science and Technology Act 1965 central responsibility for civil
science rests with the Secretary of State for Education and Science, who,
advised by a Council for Scientific Policy, is responsible for directing and
financing the research councils (see p. 196). Responsibility for technology
rests with the Minister of Technology, who is advised by an Advisory Council
on Technology (see p. 196). Other government departments continue to be
responsible for certain branches of research and development.
The Department The Department of Education and Science (see p. 51) is responsible, among
of Education other things, for the universities and civil science throughout Great Britain,
and Science The Department’s relations with the universities are conducted through the
University Grants Committee (see p. 161); and its responsibilities for civil

science are discharged mainly through the research councils, of which there
are at present five: the Science Research Council (see p. 202), the Medical
Research Council (see p. 205), the Agricultural Research Council (see p. 205),
the Natural Environment Research Council (see p. 209), and the Social
Science Research Council (see p. 210). Others may be established under the
terms of the Science and Technology Act. The Department also has, in
consultation with other departments, general governmental responsibility
for Britain’s scientific space research programme, which is co-ordinated by
the Science Research Council (see p. 208). The Department is responsible for
overseas scientific liaison, including the scientific attaches at overseas missions,
and for promoting more efficient handling and utilisation of scientific and
technical information. For the second purpose it has set up the Office for
Scientific and Technical Information, which is responsible for the National
Lending Library for Science and Technology and for grant-aid to Ashb
(see p. 211).
In the exercise of his responsibilities for the formulation and execution of
government scientific policy the Secretary of State for Education and Science
is advised by the Council for Scientific Policy (CSP), which replaced the
former Advisory Council on Scientific Policy. The Council, which was
appointed in January 1965, consists of a chairman and 13 other members;
unlike its predecessor the new Council is composed entirely of independent
members. There are, in addition, assessors from the research councils and
from the University Grants Committee. Among the issues with which the
Council is concerned is the balance of scientific effort in those areas for
which the Secretary of State is responsible.
The Ministry of Technology has the general responsibility of guiding and
stimulating a major national effort to bring advanced technology and new
processes into British industry. The methods employed include: an inten¬
sified use of research stations; civil development contracts; technical and
economic studies to identify industries or parts of industries suitable for
action; the use of procurement financed by Government in promoting
technological advance; and studies to enhance the status of the engineering
professions. . . ,
The Ministry has sponsorship responsibility for the mechanical and
electrical engineering industries as a whole, including the civil aircraft

manufacturing and shipbuilding industries, as well as for machine tools,
electronics, computers and telecommunications. The Ministry is responsible
for the Government grant-in-aid to the British Standards Institution, for
engineering standards and for determining standard weights and measures.
A Computer Advisory Service has been set up to which all proposals for
Government-financed computer purchases are referred. A National Computing
Centre has been established in Manchester to provide information about
computer programmes and to sponsor new ones.
The Ministry is responsible for ten research laboratories transferred from
the former Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in 1965 and
others transferred from the former Ministry of Aviation in 1966 (see p. 49).
It also gives financial aid to 48 co-operative industrial research associations. In
discharge of a responsibility under the Science and Technology Act 1965
to further the practical application of research, it maintains a regional service
and helps to finance industrial liaison officers centred on universities and
technical colleges throughout the country (see p. 212).
The Minister is responsible for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy
Authority (see p. 207), which he may require to undertake research and
development outside nuclear energy, and for the National Research
Development Corporation (see p. 212).
The Minister of Technology is chairman of the Advisory Council on Tech¬
nology, set up to advise on the application of advanced technology in British
industry. There is a deputy chairman and ten other members, representing
scientific, economic, trade union and industrial interests.
The Committee on Manpower Resources for Science and Technology,
established in February 1965, reports directly both to the Secretary of State
for Education and Science and to the Minister of Technology. It is concerned
with the total national resources of qualified scientific and technological
manpower and their effective employment. The Committee comprises 18
independent members, including the chairman, chosen for their wide experi¬
ence in educational and industrial matters, as well as departmental
representatives.
A number of other government departments remain responsible for certain
branches of research.
The Ministry of Transport is concerned with research into road construction,
safety and traffic flow (see p. 354), most of the basic work being carried out
by the Road Research Laboratory, at Crowthorne, Berkshire, and by the
Ministry of Defence. Research on radio aids for marine navigation is under¬
taken by the Ministry of Defence, which is also responsible for inter-Service
electronic valve research at the Services Electronics Research Laboratory.
The Government’s programme of research on marine nuclear propulsion is
undertaken by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
The Ministry of Technology is expected to share with the Ministry of
Defence responsibilities for aviation research carried on in such establishments
of the former Ministry of Aviation as the Royal Aircraft Establishment at
Farnborough and Bedford, the National Gas Turbine Establishment at
Farnborough and the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern. Some fundamental
research is carried out for the Ministries by universities and industrial
organisations. The Ministers are advised by an Aeronautical Research Council
and an Electronics Research Council.

The Ministry of Power is responsible for research into safety and health of
mineworkers. The coal, electricity and gas industries are required to settle
their general programmes of research in consultation with the Minister, who
is assisted by an Advisory Council on Research and Development.
The Ministry of Defence finances the Meteorological Office, which is
responsible for research in meteorology and geophysics, mainly for civil
purposes. The headquarters of the Office and most of its research sections are
at Bracknell, Berkshire. The Ministry also makes grants for fundamental
meteorological research carried out under the auspices of the Royal Society
or in university departments.
The Ministry of Housing and Local Government deals with geographical,
geological, economic and sociological research relating to the use and
development of land in England and Wales. Similar arrangements are made
in Scotland by the Scottish Home and Health Department, and in Northern
Ireland by the Ministry of Development. A Centre for Environment Studies
is being set up as an independent educational trust for research to support
such tasks as re-shaping towns, building new cities and dealing with the
effects of a fast-growing mobile population.
The Post Office Engineering Department undertakes research and develop¬
ment on many aspects of communications, both in its own laboratories and
in close association with industry, the universities and other government
departments. The Department’s main research station is at Dollis Hill,
London, and there are laboratories at Backwell, near Bristol, and at Castleton,
near Cardiff.
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, founded in 1759 and now administered
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has the largest collection
of living plants in the world. Its three research departments are: the
Herbarium, concerned primarily with the classification and accurate
determination of plants; the Jodrell Laboratory, for the study of plant
anatomy and plant physiology, cytology and genetics; and the Museum of
Economic Botany, dealing with the economic exploitation of plants. The
library, attached to the herbarium, was founded in 1853; it consists of more
than 55,000 botanical books, about 80,000 reprints and separately issued
items and a collection of over 150,000 drawings and paintings of plants. In
1964 the 400-acre estate known as Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, Sussex, was
taken over by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The Royal Botanic Garden,
Edinburgh, founded about 1660, is administered by the Ministry of Public
Building and Works.
The Parliamentary and Scientific Committee was founded in 1939 to replace
the former Parliamentary Science Committee to provide for a regular exchange
of information between members of Parliament and scientists. It is one of a
number of unofficial all-party parliamentary groups which have grown up
spontaneously and have varying degrees of influence. Membership is open to
members of Parliament of any party in both Houses, and also to nominated
representatives of such non-profit-making scientific and technological
organisations in Britain as may be affiliated under its constitution.
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies have retained their traditional function of facilitating the spread of
scientific knowledge. At present there are over 200 of them in Britain with
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS
Royal Society
199
approximately 400 scientific publications. There are also numerous technical
institutions and professional associations, many of which are playing a
distinguished part in promoting their own branches of science or are
interested in the education and professional well-being of their members.
Prominent examples of these are the British Medical Association, the Institutions
of Civil Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Chemical
Engineers, Metallurgists, the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of
Physics and the Physical Society and the Institute of Biology.
The most eminent of the learned societies concerned with science in its
broadest aspects (as distinct from those societies with specialised interests
and activities) are the Royal Society, Royal Society of Arts, Royal Institution
and British Association.
The Royal Society, or more fully, the Royal Society of London for the
Improvement of Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique
place in the country’s scientific affairs and corresponds to national academies
of science in other countries. Election to it is regarded by scientists as a high
honour. The Queen is Patron. There are today three main categories of
Fellowship: Royal Fellows, comprising the Queen Mother and three Royal
Dukes; Foreign Members, of whom there are about 70, and the main body
of Fellows numbering about 690. Election to the Fellowship, which is for
life, was for many years restricted to 25 persons a year and the foreign
membership to four a year but in 1965 the former was increased to 32 with
the intention of awarding some of the new places to applied scientists in
both the physical and biological sciences. The Society is governed by a
council of 21 members.
Its present activities include the holding of scientific meetings; publication
of research work, mainly in the Philosophical Transactions and the Proceedings',
the presentation of medals; the giving of endowed lectures; and the award of
research appointments and grants. Among its research appointments are the
Foulerton, Wolfson and Sir Henry Dale Research Professorships and eight
other research professorships supported by parliamentary grant-in-aid. The
highest medal awarded is the Copley Medal, for which scientists from all
countries are eligible; there are also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford,
Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester, Hughes and Leverhulme Medals. There are
five lectureships: the Croonian (biology); the Bakerian (physical sciences);
the Ferrier (nervous system); the Wilkins (history of science); and the
Leeuwenhoek (microbiology). The Society has set up committees, some of
them jointly with other bodies, to promote improvements in education in
science and to emphasise the importance of applied sciences, especially
engineering.
Although an independent private corporation, the Society has always had
a special relationship with the Government, which provides its accommoda¬
tion and makes grants for research activities administered by it. The President
of the Society is consulted on scientific appointments to government research
councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory councils and
committees concerned with research.
The Society represents the United Kingdom in the international unions
comprising the International Council of Scientific Unions and appoints
national committees for each of them. It also plays a leading part in inter¬
national scientific programmes such as the International Geophysical Year
(I957~5S)> ^ International Years of the Quiet Sun (1964-65) and the
Internationa] Biological Programme (1965-70).

The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encourage¬
ment of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) has a character at once scientific,
artistic, technical, industrial and commercial. Since its foundation in 1754,
however, one of the Society’s principal objects has been to promote the progress
and application to useful ends of all departments of science. Today it fulfils
this purpose chiefly by disseminating new scientific knowledge. The Society
regularly holds meetings for the delivery of lectures, and publishes a monthly
Journal, thus providing effective media for the exposition and assessment by
leading authorities of developments which have a public as well as a specialist
interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating
the introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for
teaching the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the
‘promotion of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving
arts and manufactures’, and 'the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge .
Its character, however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry
Davy and Michael Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today,
the Royal Institution has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are
given on recent developments in science and other branches of knowledge.
Its library of some 60,000 books includes many early scientific works and
manuscripts.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the Annual Meeting, attended by many young students as well
as by eminent scientists. In addition the Association plans special lectures,
exhibitions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publica¬
tion of pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study
groups and liaison with the press and with sound and television broadcasting
services. The Association has area committees and three lectureships for young
scientists—the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing
respectively with the physical, biological and sociological sciences to
encourage scientists to make their activities known to wider audiences. The
British Association has an organised relationship with over 150 scientific
bodies and learned societies. It has also played an important part in the
development of science by taking or recommending action to remove obstacles
to the discovery and application of scientific knowledge.
In 1964-65 the total estimated university expenditure on research was about
£55-9 million. The largest government contribution was through the Univer¬
sity Grants Committee (UGC) (see p. 161).
Scientific research in the universities is also supported from the Exchequer
through the Department of Education and Science. This support takes two
forms. Firstly, about half the postgraduate students in science and technology
in the universities receive maintenance awards from the research councils,
through postgraduate scholarships, studentships or fellowships. These awards
are in some cases for periods of up to three years for training in research work
and in others for shorter periods for advanced studies. The cost of these
studentships is currently of the order of £3 million a year. Secondly, grants are
given to the universities by the research councils for specific projects,
particularly in new or developing fields of research. In recent years the
research councils, in addition to making grants of this kind, have made funds

available for expensive items of university equipment required for specific
programmes of research. The research councils’ support for research in the
universities, excluding expenditure by the Medical Research Council and
the Agricultural Research Council on their own research units within the
universities (which remain under the control of, and are wholly financed by,
the councils themselves), amounted in 1965-66 to over £14 million.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations. The contributions from sources other than the
University Grants Committee amount to nearly a third of the total university
expenditure on research.
In addition to the universities, colleges of advanced technology in England
and Wales, which are acquiring the status and title of universities, and central
institutions in Scotland are playing an increasing part in scientific and
technological research and development. These colleges and institutions are
financed by the education departments but are now making a growing
demand on the support for research provided by the research councils.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding
reputations in studies relating to their local industries. The tendency is
increasing although the industries in most districts are becoming more and
increasingly diversified.
All universities and university colleges in the United Kingdom have labora¬
tories or research departments.1 The government research councils provide
grants for research projects in universities and award studentships for
postgraduate training in science and technology, as well as post-doctoral
research fellowships; the Ministry of Technology and the National Research
Development Corporation (see p. 212) award development contracts to
university departments; and leading firms in such industries as chemicals,
oil, motor vehicles, textiles, electrical equipment, food manufacture, and
mining provide grants for specific research projects or endow research
fellowships, such as the Imperial Chemical Industries and Leverhulme
Fellowships, or professorships. Foundations which provide similar bene¬
factions include the Nuffield Foundation,2 the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie
Trust, the Wellcome Trust and Courtaulds’ Scientific and Educational
Trust Fund. Among individuals whose major contributions to universities
have included provision for research facilities have been Lord Nuffield, with
gifts to the Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford, Lord Austin, who provided new
buildings for the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, members of the Wills
family, who financed the Physics Laboratory at Bristol, members of the Boot
family at Nottingham and of the Brotherton family at Leeds.
The Ministry of Technology’s industrial liaison officers (see p. 212) are
based on universities or technical colleges.
In 1961 there were, according to a sample enquiry at the population census,
287,610 people in Great Britain with scientific and technological qualifications
(136,520 scientists and 151,090 engineers and technologists). On the basis of
1 The many topics under investigation in these laboratories and in those of the major
technical colleges are listed in Scientific Research in British Universities and Colleges
(see Bibliography).
2 The Nuffield Foundation was established by Lord Nuffield in 1943 for a variety of
social, charitable and other purposes. Prominent among the Foundation’s many
activities is the promotion of medical, scientific and social research.

a survey made in 1956 the then Committee on Scientific Manpower of the
former Advisory Council on Scientific Policy estimated that the number of
scientists and engineers qualifying annually would need to be raised from
10,000 in 1956 to 20,000 between 1966 and 1971. The Government accepted
this figure as a reasonable goal and supported measures to ensure that the
universities and technical colleges together would be able to produce at least
this number. In 1962 the Committee forecast an annual growth rate in these
figures of 4-8 per cent in the period 1962-65. It also forecast a shortage of
mathematicians, electrical and mechanical engineers and physicists.
The emigration of scientists, though a matter of concern to a country such
as Britain, whose economy relies increasingly on science-based industries, is
no new phenomenon and is common to all advanced countries. In 1964 about
7,000 are estimated to have emigrated and there were 4,500 immigrants.
Many of the emigrants leave to continue studies or research and a significant
proportion return later.
The Science Research Council (SRC), which came into formal existence on
1 st April 1965 and consists of a chairman and 11 other members, covers
all branches of fundamental science other than those for which the other
research councils are responsible. It supports research in engineering and
technology in the universities. Provision is made for it to carry out research and
development through its own establishments; to encourage and support
similar research by any other person or body; to provide and operate equip¬
ment for common use by universities, technical colleges and similar
institutions; to make grants for postgraduate studies; and to disseminate
knowledge of science and technology. Its own establishments include the
Royal Greenwich Observatory, Herstmonceux, the Royal Observatory,
Edinburgh, the Radio and Space Research Station, the Rutherford High
Energy Laboratory, the Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory and the
Atlas Computer Laboratory (see p. 208). The SRC also co-ordinates the
British scientific space research programme and supports the European
Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and the European Space Research
Organisation (ESRO) (see also pp. 209 and 212).
The greater part of industrial research in Britain is undertaken in the research
organisations of the larger firms. Industrial research organisations vary
widely between the largest firms employing thousands of qualified start
and some employing very few; though the emphasis is on commercial
development, some fundamental research is done. Other mam agencies are
government laboratories, universities and technical colleges, industrial
research associations, independent institutes for sponsored research an
consultant laboratories.
The Ministry of Technology is responsible for the following research stations.
The Building Research Station near Watford, Hertfordshire, is concerned
with the techniques of building design and construction, and the organisation,
productivity, and economics of building work. The Joint Fire Research
Organisation, controlled jointly with the Fire Offices’ Committee, is concerne
with the detection, suppression, and inhibition of fires and the safety of life
and property in fires. The Forest Products Research Laboratory at Princes
Risborough, 36 miles west of London, studies the mechanical, physical and
chemical properties of home-grown and imported timber. The Hydraulics
Research Station at Wallingford, on the River Thames, studies problems o

water flow in open channels such as rivers, estuaries and harbours, and
coastal erosion. The Laboratory of the Government Chemist in London has
a statutory function as official referee in cases under the Food and Drugs
Acts when the results of chemical analysis are disputed, and carries out analy¬
tical and advisory work for government departments on request. The National
Engineering Laboratory at East Kilbride, south of Glasgow, carries out
research in mechanical engineering to help industry in developing new designs
and improving production processes. It has unique facilities for making
precision engineering measurements for testing hydraulic machinery and for
developing computer programmes for numerically controlled machine tools.
The National Physical Laboratory at Teddington, near London, conducts
research in various branches of non-nuclear physics and maintains British
primary standards and physical units and includes the former National
Chemical Laboratory, concentrating on basic chemical research applicable
to a wide variety of industries. The Torry Research Station at Aberdeen
(with a branch laboratory at Hull) investigates problems arising in the handling,
processing, and transport and storage of fish. The Warren Spring Laboratory
near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, provides facilities for research and develop¬
ment, including pilot-scale work on subjects of national importance in chemical
engineering and mineral processing. It is also concerned with the technolo¬
gical problems of atmospheric pollution. It also compiles the official British
register of research in human sciences (see p. 502). The Water Pollution
Research Laboratory at Stevenage carries out research on the methods of
treatment of sewage and industrial effluents and on the effects of pollution
of surface and coastal waters.
In addition, on the dissolution of the Ministry of Aviation in 1966, the
Ministry of Technology became responsible for some of its former establish¬
ments concerned with civil research.
The scheme by which the Government gives financial help to groups of firms
with similar interests to form organisations known as research associations, to
carry out industrial research co-operatively, was started in 1917 and is now
operated by the Ministry of Technology. At the end of 1965 there were 48
such associations, with a combined income of £12-4 million (compared with
£5-1 million in 1955), of which a little less than a quarter was contributed
by the Government. Suitably specialised associations are now available for
about 70 per cent of British industry, varying in size from the British Iron
and Steel Research Association (BISRA) with an annual income of j£i-6
million, of which nearly .£190,000 is provided by government grant, to the
British Brush Manufacturers Research Association with an income of only
£14,900. The largest are those dealing with iron and steel, ships, production
engineering, coal utilisation, the electricity industry, cotton and man-made
fibres, welding and wool. (Particulars of these and other associations are given
in the relevant sections of Chapter 11, Industry.) The amounts of the govern¬
ment grants are related to the contributions made by the industries concerned.
The research associations are autonomous bodies governed by their own
councils, the members of which are mostly representatives of industry,
although the Ministry of Technology is also represented. The councils are
advised in preparing research programmes, for which they have complete
responsibility, by research committees representative of their industrial
members, often with the addition of university or government scientists.
The Ministry of Technology appoints two Visitors for each association:
normally one is a scientist and the other an industrialist—both of some

eminence. Nearly all research associations admit to membership manufac¬
turers in Commonwealth countries and many also admit those in foreign
countries. The associations make the results of their work known to member
firms by a variety of methods, among which are bulletins, technical reports,
lectures, films, training classes, exhibitions and mobile demonstration units.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations (see Chapter n), in particular those con¬
cerned with fuel and power and transport. They also give support to organi¬
sations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
According to the report of the former Advisory Council on Scientific Policy
(see p. 196) total expenditure on research and development by the different
industrial sectors in 1961-62 (excluding establishments of less than 100
employees) was as follows (in £ million): aircraft 140-6; electronics 49‘9»
chemicals and allied industries 39-7; electrical engineering 36-2; mechanical
and marine engineering and shipbuilding 33'7> manufacture 10, motor
vehicles, locomotives, etc., 9-8; scientific instruments 9-2; textiles, leather,
etc., 8-7; food, drink and tobacco 7-1; mineral oil refining 6; construction
1-5; other manufacturing industries 13-5-
These figures include funds from government sources. But firms in many
science-based industries such as the chemical, pharmaceutical, electrical and
electronic equipment, oil refining, steel, vehicles and instruments, commit large
private funds to research and development in the normal course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying
problems which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
In these institutes research organised by private firms can be carried out
confidentially, so that the results remain the property of the sponsor.
Among British institutes of this type are: Fulmer Research Institute, Stoke
Poges, Buckinghamshire, which is now owned by the Institute of Physics
and the Physical Society, concentrates on metallurgy and allied subjects;
Sondes Place Research Institute, Dorking, Surrey, which is concerned mainly
with chemistry, chemical engineering and mechanical engineering; Arthur D.
Little Research Institute, Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, a British institute
working in close collaboration with a well-known American institute with a
similar name; the International Research and Development Company at
Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne; and the United Power Company at Heston,
near London. There are also consultant laboratories such as Cambridge
Consultants.
A Medical Research Committee was appointed in 1913 to administer the
research funds provided under the National Health Insurance Act 1911. In 1920
the Committee was superseded by the Medical Research Council (MRC),
established under Royal Charter and supported by a grant-in-aid provided by
Parliament, now through the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
In addition to financing the Medical Research Council, the Government
gives substantial support to medical research through block grants to
universities distributed through the University Grants Committee; and to
clinical research through the National Health Service. Certain government-
financed research for defence purposes, for example at the Microbiological
Establishment at Porton, Wiltshire, has civil applications related to medical
science.

Important contributions to the support of research in particular subjects
are made by private industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry, and by
private charities or fund raising organisations, such as the Nuffield Foundation
and the British Empire Cancer Campaign.
The Medical Research Council (MRC) is responsible to the Secretary of State
for Education and Science. There are 12 members of the Council, nine of
whom, representing different branches of medical knowledge and the funda¬
mental sciences on which these are based, are appointed after consultation
with the President of the Royal Society and with the Council itself; on
retirement, these scientific members are not eligible for immediate reappoint¬
ment. Three are lay members, one of whom must be a member of the House
of Lords and one a member of the House of Commons.
The MRC’s chief function is to promote research into all aspects of health
and disease. In planning and carrying out its research programme, the Council
is assisted by special committees appointed to advise on particular subjects.
Three of the more important of these are the Clinical Research Board, set
up in consultation with the health departments to assist the development of
clinical research; the Tropical Medicine Research Board, appointed in
consultation with the Ministry of Overseas Development, to advise on the
promotion and co-ordination of research in this field; and the Biological
Research Board, which advises on the promotion of research in the non-
clinical field. The Council’s arrangements for the support of research fall
under four main headings: (1) investigations by members of its scientific staff,
mostly working in its own research establishments; (2) temporary grants to
research workers in universities and elsewhere; (3) long-term grants in
support of specific research programmes in university medical departments
(‘research groups’); and (4) research fellowships and scholarships for tenure
both at home and abroad. The programme includes fundamental studies of
the structure and natural processes of the body; clinical and laboratory
studies of disease; the development and evaluation of special methods of
treatment and also of prophylaxis and diagnosis; and the study of social
and occupational factors affecting health and the efficiency of body and
mind.
The National Institute for Medical Research, at Mill Hill and Hampstead,
London, is the Council’s main research establishment; in addition, there are
about 80 smaller establishments, generally known as research units, which
are attached in most cases to universities and hospitals in the United Kingdom.
By 1968 it is hoped that the first phase of the Clinical Research Centre being
built at Northwick Park in north-west London as an integral part of the new
district hospital for the North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board
will be ready. The Centre will be the clinical counterpart of the National
Institute for Medical Research.
The Council also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support
from funds made available through the Ministry of Overseas Development,
maintains laboratories in the Gambia and units in Uganda and Jamaica.
Agricultural research is carried out by the Agricultural Research Council,
the Government agricultural departments and by private industry.
The Agricultural Research Council (ARC), established in 1931, consists of 18
members, including representatives of the agricultural departments. In
addition to distinguished scientists, the membership includes men with
206

practical farming experience. The Council is under the general oversight of the
Secretary of State for Education and Science.
The Council is responsible for 14 independent state-aided agricultural
research institutes and also has ten institutes under its direct control and
14 units which it has established under distinguished scientists associated
with universities. In addition there are eight independent institutes in
Scotland financed by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for
Scotland with advice from the Council on their scientific programmes,
staffing and equipment.
The Council makes special research grants to support promising new lines
of work in university departments. It awards research fellowships to enable
research workers of exceptional promise to undertake independent research
and also a limited number of postgraduate training awards for those wishing
to undertake a career in veterinary research.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which has a Scientific
Advisory Panel, established in 1965, carries out applied research in its own
veterinary laboratories at Weybridge, Surrey, and at Lasswade, Midlothian,
and also at its plant pathology laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire;
while at its infestation control laboratory at Tolworth, Surrey (with a field
station at Worplesdon), it co-ordinates work on the control of insect pests
of stored food and conducts research on the control of harmful mammals
and birds. The Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge has been
appointed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the third international
laboratory for biological students. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of
Agriculture is responsible for the promotion of agricultural research and
research divisions dealing with a variety of aspects have been established.
The Ministry maintains four laboratories for marine, shell-fish and salmon
and freshwater fisheries research, and four marine research vessels. The
Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland maintains a marine
research laboratory and five research ships at Aberdeen, and a freshwater
fisheries research laboratory at Pitlochry.
With the guidance of the Chief Scientific Adviser (Food), the Food Science
and Plant Health Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
is responsible for formulating the Ministry’s general policy on the acquisition
and dissemination of scientific and technical information about food and the
food handling and processing industry; for furnishing scientific advice to the
other divisions of the Ministry; and for sponsoring or carrying out experi¬
mental work. The division has its own experimental laboratories in London
and Norwich. The Food Research Advisory Committee, appointed by the
agricultural ministers, advises on food problems requiring investigation or
research which should be undertaken with the aid of public funds.
The Forestry Commission undertakes experimental work relating to
silvicultural and allied problems (see p. 335)' means °f grants, it also aids
forest research work undertaken by various universities and other institutions,
including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford.
The Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), set up under the Atomic Energy
Authority Act 1954, is responsible for research and development in nuclear
energy. It is answerable to the Minister of Technology, who is responsible
under the Atomic Energy Acts 1946 to 1949 for promoting and controlling
the development of atomic energy and ensuring that the proper degrees of
importance are attached to its various applications. The Authority has a

large programme of research into, and development of, the peaceful applica¬
tions of nuclear energy. As an essential part of the British Government’s
nuclear power programme, the Authority develops new types of nuclear
power stations to the stage at which they can be adopted for the generation of
electric power on a commercial scale and for this purpose it builds and operates
experimental and prototype nuclear reactors. Construction and operation
of the nuclear power stations themselves is the responsibility of the Central
Electricity Generating Board and the South of Scotland Electricity Board.
The Secretary of State for Defence became responsible for the development
and production of nuclear weapons for the Services in 1966; in practice,
however, the AEA produces the explosive nuclear material and assemblies for
nuclear weapons under contract and carries out weapon research.
The Department of Education and Science and the AEA collaborate with
a number of other government departments and with the Radiological
Protection Service on various aspects of health and safety in relation to atomic
energy. Expert advice on radiation hazards is provided by the Medical and
Agricultural Research Councils and by the Radioactive Substances Advisory
Committee, appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and Science.
This committee advises ministers on regulatory aspects of safety measures in
the use of radioactive substances and apparatus producing radiation.
The Ministry of Technology and the Authority are jointly responsible for
co-operation with other countries in the atomic energy field. This is accom¬
plished partly through the medium of bilateral agreements with a large number
of individual countries and partly through British membership of the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Nuclear Energy
Agency.
The Atomic Energy Authority, the members of which are appointed by the
Minister of Technology, consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman and up to
14 other members, some of whom may be part time.
The Authority, like other statutory public corporations, is free from day-
to-day government control (subject to the power given to the responsible
minister to issue directions to the Authority in matters of overriding national
importance), but differs from them in that most of its revenue is derived from
money voted by Parliament. The commercial activities of the AEA have
been separated from its other functions and are now financed through a
trading fund with an initial capital of about £37 million. Under the Science
and Technology Act 1965 the functions of the Authority have been extended
so that the Minister may, after consultation, require it to undertake research
and development outside nuclear energy. It has also submitted a tender for
a nuclear power station overseas as a prime contractor, and is a member of the
British Nuclear Export Executive established in June 1966.
The organisation has a London office, responsible for central financial and
administrative matters and for procuring raw materials. It also has a Radio¬
chemical Centre at Amersham which produces and markets radioisotopes.
The rest of its establishments are divided into five groups.
The Research Group’s principal establishment is the Atomic Energy
Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell. Others are the Wantage Research
Laboratory, which does research into new and improved uses of radioisotopes
and an establishment for research into plasma physics and controlled thermo¬
nuclear fusion at Culham. Harwell also runs an isotope school at Wantage,
and a postgraduate education centre, which provide training for home and
overseas students.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Weapons Group, centred on Aldermaston, conducts research on and
development of nuclear weapons and other research work with civil, as well
as defence, applications. It has outstations at Foulness and Orfordness in
eastern England.
There are three groups with headquarters at Risley, in north-western
England. The Reactor Group works on the design and development of
reactors. It is responsible for the prototype Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor
(AGR) at Windscale, which has been operating successfully since February
1963 and which formed the basis of the design chosen for the first nuclear
power station in Britain’s second nuclear power programme (see p. 289).
The Group also includes the Atomic Energy Establishment at Winfrith,
Dorset, where work on a wide range of reactor types is carried out. A prototype
Steam Generating Heavy Water (SGHW) reactor, with an electrical output
of 100 MW, is being constructed there and a number of experimental
reactors of different types have been in operation for some time. It is also
the location of the Dragon project, a 20 MW (thermal) reactor financed jointly
by the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), including members of the European Atomic Energy
Community (Euratom). The Reactor Group also includes the Dounreay
experimental reactor establishment in the north of Scotland, which houses
a materials-testing reactor and an experimental fast-breeder reactor. This has
led to the design of a prototype fast reactor station of 250 MW which is also
being built at Dounreay. The Group has research laboratories at the main
establishments of the Production Group, which is responsible for the operation
of factories producing and reprocessing fissile material at Windscale (Cumber¬
land), Capenhurst (Cheshire) and Springfields (Lancashire) and the nuclear
power plants at Calder Hall (Cumberland) and Chapelcross (Dumfries), and
for the Calder Operations School. The work of this group is now mainly
commercial; it not only supplies all the nuclear fuel for the British nuclear
power stations which form Britain’s first nuclear power programme, but is
also supplying fuel for similar power stations in Japan and Italy. The Group
has also attracted large overseas orders for the reprocessing of nuclear fuel.
The third group with headquarters at Risley is the Engineering Group,
responsible for the construction of plant, works and buildings, and for the
design and inspection of fuel elements for production purposes.
High Energy
Physics
The provision of expensive facilities for research in high energy physics is
the function of the Science Research Council (see p. 202). The SRC estab¬
lishments concerned are the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory, Chilton,
which houses a 7,000 million electron volt (MeV) proton synchrotron (particle
accelerator), completed in 19635 the Daresbury Nuclear Physics Laboratory,
Cheshire, which is to house a 4,000 MeV synchrotron; and the Atlas Computer
Laboratory, Chilton, which is also used for other scientific work.
SPACE RESEARCH Government responsibility for space research is divided between the Secretary
of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for Defence, the
Minister of Technology and the Postmaster General. Total expenditure on
space research activities in 1965-66 is estimated at about ^22 million. The
civil scientific space research programme, on which some £3 million a year is
spent, is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education and Science,
and its execution is in the hands of scientists in universities and government
research establishments, under the general supervision of the Space Research
Management Unit of the Science Research Council. The Royal Society
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 2CX)
represents Britain in non-governmental international scientific groups such as
the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) of the International Council
of Scientific Unions (ICSU). In addition to its own national rocket pro¬
gramme, Britain is co-operating with the United States in a programme which
includes the launching of the Ariel series of satellites and the incorporation of
British experiments in US satellites.
Private industry develops and provides much of the equipment and materials
needed in space research; for instance, the third Anglo-American artificial
earth satellite, UK-3, and the upper atmosphere Skylark rockets are being
made by private industry. Two organisations in which Britain is playing a
leading part have been set up to give European countries the opportunity to
participate more fully in space research and technology—the European Space
Research Organisation (ESRO) and the European Launcher Development
Organisation (ELDO). The first stage of the planned ELDO satellite launcher
will be provided by the British Blue Streak rocket, which had its first live
firing in 1964 from the Woomera range in Australia. The SRC provides the
United Kingdom contribution to ESRO.
The satellite prediction centre at Slough, attached to the Radio and Space
Research Station, also the home of one of the three World Data Centres for
space research, co-ordinates optical and radio tracking activities in Britain.
Optical observation of satellites is carried out regularly by many individual
observers in the British Isles and by the Royal Edinburgh Observatory’s
outstation (see below), radio tracking is undertaken at the Radio and Space
Research Station itself and by radio telescopes at Jodrell Bank and the Royal
Radar Establishment at Malvern. The Royal Aircraft Establishment at
Farnborough is carrying out a programme of basic satellite technology and has
undertaken a design study for a communications satellite. The General Post
Office undertakes research work connected with experiments in satellite com¬
munications. Under two inter-related international agreements reached in July
1964, in Washington, Britain is taking part in a world-wide satellite communica¬
tions system together with the United States, European and other countries.

Large optical telescopes were first constructed in Britain by Herschel and
Rosse in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The facilities at the Royal
Observatories have been augmented; further improvements will be made at
Herstmonceux when the 98-inch Isaac Newton telescope is completed.
Grants to the Radcliffe Trustees have enabled British optical astronomers to
have continued access to the 74-inch telescope at the Radcliffe Observatory
in South Africa for observations in the southern skies. The Royal Edinburgh
Observatory has been re-equipped with modern instrumentation for use in
stellar spectroscopy and photometry.
Radio astronomy, developed since 1931, is carried out mainly at Cambridge
University, at the Jodrell Bank Experimental Station of Manchester University
at Cheshire, and at the Royal Radar Establishment at Malvern. A Radio
Astronomy Planning Committee, set up in December 1961 to advise on the
nature and extent of Britain’s radio astronomy research programme, both
nationally and internationally, recommended that £4 million should be spent
in support of increased facilities for radio astronomy in Britain, which
occupies a pre-eminent position in this subject.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), which was established
in June 1965, supports research in earth sciences and ecology. It has taken
over the Nature Conservancy, the Geological Survey and Museum (with

the Ministry of Overseas Development to form a new Institute of Geological
Sciences), the Hydrology Research Unit, the National Institute of Ocean¬
ography, and the functions of the Development Commission in relation to
marine and freshwater biology and fishery research.
The Nature Conservancy was set up in 1949. Its functions are to provide
scientific advice on the conservation and control of the natural flora and
fauna of Great Britain; to establish, maintain and manage nature reserves
in Great Britain, including the maintenance of physical features of scientific
interest; and to organise and develop the research and scientific service
related thereto. Research stations have been set up at Merlewood, Grange-
over-Sands, in Lancashire; at Furzebrook, Wareham, in Dorset; at Bangor,
Wales; and at Speyside, Inverness. There are field stations at Moor House,
Westmorland, and at Anancaun, Ross, and an experimental station at Monks’
Wood, Huntingdon; at these, long-term ecological research is undertaken
into such problems as the relation of vegetation to soils and climates, peat
growth, effects of grazing and of moor burning, coastal erosion and roadside
spraying. Grants are made for research, and the Nature Conservancy awards
annually a number of postgraduate studentships.
The NERC is also responsible for the support of long-term forestry research
in consultation with the Forestry Commission; it has financial and policy
responsibility for the research in seismology and geomagnetism carried out
by the Meteorological Office and co-ordinates research in meteorology
generally with that carried out by the Meteorological Office. It has established
committees for each main activity, based on the body previously responsible.
Joint arrangements have been made between NERC and the Ministry of
Housing and Local Government about the work done by the Nature
Conservancy and the Geological Survey.
The Social Science Research Council began functioning in December 1965.
It has the same status as the other research councils and consists of a chairman
and 14 other members. It provides grants for research projects at universities
and other institutions, and makes training awards to postgraduate students.
The Council’s field of interest includes economics; political science;
psychology; social anthropology; social and economic statistics; sociology and
social administration; education; management; and various aspects of a wide
range of other disciplines.
Several government departments have funds allocated for social research
including the Home Office, which has a large research unit which carries out
a wide variety of sociological studies; the Social Survey conducts sample
survey inquiries at the request of government departments and from time to
time also carries out studies in collaboration with universities and other
independent research organisations.
Among other research agencies may be mentioned the zoological societies
and scientific museums.
Zoological research is among the activities of the world-famous Zoological
Gardens, extending over 34 acres in Regent’s Park, London, which were
opened by the Zoological Society of London in 1828. A natural zoo of 500
acres was opened in 1931 at Whipsnade, in Bedfordshire, by the Society.
Among other well-known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester and
Dudley, and a small, private, natural zoo at Chessington, Surrey.

The British Museum (Natural History) is the principal centre in the
Commonwealth for the general study of natural history; it has extensive
collections of extant and fossil animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and
meteorites. The Science Museum illustrates the development of pure and
applied science in all countries, but chiefly in Britain, which has always held
a leading place in engineering, agriculture, navigation, mining, aeronautics,
and in the development of industrial machinery and processes, all of which
are represented in the museum’s collections. The geology of Britain is known
in more exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and the
Geological Survey, responsible for this work, has an outstanding collection of
exhibits in its Geological Museum. These three museums are in South
Kensington, London.
Important collections outside London are the Museum of Science and
Industry, in Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at
Oxford.
The dissemination of the results of research to other research workers and
to ultimate users has become a problem of some magnitude as the volume
of information has grown. The traditional method of scientific publication,
in which results are written up into papers and published in journals, is still
the main means of communication among scientists. The leading learned
societies have for long been important agencies for communicating scientific
information.
The Office for Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI) was set up in
1965 within the Department of Education and Science to promote more
efficient handling of scientific and technical information over the whole field
of the natural and social sciences and their related technologies. It also seeks
to co-ordinate such action as is taken with the work of other government and
independent organisations. It has responsibility for the National Lending
Library for Science and Technology and for grant-aid to Aslib.
The National Lending Library for Science and Technology at Boston Spa,
Yorkshire, aims to collect, for loan purposes, all the current literature of
science and technology including agriculture and medicine. The Library also
prepares and sells translations of Russian technical articles and books, and is
responsible for increasing the number of translations of foreign (especially
Russian and Chinese) scientific literature, in which work it collaborates with
the National Science Foundation of the United States. (A description of
general library services which also cater for scientific needs is given on p. 221.)
Aslib undertakes research into the operation of information services, gives
assistance in setting up and running them, provides a range of membership
services, and holds a Commonwealth Index of Translation covering scientific
subjects.
The National Reference Library for Science and Invention is administered
by the British Museum and receives its grant through the Department of
Education and Science. The former Patent Office Library is included in the
new library.
An Advisory Committee for Scientific and Technical Information was set
up in October 1965 to advise the Secretary of State for Education and Science
on the conduct of, and support for, United Kingdom activities in scientific
and technical information, more particularly the work of OSTI and the
co-ordination of this work with other government departments and indepen¬
dent organisations.

The Ministry of Technology and the AEA devote considerable sums to
information services. The former sponsors over 40 industrial liaison centres,
associated with its nine regional offices. Based on universities or technical
colleges, they make contacts with local industries to promote greater use of
existing scientific and technical knowledge. A Production Engineering
Advisory Service equipped with mobile demonstration units is being launched
to bring knowledge of new techniques directly to the workshop floor. The
grant-aided industrial research associations circulate research reports and
provide information services to members. Besides information services
provided by its various groups, the AEA has an information centre and an
isotope information bureau at its London headquarters.
In agriculture, the Commonwealth Agricultural Institutes and Bureaux
(see p. 213) provide abstracts and an information service in various branches
of agricultural science. The ARC publishes an Index of A-gvicultuTCil Research
in Progress, and gives an account of current developments in its annual
reports. The advisory services of the agricultural departments bring research
results directly to the farmer.
Medical research results are communicated mainly through journals and
periodicals; but the MRC issues special reports and includes special articles
in its annual reports.

The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), an independent
body, for which the Minister of Technology is now responsible to Parliament,
was set up in 1949 under the Development of Inventions Act I94^> t° secure
the development and exploitation of inventions in the public interest. Capital
of 1$ million, provided for during its first five years, was increased in 1958 to
fio million over 20 years. Under the Development of Inventions Act 1965,
the amount was increased to ^25 million and the time limit removed.
Projects so far sponsored include, among many others, such varied items as
hovercraft, electronic digital computers, towed flexible barges (dracones),
interferon (an anti-viral agent), selective weed-killers, a hydrogen-oxygen
fuel cell as a transportable source of electricity and a group of new antibiotics
called cephalosporins. The Corporation has a substantial annual income from
the exploitation of inventions. In the case of hovercraft the NRDC has set up
a wholly owned subsidiary, Hovercraft Development Limited as a licensing
and research body, and participates in the British Hovercraft Corporation,
formed in 1966 by the leading manufacturers of hovercraft.
Britain plays a considerable part in overseas scientific collaboration, including
the exchange of scientific information. In areas of non-governmental collabora¬
tion, under the aegis of the International Council of Scientific Unions,
the primary representative of the United Kingdom is the Royal Society.
The Government is concerned with inter-governmental organisations:
these include specialised agencies of the United Nations (the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the World
Health Organisation (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission); the organisations
concerned with nuclear energy (the International Atomic Energy Agency,
the European Nuclear Energy Agency) and the European Organisation for
Nuclear Research; space research (the European Space Research Organisa¬
tion) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. There are agree¬

of the United States Atomic Energy Commission in London and of the
United Kingdom AEA in Washington). In addition, there are inter¬
governmental agreements with Euratom, and bilateral agreements with other
countries. Britain is also represented on the Committee for Scientific and
Technical Personnel and on the Committee for Scientific Research of the
OECD.
The Commonwealth Scientific Committee (CSC) consisting of the heads of
the national research organisations of Commonwealth countries, formed in
1958 from the previous Standing Committee set up in 1946, meets biennially.
Operating under the CSC are: the Commonwealth Scientific Liaison Offices
and the various specialist committees on fuel research, mineral resources and
geology (including a Commonwealth Geological Liaison Office), mineral
processing and the collection of micro-organisms.
The secretariat for the Committee is provided by the Commonwealth
Scientific Liaison Offices.
A British Commonwealth Scientific Conference held in 1946 recommended
the continuance and extension of the scientific collaboration of the war years
by the creation of the Commonwealth Scientific Liaison Offices, a group now
consisting of the Scientific Liaison Offices of the various Commonwealth
countries together with the International Scientific Relations Division of the
Department of Education and Science.
The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux comprise three Institutes and 11
Bureaux, all of which except one Institute are in Britain and each of which is
concerned with a particular branch of agricultural science. They act as
clearing houses for the interchange of information of value to research workers
in agricultural science throughout the Commonwealth and increasingly
throughout the world. This they achieve by scanning and indexing journals
of scientific repute in all languages, by keeping in touch with agricultural
research in progress and by the dissemination of this information by the
periodic issue of Abstract Journals. Seventeen Abstract Journals and one
Index are published periodically and have a combined annual circulation of
about 27,500 copies. A list of research workers in agriculture, animal health
and forestry in the Commonwealth and the Republic of Ireland, published
from time to time, provides a useful book of reference and enables research
workers to contact one another. The Institutes and Bureaux also issue mono¬
graphs on their own particular subjects and deal with inquiries received from
research workers in all parts of the Commonwealth. In addition, the Institutes
and the Bureaux of Helminthology provide taxonomic and identification
services.
One of the main aims of the Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM)
is the promotion of scientific research in the interests of developing countries.
The aid given covers specialist advice from Britain, advisory visits, confer¬
ences for exchange of information, training scientists from overseas in
universities and research institutions in Britain, recruiting scientific staff from
Britain, and providing support for existing research services overseas, for
example, in East Africa and the Caribbean. Some equipment is also given to
encourage scientific training and applied research. The Department works
with the many specialist bodies concerned, particularly the research councils
and the Ministry of Technology. It administers and supports the work of,

for example, the Anti-Locust Research Centre in London, mternatronally
recognised as a world centre for locust research since 1931. The Ministry
also responsible for the Tropical Products Institute in London which aims at
improving the economical viability of the less-developed countries of the
tropics, especially those within the Commonwealth, by research into new uses
for tropical plant and animal products. The ODM provides some £2 million
a year to support research for the benefit of developing countries, mostly in
agriculture and medicine.
The aims of the British Council in the sciences (including agriculture, medicine
and technology) are to foster co-operation between British scientists an
scientists of other countries, and to promote among overseas specialists a
better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific achievements.
Much emphasis is placed on the interchange of scientists between Britain
and other countries. Overseas tours and advisory visits by British specialists
are arranged and scientists recruited for overseas posts. In the other direction
the Council invites senior specialists to Britain for visits and discussions wi
British experts, and makes awards to postgraduate students; it also administers
the programmes of a large number of senior specialists and students who
travel to Britain under the auspices of the UN specialised agencies, or un er
various bilateral technical assistance schemes, or as private individuals. A
number of high-level scientific short courses are organised each year for

THE PROMOTION OF THE ARTS
This section describes the assistance and encouragement given t0 the
by the Government, local authorities, voluntary societies and other
organisations. Although valuable support comes from Prlvfe sou[“![
including trusts and commerical concerns,. the Government and loca
authorities are taking an increasingly active part. In f°r *
first time, a minister was appointed to take a special interest in the arts
The Government considers that its role is not ‘to dictate taste or r“ "
the liberty of even the most unorthodox and experimental of artists but to
support the arts so that a high level of artistic achievement can be sustained
and the best in the arts made more widely available.! Government support
to the arts can be grouped under three heads: education, preservation and
patronagc^n educationa, functjons are carried out in England and Wales
through the Department of Education and Science, in Scotland through the

Scottish Education Department and in Northern Ireland by the Ministry of
Education. In partnership with local education authorities and voluntary
bodies, they are concerned with schools, colleges of further education and
community centres. The Department of Education and Science is also
concerned with public libraries and is responsible for the Victoria and Albert
Museum, and the Scottish Education Department is responsible for the
Royal Scottish Museum.
The Government aids the preservation of Britain’s cultural heritage by
means of grants which largely finance most of the national museums and
galleries; through the Ministry of Public Building and Works, which looks
after historic buildings and ancient monuments; and by giving financial help
to independent bodies concerned with preservation, such as the National Trust.
General help for the arts is given through government grants for music,
drama, literature, painting and sculpture; these are channelled for the greater
part through the Arts Councils, which contribute to the aspects of the arts
not provided for by other agencies. Other state-aided organisations include
the British Film Institute and the Council of Industrial Design.
Estimated government expenditure on the arts in Great Britain in 1966-67
is over £12 million. Direct allocations included nearly £6 million for all
national museums and galleries, and £5-7 million for the Arts Council. In
addition nearly -£1-7 million was allocated for the preservation of historic
houses and ancient monuments.
The Arts Council of Great Britain was established under a Royal Charter
in 1946. Its members are appointed by the Secretary of State for Education
and Science, in consultation with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and
Wales. Its main objects are to develop in the public greater knowledge and
understanding of the fine arts, to improve the standard of execution and to
advise and co-operate with government departments, local authorities and
other organisations. The Council’s grant from the Government of ^5-7 million
in 1966-67 was ^i-8 million more than in 1965-66.
The Arts Council of Northern Ireland, which has similar aims, receives
a grant from the Northern Ireland Government of £80,000 plus up to a
maximum of £20,000 on a £ for £ basis on contributions from local
authorities and other sources.
The British Council (see footnote, p. 173) takes an active part in displaying
overseas the best in British drama, music and the visual arts.
Local authorities play an important part in encouraging the arts. Under the
Local Government Act 1948 they may levy up to a sixpenny rate in England
and Wales (just under fivepence in Scotland) for expenditure on entertainment
in all its forms, including cultural activities. They may also spend money on
buildings for the arts and provide and maintain museums and art galleries.
Many towns support orchestras and theatres and the Arts Council of Great
Britain is authorised to give financial help to house the arts.
The London County Council (the Greater London Council since April
1965, see p. 69) built the Royal Festival Hall and has agreed to contribute
equally with the Government towards the cost of the National Theatre on the
south bank of the Thames.
Many voluntary bodies are concerned with promoting the arts and include
charitable trusts and foundations which give financial support. Industrial
patronage includes continuing support from the independent television
companies.

The arts benefit most when the patrons—central and local government,
voluntary bodies, industry, the universities and individuals—combine. The
outstanding example is the Edinburgh Festival Society. Other arts festivals
organised on a similar basis are held in the City of London, Aldeburgh, Bath,
Cheltenham, Harrogate, King’s Lynn, Leeds, Norwich and York.
Regional co-operation in arts patronage is growing with support from the
Government. The pioneer organisation was the North Eastern Association
for the Arts on which are represented local authorities, universities, commerce
and industry. A similar association has been set up in Lincolnshire.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, winning 61 international prizes since 1949 and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at
home has been stimulated by an increasingly lively attitude towards display
on the part of museums and galleries, and by the varied activities of mam
institutions, societies and private galleries.
Painting and sculpture receive state support by grants to national institu¬
tions and, indirectly, through purchase grants made to local art galleries and
museums, to local education authorities for art schools and other means of
promoting education in art, and to the Arts Councils, which take an actrve
part by organising exhibitions and building up their own collections of con¬
temporary British art. The Government is advised on grants and matters of
policy by the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries and the Royal
Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland.
Knowledge of Britain’s fine arts is fostered overseas by the British Council’s
exhibitions and lectures. In 1965-66 43 fine art exhibitions organised by the
Council were shown in 44 countries and the Council was also responsible
for British participation in seven international exhibitions.
Over 900 museums and art galleries are open to the public in Britain, though
many are only small collections.
There are 18 national museums and art galleries. Those in London probably
contain between them the most comprehensive collection of objects of artistic,
archaeological, scientific, historical and general interest ever to exist within
one city They include the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum,
the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the
Imperial War Museum, the National Maritime Museum, the London Museum
(to be amalgamated with the Guildhall Museum into the Museum of London),
the Wallace Collection, the British Museum (Natural History) and the
Science Museum (see p. 211).
There are six national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the National Gallery of Scotland,
the Royal Scottish Museum, the National Portrait Gallery of Scotland, the
Scottish United Services Museum, and the Scottish National Gallery of
Modern Art. The National Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at
St. Fagan’s Castle where the Welsh Folk Museum is housed; and in Northern
Ireland there is the national Ulster Museum in Belfast.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (Tower of
London), the Public Record Office (see p. 221) and the Soane Museum.
In 1962 a small but important gallery was opened in Buckingham Palace
for exhibition of pictures from the extensive royal collections. Almost every
city and large town has a museum devoted to art, archaeology and natura

history, usually owned by the municipal authority but sometimes by a local
learned society or privately by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and
Cambridge are rich in museums, many of them, as in other towns, associated
with the universities—for example, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford,
founded in 1683, the oldest in the country, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in
Cambridge. There are important museums and art galleries in Birmingham,
Bristol, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich, South¬
ampton and York. In Northern Ireland there are notable museums and
galleries in or near Belfast (the Ulster Folk Museum and the Northern Ireland
Arts Council Gallery), in Armagh City and in Londonderry.
In recent years there has been a notable development of ‘period-house
museums’, for which outstanding private residences of former times have been
taken over by national and municipal authorities, and of folk museums. Many
private art collections housed in historic family mansions, including those in
the ownership of the National Trust (see p. 178), are open to the public at
certain times.
In the past decade several new or extensively altered museum buildings
have been opened, including those at Coventry, Derby, Doncaster, Durham
(the Gulbenkian Museum at the University), Leicester (Jewry Wall Archaeo¬
logical Museum), Liverpool, Manchester (Whitworth Art Gallery), Scun¬
thorpe and Sunderland. Developments are planned for museums in Belfast,
Bristol, Cardiff, Hull, London, Newcastle and Oxford; there are schemes
involving county council participation in County Durham, Oxfordshire (in
collaboration with the City), Staffordshire, Pembrokeshire, Rutland and
Worcestershire; and other developments are being initiated by local
associations for the arts.
A function of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries is to
advise the Government on the relationship between national and provincial
institutions. Close relations are fostered by the eight area museum councils
which cover the whole of Great Britain. They are grant-aided by the
Government and help to improve technical facilities.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas
members, is an independent organisation. The Association serves as a central
body for the collection of information and the discussion of matters relating
to museum administration, and as a training and examining body for
professional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions organised and sent on tour by the Arts Councils, the
Circulation Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Art
Exhibitions Bureau are a regular feature of many museums. All exhibitions at
the Whitechapel Art Gallery in east London are loan exhibitions (mainly of
contemporary artists). The National Gallery, the Tate Gallery and British
Museum also have loan exhibitions. The Greater London Council exhibits
modern sculpture in one of its parks every third year and is building an
exhibition gallery on the south bank of the Thames, due to be opened in 1968,
which will be administered by the Arts Council. Commercial exhibitions of
works by old masters and living artists are held throughout the year in the
galleries of the art dealers of London (largely in the Bend Street area).
The various national art exhibiting societies include the Royal Academy;
the Royal Scottish Academy; the Society of Scottish Artists; the Royal
Society of British Artists; the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours;
the Royal Society of Portrait Painters; the Artists’ International Association;
2l8

the Women’s International Art Club; and the London Group (all associations
of professional painters); and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Some of
these societies, notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their
own galleries in London. In Northern Ireland there are the Royal Ulster
Academy of Arts, the Ulster Society of Women Artists and the Ulster Arts
Club. Among regional societies are the Newlyn Society of Artists, the Midland
Group of Artists (Nottingham), the Birmingham Society of Artists and the
Penwith Society of Arts, while an increasing number of amateur art societies
throughout the United Kingdom hold local exhibitions and encourage local
interest in the fine arts. There are also exhibitions of children s art, including
the National Exhibition of Children’s Art sponsored annually by the Sunday
Mirror.
All national collections are financed from government funds, both those that
are the direct responsibility of the Department of Education and Science
(the Victoria and Albert and the Science Museums) and the Scottish Education
Department (the Royal Scottish Museum) and those run by trustee bodies.
Besides meeting the administrative costs, provision is made for annual
purchase grants which rose from £125,000 in 1958-59 to over £820,000 in
1966-67. The Government also provides special ad hoc purchase grants and
collections may receive works of art acquired by the Treasury in lieu of estate
duty. The buildings are maintained by the Ministry of Public Building and
Works. Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or
endowments, can be helped in building up their collections through the
annual government grant (£108,000 in 1966-67) administered by the Victoria
and Albert and Royal Scottish Museums. Financial help and pictures are also
given to museums and galleries by certain trusts and voluntary bodies,
particularly the National Art Collections Fund.
The Council of Industrial Design (CoID), set up in 1944 by the Government
to promote higher standards of design in British industry, is concerned with
all aspects of industrial design from durable consumer goods to capital goods.
The CoID, with its Scottish Committee, is a grant-aided body sponsored by
the Board of Trade. It has 29 Council members, including industrialists,
retail management, architects, designers and educationists. At the Design
Centre in the Haymarket, London, a selective but changing display of modern
British consumer goods is maintained; exhibits are chosen from Design Index,
the CoID’s illustrated record of 10,000 well-designed products. A new annual
awards scheme, Council of Industrial Design Awards, covering capital goods
and engineering equipment as well as consumer products, will be introduced
in 1967. The Duke of Edinburgh also presents his annual Prize for Elegant
Design. The Scottish Committee runs the Scottish Design Centre in Glasgow,
and there are three independent regional design centres, each maintaining a
duplicate of the Index, at Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham. The CoID
organises temporary exhibitions in regional centres and overseas; arranges
regular conferences and training courses; and undertakes industrial study
tours in Britain. It publishes a monthly magazine, Design, and maintains
extensive reference and photographic libraries. .
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society
of Arts (see p. 200), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is
the representative professional body in Great Britain of designers engage
in industry and commerce, and the Design and Industries Association (D ),
a voluntary association of industrial companies, designers, and others interested
in the promotion of good design in industry. The Crafts Council of Great
Art Education

PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES AND THE ARTS 2ig
Britain, which runs the Crafts Centre in London, is a voluntary body. Its aims
are to improve the standard of craft design and to promote closer relations
between craftsmen and industry.
Formal art education is given in publicly supported art colleges, university
art schools, the Royal Academy Schools and a few private art schools. There
are the colleges, art schools and classes administered by the local education
authorities; and at a senior level there is the Royal College of Art, London,
whose students have usually completed a course at a local education authority
college. Art is also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central
(Art) Institutions administered by the Scottish Education Department.
University art schools include the Slade School of Fine Art and Goldsmiths’
College (London), the Ruskin Drawing School (Oxford), the Reading School
of Art, the Department of Fine Art of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne,
and the School of Art of University College, Aberystwyth.
The leading academic institutions for the teaching and study of the history
of art are the Courtauld Institute of the University of London, the Department
of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London, and the
Warburg Institute, also a part of London University.
In England three-year full-time courses leading to a Diploma in Art
and Design were instituted in 1963 and are available to students who have
successfully completed a pre-diploma course. The Diploma is broadly
comparable to a university pass degree, and is administered by the National
Council for Diplomas in Art and Design (an independent self-governing
body set up by the then Minister of Education in 1961). In Scotland each of
the four schools of art awards a diploma which is roughly equivalent to the
pass degree of a university.
Art has a place in the curriculum of every type of school, and the Society
for Education through Art, among other activities, encourages the purchase
by schools of original works of art by organising an annual Pictures for
Schools exhibition. A loan scheme for reproductions of works of art which is
used extensively by schools is operated by the Arts Council.
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned with
encouraging the best in new building and preserving the best that has been
inherited from the past.
Several government departments are concerned with domestic architecture
and help to promote good design. The Ministry of Housing and Local
Government, the Scottish Development Department, and the Northern
Ireland Ministry of Development are responsible for approving the layout and
design of local authority housing schemes, and set standards for local
authority housing. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government has a
research and development group responsible for examining methods of building
more cheaply, and for maintaining a high standard of design. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works is responsible for the design, building and
maintenance work of all government departments; it also has a research and
development group which co-ordinates similar groups throughout the
government service. The Architects and Building Branches at the Department
of Education and Science and the Scottish Education Department carry out
research for school building programmes. The Ministry of Health is
implementing a very large building programme and the Regional Hospital
Boards, through their architectural departments, are responsible for the
design and construction of a large number of hospitals and ancillary buildings.

Government departments are assisted in an advisory capacity by the Royal
Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland, which also
advise planning authorities and other public bodies on questions of public
amenity or artistic importance. Many large-scale modern buildings have had
the approval of the commissions.
A number of professional, advisory and other societies and institutions
exist to further the interests of architecture, and the Civic Trust (see p. 178)
seeks to promote high standards in architecture and civic planning and to
encourage a wider interest in the appearance of towns.
The Minister of Public Building and Works has responsibilities for the
preservation of ancient monuments and the Minister of Housing and Local
Government for historic buildings in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland
these responsibilities are vested in the Ministry of Finance.
In Britain it is illegal for a person to practise under the title of architect
unless registered with the Architects’ Registration Council of the United
Kingdom. Most students train at a full-time school of architecture; there are
29 schools recognised for exemption from the Intermediate and Final
examinations of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and four
recognised for the intermediate examination only. In addition to these schools,
which may also have part-time courses, there are 25 schools of art and
technical institutes which prepare students for the external examinations of
the RIBA; five of these have full-time courses.
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional
architectural institution in Britain. Allied to it are 50 autonomous societies
covering the whole of the United Kingdom and most of the overseas
Commonwealth. Membership is 22,000 with some 6,000 students. It has one
of the largest and most important architectural libraries in the world. The
RIBA is concerned with a wide range of activities covering professional
practice, science, technology, statistics, architectural competitions, professional
and public relations; arranges lectures and discussions on a variety of subjects,
presents exhibitions and, through its Board of Architectural Education,
controls the training and examination of architects. The Royal Gold Medal
for Architecture is awarded annually by the Queen on the recommendation
of the RIBA. Among other associations are the Incorporated Association of
Architects and Surveyors, the Institute of Registered Architects and the
Faculty of Architects and Surveyors. Societies include the Architectural
Association, the Architecture Club, and several which cover particular
aspects of architecture, such as the Modular Society.
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges
and universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country,
private libraries and a large number of private literary societies. Book reviews
are featured in the press and on radio and television and there are numerous
periodicals concerned in whole or in part with literature.
Government support is given through the Arts Council of Great Britain
which in 1966 introduced a wider policy for supporting literature. This
includes bursaries and prizes for writers, a fund to aid literary projects, and
subsidies to festivals of literature and poetry. Similar provision is made,
through the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, for bursaries and aid for
publications. ... c v
Recognition of outstanding literary merit is given in the form of literary
prizes, a number of which are awarded annually, for instance, the Queen’s
Gold Medal for Poetry, the James Tait Black Memorial prizes for biography

and literature, the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial prize for young writers of
promise, the Hawthornden prize for imaginative writing, the Winston
Spencer Churchill Literary Award for an outstanding work in the history
of the English-speaking peoples, the Library Association Carnegie Medal for an
outstanding book for children, the Kate Greenaway Medal for the best child¬
ren’s book illustration and the Somerset Maugham award for young writers.
The British Museum Library in London (over 7 million volumes) is the largest
in Britain. The National Library of Scotland (over 2 million volumes) is in
Edinburgh, and that of Wales in Aberystwyth (nearly 2 million volumes).
Together with the Bodleian Library of Oxford University million
volumes) and the Cambridge University Library (2^ million volumes) these
comprise the ‘copyright’ libraries of the country and are entitled to receive
a copy of each new book published in Britain: the British Museum Library
must receive a copy, the other libraries may claim one.
Other national libraries are the National Lending Library for Science
and Technology (see p. 211), the National Reference Library for Science and
Invention (see p. 211) and the National Central Library (see p. 222).
The Science Museum, Victoria and Albert and the British Museum
(Natural History) in South Kensington all have large libraries and many
government departments have old-established libraries of considerable size
and importance, for example those of the Board of Trade, Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and War Office (now in the Ministry of
Defence). The Public Record Office contains the records of the superior
courts of law and of most government departments, as well as such famous
historical documents as Domesday Book. The National Register of Archives
(maintained by the Historical Manuscripts Commission) contains particulars
of local and private records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the John Rylands
Library, Manchester, and the Signet Library, Edinburgh, there are the rich
resources of the learned societies and institutions.1 Examples are the libraries
of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Royal Commonwealth
Society, the Commonwealth Institute, the Royal Geographical Society, the
Royal Institute of British Architects (see p. 220), the British Drama League
(see p. 225), the Royal College of Music, Royal Academy of Music, the Central
Music Library (administered by Westminster City Council), the National
Library for the Blind and the National Book League, which also houses the
Arts Council library of modern English poetry.
The great expansion in education in recent years has increased the strain on
library resources at all levels of education. The ancient university libraries
of Oxford and Cambridge are not matched by any of the more recent founda¬
tions, although the combined library resources of the colleges and institutions
of the University of London total over 31 million volumes and the university
libraries of Edinburgh, St. Andrews, Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool,
Manchester and Leeds each have over half a million volumes. However,
many universities have succeeded in building up large and important research
collections in special subjects; for example the Barnes Medical Library at
Birmingham and the Brotherton Library of English Literature at Leeds.
The new universities are also rapidly building initial collections.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education

authorities, give instruction in the use of libraries. This service is often
organised by the public library, and stock and staff are common to both
services. Liaison between schools and public libraries is frequent in most
areas and parties of school children are regularly introduced to the public
library system, which they can use in addition to the school library.
Britain is served by a complete network of public libraries, administered by
490 public library authorities (county councils, county borough councils,
London borough councils, municipal borough councils and urban district
councils). The authorities in Great Britain, which provide more than 40,000
service points, have a total stock of over 80 million books. (These figures
do not include the libraries in the publicly maintained schools.) Nearly
one-third of the total population are members of public libraries.
Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 the Secretary of State
for Education and Science is charged with the supervision of the public
library service in England and Wales, acting on the advice of the two Library
Advisory Councils, one for England, the other for Wales. Under the Act,
public library authorities are designated and have a duty to provide an
efficient and free lending and reference library service for books and periodicals.
Outlying areas may be served by mobile libraries, of which nearly 400 are in
service, and facilities exist for people who are normally unable to visit a
library.
In addition to lending books, about a quarter of the library authorities now
lend gramophone records of various kinds and a growing number are adding
loan collections of works of art, either originals or reproductions. Nearly all
library authorities provide children’s departments and reference sections and
art, music, commercial and technical departments meet the growing and more
specific demands in these fields.
Nearly every library authority possesses a significant collection of books
and documents on the history of its locality. Qualified and specialist staff are
available for consultation in all but the smallest service points.
The public library is often a local cultural centre. Film shows, lectures,
adult education classes, book-week exhibitions, drama groups, gramophone
recitals and children’s story hours are among the many activities. About one
in five public libraries provides special facilities for these extension activities.
Under the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964* statutory recognition is
given to the hitherto voluntary system of library co-operation in England
and Wales which has grown up since the first quarter of this century. The
ten existing regional library bureaux in England and Wales (consisting
mainly of public libraries in each area) aim to be largely self-sufficient in
the interlending of current British books by means of a national system of
subject specialisation. They organise co-operation through their own member
libraries and through the National Central Library, which is responsible for
interlending at national and international level and has a bookstock of its
own of over 300,000 volumes built up by purchase, gift and the operation of
the British National Book Centre exchange scheme with foreign libraries. The
combined resources of libraries available to the National Central Library, which
includes university, industrial and other non-public libraries, amount to some
100 million books and many thousand sets of periodicals.
There is a growing number of schemes for the exchange of specialist books
and periodicals as well as information. These are organised by associations of
industrial and commercial libraries which combine their resources, normally
through the local public or technical college library.

The Scottish Central Library carries out functions similar to those of the
regional bureaux and the National Central Library. Both Central Libraries
are financed in part by Exchequer grants. In Northern Ireland access to the
stocks of all co-operating libraries is available on application to the Belfast
public libraries, Queen’s University Library and the county libraries.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association, which
was granted a Royal Charter in 1898 to unite all persons engaged or interested
in library work; to promote the better administration of libraries and, inter
alia, to hold examinations in librarianship and to issue certificates of efficiency.
The Association in 1966 had a membership of over 15,000, of whom 1,700
were from overseas countries. It maintains a Register of Chartered Librarians,
publishes books and pamphlets, a Yearbook and an official journal, The
Library Association Record. The Association and its branches, groups and
sections hold regular conferences. There are also associations of libraries of
which Aslib (the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux,
see p. 211) and the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries
(SCONUL) are of major importance.
New books constitute the large majority of all books published in Britain.
In 1965 British publishers issued 26,358 separate titles, of which 21,045 were
new books and the rest reprints or new editions. In recent years there has been
a great increase in the number of paperbacked books of all kinds.
The above figures include only a small selection of government publications
by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, which is the largest publishing organisa¬
tion in Britain. The great majority of books, however, are produced by about
300 of the principal commercial publishers. These include the university
presses, notably the Oxford University Press (including the Clarendon Press)
and the Cambridge University Press.
Using the copies deposited under copyright law in the British Museum,
the British National Bibliography is published weekly, with three, six, nine
and twelve monthly cumulations, listing in a classified order, with indexes, all
new books and new editions, excluding reprints, of books published in Britain.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with
book production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the
Booksellers’ Association; in 1965 the Book Development Council was set up to
promote British books overseas. The Society of Authors is a professional
association of writers. The National Book League has a membership covering
all who are interested in books: authors, publishers, booksellers, librarians and
readers. It encourages an interest in books and arranges exhibitions in Britain
and overseas. Knowledge of British books and periodicals overseas is greatly
assisted by the British Council through the lending and reference libraries
(over 180 which it runs or supplies), and through the many book and
periodicals exhibitions which it sends on tour overseas. (For sales and exports
of books in 1965, see p. 309.)
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and
the Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of
Historical, Philosophical and Philological Studies, generally known as the
British Academy, is the leading society of humanistic studies and receives
a grant from the Treasury.
A number of societies sponsor poetry readings and recitals; the Poetry
Society, the Apollo Society and the Barrow Poets are among the best known.
Poetry also plays an important part in various annual festivals, including the

National Eisteddfod—the bardic festival held in Wales—the Stratford-upon-
Avon Festival of Poetry, the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, and the
biennial poetry festival organised by the Poetry Book Society in London.
Among the specialist societies are the Early English Text Society, the
Bibliographical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several
societies devoted to particular authors, of which the largest is the Dickens
Fellowship. There are a number of clubs and societies, such as the Book
Society and the Poetry Book Society, which exist to distribute selected new
books to their members.
Government support for drama is given through the Arts Councils of Great
Britain and of Northern Ireland which grant subsidies to certain theatrical
managements operating on a non-profit-distributing basis (that is, using
profits to finance future productions), provided that such managements have
given evidence of serious aims and of consistently high standards of practical
competence. The Arts Council of Great Britain operates a scheme to promote
new drama: guarantees may be offered to managements giving the first pro¬
fessional production of selected new plays; and promising authors may be
awarded bursaries. Schemes are also in operation to train stage designers,
producers and those wishing to take up theatre administration.
The British Council makes the British theatre better known abroad by
organising and sponsoring international tours by the leading British theatre
companies and individual actors and producers, and by sending overseas
drama lecturers and exhibitions of theatrical design or of books dealing with
the British theatre, and by providing newly published plays through its
overseas libraries.
There are about 200 professional theatres in Britain. The centre of theatrical
activity is in London, where there are some 30 principal theatres in the
‘West End’ and several more in the suburbs, but important developments
are taking place in the provinces. In London, with six exceptions (Covent
Garden, Sadler’s Wells, the Old Vic, the Royal Court, the Mermaid and the
Aldwych) the theatres are let to some 25 producing managements on a
commercial basis for each production.
Among London companies receiving Arts Council grants are the Nationa
Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, the English Stage Company,
which produces contemporary plays mainly at the Royal Court Theatre and
the Mermaid. # . ..
The National Theatre Company was formed in 1963; it will eventually
play in the new National Theatre, to be built on the south bank of the Thames
in London. The capital costs of the theatre will be met by the Exchequer and
the Greater London Council; grants towards the Company’s running costs
are being made by the Arts Council and the Greater London Council.
The Company, whose repertoire consists of classical and modern plays
from all countries, is large enough for simultaneous productions to be under¬
taken in London (at the Old Vic Theatre) and in the provinces or overseas.
The Royal Shakespeare Company presents Shakespearean plays at the
Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, and international classical
and modern plays at the Aldwych Theatre, London. It will eventually have a
permanent London home in the proposed City of London arts centre in t e
Barbican. , . , f

by local repertory companies. An important development is the growth of
the civic theatre. The term is generally taken to include some companies which
have the use of their own theatres (as in Lincoln, Liverpool and Birmingham)
or rent them from a local authority (as at Bristol and Chesterfield), and those
like the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry and the Nottingham Playhouse which
were built by the city councils. These companies are assisted by the Arts
Council. Many of the leading dramatists, producers, designers, actors and
actresses in Britain started their careers in such companies, work of which
influences current theatrical practice.
A number of new theatres have been opened both in London and the
provinces in recent years, including, in London, the Mermaid Theatre and
the completely reconstructed Queen’s Theatre. Coventry’s Belgrade Theatre,
opened in 1958, was the first full-scale theatre to be built by a civic authority
since 1939. Since then civic theatres have been built at Croydon, Eastbourne
and Torquay, and smaller theatres have been opened at Middlesbrough,
Richmond (Yorkshire) and Whitehaven (Cumberland). The new Nottingham
Playhouse and the Phoenix Theatre, Leicester, opened in 1963 and the
Yvonne Arnaud Theatre at Guildford in 1965. A Festival Theatre opened
in 1962 at Chichester, Sussex.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Group Theatre in Belfast specialises in
Ulster comedy; and the Belfast Arts Theatre presents some international
drama and lighter theatrical entertainment. The Lyric Players Theatre, a
non-profit-making organisation, under a board of trustees, presents Irish and
international drama, and plans to build a small theatre in or near Belfast.
All professional theatres are eligible for grants in respect of specific productions
approved by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
All plays are subject to the provisions of the Theatres Act 1843, which deals
with the licensing of theatres and plays and requires all new plays to be
approved by the Lord Chamberlain,1 who may forbid the presentation of any
play ‘for the preservation of good manners, decorum, or of the public peace’.
In the commercial theatre, the Lord Chamberlain may require amendments to
be made to the text of a play, but the number of plays for which a licence is
refused amounts to under one per cent of the total submitted.
Most managers and artists are members of professional organisations such
as the Theatres’ Advisory Council, the London Theatre Council, the Pro¬
vincial Theatre Council, the Society of West End Managers, the Theatrical
Managers’ Association, the Council of Repertory Theatres, British Actors’
Equity (the actors’ trade union) and the League of Dramatists. The trade
union of theatre staffs is the National Association of Theatrical and Kine
Employees.
There are thousands of amateur dramatic societies in Britain with an active
membership of some half a million. They are encouraged by local education
authorities, by other public bodies, and by four special organisations—the
British Drama League, the Standing Conference of Drama Associations,
the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association of Ulster
Drama Festivals. Amateur companies which stage productions in their own
theatres belong to the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain; for instance,
the Maddermarket Theatre in Norwich and the Questor’s Theatre, Ealing.

Most universities have active amateur drama clubs and societies; in 1959
Bristol inaugurated the International Festival of University Theatre, now
held annually in Britain.
Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the
most important are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (which is grant-
aided and provides a two-year course in all branches of stage work), the
Central School of Speech and Drama, the Rose Bruford Training College,
the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, the Webber-Douglas
School, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the Arts Educational
Schools, all of which are in or near London; and the Old Vic School in
Bristol. In Scotland there is the College of Dramatic Art which is an integral
part of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music in Glasgow and is grant-aided
by the Scottish Education Department. An increasing number of universities
offer courses in drama.
The Society for Theatre Research brings together those interested in the
history and technique of the British theatre. The International Theatre
Institute has a British centre in London. The main purpose of the institute is
to foster international goodwill and understanding by interchange of students,
theatrical companies, personnel and theatrical information.
Many schools and youth clubs put on plays and provide some education in
drama. In 1964 a drama centre for the London education service opened
at Toynbee Hall in east London. At Coventry special productions are arranged
for school children and members of the Belgrade Theatre s staff teach at local
schools; there is also an advisory service for school productions. Nottingham
has a Youth Theatre Workshop.
A large number of organisations such as the Unicorn Theatre Trust and
Shakespeare for Schools present children’s plays in London and the provinces.
The National Youth Theatre, whose members are all young people, presents
mainly Shakespearean productions in London, the provinces and abroad.
Music in all its forms draws large audiences; and music festivals, orchestral
concerts, choral singing, brass bands, chamber music, opera and ballet are
important features of British cultural life. The increase in musical appreciation
in recent years is shown by the size of audiences for concerts and for broadcast
music. Nearly 94 million gramophone records were produced during 1965.
The City of Westminster houses the Central Music Library which lends to
other libraries and individuals. Another well-known music collection is the
Henry Watson Music Library at the Manchester Central Library.
The Arts Council of Great Britain makes grants to a number of orchestras,
opera and ballet companies, and music societies. The British Council gives
financial assistance to some of the overseas tours of British orchestras, soloists,
and opera and ballet companies; it sponsors recordings of works by British
composers, and maintains 118 libraries of British music (scores and records)
in 72 countries overseas and, at its London headquarters, a reference library
of records, scores and books on music.
The National Music Council, representative of many aspects of British
musical activity, is affiliated to the International Music Council which is
associated with UNESCO.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities of Britain. In London the principal concert halls are the

Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames; the Royal Albert Hall,
Kensington, where the annual summer season of Promenade Concerts is
given; and the Wigmore Hall, which has been the principal recital centre.
From March 1967 the new Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room, associated with
the Royal Festival Hall, will be available.
Among the leading British orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the
London Symphony, the Royal Philharmonic, the New Philharmonia (formed
in 1964 from the Philharmonia), the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, the Halle
(Manchester), the City of Birmingham Symphony, the Bournemouth Sym¬
phony, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle upon Tyne), the Scottish National
and the BBC Symphony, Northern and Scottish orchestras. There are also
specialised string and chamber orchestras such as the Philomusica of London,
the English Chamber Orchestra and the London Mozart Players. Many of
these receive financial aid from the Arts Council of Great Britain and local
authorities; some of them also receive assistance from commercial television
and other business organisations. The new permanent Ulster Orchestra has
been formed in Belfast by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, and
replaces the former part-time City of Belfast Orchestra.
The principal choral societies in Britain are the Royal Choral, the BBC
Choral, the Huddersfield Choral, the Halle Choir, the Liverpool Philharmonic
Choir, the London Philharmonic Choir, the New Philharmonia Chorus
(formed in 1964 from the Philharmonia), the Bach Choir, the Royal Edinburgh
Choral Union and the Belfast Philharmonic Society. These and many other
choral societies are associated with famous orchestras in major choral works;
most of them, together with hundreds of similar choral and orchestral societies
and music clubs, are affiliated to the National Federation of Music Societies,
through which they are supported with funds provided by the Arts Council.
Among societies which specialise in encouraging the performance of the work
of living musicians are the Society for the Promotion of New Music, the Music
Section of the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and Macnaghten Concerts.
Music festivals in Britain, originating with the Three Choirs Festival held
annually in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford in rotation, have been in
existence for over 200 years. The famous Edinburgh International Festival
lasts three weeks; other festivals such as at King’s Lynn, last a week or less.
Among the better known are the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales; the
Llangollen International Eisteddfod; the National Gaelic Mod, held at a
different place in Scotland each year; the Cheltenham Festival, largely devoted
to contemporary British music; the Aldeburgh Festival; the Bath Festival;
the Coventry Festival; the Haslemere Festival; the biennial York Festival;
and the Leeds and Norwich Festivals, which include important choral
music, and which are held triennially. An annual international festival of folk
song and dancing is held by the English Folk Dance and Song Society.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by the work of County
Music Committees,1 which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust
and united in the Standing Conference for Amateur Music. The Rural Music
Schools Association is concerned with music-making by amateurs in country
districts; it brings together professional musicians, teachers, administrators
and amateurs.
1 Some of these are voluntary committees and some are local education authority
sub-committees.

Professional organisations which look after the interests of music and

Musicians, the Composers’ Guild, and the Songwriters’ Guild.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House,
Co vent Garden, London, leased by the Government1 to the Royal Opera
House, Covent Garden, Limited, which was formed in 1944 to make the
famous opera house the home of a national opera and ballet, and which
receives a grant from the Arts Council. The Royal Opera House has its own
opera company and ballet company (The Royal Ballet) which give perfor¬
mances in London and elsewhere. The opera company, which numbers about
200 and has a permanent orchestra, makes occasional visits to provincial
centres. The Sadler’s Wells Ballet was amalgamated in 1957 with the Sadler’s
Wells Theatre Ballet and the Sadler’s Wells School to form the Royal Ballet,
which has a high international reputation and has made many overseas tours.
Seasons of opera and operetta are also given at Sadler’s Wells Theatre in
London; with two permanent opera companies, Sadler’s Wells plays in London
throughout the year, and for about 35 weeks in other centres.
At Glyndebourne, in Sussex, an opera season, for which an international
cast is specially assembled, is held every summer. Other opera companies
include the English Opera Group, formed in 1947, and noted for its perfor¬
mances of chamber operas by Benjamin Britten and other composers; the New
Opera Company, formed in 1957 by members of the Cambridge Opera
Group to produce new operas in London; the Handel Opera Society; the
Intimate Opera Company, which performs works for very small casts in any
hall available; and the Welsh National Opera Company. The Scottish Opera
Society presents annual seasons in several Scottish towns. Opera in Northern
Ireland is promoted by the Grand Opera Society of Northern Ireland and the
Studio Opera Group, both receiving a subsidy from the Arts Council of
Northern Ireland. The Arts Council of Great Britain presents three small
operatic groups (Opera for All) which specialise in introducing opera to
audiences in small towns. There are also a number of amateur opera societies.
Among other ballet companies are London’s Festival Ballet, the Ballet
Rambert (Britain’s oldest ballet company) and the Western Theatre Ballet
which specialises in contemporary works. The work of the Patricia Mulholland
Irish Ballet Company in Northern Ireland, which is sponsored by the Arts
Council of Northern Ireland, combines traditional music, dancing and mime.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the
most prominent are the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of
Music in London, the Royal Manchester College of Music and the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music in Glasgow; all are grant-aided. There are also
the Trinity College of Music and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama,
both in London, and the Birmingham School of Music.
The London Opera Centre for Advanced Training and Development was
opened in 1963, and its building provides some rehearsal and other facilities
for the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Its courses last two or three
years. The leading ballet schools are the Royal Ballet, the Rambert Ballet
School and the Royal Academy of Dancing which, with many private schools,
have played an important part in raising British ballet to its present high

standard. Other schools offering general education combined with drama
and/or ballet are run by the Arts Educational Trust and the Italia Conti
School.
Young people are encouraged to take an interest in music, opera and ballet.
There are frequent concerts for children and the National Youth Orchestra of
Great Britain, the National Youth Orchestra of Wales and the London
Schools’ Symphony Orchestra are noted for their high standard of perfor¬
mance. A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to the international
Jeunesses Musicales, encourages opera, ballet and other performances for
young people.
In schools, more children are learning to play musical instruments; and
over 160,000 candidates a year (children and other students) take the exam¬
inations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, the largest
proportion (over 73,000) choosing the piano as their instrument.
The Royal Ballet has recently sponsored a new organisation, Ballet for All,
to give lecture-demonstrations to the public and to schools.
Although cinema attendance has been steadily declining in Great Britain
since its peak of 1,635 million in 1946 to 408 million in 1965, and the number
of cinemas has declined from 4,709 in 1946 to 1,976 in April 1966, British
films, actors and creative and technical talent are appreciated both at home and
abroad and frequently achieve success at international film events. Television
offers very large potential audiences for films and provides opportunities of
employment for technicians and actors.
London is one of the most important centres for the making of films for
international markets and export earnings are an important part of total
earnings. The British Film Producers Association and the Federation of
British Film Makers are the two trade associations to which many feature
film producers belong.
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain goes back
to 1929, when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive
and imaginative kind on behalf of the Government, and later for commercial
organisations. The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since
then, British documentary technicians have continued to produce high
quality factual films which have won numerous international awards. The
Federation of Specialised Film Associations, the trade association of documen¬
tary, short, industrial, advertising and cartoon film makers, has about 100
members.
Films from abroad made in languages other than English often draw large
audiences in London and other large cities.
Although over half of British main feature production is supported by United
States interests at present, the Rank Organisation and Associated British
Picture Corporation maintain a substantial interest in production, distribution
and exhibition. Most British film producers are independent but make films
in association with these major interests. There are numerous companies,
many of them small, which produce short films.
There is no state-owned film production unit in Britain, but the National
Film Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production. Its
members are appointed by the Board of Trade and its funds are limited by
statute to £8 million. In recent years the Corporation was financially concerned

with about half the main feature films made in British studios, but this
proportion has now fallen in view of the American support available.
There is also a levy on cinema admissions to provide a film production fund.
The money so raised is paid out as a percentage of a film’s takings, so that
the more successful a film is at the box-office, the more it receives from the
fund. Started by the industry in 1950 on a voluntary basis, the scheme
became statutory under the Cinematograph Films Act 1957.
The Government sponsors a wide range of films to inform audiences
overseas about British life and achievement, including documentary films,
television programmes and newsreels; they are produced through the Central
Office of Information (COI), which commissions their production by private
companies. These, together with films acquired from private industry and
public bodies, are distributed throughout the world, in English and many
foreign languages, by British Information Services.
Films are also sponsored by the Government, some for specialised audiences,
on such subjects as science, agriculture, health and industry, as well as films
for the general public on, for example, road safety and health education.
A large number of films are sponsored by industrial concerns and other
organisations, such as the British Travel Association and the British
Productivity Council. The best of these and industrial films from other
countries are available through the COI’s Central Film Library and other
agencies.
The Films of Scotland Committee promotes the production of Scottish
films covering the industries and cultural traditions of Scotland.
To help British films to meet the keen American competition, legislation
passed in 1927 introduced the quota system (continued by subsequent
legislation), under which a certain proportion of British films must be shown
in British cinemas each year. The proportion is fixed by the Board of Trade
annually after consultation with the Cinematograph Films Council, any
change being effected by statutory instrument approved by both Houses of
Parliament. For main feature films it has stood at 30 per cent since 1950.
The State takes no part in the censorship of films in Britain, but before it
can be shown a film must be licensed by the local licensing authority. There
are about 700 of these (usually the local authorities or, in some areas,
magistrates). In considering the suitability of films the authorities normally
rely on the judgment of an independent body, the British Board of Film
Censors, to which are submitted all films (other than newsreels) intended for
public showing.
The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912 on the initiative
of the cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in
the films offered to the public. The Board, which does not use any written
code of censorship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate
to a film; very rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the Board are
placed in one of three categories: ‘U’ (suitable for universal showing); A
(more suitable for adults than children who are admitted only if accompanied
by an adult); and ‘X’ (suitable only for adults; children are not admitted).

Film reviews appear regularly in the press and on sound and television

The development of the film as an art is promoted by the British Film
Institute, founded in 1933, which is financed partly by an Exchequer grant.

The Institute encourages the making and showing of good films. It also
administers the National Film Theatre in London and the National Film
Archive, runs an annual summer school, and maintains a film library from
which films may be hired, a library of books on the film and an information
service. It makes grants to the Scientific Film Association, the University
Film Council and the Society for Education in Film and Television.
The National Film Archive contains over 18,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, besides scripts, art designs, posters and
about 500,000 photographic stills, selected to illustrate the history and the
art of the film and as significant social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre, on the south bank of the Thames, in London,
show's films of outstanding historical, artistic or technical interest; it holds
a unique position as a cinema offering regular programmes unrestricted by
commercial considerations or by the age or nationality of the films shown.
The British Film Institute is promoting the development of regional film
theatres on the lines of the National Film Theatre and has been authorised
by the Government to make grants towards their capital costs.
The Society of Film and Television Arts, formed in 1958 by the amalgama¬
tion of the British Film Academy and the Guild of Television Producers and
Directors, has as its aim to improve the standard of film and television
production and to stimulate public appreciation of the arts.
The National Film Theatre organises an annual London Film Festival,
which includes films receiving their first showing as well as films which have
been successful in international competitive festivals. A council on which
leading British film organisations are represented organises a film festival as
part of the Edinburgh International Festival.
The Cinematograph Act 1952, which came into force in January 1956,
provided for the making of regulations by the Home Secretary to protect
the health and welfare of children attending film shows. Cinemas which give
children’s shows require a special licence from the licensing authority, which
may impose conditions. There are about 900 children’s cinema clubs which
provide special programmes on Saturday mornings. An important contribu¬
tion to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film Foundation, which
produces and distributes entertainment films specially designed for children
and publishes at intervals a list of films particularly suitable for children and
for exhibition at children’s matinees. The Foundation is a non-profit-making
body set up by the British film industry in 1951 and, under the Cinematograph
Films Act 1957, it receives grants from the British Film Fund Agency.

The Economy
before 1939
THE NATIONAL
ECONOMY
BACKGROUND
Britain ranks about 75th in size among the countries of the world, with
about 0-18 per cent of the world’s land area. In population, approaching
2 per cent of the world’s inhabitants, it ranks tenth. In density of population
it is fourth: of the major countries, only Japan, Belgium and the Netherlands
are more crowded; and there are nine times as many people to the square
mile in the United Kingdom as in the United States. In terms of national
income per head it ranks appreciably below the United States and also below
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden and Switzerland, and about on a
par with France and the Federal Republic of Germany. In world trade, it
ranks third, accounting for nearly one-tenth of the total. It takes about a fifth
of the world’s exports of primary products, and provides about one-sixth of
the world’s exports of manufactured goods.
Britain, from its own soil, provides only about half of the food it needs,
and—apart from coal and low-grade iron ore—it has few natural resources;
thus it is the world’s largest importer of such products as wheat, meat, butter,
fodder grains, citrus fruits, tea, tobacco, wool, and hard timber. In return,
it is one of the world’s largest exporters of aircraft, motor vehicles, electrical
equipment, chemicals, textiles and most types of machinery. No other major
country has such a small proportion of the working population engaged in
agriculture (less than 3^ per cent).
The United Kingdom is also the central banker of the sterling area, an
area with a quarter of the world s population. IMany countries outside the
sterling area use sterling in their international transactions, and it is the
currency in which about one-third of the world s trade is conducted.
During the nineteenth century Britain secured a leading position as world
manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker, and investor and so was able
to support a rapidly increasing population at a rising standard of living.
During the period from 1870 to 1890 British industrial expansion had the
clearest lead over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914 growing
industrial competition from Europe and North America began to make
itself felt, but its effects on Britain’s staple export industries, particularly
cotton textiles and coal, were offset by the general rise in world trade, by
the continued demand for British textiles from India and other eastern
countries, and by the continued high level of overseas investment.
The new problems confronting British industry and trade in the twentieth
century became apparent after the first world war. Textiles from India and
Japan, where labour was cheaper, established themselves firmly in the large
eastern markets, to a great extent replacing the more expensive and often
higher quality British products. The extension of the world demand for coal
was slowed down by the increasing use of oil, while coal from the newer
European mines competed keenly with British coal.
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
233
Effects of
the Second
World War
The Post-war
Period
In the old-established branches of the vehicles and engineering group of
industries (for instance, locomotives, ships and textile machinery) world
demand fell away after a brief post-war boom, and Britain failed at first to
gain a compensating share of the expanding world trade in the new types of
engineering products (for example, vehicles and electrical goods). Most
countries were tending towards self-sufficiency, and some sought deliberately
to protect nascent and even established industries by tariffs and (later) quotas
and exchange restrictions.
Income from overseas investments and a substantial improvement in the
terms of trade (the price of exports relative to the price of imports) cushioned
the effect of a fall in the volume of exports, and imports remained high.
The loss of export markets led, however, to a contraction of Britain’s staple
industries—coal, cotton, iron and steel, and the older branches of engineering.
The result was heavy unemployment, the general rate of which averaged
14 per cent of the working population in the years 1921-39, reaching a peak
of 22 per cent in 1932, when the slump in world trade was at its worst. In
districts relying mainly on one or other of the staple industries, the rate was
much higher.
After 1932 an improvement in the levels of production and employment
took place, stimulated by an increase in home investment which was aided
by the policy of cheap money, by some revival in world trade and, after 1935,
by the armament programme. The decade saw a strong expansion in the
vehicles, electrical, chemicals and aircraft industries, while the construction
of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the building and ancillary
industries. By 1937 average real income per head was about 14 per cent
higher than in 1929.
The second world war is estimated to have run down British domestic
capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping losses, bomb damage, and
arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements. Some £1,000 million
worth of overseas investments were sold, nearly half in North America, and
new external debts of £3,000 million were accumulated. By 1944 exports had
fallen to less than one-third of their 1938 volume as a result of the war effort.
Economic conditions in the immediate post-war period led to many of the
war-time restrictions remaining in force. Holdings of gold and foreign
exchange had been greatly depleted to pay for the essential war-time supplies
from overseas, and the export trade had to be rebuilt. Thus, rationing and
other war-time controls could only be relaxed gradually with the expansion
of production and the progress of recovery, this process being largely
completed by about mid-1954. The abolition of quantitative restrictions on
imports, other than from the dollar area, was largely completed by 1955.
Exchange controls on transactions between the sterling area and the rest of
the world were also progressively lifted, and in 1958 convertibility of sterling
on current account for all non-residents was introduced and other extensions
made. Thereafter the only important remaining restrictions were on the
movement of capital from Britain to non-sterling countries. In general,
however, the economy was marked by a vigorous recovery in which the pre¬
war average levels of production and consumption were restored and exceeded.
In more recent years the main objective in government economic policies
has been the achievement of faster economic growth and of overcoming the
recurring balance of payments problem (see p. 240) which has affected the
performance of the domestic economy in periods of expansion.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
THE FRAMEWORK OF THE ECONOMY
The following sections sketch briefly the salient features of Britain’s national
economy in recent years. The source of Tables 9 to 12 is Preliminary Estimates
of National Income and Balance of Payments i960 to 1965 (Cmnd. 2966).
OUTPUT AND
EMPLOYMENT
TABLE 9
Distribution of
Total Supplies
of Goods and
Services
In 1965 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the
value of total goods and services produced at home and net income from
abroad) is estimated to have totalled £30,791 million. In real terms, that is,
after allowing for price changes, the increase over the ten-year period to
1965 has amounted to about one-third.
The working population has been rising relatively slowly; in the ten years
to the middle of 1966 it increased by about i£ million (or some 5 per cent) to
about 26 million, of whom two-thirds are males. The expansion of the
national income over the same period has, therefore, been mainly the result
of higher productivity. Unemployment over the past two decades remained
very low, on average less than 2 per cent of the working population being
out of work, compared with 14 per cent between the two world wars. It has
tended to remain above the national average in Northern Ireland, Scotland
and north-east England (where special measures have been taken to provide
additional sources of employment), but in London, the south and the Midlands
the number of unfilled employment vacancies has usually exceeded that of
registered unemployed, thus leading to strong competition among employers
for available labour. While some industries, notably coalmining, the railways,
cotton textiles and agriculture, have undergone a marked reduction in their
labour forces—of the order of 400,000, in the last five years—the needs of
the expanding sectors of the economy have not always been fully met. This
shortfall is expected to continue for some years and will have to be met through
the further raising of productivity, especially in manufacturing.
Table 9 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services
since 1950, at 1958 prices, divided between consumers, public authorities,
investment and exports, and the diagram shows changes in national
expenditure between 1956 and 1965 (at i960 prices).

Manufacturing industry contributes about 35 per cent to the total output
of goods and services, and together with mining and quarrying, construction
and public utilities (gas, electricity and water) makes up just under half of
the total; agriculture, forestry and fisheries account for just under 4 per cent
and transport and communications, together with the distributive trades, for
20 per cent. The remainder, just over one-quarter of total output, includes
public administration, education, health and finance and other services. Over
the past ten years there has been a marked decline in the proportion contributed
by agriculture (though agricultural output is still rising).

It will be seen that the share attributable to fixed capital formation rose
appreciably between 1956 and 1965, in part reflecting the growth of public
investment, while there was a fall in the share of public authorities’ current
expenditure. Over this period the expansion in real terms of exports of goods and
services (28 per cent) and consumer expenditure (31 per cent) has been broadly
in line with the growth of the gross national product (30 per cent), but in the
case of capital formation the rate of increase (68 per cent) has been twice as high.
Gross fixed investment has risen markedly in the last 15 years. In 1948 fixed
investment in the United Kingdom was about 14 per cent of the gross national
product; it has been maintained at a high level in recent years, reaching
over 20 per cent in 1965. In some years, such as 1951, i960 and 1964, the level
of economic activity has been influenced by a high and rising investment in
stocks and in work in progress. Fixed investment in manufacturing in real
terms in 1965 overtook the previous peak level reached in 1961. In that year
the total at current prices amounted to £1,410 million (22 per cent of all
fixed investment), an increase of about 13 per cent over 1964. Chemicals
and vehicles are manufacturing industries in which investment has recently
been especially high. Housing received a substantial share of capital resources
in the early part of the 1950s, but as a proportion of total investment tended to
decline until 1958. It rose rapidly in 1963 and 1964, and in 1965 it was one-third
236
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
as large again as in 1961. Investment in electricity generation and transmission
and gas supply (in 1964 and 1965) has also risen rapidly in recent years.
Except in 1961, more than 40 per cent of total fixed investment over the
last 15 years has been carried out by the central Government, the local
authorities and the public corporations, the last accounting for an average of
about 45 per cent of public investment over the period, and the central
Government for about 15 per cent. Public investment in 1965 amounted to
,£2,803 million, an increase of £223 million over 1964, reflecting increased
expenditure on education, hospitals, roads, electric power supplies and other
services. Table 10 shows the division of gross fixed investment in 1956 and
1965 by industry and the diagram above shows the division between public
and private investment and the pattern of investment according to type of
asset in the same years.

An assessment of the value of the stock of fixed capital in the United
Kingdom at the end of 1964, made by the Central Statistical Office, gives a
total of £99,900 million at 1958 prices (new). This is over 50 per cent higher
than in 1948, on the same basis of calculation. About 30 per cent of the total
was attributable to dwellings and 22 per cent to assets in manufacturing and
construction.
The marked growth of investment has been accompanied by a substantial
increase in personal savings (see Table 11), which in 1965 amounted to
£1,887 million. As a proportion of disposable income (7^ per cent) personal
savings were below the 1961 level of 8| per cent but well above the level in

a Gross saving, that is, before providing for depreciation and stock appreciation and for
tax, dividend and interest reserves.
The rise in personal savings has taken various forms. There has been
increased investment by the personal sector itself in new dwellings and fixed
assets. Life assurance premiums and other forms of contractual savings, such
as superannuation funds, have grown almost without interruption for many
years and now contribute over half the total. National Savings have also
increased since the early 1950s, although the 1965 increase of £74 million
was one of the smallest in recent years and compares with a record peace¬
time increase of £396 million in 1959. Building societies are able to attract
considerable sums of personal savings, which reached a peak of £663 million
in 1965.
The largest contribution to savings comes from companies, which up to
1959 provided about half the total, but there was a fall in company profits
in 1961 and 1962 compared with i960 and only in 1963 did their savings
reach the i960 total; in 1965, they increased by about 15 per cent and accounted
for more than 45 per cent of total savings.
Public corporations, as part of the policy of financing a larger share of their
investment needs from their own resources, have raised their savings total
considerably since 1959 and the 1965 figure was nearly a tenth of total
savings.
Current expenditure, that is, excluding public investment and other capital
expenditure but including interest paid on debt, by the central Government
(including the national insurance funds) and the local authorities rose by
more than two-fifths over the period i960 to 1965 and in the latter year
amounted to about 39 per cent of the gross national product. The main
causes of this increase have been the continuing growth of the social services,

and especially education, and (since i960) in defence expenditure, which
accounted for 19 per cent of the total current expenditure of the public
authorities in 1965 (compared with a peak of 27 per cent in 1953).
Several appreciable increases in taxation rates, imposed partly to reduce
the volume of demand on resources, have increased sharply the inflow of
revenue. Thus the yield from taxes on income in 1965 went up by ^494
million, or about 14 per cent; taxes on expenditure brought in an additional
^407 million following an increase of £325 million in 1964. Revenue from
the taxes on income in 1965 accounted for 33 per cent of central Government
receipts and taxes on expenditure for 31 per cent. National insurance and
health contributions accounted for 14 per cent and the remainder was from
rent, dividends and interest and trading income.
Revenue from rates imposed by local authorities rose by nearly 60 per cent
from i960 to 1965. Rates account for nearly 40 per cent of the latter’s total
receipts, including grants from the central Government.

Personal
Incomes and
Consumer
Expenditure
Incomes from employment in 1965 totalled .£20,967 million and accounted
for over 70 per cent of total personal incomes (against 60 per cent in 1938).
The diagram on p. 239 shows the composition of personal income and
expenditure in 1965.
Of a total of 27-5 million incomes in 1964, there were only about 23,000
incomes of more than £6,000 a year after tax. About a quarter (6-8 million) of
incomes after tax were in the £250-499 range and 5-5 million were in the
next range of £500-749. The number of incomes after tax of £1,000 a year and
above rose from o-86 million in 1954 to 6-1 million in 1964. Just over 75 per cent
of the yield from income tax and surtax came from persons with annual
incomes in this latter category, although the total incomes before tax of this
group accounted for just under a half of total income.
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
239
PERSONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE, 1965
(In £ million at current prices)
The ownership of property and personal assets tends to be more concen¬
trated than income after tax. Estimates made by the Board of Inland Revenue
indicate that in 1964 80 per cent of net personal wealth (including landed
property), amounting to about ^68,500 million, was owned by just under
5 million individuals, 9 per cent of the population.
While consumer expenditure rose by nearly 65 per cent between 1956 and
1965 to reach a total of £22,653 million, in real terms (that is, after discounting
the effect of price changes) the increase was only about 30 per cent. The
proportion devoted to food has been falling slightly each year and now accounts
for 25 per cent (1956, 31 per cent); outlay on tobacco and alcoholic drinks
is about 13 per cent of consumer expenditure. In real terms expenditure
on tobacco fell by 7 per cent between i960 and 1965, but substantial increases
in taxes over the period caused total outlay to rise by 25 per cent at current
prices. Housing absorbs 11 per cent of total expenditure, and fuel and light
for about 5 per cent. Spending on motor cars and motor cycles rose steeply
in 1963 and 1964 though there wras a slight fall in 1965.
There has also been a substantial growth in spending on household
electrical equipment, fuel and light, and clothing. Outlays on running costs
of vehicles have risen from £273 million in 1956 to £917 million in 1965.
In general the pattern of consumer spending reflects the social changes and
other developments outlined in Chapter 1. The diagram on p. 240 shows the
change in consumers’ expenditure in real terms since 1958 and at current
prices.
PROBLEMS FACING THE ECONOMY
Throughout the post-war period, successive governments have sought
solutions to a number of closely inter-connected problems facing the economy:
the need for a substantial balance of payments surplus; the need—at times
critical—to strengthen the £ sterling in the foreign exchange markets and to
increase the external currency reserves, which have been at a low level;
persistent inflationary trends reflecting in the main the tendency for income as
a whole to rise at a markedly higher rate than output; and the need to achieve
a higher rate of expansion of national output. In recent years, the Govern¬
ment’s general approach to these difficulties has been through a much greater

degree of central economic planning with the object of more effectively
mobilising resources and improving the nation’s economic performance. At
times (most recently in July 1966) the need to strengthen the position of
sterling and to encourage a more effective utilisation of resources, especially
manpower, has required measures to restrict severely the pressure of home
demand.
The most far-reaching problem continues to be the balance of payments.
Periodic balance of payments crises have led to sharp checks to economic
expansion and productive investment; these in turn have left the country
vulnerable to further foreign exchange difficulties when expansion was
resumed. Britain’s exports have been growing at only an average rate of about
3 per cent per annum in volume over the past decade; the corresponding
increase in the volume of imports has been over 4 per cent per annum, and
imports of manufactures have risen particularly sharply. The average current
surplus on visible and invisible trade together has not been sufficient, there¬
fore, to finance Britain’s overseas expenditure arising from its overseas
commitments and its position as bankers to the overseas sterling area. The
most important of these costs are overseas military expenditure which rose
from £174 million to ^279 million over the past ten years, and economic
grant assistance to less-developed or dependent territories which rose from £53
million to £88 million; in addition, there are government loans to overseas
countries and multilateral assistance in the form of contributions to inter¬
national agencies. Britain also has to make repayments of capital and interest

from post-war loans from the United States and Canada, the servicing of
which requires about £62 million a year.
At the same time Britain’s private overseas investment has averaged well
over £300 million a year, a considerable portion of the outflow being to the
less-developed countries. Although this is partly offset by private investment
in Britain from overseas, mainly from the United States, in most years the
net flow has been outward.
In 1965 there was a deficit of ^354 million on current and long-term capital
account—less than half the deficit of 1964. A further drawing of $1,400
million (£500 million) was made on the International Monetary Fund in
May 1965. The gold and convertible currency reserves which had fallen during
1964 to £827 million started to increase during 1965 and early in 1966 they
were augmented by the transfer of £316 million from the Government’s
portfolio of dollar securities. The reserves stood at £1,126 million at the end
of August 1966. The full recovery of the balance of payments is regarded by
the authorities as the vital immediate economic aim. Short-term measures have
included the further promotion of exports, a temporary surcharge on imports
(removed in November 1966), support arrangements for sterling in the form
of swaps (reciprocal credit facilities) with a number of overseas central banks,
restriction on overseas investment and efforts to reduce military and other
government expenditure overseas. For the long-term, however, efforts are
being directed towards improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the
economy so as to reduce the demand for imported goods and improve export
performance; and a reshaping of government commitments overseas.
The problems to overcome in achieving a faster rate of growth are in the main
centred on improving industrial efficiency, but of necessity require a variety
of approaches, which are summarised in the National Plan (see p. 242). Among
the most important of these is the work of the Economic Development
Committees in examining the points of weakness in the most important
industries, the work of the Ministry of Technology in fostering the intro¬
duction and development of advanced techniques and industrial training
programmes to meet the need for skilled labour. An Industrial Reorganisation
Corporation is being set up to promote desirable amalgamations and
reorganisations in industry. Taxation policy is being used to strengthen manu¬
facturing industry relative to services and other non-manufacturing activities
with the introduction of investment grants (in place of tax allowances) and a
selective employment tax (see p. 378). This has been accompanied by special
financial assistance to industry in extended development areas where resources
are under-employed and by incentives to improve labour mobility including
legislation providing for redundancy payments and improved re-training
facilities. Efforts are being made to eliminate restrictive practices in both
sides of industry and legislation against monopolies and mergers has been
strengthened.
As in many other countries where full employment has prevailed and the
demands on resources have been strong, Britain has had to deal with
continuing inflationary pressures. The almost uninterrupted upward trend
in prices has resulted principally from the tendency for money incomes
to rise faster than the volume of production, thus raising costs throughout
the economy.
Since 1953 the average annual rate of increase in domestic incomes has
been about 6 per cent, while the increase in the gross domestic product per
242
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK

head of the labour force has been only between 2 and 2^ per cent. Retail
prices rose by 34 per cent between January 1956 and December 1965; over
the same period average weekly earnings of manual workers went up by
65 per cent. Company profits are subject to large cyclical swings, but since
1956 and especially since i960 they have increased more slowly than
employment incomes. Successive governments to contain the pressure of
demand have relied extensively on monetary and fiscal measures; on variations
in the volume and cost of bank credit; on hire-purchase controls; and on
changes in the levels of taxation and public expenditure. More recently,
government policy on prices and incomes has been directed towards relating
increases in money incomes to economic growth by establishing machinery
(see p. 244) to examine wage and salary claims and selected price increases, and
towards increasing public awareness of the need for voluntary restraint of
wage demands in order to preserve reasonable stability in costs and prices.
ECONOMIC PLANNING
A framework of longer-term economic planning and consultation has been
evolved in recent years within which the aim is for increases in productivity,
industrial efficiency and real incomes to be reconciled with a high and stable
level of employment, a favourable balance of payments and the promotion of
social justice. A new government department, the Department of Economic
Affairs (see p. 48) responsible for economic planning was set up in October
1964. It works in close consultation with the Treasury and other government
departments. A Ministry of Technology (see p. 58) was set up at the same
time, to stimulate a more rapid application of scientific and technological
advances in British industry. A number of other bodies dealing with economic
planning and consultation have been in existence for some years; they
include the National Economic Development Council (NEDC), the National
Joint Advisory Council (NJAC) and organisations dealing with the special
problems of Scotland, Wales and the English regions.
The Department of Economic Affairs has been given the responsibility of
framing and supervising the plan for economic development and for the
general co-ordination of action to implement the plan, including, in particular,
policies for industry, the regions, incomes and prices, and economic growth.
It works with representatives of both sides of industry directly and through
the National Economic Development Council.
The department is organised into five inter-related groups: an Economic
Planning Division concerned with the formulation of the plan and its co¬
ordination and with the preparation of medium-term, long-term and very
long-range forecasts of the development of the economy; an Industrial
Policy Division which is closely linked with the NEDC s Economic Develop¬
ment Committees (see below), and considers and reports on the problems
and obstacles to growth in individual industries; an Economic Co-ordination
Division (Home), concerned with prices and incomes policy and public
expenditure programmes including transport policy and defence; an Economic
Co-ordination Division (Overseas) concerned with external relations,*
including Britain’s relations with Europe; and a Regional Policy Division
responsible for regional policies and planning.
The National Plan, covering all sectors of the economy and prepared in
consultation with both sides of industry, was published in September 1965-

Its aim was to increase the gross domestic product by 25 per cent between
1964 and 1970. On this basis, the production of goods and services would go
up by £8,000 million a year, at 1964 prices, by 1970. The plan further aimed
at increasing productivity by 3-4 per cent a year, investment by 5^ per cent
a year and exports by 5 J per cent a year over the plan period. Because of the
measures taken during 1966 to restrict home demand, a revision of the plan’s
targets is being undertaken.
The National Economic Development Council (NEDC) was set up in
February 1962, originally to examine the economic performance of the
nation with particular concern for plans for the future in both the private
and the public sector, to consider uses of national resources and to seek
agreement upon ways of increasing the rate of sound economic growth. The
NEDC was reorganised in November 1964. The principal responsibility for
preparing a national economic plan was taken over by the Department of
Economic Affairs but the NEDC is the designated body for the discussion
of policies and through which the involvement of both sides of industry in
the formulation and implementation of the plan is secured.
The chairman of the NEDC is the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
Others members are the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of
Labour, the Minister of Technology, the chairman of the Prices and Incomes
Board, a number of representatives from both sides of industry, and an
independent. The Council, which meets at frequent intervals, is assisted by
the National Economic Development Office, whose permanent staff (not
members of the Civil Service) is headed by a Director-General. It has
published a number of reports on factors affecting the rate of growth of the
economy, including the results of inquiries into the prospects for growth of a
cross-section of industry. To assist it in this aspect of its work a series of
Economic Development Committees have been formed. They are concerned
with particular industries and consist of representatives of management,
trade unions, government departments and others with special experience.
Long-term planning of public expenditure has been much developed by
consecutive governments and annual surveys have been undertaken since 1961.
The estimates given in the 1965 survey are based on the present Government’s
decision to reshape public expenditure and to limit its growth, other than that
of the investment of the nationalised industries and certain public corporations,
in the period 1964-65 to 1969-70 to an average of 4J per cent a year at constant
prices. The White Paper, Public Expenditure: Planning and Control (Cmnd.
2915), published in February 1966 containing the results of this survey,
provides five-year guide-lines for the development of each of the main
services with specific limits for 1966-67 and 1969-70. The limits for 1966-67
so far as they concern expenditure for which provision has to be voted
annually by Parliament have been applied to the current Parliamentary
Estimates and the limits for 1969-70 are contained in the National Plan.
In recent years it has become increasingly recognised that a generally stable
price level combined with sustained economic growth can only be achieved
within the framework of an incomes policy, designed to keep the rise in money
incomes broadly in line with the long-term rate of growth in national
production.
The present Government’s incomes policy since 1964 has been developed
in three stages in consultation with representatives of management and

workers. First, the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, Prices and
Incomes, signed in December 1964, formulated the lines of action to be
taken by the Government and by management and workers.
The next step was the setting up in April 1965 of a National Board for
Prices and Incomes. The Board investigates all questions of productivity,
prices and incomes which are referred to it by the Government. It sits in
private making as thorough an examination of the issues involved as possible,
using evidence provided both by the parties involved and by outside enquiries.
Since it was first set up the Board has published some 18 reports on references
made to it and a General Report (Cmnd 3087) on its activities.
The third stage was the publication of a White Paper, Prices and Incomes
Policy (Cmnd. 2639), setting out considerations which should guide all
concerned with prices and incomes policy. General guidance is given on the
cases in which it would be appropriate to raise or reduce prices. It also
indicated a ‘norm’ (subject to revision) of 3 to 3^ per cent as an average rate
of annual increase of money incomes per head, which is consistent with
stability in the general level of prices.
In September 1965 in view of the urgent need to make its prices and incomes
policy more effective, the Government announced its intention of introducing
legislation. In the interim a voluntary ‘early warning system’ was operated,
the purpose of which was to give the Government adequate opportunity of
considering proposals to increase wages or prices and whether to refer them
to the Prices and Incomes Board. Under the scheme proposed price increases
were notified to the appropriate government department while pay claims and
settlements were notified to the Trades Union Congress. Where the Govern¬
ment consider there was a prima facie case for reference to the Board there
was a further stand-still period of normally two to three months while the
Board reported. This system remains as part of the Government’s object of
establishing a prices and incomes policy on a voluntary basis.
The Prices and Incomes Act which received the Royal Assent in August 1966
established on a statutory basis the National Board for Prices and Incomes.
It gives the Government power by Order for a period of 12 months to
require notification of increases in prices and charges, company distributions
and the terms and conditions of employment. It also contains temporary
powers, which can only be brought into operation for a period of 12 months
by Order in Council and are not renewable, to direct that prices and wages
shall not be increased or to reverse any increase which it considers to be
unjustified.
On 20th July 1966 a stand-still on prices and incomes was announced in which,
for a period of 12 months, productivity would be allowed to catch up with
the excessive increases in incomes which had been taking place. Broadly, it is
intended that for the first six months (up to the end of December 1966)
increases in prices and incomes should be avoided altogether, followed by a
period of severe restraint in the first half of 1967. In addition to wages and
prices the stand-still also covers other forms of remuneration, such as
directors’ fees, and company distributions.
The aim of regional economic planning is a full and balanced development of
the country’s resources to help achieve a faster and steadier expansion in
national output.
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY
245
Northern Ireland
A system of regional councils and boards was established in Great Britain
in 1965 to provide effective machinery for regional economic planning. The
regional Economic Planning Councils consist of about 25 part-time members
widely representative of experience in each area. The councils have no
executive powers; they assist in the formulation of regional plans and advise
on their implementation and the implications for the regions of national
policies. The regional Economic Planning Boards consist of civil servants
representing the main government departments concerned with aspects of
regional planning in their respective areas. Their task is to prepare draft plans
for the region and to co-ordinate the economic planning work of the govern¬
ment departments and oversee the detailed work on regional studies and plans.
For the purposes of the regional planning machinery, Scotland and Wales
are each being treated as single units, and England has been divided into
eight regions (Northern, Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, East
Anglia, South East, South West, West Midlands and North West).
Detailed studies of the regions have been put in hand (in some cases studies
or development programmes for all or part of a region had been published or
commenced before the councils were appointed). Studies of the North West
and West Midland regions were published in 1965 and a development plan
for Scotland up to 1970 was published in 1966.
The Northern Ireland Government has set up an economic council, comprised
of representatives of both sides of industry and other interests, to examine
means of furthering the economic development of Northern Ireland. Since
the Northern Ireland Government has its own government departments, it
was not necessary to set up a special planning board. A plan for Northern
Ireland’s economic development up to 1970 was published in 1965.
INDUSTRY
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The United Kingdom was the first country in the world to become highly
industrialised, and today fourteen people work in mining, manufacturing and
building for every one in agriculture. It is the world’s third largest exporter of
manufactured goods, and the range of its industrial manufactures reflects its
position as one of the most important workshops of the world.
Location
|
Greater London and
the South-eastern
Region
The factors that have influenced the location of industry in Britain are many
and various. During the rapid industrialisation of the nineteenth century
one of the most important influences was the proximity of coal, the major
source of power, particularly when it was associated with ease of access to
other raw materials such as iron ore in the West Midlands and salt (for
chemicals) in Cheshire, and to ports. Improved communications and the
rapid growth of electricity as a source of power have enabled advantage to be
taken of other sites—for example, those near to big consumer markets and
more plentiful supplies of labour. The main areas of industrial concentration
are still, with one exception (London), the areas which saw the beginning of
Britain’s industrial greatness and which, with two exceptions (London and
Belfast), are on or near coalfields; but many smaller and more widely dispersed
centres of industry have grown up, notably in southern England.
During the inter-war period there was a tendency for the newer industries,
such as those manufacturing motor vehicles, electrical goods and rubber
products, to develop rapidly in the south (especially in and around Greater
London) and in the Midlands. In the last twenty years the older industrial
areas which specialised in the great staple industries—coalmining, steel,
shipbuilding, heavy engineering and textiles and which remain for the most
part of considerable importance, have also acquired a much wider and more
diversified industrial base, in part the result of Government action and
encouragement. The electronic products, instruments, industrial components,
clothing, man-made fibres and the newer chemical products are examples of
industries located throughout Britain today.
A brief description follows of the location of British industry, grouped
according to broad geographical areas.
London, situated at the head of ocean navigation on the Thames estuary,
is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, probably still the world’s
most important financial centre, one of the world’s three largest cities (with
Tokyo and New York) and one of the world’s three largest ports (with New
York and Rotterdam). Greater London (see p. 69), including the urbanised
fringe areas within 50 miles of Charing Cross, has a working population of
over six million, of whom over a third are in manufacturing industry.
London is the main centre in Britain of the clothing and food and drink
industries, of printing, of cinema film production, and of the manufacture
of furniture, materials for the arts, precision instruments and many other
specialised products. Small firms predominate in many of these industries
and the average size of manufacturing firms (particularly in the County of
London) is well below the national average. London, especially its outer ring,

is also an important area for light engineering, chemicals and consumer
goods and has some heavy engineering plants and a number of leading
research establishments. Towards the periphery of the London conurbation
and in the new urban development outside it, industry, particularly the
electronics and a variety of consumer goods industries, has been expanding
rapidly; some of the largest aircraft plants are in these areas, for example at
Weybridge and Hatfield, as well as the factories, at Dagenham, Luton and
Dunstable, of two of the five main motor vehicle manufacturers. Along the
lower Thames and Medway estuaries there are large oil refineries as well as
some smaller shipyards, a variety of engineering works and major concentra¬
tions of the paper and pulp and cement industries.
The Channel coast has been much developed for tourist traffic and as a place
for retirement. A great part of the coast eastwards from Poole (population
95,500) and Bournemouth (151,000) consists of built-up areas, which from
Brighton (163,000) eastwards are partly dormitories for people working in
London. Portsmouth (216,000) is a naval port and has some shipbuilding and
general manufactures. Southampton (209,000) is the largest port in Britain
for ocean-going liners and its industries include ship repairing, oil refining,
cable-making, electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover, Folkestone and
Newhaven are packet ports.
Devon and Cornwall have a considerable tourist trade and some popular
retirement areas. Bristol, the largest city of the south-west (431,000), is a
leading port and commercial centre with aircraft, aero-engines, tobacco, food
processing, paper, printing and other industries and nearby, at Avonmouth,
are important non-ferrous metal and basic chemicals plants. Gloucester
(72,000), originally an inland port and commercial town, Cheltenham (75,000),
originally a resort town, and the area between and adjacent to them produce
a variety of manufactures, including machinery, instruments and accessories
and the well-known West of England cloth. Swindon (98,000), besides its
railway workshops, has important engineering works. Bath (83,000), originally
a resort town and the centre of an agricultural district, has become noted
for engineering and other manufacturing.
Besides being one of the most productive agricultural regions, the eastern
counties possess some sizeable towns. Ipswich (121,000) and Grantham
(26,000) are noted for agricultural machinery and implements, and Norwich
(120,000) for footwear and food manufacture. Food canning and freezing,
based mainly on locally grown produce, have developed rapidly. Scunthorpe
(70,000) in Lincolnshire, is an important steel-making centre, and the ports
of Great Yarmouth (53,000) and Grimsby (95,000) have extensive fish
processing plants, the latter also having a growing chemicals industry.
The main industrial area of the Midlands—the West Midlands conurbation-
stretches from Birmingham (1,103,500) through the Black Country to
Wolverhampton (150,000) and includes portions of Staffordshire, Worcester¬
shire and Warwickshire. It has an unusually wide variety of industry, including
notably the manufacture of metals, electrical and engineering products of all
kinds, and also jewellery, rubber products, chemicals and domestic metalware.
The largest concentrations of motor vehicle manufacture, including com¬
ponents and accessories, in the United Kingdom are situated in the Midlands,
at Coventry (330,000) and Birmingham and, farther to the south, at Cowley,
near Oxford (107,000). The smaller conurbation of North Staffordshire,
centred on Stoke-on-Trent (277,000), is devoted chiefly to the manufacture of
pottery and china and to coalmining, although other industries are growing

industrial cities and towns lying outside the main industrial area include
Leicester (267,000) noted for hosiery and knitwear, boots and shoes and
machinery for making these products; Derby (129,000) for general engineering,

at Peterborough (64,000) there are several large engineering woIhe
richest and most highly mechanised coalfield in Britain lies m the norm-east
of the area and continues into Yorkshire. Some of the towns on the coalfield,
such as Mansfield (55,000), have important manufacturing industries,,
particularly textiles.
Manchester (638,000) is the commerical hub of the cotton and man-made
fibre textiles industries, a very important financial and commercial centre and
a major port. It is also one of the chief centres for electric^ arm heavy
engineering and the production of machine tools, petro-chemicals. dyestuffs,
and pharmaceutical goods, while it has a wide range of other manutacrmes.
Most of the cotton and other yarns are spun in Bolton (158,00c). Oldham
(111,500), and Rochdale (86,500), and at Stockport (m Cheshire! ,142.000,
farther to the north lie the weaving towns of Burnley (T^000*- Nelso°
(31 000), Blackburn (103,000), Accrington (38,000) and Darwen (29,00c);
Preston (109,000) and Bury (63,000) both have spinning and weavmg plants.
In the majority of these towns engineering industries, notably the manufacture
of printing, paper making, textile and electrical machinery and heavy
commercial vehicles (especially in the Chorley-Leyland area) are. nowever
more important than cotton, which has been declining for some years. The
Lancashire coalfield also lies in the Manchester-^ igan area.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of oversea^
trade links Manchester with Merseyside. It passes through the importan
industrial towns of Warrington (75,000) with its metal mdustnes (such ^
wire-drawing), Widnes (54,000) with its chemicals, and Ellesmere Pen
(49 500) with its oil refinery installations, before reaching the Mersey e^umy.

is ship repairing; shipbuilding is a major industry across the over at Bnken-
head (143,000). Many new industries, including electrical engines-the
manufacture of other heavy industrial equipment and, more recently motor
vehicle manufacture, have been established in the Liverpool arey Bam>w

Huddersfield 1132,000? has a reputation for fine woollens and worsteds and
Haktix (95.000 for carpets. In most of the larger centres of the wool industry
a variety of engineering products are manufactured. Leeds, the commercial
capital of the area, has a large ready-made clothing industry and important
engineering plants. Farther south is the heavy engineering centre of Sheffield
(489.000), famous for its high quality steels, cutlery and tools. The area’s
extensive coalfields provide nearly a quarter of Britain’s coal; Doncaster
(87,000). also with tractor and nylon manufacturing, and Barnsley (75,600)
are the largest towns on the coalfield. York (106,000), noted for chocolates and
confectionery manufacture and with important railway workshops, and Hull
(300,000), one of the world’s largest fishing ports and with many manu-
facturing industries, mchiding engineering, vegetable oil processing, paints
and sawmilling, are important industrial towns in the East Riding of Yorkshire.
l he greater part of this region (Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland,
Durham and the North Riding of Yorkshire) is an area of mountains, lakes and
moors and is relatively thinly populated. Most of its population of 3-3
million is concentrated in the coastal strip about 20 miles deep and 45 miles
long, from the coalfields north of the Tyne to the Tees. Within this area the
main centres are Tyneside, including Newcastle upon Tyne (257,500),
Gateshead (101,500), Tynemouth (72,000), South Shields (108,500), Wallsend
149.00c; and Jarrow (26,500); and Tees-side, including Middlesbrough
: 15“.00c; and West Hartlepool (78,500). Other large towns are Sunderland
(iSS.occ . Dardngton (84,000), and Carlisle (71,000).
The whole region is more dependent than other parts of England on
traditional heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manufacture,
shipbuilding and repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical plants
on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe), which
together employ nearly a third of the male workers. This proportion has
been failing steadily as the result of the establishment of industrial estates
and other government measures to attract new types of enterprise and promote
the diversification of industry. It is one of the most important areas for the
manufacture of electrical plant, and the many other industries include mining
machinery, rolling mill plant, earth-moving equipment, machine tools, ropes,
paint, glass, dothing and scientific instruments.
Nearly two-thirds of the population of Wales and Monmouthshire (2-7
million) live in the two counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire. In this
area are the coal mines which, though long worked and operating at increasing
depths, sell produce nearly all Britain’s anthracite and much of its steam and
other specialised coals, and still employ more workers than any branch of
manufacturing industry. Rhondda (98,500) and Merthyr Tydfil (58,000) are
the largest towns in the coalmining area. The steel industry, with some of the
most modern plants in Europe, supplies almost all Britain’s output of tin plate
and a targe proportion of its sheet steel. In the past 30 years many new
industries have been established, often located on government industrial
estates; they include plastics, synthetic fibres, clothing, electronics, motor
vehicle components and light engineering.
The main urban centres are also the three major ports—Cardiff (260,000),
Newport lop-ooc and Swansea (171,000). Milford Haven, a magnificent
deep-water harbour until recently little developed, has two major oil refineries.

In North Wales a number of light industries, notably man-made fibres,
are located in the seaside resorts and other towns, particularly Wrexham
(37,000).
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population (5-2 million) is concentrated in
the central Lowlands, a belt some 65 miles wide and 15 to 30 miles deep
between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The principal cities in this
area are Glasgow (1 million) and Edinburgh (472,000). Clydeside, which
includes the city of Glasgow, is the United Kingdom’s largest shipbuilding
and marine engineering centre; it also has a great variety of general engineering
enterprises and other industries. The steel industry, sited mainly in north
Lanarkshire, produces a wide range of products. The electronics equipment
industry is represented by a growing number of firms in such widely dispersed
centres as Glasgow, north Lanarkshire, Dundee and central Fife, as well as
in Edinburgh, where this and other modern industries are expanding alongside
the lon^-established engineering, printing and brewing industries. The new
towns of East Kilbride, Cumbernauld and Glenrothes have growing con¬
centrations of modern industry, while a motor car industry has recently been
established in Renfrewshire and in West Lothian there has been a major
expansion of commercial vehicle building. A fourth new town, Livingston,
was designated in 1962. _ ....
Outside the central Lowland belt there is considerable industrial concen¬
tration in the vicinity of Dundee (185,000) and in Aberdeen (184,000) and
a number of towns outside these areas have been attracting light industries in
recent years. Dundee’s traditional manufacture, jute, has been supplemented
in the last two decades by office machinery, clocks and watches, refrigerators
and electronic products. In north-east Scotland is the largest concentration of
whisky distilleries. , . , 0 ^ ,
Most of northern Scotland is mountainous and much of southern bcotiana
is hilly and rugged. These regions are sparsely populated, but the Scottish
Highlands possess significant resources of hydro-electric power (see p. 274).
There are high-quality tweed and knitwear industries in the valley towns of
the southern uplands and in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland respectively.
Although the area is relatively small and lacking in minerals, there is sub¬
stantial and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around the capital
city of Belfast (412,500). The largest single shipyard in the United Kingdom is
sited in Belfast and other long-established activities include the manufacture
of marine engines, ropes, twine, tobacco and clothing. Northern Ireland has
also long been an important centre for textiles; it is particularly well-known
for linen but the textile industry is now extensively diversified. Northern
Ireland is one of the most important areas in Europe for man-made fibres
production and provides about one-fifth of Britain’s output. There has
also been extensive development in automobile components, oil-well
equipment, electronic instruments, telephone switchgear, toys, shoes, carpets
and synthetic rubber.
The Structure
of Industry
The pattern of ownership and organisation in industry is varied. Personal,
corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a number of different
forms and all are important in the economy. Industrial enterprises vary
from the many small workshops to vast organisations such as the Nationa
Coal Board, a public corporation with about 450,000 employees; Imperial
Chemical Industries Ltd., a limited liability company which, with ^s sub¬
sidiaries, employs some 125,000 persons in the United Kingdom; and the
Role of Public
Enterprise
INDUSTRY 25I
Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd., a co-operative society with over 50,000
employees.
Throughout the first half of the twentieth century the growth of the social
services, especially health, education and housing, led to the progressively
greater influence of the public sector of the economy. There was also an
increase in the State’s direct participation in productive and commercial
activities, particularly in the decade 1940-50. State participation is effected
mainly through special statutory bodies set up to deal with a particular activity.
Such bodies, though not part of a government department, are under a
considerable but varying degree of public control (see p. 258). The most
important of these statutory bodies are the public corporations which operate
major industries and services in the public interest. Altogether over 9 per cent
of the labour force works for these bodies, while another 14 per cent is almost
equally divided between central and local government.
The public corporation today is, generally speaking, a public body having
a clearly defined and specific task. Its managing board and its staff are chosen
for their experience and competence in a particular field; they are not civil
servants, and although they are accountable to Parliament for their actions
in a variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring
departments who are responsible for the management of the corporations.
Certain of the corporations are self-supporting; others receive Exchequer grants
to help them in carrying out the duties with which they have been charged.
Before the second world war, a number of public corporations were
established in those industries and services where it was considered that the
national interest required co-ordination or control by a public authority.
Their constitutions had no standard pattern and their governing bodies
differed in the method of appointment and in composition.
Immediately after the second world war, the nationalisation Acts set up
public corporations to run certain major industries and services, including
coalmining, inland transport, gas supply, electricity generation and supply,
and civil air transport. These post-war corporations are less varied in the
structure of their governing bodies, which are appointed by the responsible
minister.
The following corporations, the organisation and functions of which are
described in other chapters, are now operating or controlling large-scale
industries or services:
Atomic Energy: The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.

Airways, the British Airports Authority.

Mining and
Quarrying
Manufacturing
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Much the most important of the British extractive industries is coalmining.
The coalmining industry of Great Britain (see p. 266) is operated as a single
co-ordinated enterprise under the direction of the National Coal Board.
Nearly all other mining and quarrying (iron ore, sand, gravel, chalk,
limestone, salt, tin, slate, oil shale and china clay) is undertaken by private
enterprises, usually owned and operated by limited liability companies.
About 85,000 workers are employed in mining and quarrying, excluding
coalmining.
Most manufacturing is in the hands of private enterprise. Exceptions include
fissile materials and radioactive isotopes made by the Atomic Energy
Authority, locomotives and rolling-stock built in the workshops of the
Railways Board, and military equipment and supplies made in establishments
of the defence services. Staff of the Stationery Office do some printing and
bookbinding, while the repair, and to a limited extent the construction, of
post office equipment is carried on in factories run by the Post Office. Certain
factories giving employment to the severely disabled are operated by Remploy
Ltd., a non-profit-making public company financed on the Vote of the Ministry
of Labour, which appoints the directors (see p. 430). The equity of one large
iron and steel company, Richard Thomas and Baldwins, is held by a
government agency, the Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency
(see p. 286). The Government also holds 51 per cent of the equity of a major
oil company, British Petroleum Limited, and has a controlling interest in a
few other companies.
A new departure is the setting up of an Industrial Reorganisation Corpora¬
tion by the Government in 1966 with resources of up to £150 million provided
by the Exchequer. It is empowered to participate in schemes for concen¬
tration, rationalisation and modernisation of industry, in particular the
merging and regrouping of firms into larger units equipped to take greater
advantage of present day trends.
Surveys of the size of all manufacturing establishments employing more
than 10 persons are made periodically by the Ministry of Labour; the results
of the most recent of these surveys show that nearly a third of all employees
in such establishments are in those employing from 100 to 499 persons, while
slightly over a third are in establishments employing 1,000 or more persons.
A high proportion of the biggest establishments are in the heavy industries,
while the average size of establishments in industries making consumer goods
is smaller than in manufacturing industries as a whole. Comparisons with
results obtained in earlier surveys on similar lines suggest that there is a slow
but significant trend towards an increase in the average size of manufacturing
establishments.
The size of establishments is not in itself an indication of the size of
manufacturing enterprises, as a single enterprise may own several establish¬
ments, not all of them necessarily engaged in the same or similar activities.
The most recent analysis of manufacturing enterprises by size (employment)
is provided by the Report of the Census of Production for i95^# enter¬
prise, as defined in the Census, normally consists of either a single firm or a
holding company together with its subsidiaries. Just over half of all employ¬
ment in British manufacturing industries in 1958 was accounted for by about
950 large private enterprises employing 1,000 or more people, the largest
70 or so accounting roughly for a quarter. A further indication of the size
of companies is the value of assets employed. Those of the largest, the Imperial
Chemical Industries group, total over £1,000 million, while there are some
40 companies registered in Britain with net assets of over £100 million.

In some industries a small number of big companies and their subsidiaries
are responsible for most of the total production. Examples are oil refining,
steel making, non-ferrous metal smelting, the manufacture of motor vehicles
and components, aircraft and aero-engines, heavy electrical equipment,
bicycles, tobacco, cement, and basic chemicals. Shares in these companies
are usually distributed among a great number of holders and it is rare for a
few large holders to have a controlling interest. For example, five of the
largest public companies each have more than 100,000 shareholders. In recent
years there has been a relatively large number of mergers, leading to larger
units of control; and in some industries, notably brewing, pharmaceuticals,
aircraft, textiles, electrical products and newspaper and magazine publishing,
there have been increases in concentration. There has also been a growth of
large industrial holding companies, controlling a wide range of subsidiary
companies with a diversity of industrial interests.
An account of some of the principal manufacturing industries is given on
PP- 285-308.
In building and civil engineering, large-scale work is usually carried out by
private contractors, although the Ministry of Public Building and Works is
the largest single employer of building labour while nearly 45 per cent of
the industry’s output is for public authorities.
Building firms may be divided into those undertaking general building and
civil engineering work and those concerned with highly specialised work,
many of which operate outside as well as inside the building industry.
Building is an industry of small firms; more than three-quarters of the firms
employ fewer than 20 employees. For a fuller account of the building and
civil engineering industries, see p. 282.
From the middle of the nineteenth century, private industrial undertakings
have increasingly entered into voluntary association for a number of different
purposes. Some of the more important of these purposes may be classified
as follows:
1. The provision of common services, the exchange of information, liaison
with the Government, and representation of their members’ point of
view.
2. The regulation of trading practices, sometimes including the regulation
of prices (see p. 262).
3. Negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions of work.
Associations for the first and third of these purposes cover, with varying
completeness, most of British industry, but there are wide sectors of industry
where there are no collective agreements to regulate trading practices.
Employers’ organisations which deal with labour matters usually consist of
firms engaged in the same type of operation or manufacturing process. Trade
associations mainly concerned with representations to the Government,
provision of common services or the regulation of trading practices are built
up round a product or an allied group of products. In an industrial sector
concerned wholly with an allied group of products, a single association may
undertake all the required functions.
There are about 80 national federations and probably altogether about
1,500 employers’ organisations (mostly regional or local, and members or
branches of the national federations) all concerned with negotiation of wages

and conditions of work. The number of manufacturers’ associations concerned
with providing common services is not known precisely, but according to a
survey carried out between 1953 and 1956 by Political and Economic Planning
(an independent research organisation) some 1,300 were in existence, varying
greatly in importance, structure and activities.
The central body representing British industry nationally is the Confedera¬
tion of British Industry (CBI), incorporated by Royal Charter in July 1965.
This was established by the amalgamation of three former bodies, the British
Employers Confederation (BEC) which used to represent employers on labour
questions, the Federation of British Industries (FBI) formerly the chief
spokesman on economic, commercial and production matters, and the
National Association of British Manufacturers (NABM), representing mainly
industrial firms of small or medium size. The CBI is recognised by the
Government as a channel for consultation between government departments
and representatives of private employers as a whole. It acts as an advisory
and consultative body for its members, providing them with information and
statistics, ascertaining their collective views and representing them nationally
to the Government and the public and also internationally, for example in the
Council of European Industrial Federations. CBI representatives sit on a
number of government advisory committees, on other statutory bodies and
on voluntary bodies concerned with matters affecting industry.
The CBI membership consists of approximately 13,000 individual firms
and 280 trade associations and upwards of 50 employers’ organisations,
as well as the nationalised industries. It has a regional organisation in the
United Kingdom and is widely represented abroad.
In matters of common concern the CBI often acts jointly with the Chambers
of Commerce. These bodies are open to all kinds of producers and traders
and exist to promote the interests of local industry and commerce. The
Association of British Chambers of Commerce, founded in i860, is the central
organisation to which 101 local chambers of commerce (together with 22
British Chambers of Commerce operating in foreign countries) are affiliated.
In Scotland there is an additional central organisation, the Council of Scottish
Chambers of Commerce, and in Northern Ireland, the Association of Northern
Ireland Chambers of Commerce.
The Government can influence industrial development in a number of ways
through fiscal and monetary policy, through the level of public expenditure,
through the policies of publicly owned enterprises, by physical controls, by
inducements, by exhortation and by the provision of services, information and
advice. There are relatively few physical controls over industry: the chief
ones, apart from labour legislation and certain export and import controls
over a small range of products, derive from powers to stop new building or
changes in the use of land and from certain powers to investigate and forbid
monopolies and restrictive practices.
A system has grown up whereby a particular government department acts
as the main point of contact, or ‘production or sponsor department, for each
major industry, but there is a close and growing association between industry
and the Government through such channels as the National Economic
Development Council and the Economic Development Committees (see
p. 243).
The department through which the Government’s relations with trade and
industry are chiefly conducted is the Board of Trade (which has regional
offices in the principal industrial centres) and its responsibilities cover a

wide range of industries and materials. The Ministry of Technology, which
was set up in 1964) is concerned wdth the application of advanced technology
and new processes in industry. It is, therefore, the sponsor department for
the mechanical and electrical engineering industries and for those manufac¬
turing electronics, computers, machine tools, telecommunications equipment,
aircraft and aero-engines. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
is responsible for food processing, the Ministry of Power for iron and steel,
the Ministry of Public Building and Works for building materials, and the
Ministry of Health for medical and surgical goods. The Department of
Economic Affairs, set up in 1964) is responsible for framing plans for
economic development and policies affecting the growth of the economy and
regional development (see p. 242). The DEA works in close association with
the Treasury, which is responsible for fiscal and monetary policy, and with
the other departments concerned with economic development. The Ministry
of Labour is the channel through which manpower policy is conducted. The
Department of Education and Science is responsible for the promotion of
education and for civil science, operating in the main through the research
councils.
There are separate departments of the Northern Ireland Government for
matters within the competence of the Northern Ireland Parliament. The
Ministry of Commerce deals with industry, especially the encouragement of
industrial development.
The Central Statistical Office, which is attached to the Cabinet Office,
provides a comprehensive statistical service. Although departments them¬
selves compile statistics relating to their particular responsibilities, and may
publish them in their own standard publications, the comprehensive statistical
publications are prepared by the Central Statistical Office.
Statistics relating to industrial and economic affairs may be found in its
regular publications: the Monthly Digest of Statistics, the monthly Economic
Trends which also provides a quarterly summary of the balance of payments,
Financial Statistics (monthly), the Annual Abstract of Statistics, the Preliminary
Estimates of National Income and Balance of Payments, published annually
before the Budget, and the fuller National Income and Expenditure Blue Book
issued later in the year. A general survey is also provided in the annual
Economic Report, also published shortly before the Budget. Statistics on
Incomes, Prices, Employment and Production, compiled by the Ministry of
Labour to provide factual information for those engaged in wage negotiations,
is published quarterly. The Digest of Scottish Statistics is published half-yearly
by the Scottish Statistical Office, a Digest of Northern Ireland Statistics at
half-yearly intervals by the Economic Section of the Cabinet Offices of the
Northern Ireland Government, and an annual Digest of Welsh Statistics by
the Office of the Secretary of State for Wales. The main economic and social
statistics for the regions are brought together in the Abstract of Regional
Statistics.
While the Government has no power to direct an individual firm to set up a new
factory or plant in any particular area or site, it has sought, on both economic
and social grounds, to control the expansion of industry in some areas and
to encourage it in others.
One object has been to try to limit the expansion of industry in areas of
concentrated population, such as Greater London or Birmingham; and the
other to induce movement of expanding industry to areas of high unemploy¬
ment or, secondarily, to new or expanded towns taking population from the
256
Northern Ireland
Britain: an official handbook
more congested areas. The negative powers required derive from the Town
and Country Planning Acts in conjunction with the Control of Office and
Industrial Development Act 1965. Under these Acts the consent of the local
planning authoiity is, in general, necessary for any new building, any extension
of a building or any change in the use of an existing building. Where industrial
floor space of more than 5,000 square feet is to be created (1,000 sq. ft. in the
congested Midlands regions and in south-east England), or more than 3,000
sq. ft. of office development in the Metropolitan region (extending 40 miles
from the centre of London), such consent cannot be sought without a certi¬
ficate from the Board of Trade that the development is consistent with the
proper distribution of industry.
Assistance for areas of relatively high unemployment began to be given in
1934 (when the inter-war depression was at its worst) and has been given
ever since, linked to the provision of additional employment for the benefit of
such districts, under successive Acts. The main legislative basis of the Govern¬
ment’s present positive powers was provided by the Local Employment Acts
i960 and 1963. Under the i960 Act, the Government’s powers of assistance
were centred in one department, the Board of Trade, which can name as
‘development districts’ places where high and persistent unemployment exists
or is expected, and can offer a number of inducements to industrialists to
settle or expand there. Specifically, the Board can build factories for leasing
at favourable rents or sale on deferred terms; make a capital grant of 25 per cent
of building costs towards the cost of an industrialist s own factory or for
unusual initial expenses arising solely from the choice of a development
district; and make loans towards working capital or for acquiring premises or
equipment. The appropriate government departments can also make grants
to local authorities for clearing derelict or neglected sites and for improving
basic services.
The industrial estates in the development areas are run by three
Industrial Estates Corporations, one each for England, Wales and Scotland.
These corporations, however, are controlled and financed by the Board of
Trade. ,
The powers to offer such assistance are extended and amended by the
Industrial Development Act. The powers are available over wider ‘develop¬
ment areas’ and, in addition, investment grants not linked to employment, of
40 per cent of approved capital cost are provided in respect of qualifying plant
and machinery used in a process of manufacture, extraction or construction.
Qualifying plant and machinery in other parts of Great Britain attracts grants
at a rate of 20 per cent. These grants replace investment allowances, free
depreciation and the 10 per cent plant machinery grants previously available
under the Local Employment Act 1963.
The Act also permits the Board of Trade to take powers to make additional
assistance available to new projects in the development areas, which provide
additional employment. This takes the form of a building grant at a rate of
up to 35 per cent of the cost or, in the case of firms renting Board of Trade
factories, an initial rent-free period.
Under its own legislation Northern Ireland provides for the payment of
40 per cent of the cost both of new plant and machinery and of new buildings
for the manufacturing, construction and extraction industries in Northern
Ireland. There is also provision for assisting firms by means of loans to carry
out major schemes of re-equipment, to move to another area in particular need
of industrial development or to undertake a rehousing of their business in
association with a major scheme of modernisation and reorganisation.

As an alternative means of assistance the Northern Ireland Government
continues to use its comprehensive and flexible powers authorised under the
Industries Development Acts for projects which offer a reasonable amount of
employment. In such cases capital assistance of 45 per cent would normally
be available instead of the 40 per cent referred to above. For those projects
which offer exceptionally attractive returns in employment or are to be located
in areas in urgent need of development, grants towards operating costs could
also be made available in the initial stages of development. In suitable cases
loans can be made towards capital expenditure on plant, machinery and
buildings and grants may also be made towards such things as the cost of the
removal, including installation, of plant and machinery from an existing factory
to Northern Ireland.
Since i945> 218 new firms have been established in Northern Ireland and
171 schemes of expansion carried out with government assistance, develop¬
ments which at present are employing some 61,300 persons. The Ministry
of Commerce is the Northern Ireland government department concerned with
the administration of this assistance.
Encouragement is given to the development of rural industries. Much of this
work is done under the aegis of the Development Commission1 with finance
from the Development Fund, notably the provision of advice and guidance
to small businesses in rural areas and country towns. In England and Wales
this service is provided by the Rural Industries Bureau acting in consultation
with the Rural Community Councils; in Scotland by the Scottish Country
Industries Development Trust. Finance for small industries in England,
Wales and Scotland is provided by the Rural Industries Loan Fund, also
financed by the Development Commission. The Fund works in close liaison
with the Rural Industries Bureau and the Scottish Country Industries
Development Trust. Another service provided by the Commission in Wales
has been the financing of small factories to stimulate rural industries and to
combat rural depopulation.
In Scotland and Wales there are national organisations devoted to encouraging
the expansion and diversification of industry. The Scottish Council (Develop¬
ment and Industry) is concerned with the economic development of Scotland.
The special problems of the seven crofting counties of Scotland (see p. 325) are
the concern of a public authority, the Highlands and Islands Development
Board. This was set up in 1965 to prepare, control and undertake measures for
the economic and social development of the Highlands and Islands. Its powers
include the making of grants and loans to industrial and other enterprises:
it may also acquire land, provide management services and set up and carry
on businesses.
There are several voluntary associations concerned with the needs of Welsh
industry as a whole notably the Development Corporation for Wales, founded
I959- Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Economic Council was
set up in 1965 to assist in furthering economic growth. The chairman is the
Minister of Commerce and the membership includes representatives of
industry, commerce and the trade unions.
In England certain regions and cities have established industrial development
associations which are concerned with studying local industrial needs and
The Development Commission approves and administers advances by grants or loans
rrorn the Development Fund, established by the Development and Roads Improvements
bund Acts 1909 and 1910. At the present time the Fund may be used to help and
expand agriculture and rural industries and also to promote the development and
improvement of fisheries.

with trying to attract suitable industry. These associations are sponsored
mainly by local authorities and trade associations, but may also include
firms, financial and commercial interests, and individuals in their membership.
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working
of the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members
of each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to
how the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day manage¬
ment. It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister
any information, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In
practice, as the responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy
decisions are reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion
for him to issue a formal directive.
The Minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual
statutory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so
that receipts at least balance outgoings taking one year with another. The
responsible minister is usually empowered (subject to Treasury approval) to
say what shall be done with any surplus revenues which may accrue. As
regards finance of capital expenditure, the present system is that such finance
as cannot be met from internal sources is mainly provided, in the form of
interest-earning loans, by the minister from the Exchequer, bank advances
being used only for normal requirements of short-term capital.
The minister responsible for each nationalised industry must take steps to
see that the interests of the industry’s customers are protected. This is usually
done by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider
complaints and suggestions made to them, and to advise the board or the
minister on the changes they think desirable.
Government policy towards these industries is subject to the approval of
Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are afforded by
debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts, and by
answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible only
if concerned with policy rather than details of administration.
In a White Paper (Cmnd. 1337) issued in April 1961 the Government out¬
lined certain general principles which it believed had to be applied for the
administration of the nationalised industries to be efficient. Among them were
a balancing of revenue accounts over a five-year period, a closer definition of
the financial and economic obligations of the industries, and greater freedom
in price policies. In accordance with these principles, financial objecfives for
the nationalised fuel and power industries and for BEA, the Post Office and
the London Transport Board have since been announced.
In order to ensure that parliamentary discussion of the nationalised industries
is informed and effective, a House of Commons Select Committee on the
Nationalised Industries was established in 1957 to examine the reports and
accounts of the nationalised industries and to report to Parliament. Reports
issued by the committee have so far dealt specifically with the two Scottish
electricity boards, the National Coal Board, the airways corporations,
British Railways, the gas industry and the electricity supply industry. These
reports have discussed problems of ministerial control, organisation, finance
and general policies. A report published in February 1962 reviewed the action
taken by the corporations and the Government in the light of the committee s
recommendations.

Between 1958 and 1965 output in the chemicals and allied industries rose
by per cent; in engineering and electrical goods by 44 per cent; in metal
manufacture by 34 per cent; in vehicles (including aircraft) by 30 per cent;
in paper, printing and publishing by 42 per cent; in clothing and footwear
by 21 per cent (see diagram below).
The increases in production in recent years have been due only to a small
degree to an increase in the labour force but mainly to a variety of factors
influencing productivity, including technical advances in products, machinery
and processes; the rate of fixed capital formation; more intensive competition
and sales promotion and improvements in the management of particular
undertakings.

Productivity
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Gross fixed capital formation at home has continued to increase steadily
even in periods when demand as a whole was slowing down. In 1965 it
amounted to nearly 21 per cent of the gross domestic product and was
estimated to be about 59 per cent greater than in 1958. Part of this rising
investment is linked with the introduction of new techniques and equipment
and in particular of machines and instruments which lessen the demand for
human skill and supervision though they may require more skill from fewer
people. All of this is part of the process known as automation, which is giving
rise to far-reaching changes in the pattern of industry and in the internal
organisation and labour requirements of business enterprises and has already
been responsible for consequential increases in production and efficiency which,
in the long run, are likely to be very large. Much investment, however, still con¬
sists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more traditional kind.
Both the long-term and the short-term growth of productivity thus depend
most directly on the decisions of individual undertakings, and the promotion
of productivity is regarded as primarily a matter for industry though govern¬
ment departments and educational and research establishments also have their
contribution to make. Government budgeting and financial policies also have
a strong influence on the extent and direction of demand. These, therefore,
are framed to a large degree on a realistic assessment of the possibilities of
sustained economic growth.
Leading industrialists have been recruited as advisers in the Department
of Economic Affairs to help overcome specific obstacles to efficiency and
industrial expansion. They work principally through the Economic Develop¬
ment Committees (EDCs), which are offshoots of the National Economic
Development Council. The Committees cover particular sectors of industry
and bring together managements, union and government representatives.
Employers’ associations and trade unions are engaged in activities to raise
industrial productivity. In signing a Joint Statement on Productivity, Prices
and Incomes (see p. 244) representatives of trade unions and employers’
organisations undertook ‘to raise productivity and efficiency so that real
national output can increase’. Employers’ organisations often provide technical
assistance, conduct market surveys, and support schemes of vocational
education and training.
The trade unions in many industries organise special schemes for training
young people, and also a variety of courses designed to give trade unioniste
an understanding of modern management techniques. Private consultants
specialising in management and work study are available to give advice to
firms on measures to increase their productive efficiency; there are also many
specialist institutions, both public and private, concerned with various aspects
of productivity.
The British Productivity Council (BPC) was established by both sides of
industry to stimulate interest in methods of raising productivity. It was set
up in 1952 to continue and develop the work of the Anglo-American Pro¬
ductivity Council. It is an independent body on which are represented the
Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the
Association of British Chambers of Commerce, and the nationalised industries;
its work is financed by contributions from these bodies and by a government
grant-in-aid. Advisory committees have been set up to promote productivity
in the building trades, in agriculture and in retailing. Much of the BPC’s
work is done through 130 local productivity committees and associations
throughout the country. These local organisations arrange meetings, inter¬
factory visits, courses, conferences, film shows and exhibitions.
INDUSTRY
261
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making
body incorporated by Royal Charter. It prepares and promulgates standards
in respect of, inter alia, quality, performance, dimensions, testing methods
and codes of practice. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manufac¬
turers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies the
specification of requirements, thus promoting industrial efficiency. The BSI
is governed by a council consisting of representatives of the main organisations
of employers and workers, professional institutions and the larger government
departments.
The Board of Trade is the department responsible for general aspects of
the promotion of productivity and it administers the government grants to
the BPC and the Council of Industrial Design. The Ministry of Technology,
however, is charged with the function of extending the introduction of
automatic control systems and advanced techniques into industry, sponsors
the BSI and provides technical advisory services. It is also concerned directly
with research into such factors as productivity measurement techniques,
production engineering and fatigue among operators.
A number of other departments have responsibilities which bear on pro¬
ductivity. The Ministry of Labour has an Industrial Relations Service, which
advises firms on personnel management and industrial relations. The
Department of Education and Science and the Scottish Education Department
are responsible for the technical colleges, at which courses are available in
such subjects as work study and industrial engineering. The Ministry of
Public Building and Works provides a Technical Information Service for the
building industry; and the Ministry of Power and the British Productivity
Council sponsor the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food provides a number of advisory services
which aim at encouraging the efficiency of the farming industry in England and
Wales; similar services are provided by the three Scottish agricultural colleges.
Management During the present century and particularly during and since the second
world war, the increasing pace of technical organisational and social change
has made the successful conduct of enterprises dependent on knowledge of,
and practice in, a complex of managerial techniques for dealing with technical
and human problems. In Britain, as elsewhere, there is a growing awareness
of the importance of management as a subject requiring special skills and
knowledge. This has been reflected both in a change in the general educational
qualifications of recruits to management and in the spread of systematic
education and training for management.
The British Institute of Management (BIM) is the central national
management body, independent, non-political and non-profit-making. Its
purpose is to study and promote scientific management, including management
education and training, throughout industry, commerce, and public admini¬
stration. It has nearly 5,000 member companies and over 14,000 individual
members. Management studies and education for management are expanding
rapidly in Britain and have become a recognised feature of higher education
(see p. 165). Graduate Business Schools have been established in London and
Manchester.
Training courses for higher management are held at a few universities,
notably Bristol; by some firms of management consultants; and at the
Administrative Staff College at Henley-on-Thames (normally of somewhat
longer duration) and Ashridge, Berkhamsted. The larger firms, especially
those with wide-ranging responsibilities, often provide general management
262
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
courses for the training of senior executives, and systems of informal training
within an organisation are numerous. There are also various bodies concerned
with specialised branches of management, for example the Institute of
Personnel Management, the Institution of Works Managers, the Institute
of Office Management and, on the sales side, the Institute of Marketing and
Sales Management.
The growing number of professional personnel working as management
consultants—now probably over 2,000—and the use of the services of
independent management selection firms in the appointment of senior staff
are indications of the interest in the science of management in Britain.
Monopolies and Legislation in force in the United Kingdom for dealing with restrictions in
Restrictive trade and industry, either by agreements (formal or informal) between
Practices suppliers, or by monopolies which dominate the market, is described below.
The Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 provides for the registration
and judicial examination of restrictive agreements. It requires the entry in a
public register of the particulars of a wide range of restrictive agreements
(including those relating to common prices, approved lists of dealers and the
limitation of production) which affect the supply or processing of goods for
the United Kingdom market. The Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agree¬
ments is responsible for keeping the register and for bringing the agreements
before the Restrictive Practices Court set up under the Act. The Court, which
includes laymen but is presided over by one of Her Majesty’s judges, is, in
effect, responsible for deciding whether or not an agreement is in the public
interest. If the parties to an agreement fail to satisfy the Court that any
restriction in their agreement produces one or more of seven beneficial
effects set out in the Act, and that the restriction is not unreasonable, having
regard to the balance between the benefit it confers and any public detriment
likely to result from its operation, that restriction must be found contrary to
the public interest. Agreements are void in respect of restrictions so found.
The Court can make orders preventing the parties from operating their
agreement, or from making new arrangements having the same effect. Agree¬
ments relating exclusively to exports are not subject to this procedure but
have to be notified to the Board of Trade. The first full hearing before the
Court took place in October 1958.
Monopolies and kindred arrangements (except those within the scope of
the Restrictive Practices Court) in the circumstances indicated in the
Monopolies and Mergers Acts 1948 and 1965 may be referred by the Board
of Trade to the Monopolies Commission for investigation and report. The
Board of Trade, in co-operation with the production departments concerned,
take appropriate action on the reports but no Order can be made without the
approval of Parliament.
The 1965 Act strengthened and extended the legislation on monopolies.
It reorganised and enlarged the Monopolies Commission; provided for the
investigation, at the reference of the Board of Trade, of services and of
proposed or recently completed mergers; makes special provision for news¬
paper mergers; and improves and extends the Government’s powers for
taking action on the basis of the Monopolies Commission reports including
new powers to prohibit mergers and break up undesirable monopolies and
mergers. The Commission has to date presented 32 reports, of which three
dealt with mergers.
Under the 1956 Act collective enforcement of resale price maintenance
was prohibited, but individual suppliers remained free to enforce resale
INDUSTRY
263
prices in the courts. The Resale Prices Act 1964 makes minimum resale price
maintenance unlawful, except in respect of classes of registered goods for
which temporary exemption has been sought under the provisions of the Act.
Where resale price maintenance is prohibited, it is also unlawful to notify
to dealers prices stated or calculated to be understood as the minimum price
which may be charged on the resale of goods in the United Kingdom, or to
seek to maintain such prices by withholding supplies. Suppliers may continue
to practise resale price maintenance on registered goods, pending a decision
by the Restrictive Practices Court as to whether a case for exemption has
been made out against the criteria in the Act. Periodically, the Registrar of
Restrictive Trading Agreements issues lists of classes of goods in respect of
which the Court has refused to make an Order exempting them from the terms
of the Act.
FUEL AND POWER
The main primary sources of energy currently used in Britain are coal,
petroleum and, to a small extent, water power, nuclear energy and natural
gas; secondary sources produced from these are electricity, gas and coke.
Coal, mined within the country, supplies slightly under two-thirds of
primary energy and it will remain the principal source for many years to come.
I or supplies of crude petroleum Britain is virtually dependent on imports.
Water power resources are small. A large-scale programme is in hand for the
construction of nuclear power stations. Most of the natural gas used is at
present imported in liquefied form, but the discovery of an extensive gasfield
under the North Sea in 66 from which natural gas in commercial
quantities is available opens up an additional source of energy.
The pattern of primary energy consumption has been changing considerably
in recent years. The proportion of total energy provided by coal has been
declining steadily in relation to oil, the latter’s share having risen from one-
fifth in 1958 to over one-quarter in 1961 and to over one-third in 1965.
Trends in consumption are shown in Table 14 and in the diagram on p. 265.
The fuel and power industries, with the exception of petroleum, are under
public ownership. General responsibility for ensuring the effective and co¬
ordinated development of fuel and power resources lies with the Minister
of Power. He is assisted in the formulation of energy policy by an Energy
Advisory Council. Fuel research is undertaken by the fuel and fuel-using
industries. The Minister of Power also has an Advisory Council on Research
and Development.

INDUSTRY
265
In general, fuel and power industries require heavy capital investment in
long-term projects and both internal resources and borrowing are used to
raise the large sums needed. Until 1956 long-term borrowing by the cor¬
porations was mainly through the issue of stock, except in the case of the
coal industry, which borrowed direct from the Exchequer. Under the Finance
Act 1956 and subsequent legislation, all state-owned corporations were given
power to raise money by means of Exchequer advances from the responsible
minister with the approval of the Treasury; since then, all the corporations
have done so, and issues of stock have been suspended. Investment by the
nationalised fuel and power industries is estimated to amount to £862 million
in 1965-66 and is likely to reach £1,050 million in 1966-67.
The responsible ministers—the Minister of Power in England and Wales
and the Secretary of State in Scotland—are required by statute to set up
consultative councils for each of the nationalised industries to ensure the
protection of the interests of consumers of fuel. Councils were established

for coal in 1947, for electricity in 1948 and for gas in 1949; each consisting
of a chairman and from 20 to 30 unpaid members appointed from nominations
put forward by interested bodies selected by the ministers as representing
consumers. In the electricity and gas supply industries councils and commit¬
tees have been formed on an area and district basis; for coal there are councils
at national level only.
Coal has been worked in Britain for over 700 years and an organised coal¬
mining industry has been in existence for over 300 years, some 200 years
longer than in any other country. British coal exports dominated the world
market until about 1910. By 1913—the peak production year—the industry
was producing 287 million tons of coal, exporting 94 million tons and
employing over a million workers. Economic depression in Britain and
mounting competition in overseas markets caused a decline during the inter¬
war years (1919-39) and both inland consumption and exports fell substan¬
tially, bringing a reduction in the number of pits in operation. Measures were
introduced to rationalise production in larger and more efficient units. During
the second world war the industry came under the control of the government.
In 1947 the coal mines passed into public ownership by means of the Coal
Industry Nationalisation Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board as
a statutory corporation to manage the industry.
The National Coal Board (NCB) consists of a chairman and between eight
and eleven members appointed by the Minister of Power. The NCB has the
exclusive monopoly to extract coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to
license private operators to work small pits and open-cast sites. It has no
monopoly in distribution, and retail sales remain largely in private hands, but
it has, however, some retail depots and makes bulk sales to large industrial
consumers.
The NCB is responsible for the day-to-day running and the commercial
management of the industry, but is answerable to the minister (and through
him, to Parliament) for its efficiency. The minister has power to issue
directives on matters affecting the public interest, and to authorise borrowings
to finance capital investment.
The 483 collieries in operation at the end of March 1966 were grouped into
37 areas, which are the basic units for commercial management. The areas
in turn are grouped into eight geographical zones which roughly correspond
to the main coal-bearing regions; in each zone, a senior resident executive of
the NCB is responsible for co-ordination and for certain common-user
services. Plans to amalgamate the areas will reduce the total to about 17 by
1969-70.
Coal consumption in Britain increased by an average annual rate of nearly
4 million tons between 1947 and 1956; inland sales fell sharply between 195
and 1959 and large stocks of coal accumulated at pit heads. Growing competi¬
tion from oil, increasing efficiency in the use of coal and reduced requirements
of the gas, steel and other industries have contributed to the fall in demand.
Since 1963 undistributed end-of-year stocks have been maintained at about
18-20 million tons. The fall in consumption is shown in Table 15.
Nearly two-fifths of total output is consumed by the electricity authorities
and over one-quarter by domestic and industrial users together. Coke ovens
and the gas industry are other large users. Consumption by the electricity
industry has increased by one-quarter since 1961 to 69 million tons in 1965,
INDUSTRY

Manpower

267
whereas the requirements of all the other main classes of consumer have
declined. In the case of domestic users this fall has been slightly offset by
increased purchases of solid smokeless fuels.
Coal exports have fallen heavily since the second world war due mainly,
at first, to increased internal consumption and, later, to keener competition.
Exports fell from the post-war peak of 19 million tons in 1949 to 3-8 million
tons, valued at £19 million in 1965. The principal markets are the Netherlands,
France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, the
Irish Republic and Sweden.
It has been estimated that Britain’s workable reserves of coal will last for
about 200 years at current rates of consumption. Howrever, the very fact that
the British industry was developed so early has meant that many of the best
seams of coal are now worked out; every year coal has to be mined from deeper
and thinner seams and productivity can be maintained only by a high level of
re-equipment and constant modernisation.
The main coal-bearing areas are: (1) the Yorkshire, Derbyshire and
Nottinghamshire field, which produces about 48 per cent of the total output,
(2) the Durham and Northumberland field, (3) the South Wales field, and
(4) the Scottish field. Other important coal-bearing areas are those of Lanca¬
shire and the West Midlands (Staffordshire and Warwickshire).
The main trends in coal production and manpower since 1950 are shown
in Table 15.

According to forecasts by the Ministry of Power, the fall in coal consump¬
tion shown in Table 15 is likely to continue, but requirements may be
stabilised at about 170-180 million tons in 1970. The NCB plans to improve
the competitive position of coal by restricting production to the most efficient
pits. Between 1966 and 1969-70 about one-third of the pits are scheduled to
be closed and the total labour force will fall by 22 per cent to about 333,000
colliery workers. Productivity has risen by over 25 per cent since 1961, and
three-quarters of output now comes from new or reconstructed collieries,
some with a daily output of 6,000 tons and a few of up to 8,000 tons; at
mechanised faces output averages 6-7 tons per shift as compared with 3-8 tons
268

at non-mechanised faces, the average for all faces being about 5J tons. In 1965,
output per manshift at NCB mines rose by nearly 4 per cent to i-8 tons, with
35,000 fewer workers. Among measures contributing to higher productivity
are new designs for loading and mechanical handling, improved layouts for
pit-bottoms and the extension of horizon mining. Experimental remotely
controlled longwall faces have proved successful at two Midlands collieries
and are to be installed in others. The Bevercotes colliery in the East Midlands
is the first in the world to be planned as a fully mechanised and automated
pit from the coal face to the surface.
The National Coal Board raises capital, including working capital, by borrow¬
ing directly from the Exchequer. At present there is a statutory limit of
£750 million on such borrowing, but borrowing above £700 million must be
authorised by Order in Council. Within these limits the Board may, with the
permission of the Minister of Power, borrow temporarily (by way of overdraft
or otherwise). The greater proportion of investment, however, is financed
from internal resources.
Capital expenditure by the industry totalled £462 million from 1947 t° 1955
and about ^790 million in the nine years 1956 to end-March 1964. At the end
of the 1964-65 financial year the total capital debt to the Exchequer amounted
to about £960 million. In 1965 a fresh study was made of the NCB’s capital
structure, and legislation was enacted to effect a capital reorganisation,
involving the writing off of ^415 million of the existing debt. As a result, the
total debt to the Exchequer at the end of March 1965 was reduced to £545
million.
Under the nationalisation statute, the NCB has been required to break even
on its current account (taking one year with another) after meeting all proper
charges including provision for reserves. It has made surpluses in some years
and deficits in others. In certain areas, such as Scotland, Lancashire and Wales,
deficits have been persistent, and profits from the areas of high productivity,
for instance, the Midlands, have been inadequate to cover the losses sustained.
By March 1965 the accumulated deficit on the current account had reached
3^91 million which was included in the ^4I5 million to be written off (see
above). Interest payments and depreciation provisions will be reduced as a
result of this writing off.
To assist the redeployment of manpower and the elimination of uneco¬
nomic colliery capacity, the 1965 Coal Industry Act authorises the Ministry
of Power to make grants, with contributions on an equal basis from the NCB,
to meet expenditure up to a limit of £30 million over the five years to
igyi.
The NCB has three research organisations: a Coal Research Establishment,
at Stoke Orchard, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, providing facilities for
fundamental research; a Mining Research Establishment, for the investigation
of underground problems, at Isleworth, Middlesex; and a Central Engineering
Establishment for developing new machines and testing equipment, near
Bretby, Derbyshire. In 1959 the Board set up a new department concerned
primarily with the further development of new processes for making smokeless
fuels. In 1947 the NCB took over the Coal Survey, a national organisation
for surveying coal resources within Britain; it has 7° laboratories in the various
coalfields.
A number of autonomous research associations receiving grants from the
NCB and the Ministry of Technology include the British Coal Utilisation

Research Association, the British Coke Research Association and the Coal Tar
Research Association. Much of the work of other bodies, such as the Safety
in Mines Research Establishment (SMRE), is closely related to the Board’s
problems; the SMRE carries out research on explosions and fires, pneumo¬
coniosis, engineering and metallurgy.
The petroleum industry in Britain dates back to 1850, when Dr. James Young,
a Glasgow chemist, succeeded in obtaining lamp oil and lubricants from
natural mineral oil occurring in the Derbyshire coal measures. The Scottish
shale deposits, yielding similar products, were first worked in 1858 and ceased
production in 1962.
Sources of crude oil within Britain meet only 1 ton in every 800 of total
United Kingdom requirements, the remainder being imported from overseas.
Annual production of crude oil from indigenous oilfields now totals about
80,000 tons. Prospecting for crude petroleum has so far led to the establishment
of several small oilfields, notably in Nottinghamshire (Eakring, Egmanton
and Bothamsell), in Leicestershire (Plungar), in Lincolnshire (Gainsborough)
and in Dorset (Kimmeridge).
Seismic prospecting in the North Sea has been going on since 1962. Under
the Continental Shelf Act 1964, the Minister of Power, by a system of licensing
for exploration and production, controls those activities in the areas over the
Shelf appertaining to the United Kingdom. Britain’s share of the North Sea
shelf amounts to about 100,000 square miles. Licences covering about 42,000
square miles were issued in 1964 and 1965 (a few being in the Irish Sea).
Drilling, wdiich started in 1964, has proved the existence of four fields of
natural gas capable of commercial production. A substantial field of natural
gas was also proved in 1966 in North Yorkshire, near Scarborough.
British and British-Dutch oil companies have been responsible for developing
the oil resources of many countries to mutual advantage, especially in the
Middle East, Far East and Caribbean areas.
Today these companies produce about one-third of all oil entering into
international trade, with a tanker fleet (partly owned by them and partly on
charter) amounting to nearly a quarter of the world’s tanker tonnage. (United
Kingdom registered tanker tonnage is nearly one-seventh of the world’s total.)
In 1965 the United Kingdom imported 66 million tons of crude oil valued
at £431 million, the largest single item among imported products; approxi¬
mately 22 per cent came from Kuwait, the other largest suppliers being Iraq,
Libya, Venezuela and Nigeria in that order.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption in 1965 totalled
slightly over 67 million tons, having risen by more than half since i960. An
outstanding feature has been the continued rapid advance in the use of black
oils. Fuel oil consumption (excluding refineries) has been expanding at the
rate of over if million tons a year since i960 and totalled about 27 million tons
in 1965. Demand for gas and diesel oils (excluding that used in road vehicles)
rose by a further 0-9 million tons to 6-9 million tons in 1965. Sales of motor
spirit in recent years, after expanding by half a million tons annually for some
years, increased by nearly 1 million tons to about 10 million tons in 1964 and
to lof million tons in 1965.
A more detailed analysis of deliveries of gas and diesel oils for 1965 shows
that their most important uses were for non-industrial central heating,
270
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Refineries
Oil Pipelines
agricultural tractors and the railways. Electricity generation accounted for about
22 per cent of total fuel oil consumption, excluding that used in oil refineries;
the steel industry accounted for 16 per cent and non-industrial central
heating for a further 10 per cent. Of the remainder, the largest users were
the cement, paper-making, general chemical, glass, engineering, brickmaking
and fishing industries.
Before 1939 three-quarters of the United Kingdom’s supply of petroleum
products was refined overseas, as it was considered more economical to
refine at the source of production. Since the second world war, however,
the industry has come to favour the siting of refineries in the consuming
areas.
By mid-1966 rated refinery capacity in the United Kingdom amounted
to over 70 million tons a year. Of the 18 refineries in operation, four have a
capacity of under 0-2 million tons. The seven largest are situated at Fawley,
near Southampton (11-3 million tons which is being raised to 16-5 million
tons); Stanlow, in Cheshire (9-8 million tons); Isle of Grain (10 million tons)
and Shellhaven (9-8 million tons), both on the Thames Estuary; two at
Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire (6-3 million tons and 4-6 million tons) and
at Llandarcy near Swansea (8 million tons). Other important refineries are
located at Belfast, and on the Firth of Forth (Grangemouth). These, and
other projects in hand or planned (notably on Humberside and Tees-side,
both of which will become important refining areas), will bring Britain’s total
capacity to over 100 million tons a year by the end of 1968.
Output of refined products (excluding refineries’ own consumption) has
risen steadily; from 4 million tons in 1948 to 25! million tons in 1954, 40
million tons in i960 and the record total of 60 million tons in 1965. There is
a substantial external trade in refined products which tends to follow trading
and seasonal requirements and the commercial arrangements of the oil
companies. Exports from Britain, mainly in the form of heavier products
to European countries, were valued at ^108 million in 1965; imports of
refined products including liquefied gases amounted to ^177 million.
Three major oil pipelines are at present in operation in Britain carrying crude
oil from harbours capable of berthing very large tankers to refineries. One in
Scotland (from Finnart on Loch Long to Grangemouth) and one in South
Wales (from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to Llandarcy) and a third on Mersey¬
side (from Tranmere to Stanlow). Pipelines carry refined products from
refineries to major marketing areas, where the volume transported is sufficient
to justify the capital cost; for example, a complex of lines runs from the
Stanlow, Cheshire, refinery to the Manchester area and another, 78 miles long,
takes petroleum feedstock from Fawley refinery to the £100 million petroleum
chemicals plant at Severnside, near Bristol; others carry refined products
from Fawley to west London and London Airport and from Walton-on-
Thames to London Airport. Construction has begun on a pipeline system
with an initial capacity of 3 million tons a year to feed refined products to the
Midlands from refineries and installations on the Thames and Mersey.
Construction is also in progress of a crude oil line from Stanlow to Heysham,
a refined products line from Stanlow to Haydock and an ethylene line from
the Tees to the Mersey. Meanwhile, parts of the system of pipelines laid
during the second world war are being used by the petroleum distributing
companies. The Pipelines Act 1962 is designed to secure the orderly
development of privately owned industrial pipelines.

Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(the British Petroleum Company), Thornton, in Cheshire, and Woodstock,
in Kent (Shell), and Abingdon, in Berkshire (Esso). The first of these covers
the full range of petroleum research and development, from geology and
production to product utilisation and petroleum chemicals. In general, the
remainder are concerned with the evolution of new and improved fuels and
lubricants and the development of new uses for petroleum products and of
new products based on petroleum, especially chemicals.
A public supply of electricity was first provided in Britain in 1881, at
Godaiming, Surrey. From its earliest days a measure of public control has
been a feature of the industry and the Electric Lighting Act 1882 authorised
the Board of Trade to grant licences for the establishment of electricity
undertakings by local authorities or by companies (which the local authorities
might compulsorily purchase after a given period of time) to supply consumers
in given areas. By the turn of the century a variety of independent supply
systems had grown up all over the country. In 1919 the Electricity Commis¬
sioners were set up as a supervisory body and to promote reorganisation on a
national scale through voluntary agreement. In 1926 the Central Electricity
Board was set up to construct and operate a national grid inter-connecting
individual power stations, thus co-ordinating generation and transmission.
In 1943 the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB) was estab¬
lished as a public corporation to develop the water power resources of the
Highlands. In 1948 all municipal and private undertakings (other than those
in Northern Ireland) were acquired under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested
in the British Electricity Authority and 14 regional boards, except in the north
of Scotland where they became the responsibility of the NSHEB. Two
subsequent Acts (1954 and !957) effected a measure of decentralisation and
gave the industry its present structure. Electricity supply employs about
250,000 people, including 4,700 in Northern Ireland.
In England and Wales, electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and distributed by 12 separate Area
Electricity Boards; co-ordination is effected by the Electricity Council. In
Scotland, two boards—the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB)—both generate and distribute electricity. In Northern Ireland,
the Belfast Corporation and the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland generate
and distribute electricity, and the Londonderry Corporation distributes only.
The Electricity Council is the central body of the supply industry with
responsibility for general policy and programmes and for advising the
Minister of Power; it is also responsible for a number of common services,
principally capital financing, research and industrial relations. The Council
consists of a chairman, two deputy chairmen, the chairman and two designated
members of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), the chairmen
of the 12 Area Electricity Boards and not more than three other members.
The CEGB controls the operation and maintenance of power stations and the
main transmission system (the national grid) and supplies electricity in bulk
to the 12 Area Boards. The CEGB consists of a chairman, a deputy chairman
and between six and eight members. Each of the 12 Area Electricity Boards
acquires bulk supplies of electricity from the CEGB and is responsible for
distribution networks and sales of electricity to its area consumers.
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Area Consultative Councils were set up under the Electricity Act 1947
the area of each board to represent the interests of consumers; their chairmen
are ex officio members of their respective Area Boards. The Minister of Power
appoints the chairmen, deputy chairmen and members of the Electricity
Council, the CEGB, the Area Boards and the Consultative Councils; approves
each Board’s capital development programmes and the industry’s research
programme; and approves, in consultation with the Treasury, the boards
borrowing requirements. The Electricity Act 1957 requires each Board, and
not merely the industry as a whole, to pay its way taking one year with another.
The boundary separating the areas covered by the two Scottish Boards runs
roughly from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on the Firth of
Tay. Members of both Boards and of the respective consumer consultative
councils are appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland, each Board
comprises a chairman and between four and eight members. The Secretary of
State’s responsibilities in relation to the Boards are similar to those of the
Minister of Power.
In Northern Ireland electricity is generated at power stations in Belfast and
at Ballylumford and Coolkeeragh. Those in Belfast are operated by the city
corporation and the remainder by the Electricity Board for Northern Ireland.
Generation at these stations is co-ordinated by the Northern Ireland Joint
Electricity Committee, set up by statute in 1948, which purchases their output
and resells it to distributors—the Belfast Corporation for Belfast and district,
the Londonderry Corporation for the City of Londonderry, and the Electricity
Board for the rest of Northern Ireland.
Generation As Britain has abundant supplies of coal, together with good rail and water
transport for moving it, most of its electricity is produced by coal-fired steam
generating stations. The development of hydro-electricity on any scale is
comparatively recent, water power resources being relatively small and in
remote areas. By the middle of 1966, however, nuclear energy was contributing
a sizeable volume. . . .
The output capacity of the generating stations of the electricity boards in
Great Britain at the end of 1965 totalled 40,708 megawatts (MW), an increase
of over one-third since i960.
In the years i960 to 1964 an annual average of nearly 2,000 MW of
generating capacity was installed, and this rose to a record level of 3>5°0 MW
in 1965. It is planned to commission 20,000 MW of capacity in England and
Wales in the period 1965-68 inclusive. In the north of Scotland it is planned
to increase capacity from 1,331 MW at the end of 1965 to 1,840 MW by i97°-
The South of Scotland Electricity Board’s proposals provide for its total
capacity of 2,700 MW at the end of 1965 to be increased to 5,600 MW by 1970.
Sales of electricity in Northern Ireland (where, of the total installed
generating capacity of 797 MW, 240 MW is in oil-fired and the remainder in
coal-fired thermal stations) amounted to 2,336 million kilowatt-hours in 1965.
Generation by the public supply in Great Britain exceeded 174,000 million
kilowatt-hours in 1965: conventional steam power stations provided 90 per cent
of the total and hydro-electric and nuclear stations about 2 per cent and 7
per cent respectively. The high rate of expansion of output, which has been
a feature of the industry since its earliest years, has been maintained. The
total volume generated increased by 47 per cent between i960 and 1965.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively
small—under 20,000 million kilowatt-hours in 1965. The major sources

In the mid-1950s, when a coal shortage seemed likely, programmes for oil¬
firing at conventional thermal stations and for generating from nuclear energy
were introduced. There are 14 oil-burning power stations, or parts of
stations, operating in Great Britain (excluding old stations converted to oil¬
firing to satisfy clean air legislation). They are mainly situated on river estuaries
and thus able to be fed conveniently from oil refineries. A 2,000 MW oil-fired
station is under construction at Fawley, on Southampton Water.
The electricity authorities are the largest consumers of primary fuel in
Britain and, although most of their electricity generation is based on coal, oil
consumption rose from a negligible quantity in 1955 to over 5-5 million
tons in 1962 and to 5-8 million tons in 1965. Average thermal efficiency of
conventional steam stations in England and Wales (that is, the ratio of power
output to the fuel consumed) rose from 20-75 Per cent J947 to 27-32 per
cent in 1964 as new plant was brought into use. The 20 most efficient stations,
containing much of the newest plant, had an average efficiency of 32-98 per
cent in 1964-65.
Striking advances have been made in the design of steam-generating plant.
A cross-compound generating unit with an output capacity of 550 MW came
into operation in 1963 at Thorpe Marsh, near Doncaster. The largest single¬
shaft units of 500 MW, which came into operation in 1966, are at Ferrybridge
‘C’, West Burton, near Retford, and Eggborough, near Selby (for location
see map p. 264). These show substantial economies in capital and operating
costs and in fuel consumption, and larger units of 660 MW are planned.
Station capacities are also increasing. By 1970, ten, each with capacities of 2,000
MW, with four 500 MW single-shaft generating units, will be in service. An
even larger station of 4,000 MW is under construction at Drax, in Yorkshire.
In Scotland, a 1,200 MW station at Cockenzie (1968) and one of 2,400 MW
(four generating units of 600 MW) at Longannet (1971) are under construction.
Large gas turbine units of 55 MW and 70 MW, based on aero jet engines,
have been introduced since 1965 for peak load operation. The CEGB and
South of Scotland Electricity Board have installed 846 MW of such units.
274
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Hydro-Electric
Nuclear Power
Stations
Smaller gas turbines have been introduced at new stations to safeguard the
auxiliary supplies to the large new steam units, and also to provide capacity
for peak operation. Auxiliary units of this kind in service at the end of 1966
will total 330 MW, and by 1970 will exceed 1,000 MW.
Hydro-electric generation is confined to Scotland and Wales, and most of the
water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with their own
natural catchment areas. The setting up of the North of Scotland Hydro-
Electric Board in 1943 marked the beginning of an era of intensive water¬
power development in the Highlands of Scotland. A development scheme was
drawn up by the Board in 1944, showing the water-power resources which it
proposed to examine.
In 1965-66, 2,900 million units were generated by the North of Scotland
Board from water-power, compared with 322 million in 1949. At the end of
March 1966 there were 53 main hydro-electric stations in operation in the
north of Scotland with a total installed capacity of 1,040 MW and the largest—
the Loch Sloy station—had a capacity of 130 MW; the Cruachan pumped
storage section of the Awe scheme, with an installed capacity of 400 MW from
four reversible-pump-turbines, was planned to be in full operation by the end
of 1966. Under construction and survey were 199 MW of conventional hydro¬
electric capacity together with a 1,200 MW pumped storage project at Loch
Sloy. In addition, there are stations generating electricity by water-power in the
south of Scotland (123 MW) and in Wales (473 MW). The latter includes the
360 MW pumped storage station at Ffestiniog, which was completed in 1963-
(In pumped storage schemes electricity generated in off-peak periods is used to
pump water to higher levels from which it descends at peak periods to
operate turbo-generators.) The CEGB is also examining the feasibility of a
pumped storage project on the north coast of Devon.
Some 8 per cent of Britain’s electricity was generated in nuclear power
stations in 1965 and the proportion is expected to rise to 12 per cent in 1980.
Britain has so far produced as much electricity by this means as the rest of the
world put together.
The AEA itself has four mains stations which produce electricity for the
national grid: Calder Hall, in Cumberland (180 MW electrical output);
Chapelcross, Dumfriesshire (180 MW); the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor
(AGR) at Windscale, Cumberland (28 MW); and the experimental fast
breeder station at Dounreay (14 MW).
Others are owned and operated by the electricity authoiities. Under the
first commercial programme, originally announced in 1955 ^ut: s^nce tw^ce
modified, nine stations with a total installed capacity of 5>000 MW should be
in operation by 1969, eight of them by the end of 1967* S° far seven (over
3,000 MW) have started operation: Berkeley, in Gloucestershire (276 MW
output capacity), and Bradwell, in Essex (300 MW), were both commissioned
in 1962; Hunterston, in Scotland (30° MW), in 19645 an<^ following year
Hinkley Point ‘A’, in Somerset, and Trawsfynydd, in Wales (both 500 MW);
Dungeness ‘A’, in Kent (550 MW), andSizewell, in Suffolk (580MW), in 1966.
Oldbury, in Gloucestershire (600 MW), and Wylfa, in Anglesey (1,180 MW),
should be completed by 1967 and 1969 respectively. These stations, like
Calder Hall and Chapelcross, are all magnox stations—graphite-moderated,
carbon-dioxide cooled using natural uranium metal fuel elements canned in
magnesium.
Under a second programme announced in 1964 and extended in i905> a
further 8,000 MW of installed nuclear capacity is planned by 1975. The first

station in this programme, Dungeness ‘B’, is based on the AGR at Windscale
which uses ceramic uranium dioxide fuel canned in stainless steel, a logical
development of the magnox system. Due to come into operation in 1971 with
a net electrical output of 1,200 MW it will be the most powerful in the world,
and the first in Britain to produce electricity more cheaply on base load than
the best coal stations.
A large prototype fast reactor (PFR) of 250 MW capacity is being built by
the AEA, to be completed in 1971, at Dounreay where in October 1962 the
experimental fast reactor became the first of such type to produce electricity
for public use and to operate at a high power level.
Main electricity transmission lines—the national grid—supply most of the
country. By 31st March 1965, those of the CEGB totalled some 8,800 route
miles (15,200 circuit miles), of which 2,000 miles were operated at 275,000
volts, 6,500 miles were operated at 132,000 volts and the remainder at 66,000
volts and below. In Scotland there were some 3,900 circuit miles of main
transmission lines at the end of 1965, of which 1,050 circuit miles operated at
275,000 volts and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Energy movements on the
grid in England and Wales are controlled through the seven operational areas,
set up for that purpose and distinct from the regions in which the generating
side of the industry is organised; each area has a separate control, and the
operations are co-ordinated by a National Control in London. The grid in
Scotland is operated from the control centres at Pitlochry (North of Scotland)
and at Kirkintilloch (South of Scotland).
To reduce the number of new transmission lines needed to meet the
country’s increasing power demands, most of the new ‘supergrid’ of main
transmission lines now operating at 275,000 volts are, since 1965, being up¬
rated to operate at 400,000 volts. The development of the grid system has
made the British system the largest integrated power network in the world.
Twin cross-Channel cables laid between Dungeness and Boulogne, capable
of transmitting up to 160 MW at 200,000 volts (direct current) have been
in operation since 1961; by this means advantage is taken of the differences
between France and Britain in the timing of peak loads.
In England and Wales the Area Electricity Boards distribute to consumers
electricity acquired mainly from the Central Electricity Generating Board,
supplemented from other sources, such as industrial plants and the nuclear
power stations of the AEA. There are nearly 17 million consumers. Industrial
concerns are the biggest users of electricity. The principal domestic uses of
electricity are for lighting, cooking and for space and water heating, but the
demand for numerous other domestic purposes is rising steadily.
The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board has also pressed ahead with
the distribution of electricity to consumers in the north of Scotland. At the
end of March 1966 it had about 428,500 consumers of electricity, many of them
in remote areas, and well over four-fifths of the farms and crofts had a supply
of electricity. At the same date the South of Scotland Electricity Board
supplied 1-4 million consumers, including over 97 per cent of the farmers in
the area.
About 11 per cent of the annual gross fixed capital formation of the United
Kingdom in 1965 was attributable to the electricity supply industry. The
industry in recent years has based its capital needs for five years ahead on an
average annual increase in demand of about 7 to 9 per cent; its plans for the
future are based on an average annual growth of 8 per cent.

Capital expenditure of the electricity supply industry has been expanding
very rapidly: from £242 million in 1956 it rose to £378 million in 1961 and
£584 million in 1965. More than two-fifths of the industry’s capital require¬
ments have been financed from internal resources. The statutory limit to
borrowings by the industry in Great Britain is £4,980 million. The industry
(other than the NSHEB) is required to aim at a gross return of 12^ per cent
on its net assets.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Minister of Power, is
responsible for drawing up a general programme of research, comprising:
direct research carried out by the Electricity Boards themselves; sponsored
research undertaken for the supply industry by universities and colleges;
and co-operative research with other organisations, in particular the industrial
research associations to which the supply industries subscribe. The Council
itself is empowered to conduct research. It is advised by the Electricity Supply
Research Council.
The main research establishments of the industry are run by the Central
Electricity Generating Board and comprise the Central Electricity Research
Laboratories at Leatherhead, Surrey, the Berkeley Laboratories in Glouces¬
tershire, concerned with nuclear problems, and the Engineering Laboratories
at Marchwood on Southampton Water. In 1965 the Electricity Council
established a research centre at Capenhurst, Cheshire, at which intensive
research is being undertaken on distribution problems (to supplement the
work undertaken at the Central Electricity Research Laboratories) and on
appliances and methods of electricity utilisation.
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
either on their own or in co-operation with other electricity authorities. The
North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board undertakes a wide range of research
and development work, both independently and in conjunction with the
British Electrical and Allied Industries Research Association, colleges of
science and technology, universities and manufacturers. The South of
Scotland Electricity Board has recently extended its own research activities
and is associated with those of the Electricity Council and Central Electricity
Generating Board in England.
Public supply of gas in Britain dates from 1807, when Pall Mall, London,
was first lighted with gas. In 1812 the London and Westminster Gas Light
and Coke Company received a Royal Charter to supply gaslight in London.
In the early years of the industry gas was used almost exclusively for lighting
and was provided by a growing number of company and municipal under¬
takings.
The gas industry in its present form developed in the main during the
period between the two world wars when increasing competition from
electricity had to be met, and by 1939 ^he industry had become mainly a
supplier of heating rather than lighting.
The Gas Act of 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain, in which about
123,000 persons are at present employed, under public ownership and control
on 1 st May 1949. The assets of 991 undertakings, of which 269 belonged to
local authorities, were vested in 12 Area Gas Boards. The central body is
the Gas Council, appointed by the Minister of Power. It is both a co-ordinating
council and, since the enactment of the Gas Act 1965, a trading body,
consisting of a full-time chairman and deputy chairman, the 12 chairmen

of the area boards and up to three other members. Its general duties are to
advise the Minister on questions affecting the industry and promote the
efficient performance of their duties by the area boards. It has also specific
duties relating to finance, labour relations and research.
The Area Gas Boards, which have a large measure of financial and opera¬
tional responsibility and are similar in most respects to the central bodies
of the other publicly owned corporations, are responsible for manufacturing
gas and distributing it to consumers. Each of the Area Gas Boards, appointed
by the Minister of Power, consists of a full-time chairman and deputy chair¬
man, in some cases one or more full-time members, and usually five or six
part-time members, including the chairman of the Area Consultative Council.
There is no common pattern of organisation; each board is fully independent
and has devised its own subordinate structure. Each is required to pay its
way, taking one year with another. The operations of the area boards have
resulted, in the 16 years up to 31st March 1965, in an aggregate disposable
surplus of approximately ^60 million, before taxation.
In Northern Ireland the gas supply industry remains in the hands of a
number of municipal undertakings and statutory and non-statutory companies.
The chief method of gas production in Britain used to be by carbonising coal
but oil-based production is expanding markedly; more than one-third of gas
supplied in 1965 was derived from oil, and 1-5 million tons were used, more
than double the amount in 1962. The gas industry used about 18 million
tons of coal (25 million tons in 1958) and another 25! million tons were
carbonised in coke ovens other than those of the gas industry.
About one-third of the output of gas from coke ovens is sold to gas under¬
takings for general distribution; the remainder is mainly consumed at the
ovens or at steelworks. There are about 13 million consumers, the total having
shown no significant change since 1955. Manufactured gas and gas acquired
from coke ovens and other sources for distribution exceeds 700,000 million
cubic feet annually.
In 1965 the quantity of gas produced in Northern Ireland was about
6,500 million cubic feet, most of it for household use.
Half of all gas is sold by gas boards for household use and the remainder for
industrial and commercial purposes. Total consumption has been rising at an
average rate of over 6 per cent per annum since 1961, after a period when
growth was almost negligible. During the very cold winter of 1962-63 the
rate was even higher. It reached a level of about 3,750 million therms1 in
1965, an increase of about 10 per cent on the previous year.
About 50 per cent of the domestic load is used for cooking and about 25 per
cent for space heating, the remaining 25 per cent being spread over water
heating and other installations. Most homes in Britain are supplied with gas,
except in some rural areas where, owing to difficulties in storage and trans¬
mission, mains gas is not economic, and bottled gas, derived from petroleum,
is widely used.
Gas is used extensively in industries which require the control of temperatures
to a fine degree of accuracy, for example, in the pottery industry and in
certain processes in the manufacture of iron and steel products. In 1964-65
sales of gas to industry totalled 915 million therms.

BRITAIN-. AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Production of coke at gas works in 1965 was 7-8 million tons (a fall of one-fifth
in two years) and at coke ovens 17-1 million tons, reflecting on the one hand
the increasing use of oil and on the other a continuing high level of activity in
the steel industry. The gas industry and coke ovens jointly produce about
3 million tons of crude coal tar and over 100 million gallons of crude benzole a
year. These latter by-products yield materials widely employed in the newer
branches of the chemical industry.
Capital
Investment
Lines of
Development
Under the Gas Act 1948, borrowing by the Gas Council and the Area Gas
Boards was limited to £250 million. In 1954 the industry’s borrowing powers
were increased to j£450 million, in i960 to ^525 milli011* in I9^3 £650
million and in 1965 to £1,200 million.
The industry had been spending about £50 million a year on capital invest¬
ment in the period 1955 to 1961 but since 1961-62 expenditure has increased
sharply; in 1965-66 it reached £118 million and £190 million has been
approved for 1966—67. Between vesting day (1st May 1949) the end of
March 1965, about £940 million had been invested in fixed assets.
Considerable integration, by the linking of works for the transmission of gas
through gas grids and long-distance mains, has enabled production to be
concentrated in the most efficient units.
To maintain its competitive position, the gas industry has investigated
new and more economic methods of production and new sources of gas
supply. Although two plants which use the Lurgi method for the complete
gasification of inferior grades of coal have been commissioned, their capital
cost is high. More significant have been the developments in the gasification
of oil. In the 1950s these plants were small, produced gas at lower pressure
and were designed to meet peak-load needs. More recently the introduction
of processes using light distillates in large units producing gas at high pressure
has permitted even greater savings to be made in both capital and running
costs.
The work done in the Gas Council’s Midlands Research Station led to the
introduction of two new methods of manufacture, the Gas Recycle Hydro-
genator and the Catalytic Rich Gas processes, both of which enable a high
calorific value gas to be manufactured entirely from light distillate feedstock
without the need for enrichment from any outside source. The first plants
incorporating these processes were put on stream in 1965* Gas made from
oil and gas purchased from refineries now amounts to over one-third of the
total supply available and the proportion is steadily increasing.
During 1965 deliveries of gas from the Sahara reached their planned level
of 35,000 million cubic feet annually, equivalent to about 10 per cent of total
consumption. A pipeline system distributes the gas from a terminal on Canvey
Island to eight of the 12 Area Boards.
The discovery of productive wells in the North Sea in 1965 and 1966
confirms the presence of natural gas (see p. 269). A pipeline is being con¬
structed to the coast, with the flow for commercial use planned to start by the
end of 1966. Although it is not yet possible to assess the quantities of gas
likely to be available from the North Sea discoveries and also from those in
Yorkshire, they are expected to be substantial. The chairman of the Gas
Council has stated the industry plans to switch over entirely to natural gas
within the next 10 to 15 years.
The Gas Council expects gas consumption to increase by some 10 per
cent a year up to 1970 and therefore substantial expansion is required. The

need to provide additional storage capacity, particularly in underground
reservoirs of porous rock (regulated under the Gas Act 1965), and the strength¬
ening of the distribution system will also mean substantial investment.
The Gas Council has a research committee which advises on the initiation
and implementation of research policy. Research organisations comprise five
stations in addition to Watson House at Fulham, London, for the design,
testing and development of appliances. Research is also carried out on behalf
of the Gas Council at Leeds University and at other universities and colleges.
Efficiency in the use of fuel, among both industrial and domestic users, has
been assisted by various bodies representing producers and consumers and
by the technical advisory services of the fuel and power industries.
The Coal Utilisation Council consists of representatives of the National
Coal Board, solid fuel distributors and appliance manufacturers and dis¬
tributors. Originally formed in 1932, it informs and advises domestic users
on the best use of solid fuel, including the choice of installation and the
operation of solid fuel appliances.
A non-profit-making company, the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency
Service, was formed in 1954 sponsored by the fuel and power industries
to promote fuel saving in industry. It provides advice and services to all non¬
domestic fuel users in a variety of forms, from ‘spot’ inspection to full-scale
heat and power surveys and regular visits on a contract basis.
WATER SUPPLY
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, sufficient for
domestic and industrial requirements. The sources of water are often distant
from the areas where supplies are needed, however, and water undertakings
are therefore mainly concerned with abstraction, storage, treatment and
distribution. Supplies are obtained partly from surface sources such as
mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering grounds and river
intakes, and partly from underground sources by means of wells, adits and
boreholes. Unlike other public services in Great Britain, such as electricity and
gas, water supply remains in the hands of a large number of undertakings.
The Government has announced its intention of reorganising the water
supply industry under full public ownership; the then Minister of Land and
Natural Resources was responsible for formulating long-term plans to give
effect to this general policy. Ministerial responsibility in England and Wales
is shared by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary
of State for Wales; in Scotland it lies with the Secretary of State for Scotland.
In Northern Ireland ministerial responsibility lies with the Minister of
Development.
It was not until the nineteenth century that the provision of water supplies
became a general public service, largely due to the efforts of Edwin Chadwick
and his colleagues who demonstrated the dangers arising from inadequate
water supply and sanitation. The Public Health Act 1848 laid the basis for
a long series of statutes dealing with public health. From the middle of the
nineteenth century onwards a number of water undertakings were set up
to provide water to the expanding urban population, and the water supply
system developed rapidly, although in piecemeal fashion and with some
overlapping and waste.
K
2g0 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Local authorities have a duty as sanitary authorities to ensure that water
supplies are adequate for the needs of their areas, and they may do this
either by operating water undertakings themselves or by ensuring that other
bodies are providing adequate supplies. Over one-fifth of the water consumed
is supplied by statutory water companies. The householder receives his
domestic water supply at a comparatively small charge, varying in different
areas, which he usually pays by way of a water rate levied, like other rates
on the value of his house. Industrial users are charged according to actual
material consumption. ,
The Minister of Housing and Local Government and the becretary ot
State for Wales have a duty to promote the conservation and proper use of
water supplies in England and Wales and are advised by the Central Advisory
Water Committee on general questions relating to water and organisation of
supplies. Since the passing of the Water Act 1945, some 800 smaller water
authorities in England and Wales have been absorbed by larger authorities or
by the creation of joint boards in order to improve the efficiency of the water
supply industry. In March 1966 there were in England and Wales 138 local
authority water undertakings, 84 joint water boards (including bulk supp y
boards) and one joint water committee, 41 statutory water companies, nine
non-statutory water companies, and one private proprietor with statutory
powers. A number of private proprietors without statutory powers a.so
provide small supplies. ,
The Metropolitan Water Board supplies over 350 million gallons daily to
the 61 million people in the London area. It consists of 39 part-time members
who are the elected representatives of the various local authorities within the
Board’s area of operations, together with one representative each from the
Thames and Lee Conservancies.
Present Supplies Today, piped water reaches over 95 per cent of the total population of England
and Wales and about 90 per cent of the rural population.
Capital expenditure by water undertakings which averaged about £40
million a year in the period 1955-60 is now at a level of £55 million a year.
Interest, together with running costs, is largely met from annual income.
The provision of piped supplies for rural districts has been assisted by
grants under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1965. By
March 1966 schemes costing nearly £100 million had been completed or
were in progress with the aid of grants under these Acts.
The growth of towns in England and Wales has meant increased demands
for water, the needs of industry having grown so much that in many areas
they now exceed domestic demand. The use of water in irrigation of farm
land is also growing. In order that the country’s water resources should be
developed to meet these growing requirements the Water Resources Act 1963
provided for a new administrative structure consisting of 27 river authorities
and a central Water Resources Board; the Act came into full operation in
April 1965. The river authorities, the Thames Conservancy and the Lee
Conservancy Catchment Board have a majority of members appointed
by the county and county borough councils in their areas. The remainder
are appointed by ministers for their knowledge of land drainage, fisheries,
the public water supply, and water in use in industry and in agriculture.
The authorities manage the water resources of river basins, taking over the
functions of the 30 former river boards in respect of land drainage, flood
control, administration of fisheries and prevention of pollution. They are
responsible for assessing water resources and requirements, controlling and
developing resources and securing regulation by a system of licensing.

Special arrangements exist for the Greater London area, where the full range
of river authority control is not necessary. The work of the river authorities
is co-ordinated by the Water Resources Board, an expert advisory body which
reports to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. Its duties include
the review of national water resources and requirements, the encouragement
of the transfer of water between areas according to need, the co-ordination
of proposals of river authorities for capital investment and the initiation of
research. Water conservation is to be financially self-supporting after an
initial period of about five years, the cost being met from charges made to
abstractors and users of water.
In Scotland public water undertakings are carried on entirely by local
authorities, either separately or in combination with each other; they supply
about 97 per cent of the total population. The water problem in Scotland is
broadly similar to that in England and Wales except that there is not the
same need to allocate water between competing interests and less reliance
needs to be placed on underground sources. The Secretary of State for
Scotland has a general duty to promote the conservation of water resources
in Scotland; require local authorities to provide supplies of wholesome water
everywhere in their districts, where this can be done at reasonable cost; and
provide for a uniform system of rating for water throughout the country. The
Scottish Water Advisory Committee advises the Secretary of State on general
questions relating to resources and supplies. The Rural Water Supplies and
Sewerage Act 1944, as amended, makes available to Scottish local authorities
grant assistance up to a maximum of £45 million towards the cost of water
supplies and sewerage schemes in rural areas.
Northern Ireland has abundant supplies of water for both domestic and
industrial consumption. The Water Supplies and Sewerage Act (Northern
Ireland) 1945 made it obligatory for water supply authorities to provide a
supply of wholesome water to houses and schools in their areas where this
could be done at reasonable cost; the Minister of Health and Local Government
may make grants towards the costs of schemes undertaken by these authorities.
Before 1945 only the more densely populated areas had a piped supply,
but progress has been such that even in the thinly populated rural
districts most households have now been, or soon will be, connected to a
piped supply.
Information on the yield, behaviour and quantity of the nation’s surface
water resources is provided in the Surface Water Year Book of Great Britain,
published annually by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. This publication
contains particulars of the run-off and related rainfall from a large number of
rivers, streams and reservoired areas. The Water Resources Board is responsible
for the gauging, collation and publication of hydrological information: the field
work of surface water measurement is done by river authorities, water
undertakings and other bodies. Detailed studies of the resources and use of
water in specified areas have been published in the series of Hydrological
Surveys which cover approximately half of England and Wales. General
information on rainfall, published annually in British Rainfall, is the res¬
ponsibility of the Meteorological Office, while advice on ground water is the
responsibility of the Water Resources Board. The Hydraulics Research Station
of the Ministry of Technology at Wallingford and the Water Research
Association’s station at Medmenham carry out research into problems of the

Each river authority is responsible for the prevention of pollution of rivers
and certain tidal waters in its area and its approval must be sought before
polluting effluents are discharged. Control of pollution in the tidal Thames
is exercised by the Port of London Authority (see p. 343)- Scotland nine
river purification boards have been set up. The Secretary of State for Scotland
is advised by the Scottish River Purification Advisory Committee on questions
affecting the cleanliness of Scottish rivers. In several ports the petroleum
companies co-operate in the prevention of oil pollution from tankers and
refineries*
The Water Pollution Research Laboratory at Stevenage investigates
problems connected with the treatment of polluted waters, the treatment
and disposal of sewage and industrial waste water, and the effects and
prevention of pollution of surface water and underground water. Research is
carried out with general supervision and advice from the Water Pollution
Research Board.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industries include firms engaged on the construction,
alteration, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage
and sewerage systems, waterworks, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence
works, electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, open-cast coal
prospecting and mining, and structural work connected with thermo-electric,
hydro-electric power stations and telecommunications. The industries employ
i-8 million persons, including all grades, equivalent to some 7 per cent of the
total labour force. Allowing for new work only, and excluding work carried
out on repairs and maintenance, they provide about 9 per cent of the total
industrial product. , . . . . ,
To meet a growing demand for constructional work arising from plans tor
large scale expansion and modernisation, it is estimated that the industries
will need to increase output by about 50 per cent over the next decade.
This will have to be achieved, in the main, by improvements in produc¬
tivity as any great increase in labour resources to meet these demands is
unlikely.
Constructional work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities who employ their own labour. Nearly five-sixths of the work is
done by private firms. Although there are nearly 90,000 firms in the industry,
about one-quarter of them are one-man businesses. At the other end of the
scale are about 200 firms each employing more than 500 operatives, with some
employing as many as 20,000.
Public authorities as a whole employ nearly 370,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these are engaged on repair and maintenance work whic
local authorities, for example, carry out with their own labour.
Of the total labour force, nearly a million are skilled operatives who have
been trained under the apprenticeship scheme, taking four to five years to
qualify. About one-third of these skilled men are employed on repair and
maintenance work.

Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake responsi¬
bility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the smallest
projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either by
architects or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects,
by consulting engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a
client, embrace advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans
and the supervision of the constructional work by the contractor. There are
over 250 firms of consulting engineers in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Public Building and Works (see p. 57) is responsible for
all the construction programmes undertaken directly by the Government
(except for roads), including work for the armed services, both at home and
overseas. It is also responsible for co-ordinating research and development
throughout the government service and seeks to influence methods and
techniques in the building industry as a whole.
The National Building Agency, set up in 1964, is a limited company,
financed initially from government funds. The Agency offers advice to clients,
contractors, materials producers and the building professions on the most
modern ideas and techniques and brings clients’ demands together so that
industrialised methods can be more widely used.
The volume of output of the industry has been rising fairly steadily since 1954,
when building controls ended; by the end of 1965 it was running at an annual
rate more than 50 per cent above the 1958 level. The value of work done in
1965 amounted to £3,848 million, of which £546 million represented work
carried out by the labour employed directly by public authorities. Private
contractors carried out the remaining £3,302 million (£2,631 million on new
work and £671 million on repair work).
Some 5^ million houses and flats have been built in Great Britain since 1945;
about 3J million on behalf of public authorities, mainly for renting, and
about 2^ million for private owners, mainly for sale. About 403,000 houses
were started in 1965 and some £1,051 million of housing work was carried out
by private firms, a record for the total volume of housing work. Of this, about
£585 million, or 56 per cent, was for private owners and the remaining £466
million for public authorities. It is planned to build 500,000 dwellings a year
by 1970. Increasing use is being made of industrial methods in housing
construction employing prefabricated components.
Britain was the first country to develop civil engineering as a large-scale
modern industry and the first to provide techniques, finance and equipment
to carry out major civil engineering projects throughout the world. Prominent
figures in the early development of civil engineering included John McAdam,
pioneer in road construction; Thomas Telford, builder of roads, canals,
docks and railways; George and Robert Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom
Brunei, pioneers of railway building.
Among important construction projects in hand in the United Kingdom in
1966 were a drainage and sewerage scheme in Glasgow, costing £3-5 million,
and another at Davyhulme, costing £6-4 million; several major conventional
power stations and nuclear power stations (see p. 274); the £5 million river
Trent tidal reach improvement scheme; the 10-mile Victoria Tube line in
London, costing £57 million; the Great Ouse water supply scheme, costing

£52 million; and the large-scale reconstruction of the centres of some major
cities, such as Newcastle upon Tyne. Projects for road construction, bridges
and tunnels included a further 124,000 miles of motorways under construction
(see p. 350), major road bridges over the river Severn and the Firth of Tay, and
the £12-6 million tunnel under the river Tyne.
British constructional firms have been as active overseas as in the United
Kingdom. British consulting engineers, in particular, have built up a tradition
of knowledge and integrity which has caused their standards to become
international practice and their services to be in world-wide demand.
Among important construction projects by British contractors in hand in
overseas countries during 1966 were: a new township for the Government of
Bahrain, costing £6 million; the £10 million restoration of the Hejaz railway
in the Middle East; electrification projects on the Indian railways (£6 million);
a £2 million rutile mine township and docks in Sierra Leone. British consul¬
ting engineers were engaged on a number of projects where British contractors
were not commissioned for the construction work. Notable examples were
an airport at Baghdad, costing £12-5 million; a £6-5 million main drainage
scheme for Benghazi; construction of two water barrages in West Pakistan
(£27 million); water supply schemes for Hong Kong (£19 million) and Libya
(£6-2 million); a -£16 million iron and steelworks in Tunisia; and construction
of a dam and tunnel for the Tehran water board (£14 million). On certain
projects both the consulting engineers and the contractors were British,
examples being the second stage in the port of Tema construction in Ghana
(£11 million); and the 12-mile Accra-Tema motorway (£3-3 million).
It has been estimated that the total value of work carried out during the
year ending in March 1966 by over 90 British contractors, operating in 96
countries, was £169 million, compared with £160 million in the previous
year, and that the value of new contracts obtained was £190 million, com¬
pared with £198 million in the previous year. Consulting engineers had
projects worth about £i,3<->® million in hand on 1st January 1966.
The Directorate-General of Research and Development in the Ministry of
Public Building and Works is responsible for co-ordinating research and
information services to increase efficiency in the building industry.
Some of the research establishments of the Ministry of Technology (see
p. 58) deal with subjects relating to the construction industries, in particular
the Building Research Station which was set up in 1921, thus making Britain
the pioneer of organised building research, is concerned with research into
all aspects of building.
The Civil Engineering Research Association financed by grants from the
Ministry of Technology and contributions from the industry promotes
research on problems in civil engineering, making use of existing research
facilities of all types.
The Heating and Ventilating Research Association, an industrial research
organisation, deals with problems of heating and ventilation of large buildings.
The major construction firms have research departments working on plant,
materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with research include the
universities and colleges of technology. Most of the producers of primary
building materials have trade associations which maintain research institutions
chiefly devoted to seeking new and more efficient uses for their materials:
the Timber Research and Development Association and the Cement and
Concrete Association are examples.

MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
Britain’s manufacturing industries supply a wide range of products, many
of which are of major importance in world trade. Output has increased by
over a third since 1958, and in 1965 was 3 per cent higher than the previous
year. In 1965 this sector spent £1,410 million on fixed capital equipment,
including £385 million on building work and £940 million on plant and
machinery. The number of employees in manufacturing industry (including
the unemployed and those absent from work through sickness and other
causes, but excluding employers and the self-employed) was over 9 million
in June 1965, 38 per cent of the total number of employees.
The employment and production figures listed in Table 17 give an indication
of the relative importance of broad sectors of manufacturing industry.
Expansion has been particularly rapid in electronics, in the newer branches of
mechanical engineering, most branches of the chemical industry and man¬
made fibres. The diagram on p. 259 shows the changes in production between
1958 and 1965 in the major groups of industry.
In the subsequent sections, statistics of employees refer to numbers at
June 1965, and export statistics are taken mainly from the Overseas Trade
Accounts of the United Kingdom.
The metal manufacturing industries employ 637,000 persons. Of these,
364,000 were in the iron and steel industry, 124,000 in the manufacture of
iron castings, 60,000 in the manufacture of light metals, and 87,000 in the

copper, brass and other base metal industries. Exports of iron and steel
products and non-ferrous metals in 1965 had an aggregate value of ^402
million.
Britain pioneered the application of coal to the smelting of iron ore from the
seventeenth century onwards and British inventors were responsible for the
discovery of the processes which led to the great expansion of steelmaking
in the second half of the nineteenth century. Today Britain is the world’s
fifth largest steel producing nation. Output of crude steel in 1965 totalled
27 million ingot tons, the highest level ever recorded and 4'6 per cent more
than in 1964, the previous peak year. Capacity utilisation in 1965 was 87-5 per
cent, about the same as in 1964. Between 1961 and 1965 total capacity
increased by over 4 million tons. Pig iron production in 1965 amounted to
the record level of 17-5 million tons.
Net deliveries of finished steel amounted to 20-2 million tons in 1965.
The 4-1 million tons of iron and steel products which were exported had a
value of ^234-1 million; the United States (5631-5 million), Canada (5613-3
million) and Sweden (5612-6 million) were the main overseas buyers.
The main producing districts are: South Wales (25 per cent of total crude
steel output); the north-east of England (18 per cent); Sheffield and district
(12 per cent); Scotland (11 per cent); Lincolnshire (11 per cent), and
Lancashire (10 per cent). South Wales concentrates mainly on the manufacture
of flat products, especially sheet steel and tinplate; the output of the north¬
east coast and Scotland is predominantly of heavy steel products (plates,
sections and rails) although a wide strip mill for sheet production is now in
operation in Scotland; Sheffield is responsible for nearly two-thirds of
Britain’s alloy steel production.
During the period 1950-65 about 561,37° niillion was spent on major
development schemes. Capital expenditure reached a peak in the years
1960-62 of over 36170 million a year on average, due mainly to the strip mill
expansion programme, then fell to 365° rnifficm in 1965, but it is expected to
rise again. The emphasis is increasingly on improving efficiency rather than
raising total capacity. Britain has some of the most modern plant in Europe
and by 1965 steel produced by the converter processes had increased from
8 per cent of total output in i960 to over 23 per cent; steel from electric
furnaces had increased from 7 per cent to 13 per cent; and the share of the
older open hearth process had fallen from 85 per cent to under 64 per cent.
Output per blast furnace has risen markedly in recent years, due both to
an increase in average size and to improvements in efficiency, such as improved
preparation of raw materials, the injection of fuel and oxygen, and the use of
higher blast temperatures. Scientific and technological research is carried out
on a co-operative basis by the British Iron and Steel Research Association
and the industry as a whole now spends some 5612 million a year on research.
Outstanding development projects completed in the last few years include
wide strip mills at new integrated works at Newport (Monmouthshire) and
at an existing works in Scotland; a new plant at Stoke-on-Trent, which is
based entirely on continuous casting for supplies of semi-finished steel; an
advanced unit for the mass production of alloy and special carbon steels at
Sheffield; the world’s largest electric melting shop and a new steelworks in
which a linked three-computer system controls production planning through¬
out, both at Rotherham.
The iron and steel industry has been subject to some form of public
supervision since 1932. In February 1951 ^be greater part of the industry

came under public ownership, but the Iron and Steel Act 1953 established
an Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency, with the duty of returning
the companies to private ownership. Only one company remains under the
control of the Agency.
In a White Paper, published in April 1965, proposals for bringing 13
major steel companies into public ownership were outlined. Their shares and
securities would be vested in a National Steel Corporation and the Iron and
Steel Board, set up under the 1953 Act to exercise a general supervision over
the iron and steel industry, would be dissolved. A Bill to restore public
ownership and control of the main part of the steel industry was introduced
to Parliament in July 1966.
Members of the Iron and Steel Board are appointed by the Government
and it is financed by levies which it has power to make on firms in the industry.
The major trade association in the iron and steel industry, excluding iron and
steel founding, is the British Iron and Steel Federation.
Output of iron castings maintained the record level of 4-1 million tons in
1965. The main users of iron castings are the general engineering industry,
manufacturers of pressure pipes and fittings, the motor vehicle industry, the
building and associated industries and the steel industry. The engineering
industry accounts for nearly one-third of the total tonnage sold and about
one-half of the industry’s turnover.
There are about 1,200 firms in the iron founding industry and the number
of employees is about 124,000. Exports are included in the total of steel
exports in the previous section.
The non-ferrous metals industry is the largest in Europe and as a consumer
of aluminium, copper and lead Britain is second only to the United States
among western countries. Output in 1965 included: aluminium, 36,000 tons
of virgin metal and 185,000 tons of secondary metal; refined copper, 101,000
tons of virgin copper and 151,000 tons of secondary metal; lead, 125,000 tons
of English refined metal; zinc, 105,000 tons of slab metal; and tin, 18,000 tons.
Mining in Britain is confined to the working of lead and tin ores on a small
scale, although detailed investigation is taking place into the possibilities of
a considerable expansion of tin mining.
In 1965 exports of non-ferrous base metals were valued at ^128-6 million.
The main products exported, including semi-finished products, were copper
and copper alloys (^57-3 million), nickel and its alloys (^24-4 million),
aluminium and its alloys (£20-4 million) and tin and its alloys (^12-9 million).
The Federal Republic of Germany (£19 million), Sweden (£9-1 million), the
Netherlands (^8-5 million), the United States (£8 million) and France
{Ll'9 million) were the largest purchasing countries. There were also sub¬
stantial exports of finished products incorporating non-ferrous semi-finished
products and non-ferrous metals in many finished forms.
Nearly half of the industry is situated in the Midlands; other centres
include South Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth. Firms are engaged
in smelting, casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing and
the techniques of powder metallurgy and pressure diecasting are also employed.
Some non-ferrous metals, such as nickel, molybdenum, tungsten and
vanadium, are largely used in the making of high speed and other special
steels. New uses for non-ferrous metals with special properties have emerged
with the growth of new industries having particular requirements, as, for
example, production of nuclear energy (uranium, zirconium), jet aircraft

(niobium, magnesium, titanium) and electronic apparatus (selenium, silicon,
germanium, tantalum). Scientific and technological research for the industry as
a whole is conducted by the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association,
Mechanical engineering comprises a wide range of industries, including all
types of machinery, machine tools, engineers’ small tools, mechanical handling
equipment, construction equipment, industrial plant, ordnance and small
arms, watches and clocks, and scientific instruments. Vehicle engines are
included in the section on vehicles (p. 294). The number of employees is
1-4 million and the volume of production from these industries rose by 42 per
cent between 1958 and 1965. In 1965 £2,063 million was the aggregate value
of the main products of all sections other than tractors, small arms, scientific
instruments and watches and clocks. Exports of non-electric machinery
were valued at £931 million in 1965.
There are over 300 firms, employing 39,000 people, in the agricultural
machinery industry, including three very large firms with more than 1,000
workers. In 1965 output, excluding tractors, was valued at £59‘4 million and
exports were worth £28-9 million; the main overseas markets were France, the
Irish Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands and South
Africa. The number of self-propelled combine harvesters, forage harvesters,
pick-up balers and grain driers in use has increased in Britain in recent years.
Deliveries in 1965 included 5,200 combine harvesters, 4,700 milking machines,
16,700 pick-up balers and 2,400 grain and grass driers.
The bulk of British tractor output and exports consists of agricultural tractors.
Some 199,000 agricultural and industrial wheeled tractors were delivered in
I9^5> 156,000 (79 per cent) for export. In addition, 29,000 small market
garden tractors, were delivered. Exports of new agricultural and track-laying
tractors had a value of £92-1 million in 1965- Agricultural tractor production
is dominated by two large organisations. Tractors are exhibited at the annual
Royal Smithfield Show and Agricultural Machinery Exhibition in London;
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world (see p. 320).
Britain was the birthplace of the modern machine tool industry, and by the
early 1830s had developed to an advanced stage the boring machine and
screw-cutting lathe, as well as other machine tools. The industry s output
today ranges from watchmakers’ lathes weighing a few pounds to machines
weighing hundreds of tons, including transfer lines for motor vehicle manu¬
facture and electronically controlled machine tools giving accuracies of one
ten-thousandth part of an inch.
The value of deliveries of metal-working machine tools rose by 16 per cent
in 1965 to £140-6 million (the highest ever recorded), compared with £122
million in 1964. Exports in 1965 had a value of £50'2 million; and of the
orders on hand at the end of December 1965 (£I04 million), 28 per cent were
for export. India (£6-7 million), Australia (£5’8 million) and South Africa
(£4-8 million) were the main overseas markets in 1965.
The trend in the industry is towards the formation of larger groups although
the high degree of specialisation makes it possible for the small firm to
flourish. The industry is centred mainly in the Midlands, Yorkshire and
Lancashire, and to a lesser extent near London and Glasgow. There are
95,000 persons employed.

International Machine Tool Exhibitions held in Britain every four years,
the next being due in 1968. The industry is served by its own research body, the
Machine Tool Industry Research Association, and its customers by the
Production Engineering Research Association.
Britain manufactures a wide range of industrial engines. Deliveries of engines
(including parts) had a value of £110-9 million in 1965 and exports (including
marine and rail traction engines) were worth £29-8 million; in addition,
parts exported were valued at £19-8 million. The total brake horse-power of
the 360,000 internal combustion engines delivered was n-2 million.
Production is concentrated among the large firms in the industry and a
total of 46,000 people are employed.
One of the oldest of Britain’s mechanical engineering industries, the textile
machinery industry, developed rapidly after the introduction of mechanical
spinning and weaving towards the end of the eighteenth century. Its range of
output embraces all stages in textile manufacturing processes. Deliveries in
1965 were valued at £104-2 million and exports (including products of some
associated industries) at £70-9 million. Principal markets were India (£7-1
million), the United States (£6 million), Pakistan (£5-7 million), the Federal
Republic of Germany and Australia.
The industry, which has about 59,000 employees, comprises over 600
firms and is situated mainly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Northern Ireland,
Dundee, Leicester and Nottingham, makes a wide range of machines and
accessories for the manufacture and processing of yarns and fabrics from all
types of natural and man-made fibres. In the case of bast and leaf fibre
machinery the United Kingdom is still by far the world’s largest supplier.
Almost every industry makes use of mechanical handling equipment; the
products of the industry range from individual units and accessories to
complete operating systems. The value of deliveries in 1965 was £126-7
million (15 per cent more than in 1964), the main products being cranes and
bridge transporters, lifts, escalators, conveyors, elevators and hoists. In
addition, British firms produced 16,100 powered industrial trucks, including
11,800 fork-lift trucks. Exports of mechanical handling equipment (including
industrial and works trucks) in 1965 were valued at £33-3 million. There are
many small firms in the industry; in all, 58,000 people are employed.
Production of equipment extends to almost the whole range of plant required
by the construction industry, including crawler tractors, motor graders,
scrapers, trenchers, dozer equipment, dumpers, excavators and loading shovels,
and crushing, pulverising and screening plant. The labour force numbers
32,000.
The value of deliveries from the industry was £159-5 million in 1965;
by far the most important single item was earth-moving machinery with a
value of £93*9 million, while other important products were crawler tractors
(j£27’7 million), and concrete mixing machinery (£13-2 million). Deliveries
of contractors’ plant for export in 1965 totalled £75-8 million; Spain, France,
Sweden, Australia, the Federal Republic of Germany and South Africa are
important markets.
The office machinery industry has been expanding rapidly and is now second
in size only to that of the United States. In 1965 the value of deliveries of

office machinery (such as accounting machinery, punched-card machinery,
typewriters, dictating machines, and duplicating machinery) was £73'9 m^^on
including £37-6 million for export. Deliveries in 1965 included 114,000
standard typewriters and 166,000 portable typewriters. The value of deliveries
of accounting and similar machinery was £45'2 iffilli°n> of which £24-6
million was for export, and of other office machinery £18-6 million, of which
£9-5 million was for export. Exports of all office machinery were valued at
£44-5 million and the most important overseas purchasers were Australia
(£7-7 million), the Federal Republic of Germany (£5’1 million) and the
United States (£4-9 million). British subsidiaries or associates of United
States firms are prominent in the office machinery industry; nearly 40 per
cent of output comes from Scotland. There are 63,000 persons employed.
The manufacture of engineers’ small tools and gauges is an expanding
industry; deliveries increased in value from £55 million in 1959 t° a peak of
£90 million in 1965; the main products were hard metal tipped tools (£14
million), other metal cutting tools (£40-4 million), jigs and fixtures (£17-1
million) and press tools, moulds, etc. (£12-4 million). Export deliveries in
1965 totalled £15-8 million. The industry has a labour force of 67,000 persons.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial plant and
steelwork, and i35>ooo are employed in this branch. Of particular importance
are steam-raising boilers, lime and cement kilns, gas and coke oven plant,
sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, chemical and mineral oil
refining plant, nuclear reactors, water and sewage treatment plant, and
steelwork for bridges, buildings, etc. The industry has several large-scale
enterprises. In 1965 the aggregate value of deliveries was £427-8 million,
one-fifth higher than in the previous year.
British companies delivered water tube boilers to the value of £86-4 million
in 1965 compared with £63-1 million in 1964? shUl boilers and other boiler-
house plant accounted for a further £3^*9 million. Water tube boilers of
advanced design and of large steam-raising capacity are produced for power
stations, whereas shell boilers are used for steam-raising and heating in
factories and buildings. Exports of vapour generating boilers in 1965 amounted
to £13-4 million.
The steelworks plant industry provides, in association with firms producing
rolling mills, almost all Britain’s requirements as well as plant for export.
The value of deliveries in 1965 was £31-9 million; rolling mills and ancillary
equipment accounted for an additional £25-3 million. Exports of steelworks
and non-ferrous machinery and similar equipment (including rolling mills)
were worth £14 million in 1965.
This industry consists of a small number of firms, most of which are
business associates or members of a consortium. Spain, India, South Africa
and Australia are a few of the countries in which British firms are undertaking
large-scale steelworks plant projects.
The manufacture of specialised equipment for the chemical and oil refining
industries has expanded rapidly in recent years. Deliveries of chemical plant
had a record value of £85-6 million in 1965 compared with £53*7 million in
1964. If the whole range of equipment manufactured by British firms for
the petroleum industry is aggregated, Britain ranks second to the United
States as a supplier. The range of chemical plant produced includes distillation
columns, heat exchangers, high vacuum drying equipment, and plant for the

manufacture of chemicals from all feedstocks including petroleum. British
chemical engineering contractors had export orders in hand in January 1966
worth over £200 million.
Three major groups of firms, consisting of leading firms in the heavy electrical
engineering, civil engineering, boiler, instrument, and associated industries,
build nuclear power stations for the United Kingdom electricity authorities,
and have built stations in Italy and Japan. The Atomic Energy Authority
grants them non-exclusive manufacturing licences and is working in close
collaboration with them in research and development.
In addition to the mechanical engineering firms described in preceding
sections, there are about 1,750 enterprises whose principal product is a type of
machinery not so far mentioned. The main products include: mining
machinery, printing and book-binding machinery, refrigeration appliances,
space heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment, pumps and pumping
machinery, industrial valves and cocks, compressors, scales and weighing
machinery, portable power tools, food preparing machinery and many other
types of equipment. The total value of deliveries in 1965 was some £677
million. There are 367,000 workers employed in these industries.
This industry makes a wide range of equipment and appliances, extending
from refrigerators of varying sizes suitable for domestic and commercial use
to industrial refrigeration equipment for cold stores, manufacture of chemicals
and other products, ice-making plant and refrigeration plant for ships.
Important advances have recently been made in the development of acceler¬
ated freeze-drying equipment for the food industry and of refrigerated
transport vehicles. In 1965 886,000 domestic refrigerators were delivered to
the home market and 188,000 were delivered for export. Total deliveries of
refrigerating machinery in 1965 had a value of £53-4 million.
The value of deliveries of space heating, ventilating and air-conditioning
equipment has been rising recently and in 1965 reached £71-5 million.
Exports of air-conditioning and non-domestic refrigerating equipment in 1965
had a value of £8-2 million. The number of houses equipped with central
heating in Britain has risen markedly since i960.
Industrial valves controlling the movement of liquids and gases are a vital
component in many industrial processes, particularly in the chemicals, oil
and electric power industries. A wide range of materials is used, including
plastics and many different metals. The value of deliveries of pumps and
valves in 1965 was ^122-8 million and that of air and gas compressors and
exhausters £41-9 million. Exports of pumps and centrifuges were valued at
£50-1 million and exports of industrial valves at £21-4 million.
The value of deliveries of other major products in 1965 was: mining machinery,
^53-8 million; food and drink machinery, £53-8 million; packaging machinery,
£27-7 million; and other machinery, £305-5 million. Important export
products in 1965 included: food and drink processing machinery, £18-5
million; cigarette-making machinery, £io-6 million; paper-making machinery,
£13-7 million; and printing and book-binding machinery, £5-1 million.
The industry manufactures photographic, scientific, surgical and industrial
instruments; it has a labour force of 139,000 persons. A rapidly expanding
sector is that making industrial process measuring and control instruments—
an essential element of automation in industry—deliveries of which amounted

to 3^69-6 million in 1965, compared to £41-3 million in i960. The value of
deliveries of other broad categories was: optical instruments, £9-1 million;
electric, electronic, and nucleonic instruments, ^24-9 million; and nautical
and aeronautical instruments, £26-8 million. The total deliveries for 1965
amounted to ^180-3 million.
Export deliveries of scientific instruments have been rising markedly,
amounting to £51-2 million in 1965, compared with ^27-9 million in i960.
The Scientific Instrument Research Association conducts research on behalf
of the industry.
Deliveries of photographic equipment in 1965 totalled ^88-4 million,
including ^34-3 million for export. The main products in 1965 were: film
(other than cinematograph film), ^27-6 million; sensitised paper and cloth,
£i()-2 million; and cinematograph film, £12-6 million. Deliveries of photo¬
graphic cameras were valued at ^3-2 million.
The present industry is largely a post-war development. It employs about
15,000 people, the great majority skilled craftsmen, and many of its factories
are located on new industrial estates in the older industrial areas, particularly
in Scotland. Sales in 1965 included clocks to a value of ^7-5 million, watches
worth £5-2 million and time switches (£7-5 million); export sales were valued
at £3-9 million.
Behind the firms manufacturing the major products outlined in this section
are nearly 4,000 enterprises, employing 244,000 people, whose main functions
are to supply parts and components, to conduct research and development
work, and to undertake general sub-contracting and repair work. (Some enter¬
prises are included because the mixed character of their work makes it
impossible to classify them under any single industry.) They include some
very large undertakings: several with more than 5,000 employees. Ball and
roller bearings, and chains, are important products; exports 01 the former
were valued at j^ii-5 million in 1965) and exports of chains at £7‘2> million.
The electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufacture and
installation of a wide variety of electrical equipment, including all types of
generating, transmission and distribution equipment; motors; telecommunica¬
tions apparatus; domestic appliances; and specialised laboratory and electronic
equipment. Output of the industry rose 46 per cent between 1958 and 1965.
Exports of electrical machinery, apparatus and appliances in 1965 were valued
at £331 million. Products are exported to all parts of the world; in 1965,
South Africa (^26-5 million), Australia (£24-3 million), the Netherlands
(£15-3 million), India (£14-2 million), and the Federal Republic of Germany
(_£ 14-2 million) were the main markets.
Altogether the industry employs a labour force of 898,000. The leading
organisation is the British Electrical and Allied IVIanufacturers Association
while scientific and technological research on behalf of the industry as a whole
is carried out by the Electrical Research Association.
British scientists and engineers have been responsible for many of the basic
advances in the generation and transmission of electric power. The experi¬
ments of Michael Faraday pointed the way to the production of electricity
as a source of cheap and abundant power; Sir Charles Parsons produced and

patented the first turbo-dynamo, the forerunner of the giant turbo-generating
sets of today. The industry is providing the plant required for the large-scale
expansion programme of the electricity authorities in Britain and has built
all types of equipment for overseas countries.
In 1965 the output of electrical machinery was valued at £425 million,
comprising £156-3 million worth of rotating electrical machinery (motors,
generators and rotary converters), £65-3 million worth of transformers for
lighting, heating and power, £173-4 million worth of switchgear and control
gear and £29-9 million worth of other electrical machinery.
Exports of electrical power machinery and switchgear in 1965 had a value
of £86-8 million; generators, motors, converters, transformers and rectifiers
accounted for £49-6 million and the main purchasers were South Africa
(£7'3 million) and Australia (£4-8 million). Switchgear, starting and control
gear accounted for £37-1 million.
Over 600 firms manufacture electrical machinery, including several with
over 7>5°0 employees. The total labour force numbers 234,000. Manufacture
takes place in many areas; among the most important are Manchester, Rugby,
Tyneside, Stafford and Larne (Northern Ireland).
Production of electronic equipment is one of the most rapidly expanding of
British industries. United Kingdom scientists and inventors have made many
basic contributions to electronics—the thermionic valve, the development of
radar (a British firm has fitted over half the world’s radar-equipped ocean¬
going ships), the first public transmission television service, and the ‘printed
circuit’, which has led to far-reaching changes in methods of production in
the radio industry. The industry employs 294,000 people.
The consumer goods sector of the industry is concerned with the manufacture
of radio and television sets and radiograms. The industry is dominated by
several large firms. Output of television sets in 1965 totalled 1-59 million
sets, while the total value of sales was £71 million, almost all of which was in
the home market. Sales of radios, together with radiograms, totalled 2-04
million in 1965 and were worth £22 million.
The total value of deliveries of electronic apparatus in 1965 was £265 million,
including £82 million for export. Indirect exports of equipment incorporated
in other products, such as ships, aircraft and machinery, are also considerable.
The largest sectors of the industry, by value of deliveries, in 1965 were radar
and navigational aid equipment (of which over one-third of the 1965 deliveries
°f £72-7 million was for export) and electronic control equipment (£56-3
million). Other important sectors include radio communications equipment
(£34-9 million in 1965), electronic computers (£34-7 million) and electronic
measuring and testing equipment (£26 million).
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
for telegraph and telephone networks and for many other purposes; its products
include submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of materials.
It is supplying the high voltage cable to carry the rapidly expanding output
of electric power in Britain (see p. 272). The value of deliveries in 1965 was
£213-6 million, 16 per cent more than in 1964. Exports of electric cables,
wires, etc., were worth £30-8 million; the main purchasers were Hong Kong
and New Zealand.
The industry has a labour force of 65,000 persons and includes three firms
with over 5,000 employees.

Britain is the largest exporter of telegraph and telephone equipment. Ship¬
ments overseas had a value of ^28-2 million in Research and development
work is done by firms in the industry in co-operation with the Post Office;
in future all new small and medium-sized exchanges installed in Britain will
be electronic (see p. 369). The industry, employing 86,000 persons, is organised
for large-scale operations, and includes several very large firms.
Deliveries of other electrical goods in 1965 included: domestic electrical
appliances, £150-3 million; electrical equipment for motor vehicles, cycles
and aircraft, £86-8 million; batteries and accumulators, £58-5 million;
electric lamps, £31-2 million; and other electrical goods, £126-3 million. By
number, deliveries included: 1-4 million electric blankets, 1-7 million vacuum
cleaners, 0-9 million domestic washing machines and 2*3 million electric
irons. In 1965 exports of domestic electrical equipment were valued at £32-1
million, including washing machines and parts (£9-7 million), refrigerators
(£4-5 million) and vacuum cleaners (£4-2 million); the main markets were the
Federal Republic of Germany (£2-8 million), Australia, France, South Africa
and the Irish Republic. Exports of batteries and accumulators in 1965 were
valued at £14-4 million. The industry has a labour force of 218,500.
The industries which manufacture vehicles and aircraft provide a significant
contribution to exports; exports of transport equipment in 1965 had a value of
£724 million, accounting for 15 per cent of total exports. The labour force
numbers 1,100,000 and includes: 498,500 in motor vehicle manufacture,
260,000 in aircraft construction and repairing, 224,000 in shipbudding and
marine engineering, 85*000 in the manufacture of locomotives and railway
wagons and carriages, 26,000 in cycle and motor cycle manufacturing, and
6,400 in the making of perambulators and hand trucks.
In both size and value the largest section of the vehicle industry comprises
the manufacture of cars and commercial vehicles. In the last few years
development schemes costing over £200 million have been completed and,
whereas the industry had previously been located mainly in the Midlands
and London areas, manufacturing and assembly plants are now in full
operation on Merseyside, in Wales and in Scotland.
Car and commercial vehicle output is dominated by the five largest firms
(British Motor Corporation, Ford, Rootes, Leyland Motor Corporation and
Vauxhall) who account for over 90 per cent of complete vehicle production;
the balance is in the hands of specialist producers of heavy commercial
vehicles, omnibuses, coaches, limousines and sports cars. The principal trade
association is the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT),
which holds a motor show annually in London and a Commercial Motor
Exhibition every two years. The Motor Industry Research Association
carries out collective research on vehicles and components.
Car output in 1965 at 1-72 million units was the second highest ever recorded.
Exports in 1965 amounted to 625,000 cars with a value of £250-5 million.
The United States (£40-6 million) was again the largest single purchaser;
South Africa (£16-3 million), New Zealand, Australia and Canada were the
other main markets.
Production of commercial vehicles, including chassis, increased from 146,000
in 1946 to 455,000 in 1965. Exports in 1965 of new commercial vehicles
numbered 166,000 with a record total value of £137 million. South Africa

(£16-5 million), Australia (j£i3-i million), New Zealand and Denmark were
the main markets for goods vehicles. Since 1961 Britain has been the world’s
largest exporter of commercial vehicles.
It has been estimated that in some cases up to 70 per cent of the final cost of
a car is represented by bought-out components. Exports of parts and access¬
ories for cars and commercial vehicles in 1965 had a value of ^129-4 million;
engines and parts for motor vehicles were valued at a further ^56-4 million.
Caravan and trailer exports were valued at fio-z million, over a third more
than in the previous year.
Deliveries of bicycles have declined in recent years, the total in 1965
amounting to 1-7 million. About 75 per cent of British manufacturing capacity
is in the hands of a single group of companies, and output is concentrated
in the Nottingham area. Over 950,000 cycles worth £8-9 million were sent
overseas in 1965 > the United States (^2-8 million) was much the largest single
market.
Deliveries of all types of motor cycle were 108,000 in 1965, slightly less than
in previous years. The 1965 total of deliveries included 28,600 mopeds,
3,800 motor scooters and 12,800 three-wheeled vehicles. Manufacture of
motor cycles is dominated by two large groups. Exports of motor cycles and
parts totalled £io-i million in 1965, the highest since 1952. The United
States (£6-5 million) continues to be by far the biggest market.
The British Railways Board has its own workshops which supply British
Railways and certain other users in Britain; private firms build locomotives,
carriages and wagons for the British Railways Board, for industrial users
and for export.
Deliveries in 1965 included 154 electric locomotives, of which about half
were for export, 565 diesel and diesel-electric locomotives, 443 coaching
vehicles and 4*625 wagons. Deliveries of locomotives by private firms in
1:965 were valued at £15-3 million. The total value of exports of railway
vehicles in 1965 was £18-3 million; Nigeria (£3-3 million) and South Africa
(£2-6 million) were the largest purchasers.
Almost all the aircraft produced by the British industry today are based on
civil and military applications of the gas-turbine aero-engine, first developed
by Sir Frank Whittle. Turbo-prop aircraft in current production and operation
include the Argosy and Herald and the Hawker Siddeley 748. Two of a
second generation of jet airliners, the medium-haul Trident and the longer-
haul Vickers VC 10, entered airline service in 1964, followed in 1965 by a
third, the BAG One-Eleven, the world’s first jet transport designed to operate
economically on short-haul routes. Other civil aircraft in production include
the Skyvan light transport aircraft, the HS 125 executive jet, the Beagle
range of light aircraft, using piston and turbo-prop engines, and the Islander,
an economical feeder-line aircraft. The Concord, the world’s first supersonic
airliner, is being developed jointly by Britain and France; the first prototype
is expected to fly in the spring of 1968.
The industry produces a wide range of military aircraft. It is also engaged
on work on rockets, earth satellites and other aero-space requirements,
including the Blue Streak satellite launcher. Hovercraft, a new type of
transport vehicle invented in Britain, are being increasingly used throughout
the world; Britain continues to lead in their building and development. The

industry employs about 260,000 people but this number is likely to decline as
a result of reductions in orders for military aircraft.
Exports of aircraft and parts in 1965 had a value of £80-9 million, nearly
double the 1964 level. Leading buyers (who vary considerably from year to
year) included the United States (,£24-7 million), South Africa (j£i i'3 million),
the Irish Republic and Iraq. In addition, exports of instruments were worth
£3-3 million, and tyres ^i-2 million.
As a result of a series of mergers in 1959 and i960, the construction of
aircraft is dominated by two large airframe manufacturers and one helicopter
concern, though there are a few important smaller companies outside these
groups. Besides extensive research work by the industry, research on a
substantial scale on problems of aircraft and their engines is carried out by
the Government, chiefly at the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the
National Gas Turbine Establishment, both at Farnborough, and the Royal
Aircraft Establishment at Bedford. This work is done in collaboration with
the industry and results are made known to manufacturers. In addition, the
National Physical Laboratory undertakes research on aerodynamics.
The British aerospace industry has over 50 collaboration agreements with
overseas governments and companies.
Aero-engines provided some £670 million in export earnings from 1946 t°
1965. In 1965 exports of engines and parts totalled ^55-1 million; major
customers were the United States (£8-5 million), the Federal Republic of
Germany (^7‘i million), France and Canada. Twelve different British jet
engines power 33 types of aircraft currently in production overseas. Nearly
half of the world total of jet and turbo-prop airliners on order or in service
have British power plants. Famous engines in production include the
economical Dart and Tyne turbo-props, the Avon, Conway, Viper and Spey
turbo-jets and the revolutionary Pegasus lift-thrust engine for vertical take-off
and landing (VTOL) aircraft. The power plant for the Concord will be a
further development of the Olympus.
Two companies are responsible for almost all aero-engine production.
The building of large ocean-going vessels is concentrated in four main
areas: the river Clyde in Scotland, the north-east and north-west coasts of
England, and Belfast in Northern Ireland. Numerous yards along the coast
build fishing vessels, yachts, harbour craft and barges, and repair yards and
dry docks are situated in all the large ports. The shipbuilding, ship repairing
and marine engineering industries employ 224,000 workers.
Co-operative research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is under¬
taken by the British Ship Research Association with its headquarters in
London and a research station on the river Tyne. Pametrada, an association
of turbine manufacturers, carries out design and development work on marine
steam turbines.
The report of a government-appointed committee, published early in 1966,
recommended a number of steps for improving the competitive position of
the industry including a reorganisation of its structure.
A gradual fall in tonnage launched from the 1955 peak of 1-5 million tons
was halted in 1964, and 1965 showed a further small rise to 1,073,074 gross
tons. British launchings were the third largest in the world in 1965, accounting
for 9 per cent of the world total, compared with 10 per cent in 1964. Sixteen
oil tankers, totalling 421,000 gross tons, were launched in 1965, including
one of over 90,000 deadweight tons which was the largest ship launched in

Britain. Launchings also included bulk carriers totalling 312,000 gross tons
and 11 cargo ships totalling 118,000 gross tons. At the end of 1965 orders
on hand of merchant vessels of 100 gross tons and over were 321, totalling
3 million gross tons and valued at ^343 million. Of these vessels, 89 of 1-3
million gross tons were for export.
Modernisation in British shipyards over the last few years has involved
the replanning of yards, the erection of large prefabrication shops for welding
massive sections under cover, the installation of heavy-lift travelling cranes,
and much other reconstruction.
Although there are many specialist ship-repairing establishments, most of
the largest shipbuilding firms also carry on repair work; about one-quarter
of ship-repairing activity is concentrated in the north-east coast of England
area.
Many of the larger shipbuilding yards maintain or have closely associated
engine building works, building various types of marine slow-speed diesel
engines, usually under licence. One firm also designs engines and there are
two independent builders of large marine diesels. Steam turbines of the
highest powers are also built, mainly to Pametrada design.
The group of industries manufacturing metal products not already described
consists of a large number of companies with a total labour force of 596,000
in 1965; the main groups were tools and implements (24,000 persons), cutlery
(14,000), bolts, nuts and screws (48,000), wire and wire manufactures (46,000),
cans and metal boxes (40,000), jewellery, plate, and refining of precious metals
(28,000), and other metal industries (396,000). The total value of exports in
1965 was about £156 million.
The production of cutlery and flatware is centred mainly in the city of
Sheffield and the industry’s reputation has been built up on the skill of its
craftsmen. Mass-production methods are, however, now extensively used
except in the case of some of the highest quality wares although firms remain
mainly small. The value of sales of cutlery and flatware in 1965 was ^16-2
million, including export sales of £4-1 million.
This industry, located mainly in the Midlands, Lancashire, Yorkshire, South
Wales and London, produces a wide range of domestic utensils, such as
saucepans, buckets and dustbins, mainly from aluminium and wrought steel.
The value of sales in 1965 was £23-7 million, of which £3-2 million were
sales for export.
The manufacture of hand tools is one of the oldest British industries covering
the manufacture of such tools as files, saws, hammers, axes and spades;
Sheffield, Birmingham and other Midland towns are the most important
centres. The value of sales of implements and tools, other than machine tools
and portable power tools, was £39-6 million in 1965, of which ^12-3 million
worth were exported; the totals included sales of hand tools, at home and for
export, valued at £35-5 million and £11-7 million respectively.
The making of jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious
metals is an industry in which British craftsmen are heirs to a long tradition.
Most of the firms in the industry are small. The law requires that gold and
silver plate shall not be sold until it has been hall-marked at one of the Assay
Offices situated in London, Birmingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh. The
298
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Birmingham office, located in the main centre of the jewellery industry, is by
far the most important. The total value of sales of jewellery, goldsmiths’ and
silversmiths’ wares and electro-plated nickel silver wares in 1965 was j£26'5
million, of which £3-6 million was for export.
The chemicals industry, with a labour force of 468,000, comprises the
manufacture of: chemicals and dyes (225,000 employees), pharmaceutical
and toilet preparations (79,000 employees), explosives and fireworks (26,000
employees), paint and printing ink (48,000 employees), oils, fats, soap and
detergents (40,000 employees), synthetic resins and plastics (36,000 em¬
ployees) and polishes and gelatine (15,000 employees). The industry is capital
intensive: the fixed capital expenditure of the industry, excluding mineral
oil refining, amounted to some £1,000 million during the seven years 1958-65
and totalled £257 million in 1965. The value of exports in 1965 was £439
million, or 9-3 per cent of total British exports. Production in the chemicals
and allied industries rose by 58 per cent between 1958 and 1965.
Organic and
Inorganic
Chemicals and
Dyestuffs
The inorganic chemicals industry dates back to the middle of the nineteenth
century; over half of the output of this sector consists of a limited number
of relatively simple chemicals, such as sulphuric acid, caustic soda, chlorine
and ammonia, produced in very large quantities and serving as basic materials
for industry. Sulphuric acid has the largest production of any chemical and
3.3 million tons was produced in 1965. The remaining output of this sector
consists of a very wide range of chemicals of varying complexity. Almost all
inorganic chemicals are consumed in other manufacturing processes and
substantial quantities are used in the manufacture of such products as
fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass and metals. Exports are important; about
one-quarter of output is estimated to be exported directly.
Production of organic chemicals (which include coal-tar chemicals) rose
by 132 per cent between 1958 and 1965. To an increasing extent petroleum is
the raw material used and it is estimated that in 1965 petroleum-based
chemicals accounted for 7° Per cent of the total output of organic chemicals,
deliveries of feedstock for the petroleum chemical plants totalled 3-3 million
tons in 1965 compared with i-i million tons in 1959. The most important
products (by weight) in 1965 were ethylene (529,000 tons) and propylene
(254,000 tons). The main outlets for organic chemicals are plastics materials,
solvents, synthetic rubber, man-made fibres and detergents. Consumption of
dyestuffs is geared to demand by the textile industry; about 37,000 tons of
synthetic dyestuffs were produced in 1965.
Exports of chemical elements and compounds amounted to £106-7 rnillion
in 1965. Exports go to a large number of countries including, in 1965, the
Netherlands (£11-2 million), Australia (£6-6 million), the United States
(£6-4 million), France, South Africa, the USSR and Canada.
The first plastic, Parkesine (later called Celluloid), was produced and
patented in Britain in 1865 by Alexander Parkes; other British discoveries
include polyethylene. Manufacture of plastics is one of the most rapidly
growing sections of the economy. Output of synthetic resins has more than
doubled since 1958 and total production in 1965 was 943,000 tons (an increase
of 8 per cent over 1964), of which 630,000 tons consisted of thermoplastic
resins. .
Expansion in recent years has mainly been in thermoplastic materials, of
which the most important are polyethylene (used in coverings and packaging—

notably for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride (known as PVC and used for a
wide range of industrial purposes and consumer goods) and polystyrene
(a cheap non-inflammable material used for toys, light mouldings and many
consumer goods). One of the newer thermoplastic materials is polypropylene,
a versatile material for use mainly in electrical components, mouldings, and
domestic appliances. Rapid expansion of capacity for all the main types of
plastics materials is planned. Exports of plastics materials amounted to
343,000 tons in 1965, valued at ^81 million. The main purchasers were
Australia (£9-1 million), South Africa (^5-4 million) and Sweden (^5-2
million).
The first general purpose synthetic rubber to be manufactured on a com¬
mercial scale in the United Kingdom was marketed in 1958. High styrene
rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and nitrile rubbers for use where oil
resistance is required, are now in large-scale production, and neoprene rubber is
manufactured in Northern Ireland. Production in 1965 amounted to 172,000
tons, by far the greater part of which came from the styrene-butadiene plant
at Hythe, near Southampton. Exports of synthetic rubber and latex totalled
50,000 tons in 1965.
The development of artificial fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
the British scientists, Sir John Lawes and Sir Joseph Gilbert. Two firms
predominate in the production of fertilisers and there are about one hundred
firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal constituents—
nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. To encourage use, sales on the home
market are assisted by government subsidies paid to the farmer (see p. 323).
Output of nitrogenous fertilisers (in terms of nitrogen content) has been
increasing and in 1964-65 totalled 599,000 tons, while 443,000 tons (in terms
of phosphate content) of phosphatic fertilisers were produced; production
of compound fertilisers amounted to 2-8 million tons in 1964-65. The use of
ammonium nitrate (35 per cent nitrogen), ammonium phosphate, and, to a
limited extent, urea (mostly 45 per cent nitrogen) is resulting in more
concentrated fertilisers.
The value of exports of manufactured fertilisers, almost all nitrogenous,
was P-2 million in 1965, nearly a third higher than in 1964.
Sales of paint and varnish during 1965 amounted to over 91 million gallons
(including 12 million gallons of emulsion paint) valued at £136 million.
Britain is the largest exporter of paints in the world; exports of pigments,
paints, varnishes and related materials in 1965 amounted to £31 million. The
industry’s indirect contribution to exports in the form of surface coatings
for finished goods is also considerable.
In recent years many improved techniques have been introduced, in
particular the use of important new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments;
quick-drying paints and paints needing only one application have been
developed.
The whole range of drugs is produced in the United Kingdom, including
sulphonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics,
vaccines, sera, and naturally occurring drugs. Over po million each year
is currently being spent on research.
Notable British contributions to the development of new products include:
the discovery of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming and its evaluation by Sir

Howard Florey and E. B. Chain; the evaluation of sulphapyridine (M & B 693)
by Sir Lionel Whitby; the introduction of the anti-malarial drug proguanil;
the discovery of griseofulvin; and, more recently, the isolation of the penicillin
nucleus and the development of several semi-synthetic penicillins. Several of
the larger pharmaceutical companies in Britain are subsidiaries of overseas
firms.
In 1965 exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products reached the
record level of £66-9 million, of which ^14 million worth were antibiotics.
The largest purchasers were Australia (£4-1 million), Nigeria (£3-5 million),
the Irish Republic, France and New Zealand.
Notable discoveries by the British crop protection industry include the
insecticidal activity of BHC (benzene hexachloride), the first selective weed¬
killer, MCPA, and more recently Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide
based on paraquat. Sales of pesticides and allied products were valued at
^22-5 million in 1965, 11 per cent higher than in 1964; herbicides (£12
million) were the largest single category. Exports of insecticides, fungicides
and weedkillers in 1965 totalled ^10-3 million.
Sales of toilet preparations were valued at £91-4 million in 1965, including
export sales of j£I0'9 million; home market sales of hair preparations totalled
£25-4 million. Petroleum is the source of the principal raw material used in
the manufacture of organic surface-active agents in detergents; the other main
constituent, polyphosphates, is derived from inorganic sources. Sales of
synthetic detergents amounted to 350,000 tons in 1965. Production of soap
was some 350,000 tons. Sales of polishes in 1965 were valued at ^17-6 million,
including floor and furniture polishes worth ^8-4 million. Exports of essential
oils, perfumery and toilet preparations, soap and cleansing and polishing
preparations were valued at £27'5 million in 1965.
The textile industries in 1965 had a labour force of 828,000 persons, including
51,000 employees engaged in the production of man-made fibres: 116,000
were employed in the spinning and doubling of cotton, flax and man-made
fibres, 107,000 in the weaving of cotton, linen and man-made fibres, 180,000
in the woollen and worsted trades, 134,000 in hosiery and knitted goods,
72,000 in textile finishing and 42,000 in carpets. Over half the employees are
women. The total value of textile exports in 1965 was £274 million, about the
same as in 1964. Production of textiles rose by 18 per cent between 1958 and
1965. Considerable reorganisation is taking place within the textile industry,
connected with the increasing use of man-made fibres, which has resulted in
several mergers and the formation of some large multi-fibre, multi-process
groups under the leadership of manufacturers of man-made fibres.
Cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods industry and cotton piece-goods
its largest export during the nineteenth century. Increasing foreign competition
and the tendency of many countries to set up their own textile industry have
cut progressively into British markets and a global limit will be placed on
imports of cotton goods from low-cost countries during 1966-70.
Output in 1965 consisted of: 485 million lb. of single cotton yarn, 143 million
lb. of spun man-made fibre and mixture single yarn, 252 million lb. of
doubled yarn, 1,015 million linear yards of woven cotton cloth, and 625 million
linear yards of man-made fibre and mixture cloth. In 1965 exports of cotton
yarn and woven fabrics (excluding man-made fibres) amounted in value to

^42 million, including woven fabrics worth £31-6 million, for which South
Africa, Australia, the Irish Republic and New Zealand were the most important
markets.
Most of the industry is located in Lancashire, the north-east of the county
being mainly concerned with weaving and the south-east with spinning.
Manchester is the commercial centre and Liverpool is the chief port of entry
for raw cotton.
Legislation to assist the reorganisation of the industry was introduced in
1959. Exchequer funds have paid for two-thirds of the cost of removing
surplus capacity, and also provided grants of about one-quarter towards the
cost of approved re-equipment and modernisation. The reorganisation schemes
were administered by the Cotton Board, a development council, that is a
statutory body with constitution and powers laid down under the authority of
an Act of Parliament. In 1964 the Cotton Board’s functions were extended
to cover the man-made fibre section of the industry.
Scientific and technical research for the industry is carried out by the
Cotton, Silk and Man-made Fibres Research Association.
The wool textile industry, the largest in the world, is the most ancient of
Britain’s staple industries and has been important since medieval times. There
are two main branches—woollen and worsted. While the West Riding of
Yorkshire is by far the most important producing area, Scotland and the West
of England remain famous as specialised producers of high quality woollen
cloth. In recent years an increasing amount of man-made fibre has been
blended with wool.
In 1965 output included 248 million lb. of wool and hair tops and 322
million lb. of woollen yarn. Production of worsted yarn amounted to 228
million lb. and of woven fabrics to 323 million square yards. In addition,
large quantities of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain. Consumption
of raw wool in 1965 was 403 million lb., compared with 518 million lb. in 1959.
Exports of wool yarns and woven fabrics in 1965 were valued at .£88-6 million;
the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany and Canada were the
chief buyers. Raw wool (cleaned or scoured in Britain) and other animal hair
and tops exported had a value of £57-7 million. Research is carried on mainly
by the Wool Industries Research Association. The National Wool Textile
Export Corporation is responsible for assistance to exporters and the develop¬
ment of new markets.
The small or medium-sized business predominates in the industry and there
are only a few large firms. In recent years on the worsted side there has been a
tendency towards the formation of holding companies controlling a number
of subsidiaries which combine all the worsted processes within one organisa¬
tion. Firms on the woollen side are normally organised to include the full
process of manufacture from raw material to finished article.
Man-made fibres produced from cellulose were first made commercially
available in the United Kingdom in 1905, and much of the early development
of viscose rayon and acetate took place in Britain. Large quantities of chemicals
are consumed in their production, which is spread throughout the country;
Northern Ireland is of growing importance. Large firms predominate in the
industry. There has been a rapid expansion of output in recent years, the
1965 record total of 862 million lb. being 4 per cent higher than in 1964 and
37 per cent more than in 1962. Output consisted of 466 million lb. of staple
fibre and 396 million lb. of filament yarn in 1965. Of the staple fibre, 146

million lb., and of the continuous filament, 180 million lb., were of fully
synthetic materials.
Two main types of man-made fibres are manufactured in the United
Kingdom: those made from cellulose (such as rayon) and those produced by
fully synthetic processes from chemical substances (such as nylon). Viscose
rayon is still the most widely used of all man-made fibres and output in 1965
totalled 434 million lb. It can be modified to produce a wide range of
different fibres such as Vincel, a formidable competitor to cotton, and Evlan,
specifically developed for the carpet industry. The world’s largest rayon
staple factory is at Greenfield (North Wales), with an annual output of
200 million lb., while other large rayon plants are at Grimsby, Preston and
Wolverhampton. Almost all the rayon in Britain is produced by one company
and its subsidiaries. Triacetate (Tricel), a stronger form of acetate, was first
produced in Britain in 1955.
Production of nylon, the first fully synthetic fibre, in the form of nylon 66,
started in Britain in 1941; another type of nylon (nylon 6) has been manu¬
factured since 1963. Total productive capacity of nylon is planned to reach
about 390 million lb. a year by the end of 1967 compared with about 160
million lb. in 1964. Nylon is used extensively in the manufacture of clothing,
fabrics and stockings, and has many industrial uses.
Terylene, a polyester fibre, was invented in Britain during the second
world war. It is resistant to fading and is particularly suited to blending with
wool. Annual manufacturing capacity totals about 100 million lb. A group
of fibres of growing importance are the acrylic or polyacrylonitrile fibres:
Courtelle (a British discovery) and Acrilan are examples. Synthetic elastomerics
or spandex fibres, which are man-made textile fibres having inherent
properties of stretch and recovery, are now produced commercially. Polythene
(Courlene) and polypropylene (Ulstron) fibres have been developed mainly
for industrial uses.
Exports of man-made fibre yarns had a value of ^37‘2 million in 1965*
and woven fabrics £20-6 million. South Africa (^5’4 million), Sweden
(£5.3 million), the Federal Republic of Germany (£5 million) and Switzerland
were the most important purchasers.
The hosiery and knitwear industry is predominantly one of small scale
enterprises. The industry is widely distributed, with Scotland and the east
Midlands as the two most important centres. Sales of knitted goods were
valued at ^323-3 million in 1965 including £128-1 million worth of outerwear
and £75 million worth of socks and stockings. Exports of knitted clothing
and accessories were valued at £16-9 million in 19651 the largest buyers were
the United States, Canada, Switzerland and Sweden. Exports of knitted
fabrics amounted to £4-9 million. The Hosiery and Allied Trades Research
Association, with laboratories at Nottingham, undertakes collective research.
The linen industry is concentrated in Northern Ireland (the greatest linen
manufacturing region in the world), with most of the remainder in Scotland.
Broadly speaking, the Northern Ireland industry concentrates on yarns
and the lighter types of fabrics, while in Scotland production is largely of
coarse linens and canvas. Northern Ireland manufacturers produced 48 million
linear yards of cloth in 1965, while weavers in Great Britain delivered 27-5
million square yards, including 17-6 million square yards of sailcloth and
canvas. Exports in 1965 included £8-3 million worth of linen fabrics and
£3 million worth of flax yarns and linen thread.
INDUSTRY
3°3
Jute Jute is manufactured on a large scale in Dundee—the centre of the world’s
oldest jute industry—and 18,000 people are employed in all. Jute is used in
the manufacture of carpets, cordage, ropes and woven into fabrics for a wide
range of uses in the packaging of carpet, upholstery, building and motor car
industries. In 1965 127,000 tons of raw jute were used, and exports of jute
fabrics totalled £2-2 million.
Lace Sales of finished lace goods amounted to £21 million in 1965. The most
important lace product is from the warp knitting machines, with sales valued
at £10-8 million. Deliveries of lace products for export were worth £5-4
million in 1965.
Miscellaneous
Textile
Manufactures
In addition to the products mentioned specifically in this section, British
textile firms manufacture a wide range of other goods, including many special
yarns and fabrics, net, household textiles such as blankets, tablecloths and
curtains, and floor coverings other than carpets. Sales of narrow fabrics
(including elastic machinery belting and ribbon) totalled £43-3 million in
1965, including export sales of £6-2 million. Sales of floor coverings of
linoleum, vinyl and other synthetic materials were valued at ^39-2 million
in 1965; just over one-fifth were for export.
Carpets In 1965 total sales of all types of carpet and rugs amounted to 110-9 million
square yards, valued at £159-3 million. Exports in 1965 had a value of £12-2
million; Australia (£3-1 million) was the largest single market.
There are over 100 enterprises engaged in the manufacture of carpets,
including several large firms. In addition to the manufacture of woven carpets
such as Axminster and Wilton, over one-third of total sales by quantity in
1965 were of tufted carpets, a form of carpeting in which the pile, usually
containing a high proportion of artificial fibres, is inserted into a pre-woven
backing. Axminster-type carpets account for over 40 per cent of exports.
The principal manufacturing centres include Kidderminster (in Worcester¬
shire), Halifax and Dewsbury (in the West Riding of Yorkshire), Durham
(in north-east England), Glasgow and Kilmarnock (in Scotland) and several
towns in Northern Ireland. Just over a third of the carpets produced by
quantity are made predominantly of wool and a growing proportion of
traditional woven carpets contain some man-made fibre.
CLOTHING,
LEATHER AND
FOOTWEAR
There are about 624,000 employees in the clothing, leather and footwear
industries. Some 451,000 are in the clothing industry, 112,000 in the foot¬
wear trade and 64,000 in leather, leather goods and fur manufacture. The
aggregate value of their exports in 1965 was £95-3 million.
Clothing The British clothing industry is the largest in Europe and total production
of made-up clothing has increased by 34 per cent since 1958. Consumer’s
expenditure on clothing in 1965 totalled £1,700 million. Exports in 1965,
including knitted goods, were valued at £49-6 million, 13 per cent more than
in 1964, the United States (£9-5 million) was the main purchaser. Exports
of women’s outerwear rose particularly sharply in 1965. Substantial quantities
of clothing are also sent by parcel post.
Although there are some large firms employing mass-production methods
on an increasing scale, the typical firm is small. The principal manufacturing
centres are London, Leeds and Manchester, but several firms are also situated
on industrial trading estates throughout the country. Fashion is important in the
production of haute couture models and throughout the ready-to-wear industry.

Leather tanning is one of Britain’s oldest industries. In 1965, 15,800 tons of
sole and other heavy leather and 469 million square feet of upper, lining and
other light leathers were produced. Britain is the world’s leading exporter
in terms of quantity, with exports in 1965 valued at £22 million. The United
States is the largest single market (^4-5 million in 1965), followed by Canada
(£2-2 million), the Federal Republic of Germany, Sweden and Italy.
Tanneries are situated in most parts of Britain, but there are important
concentrations in Lancashire, Cheshire, Yorkshire, the north Midlands and
the London area. Many different types of leather are produced, ranging
from the heavy types for industrial uses, such as machinery belting and car
upholstery, to high quality leather for footwear, leather goods, gloves and
clothing. The British Leather Manufacturers’ Research Association is the
foremost of its type in the world.
The British footwear industry is the third largest in the world. In 1965
manufacturers’ sales of footwear totalled 198 million pairs. Exports of all
types had a value of £ 15 • 3 million; the United States (£ 3 • 5 million) and Canada
were the largest markets.
Factories are located throughout Britain. Some areas concentrate on
production of particular types; for example, the Rossendale Valley region
of Lancashire on slippers, and Leicester and Norwich on women’s and girls’
shoes. The Shoe and Allied Trades Research Association enjoys a world-wide
reputation in all matters connected with shoemaking.
The food, drink and tobacco industries employ 849,000 persons in the
production of a great variety of goods. The value of their combined exports
in 1965 was ^261 million. Exports of alcoholic and other beverages accounted
for ^123-2 million; sugar, sugar preparations and honey for £23-8 million;
cereal and cereal preparations for ^21-9 million; and coffee, cocoa, tea and
spices for £13-i million.
The average weekly household consumption of bread per head of population
in Great Britain, which has been falling, was about 2 lb. 9 oz. in 1965. In
England and Wales particularly, the small ‘family’ type of baker, producing
bread with some mechanical aids, is still found, but the trend towards
concentrating production in large mechanical bakeries has become more
pronounced; well over two-thirds of the bread is made in these bakeries, which
specialise in sliced and wrapped loaves; 4 groups have a dominant position.
In the smaller bakeries production of cake and other flour confectionery is
usually allied to bread production. There are 162,000 employees in the bread
and flour confectionery industry; a further 43,000 are employed in grain¬
milling.
There are 51,000 employees producing biscuits, and annual output has been
well over half a million tons in recent years. Weekly consumption of cakes
and biscuits per head in Britain was over 12-5 oz. in 1965. British biscuits have
gained a world-wide reputation, and despite the problem of import restrictions
in several overseas markets, exports in 1965 were valued at £7'5
The chocolate and sugar confectionery industry, which has 92,000 employees,
is composed of a small number of very large manufacturers and many medium¬
sized and small firms. The main ingredients used by the industry are sugar,
cocoa beans, glucose, milk, nuts and fats. Production of chocolate and
sugar confectionery was 652,000 tons in 1965. Consumption of chocolate and

sugar confectionery in the United Kingdom is far higher than in any other
country, being equivalent to about 7-5 oz. per head per week.
The value of exports in 1965 of cocoa preparations (including chocolate)
was j£io-8 million and of sugar confectionery, £10-2 million. Canada and the
United States were the main markets for cocoa preparations. Over 30 per cent
of total world exports of chocolate and sugar confectionery come from
Britain.
Among the fruit and vegetable products manufactured are jam, marmalade,
sauces and vinegar. The labour force numbers about 73,000. Output of jams
and marmalade, which fell from 329,000 tons in 1949 to about 215,000 tons
in 1956 has since remained little changed, totalling 203,000 tons in 1965.
Strawberry, raspberry and blackcurrant jams are the most popular. Exports
of jams and marmalade in 1965 were valued at ^i-8 million.
In 1965, 625,000 tons of canned vegetables were produced. The British
Navy was using canned foods in 1813, but rapid development in the industry
did not take place until after 1935. Beans in tomato sauce (237,000 tons)
and processed peas (182,000 tons) are the vegetables most in demand as canned
products. In addition, output in 1965 included 97,000 tons of canned and
bottled fruit, and 286,000 tons of canned soup. Apples are the most important
single fruit used for canning, followed by strawberries.
The quick freezing of foods has been increasing in Britain. Nearly 88,000
tons of vegetables and 1,000 tons of fruit were preserved by this method in
1965; peas accounted for over three-fifths of all quick-frozen vegetables.
Sales of dehydrated products, including accelerated freeze dried foods,
which retain their appearance, taste and smell indefinitely, are increasing
steadily.
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and
preserving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the
preparation of extracts and pastes. The labour force numbers 85,000. Output
in 1965 included 87,000 tons of canned meat and meat products and 233,000
tons of bacon and ham. There has been a rapid expansion of frozen fish output,
and some 50,000 tons were produced in 1965; small quantities (6,600 tons in
1965) are also canned. Exports of fish and fish preparations had a value of
£10-2 million in 1965 and those of meat and meat products were worth £10
million.
The industries which manufacture beer, spirits, wines, cider and soft drinks
have a labour force of 166,000. Exports were valued at £123-2 million in 1965,
15 per cent more than in 1964.
Exports of whisky (almost all of it Scotch whisky) reached the record level
of 39-7 million proof gallons with a value of £107-6 million in 1965; over half
went to the United States (£54-3 million or 20-5 million proof gallons).
Scotch whisky was first distilled in the fifteenth century. It is blended from
20 or more different types, some from malted barley and some from other
grains. Whisky requires several years to mature, and the 126-5 million proof
gallons (a record) of Scotch whisky produced in the 1965 distilling year will
not be on sale for some years. Stocks of whisky amount to about 450 million
proof gallons, representing nine years’ consumption, of which about one-third
has been in stock for more than three years. About four-fifths of annual sales
are to overseas buyers.

BRITAIN! AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Production of gin in Britain has risen steadily since the early 1950s. The
main distillers are in London and one company accounts for a large proportion
of total output. Although the larger manufacturers also own distilleries abroad,
exports (4-4 million proof gallons) had a value of ^7-9 million in 1965.
There are 90,000 employees in the brewing and malting industry. In recent
years there has been a strong tendency towards the creation of larger brewery
units, partly to secure wide distributive outlets for the products of the large
brewing groups, many of which market beer throughout the country. Bottled
and canned beer consumption, after increasing to nearly two-fifths of total
consumption, has since dropped to about one-third; draught beer, which
includes keg beer (about 8 per cent of total output), accounts for the remainder.
In 1965 29-6 million bulk barrels of beer were produced, the same as in 1964,
and consumers’ expenditure on beer amounted to ^837 million. Exports in
1965 of malt beer were 367,000 bulk barrels, worth ^3-1 million. Firms are
experimenting with new methods, including continuous brewing processes.
The main raw materials used in brewing are malt, hops and some sugar.
Malt is made almost entirely from home-grown barley. Some brewers make all
or part of their own malt, others purchase it from independent maltsters who
also supply distillers, vinegar brewers, and malt extract manufacturers.
British malt is used by brewers throughout the world, and exports in 1965
amounted to 39,000 tons, worth £1-9 million.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade although
weather conditions can cause a marked drop in demand in some years. Output
in 1965 included 51 million gallons of concentrated liquid, and 240 million
gallons of unconcentrated drinks.
Though there has been some amalgamation in recent years, there are still
several hundred firms supplying regional markets. There are three very large
firms among the 20 or so producing widely advertised brands which are
marketed on a national scale. There is also some degree of specialisation by
firms in the production of various types, such as carbonated drinks, cola-based
drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and ‘mixers’, and comminuted
drinks (in which the whole fruit is used). Sales of canned carbonated drinks
are increasing rapidly.
The tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and other
tobacco goods sold in Britain. In 1965 consumers’ expenditure on these
goods amounted to -£1,429 million (of which about 70 per cent was tax revenue)
and, in addition, exports worth £20 million (of which cigarettes accounted for
88 per cent) were shipped to a large number of overseas markets; Kuwait,
Aden and Malaysia were the most important. The main centres of production
are in and around Bristol, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle,
Nottingham, Glasgow and Belfast. The two biggest manufacturing groups
account for a large proportion of total output. The industry has 48,000
employees.
The tobacco industry used 298 million lb. of unmanufactured tobacco
in 1965 (3-1 per cent less than in 1964), all of which was imported. In 1965
the main sources were the United States, Rhodesia, Canada and India. Total
consumption of tobacco in Britain in 1965 amounted to 255'1 million lb.,
including 220-7 million lb. consumed in cigarettes, 30-7 million lb. in pipe
tobacco and 2-9 million lb. in cigars. In 1965 112,000 million cigarettes were
consumed, 2,400 million fewer than in the previous year; 53 per cent of the
total were tipped compared with 16 per cent in i960.

This group comprises the manufacture of bricks, fireclay, refractory goods,
pottery, glass, cement, abrasives, asbestos and other building materials. The
industries have a combined labour force of 362,000, which includes 75,000
in the bricks, fireclay and refractory goods trades, 80,000 in the glass industry
and 66,000 in the pottery industry.
Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking, one of Britain’s oldest industries, was introduced by
the Romans, and manufacturing methods vary from traditional hand fabri¬
cation to highly mechanised systems. In 1965 about 7,868 million building
bricks were produced in Great Britain, 41 per cent of which were of the
Fletton type, made mainly in the Bedford and Peterborough areas. Refractory
goods (firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks and chrome-magnesite bricks)
are manufactured mainly for home use. Exports of refractory construction
materials in 1965 were worth £5-8 million.
The pottery industry is a long-established and complex industry, largely
located in the Stoke-on-Trent area of Staffordshire. Much of its raw material
is indigenous, such as china clay, ball clay and china stone from Devon
and Cornwall. It supplies nearly all home needs for domestic and industrial
pottery and its exports in 1965 exceeded £25 million. The United States,
Canada and Australia are important markets.
The largest section of the industry, about half, makes domestic pottery,
sub-divided into china, earthenware, stoneware, jet and Rockingham; the
other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical ware, and
such specialised industrial products as acid-proof stoneware, porous ceramics
and laboratory porcelain are also manufactured. Among famous makes of
British pottery are Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton,
Minton, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby. Total sales of domestic pottery
were valued at £41-5 million in 1965, including export sales of £16-6
million.
The industry employs 66,000 people, of whom 35,000 are women. There
has been considerable re-equipment; gas or electrically fired kilns have
replaced almost all the coal-fired kilns and new decorating techniques and
automatic and semi-automatic machinery have been introduced.
Britain’s glass industry is the third largest in the world. The section of the
industry devoted to the manufacture of plate and sheet glass in their various
forms is organised for quantity production, much of it in the form of the
‘float’ glass process, which was developed in Britain. Its use for internal
decoration and as a finish for internal and external walls has greatly increased
in recent years. Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the motor
industry. Other products include glass bricks, tubular glass (produced on a
large scale), mirrors, lamp and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware,
glass fibres, and all types of glass container (often made by fully automatic
machinery). A traditional product is hand-made lead crystal glassware of very
high quality, much of which is exported.
Direct exports of glass and glassware maintained the record value of £25-2
million in 1965. Those of glass were worth ^16-3 million, the most important
markets being Australia, Canada, the United States and South Africa. The
figures included £3-9 million of float glass.

Collective research is undertaken by the British Glass Industry Research
Association, and much research work is also carried out by the Department
of Glass Technology of Sheffield University.
The cement industry of the United Kingdom is chiefly concerned with the
manufacture of Portland cement. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented
in 1824, this material and the methods of its production have been the subject
of continuous technical improvement and intensive research. The capacity
of the industry, which has 18,000 employees, has increased substantially
since the war to meet the growing demands of the building industry and
further expansion is planned. About one-third of production comes from
plants situated in the Dartford-Gravesend district of Kent. Annual output,
which reached 7-7 million tons in 1938, remained at the record level of
16-7 million tons in 1965. One group of companies is responsible for about
three-fifths of total output.
The paper, printing and publishing industries have a labour force of over
643,000 including 98,000 in the manufacture of paper and board, 70,000 in
the production of cardboard boxes and packing cases, 143,000 in the publishing
of newspapers and periodicals and 258,000 in other types of printing and
publishing.
The manufacture of paper in Great Britain was not firmly established until
1678, but records show that some paper was produced as far back as the year
1492. The British paper and board industry is the largest of its kind in Europe.
Total production in 1965 of all types of paper and board amounted to 4-6
million tons, the highest ever. Of this, newsprint accounted for 768,000 tons,
board for 1-3 million tons and other paper for the remainder. Exports of
paper, board and manufactured paper items were valued at £50-5 million
in 1965. A substantial proportion of the export trade is to sterling area
countries, mainly Australia, the Irish Republic and South Africa.
Wood pulp, almost all of which is imported, is the main raw material, but
large and increasing quantities of waste paper are also used and indigenous
timber resources are being developed.
There are a few very large groups in the industry and many medium-sized
and small firms. The large groups hold considerable interests abroad, including
pulp and paper producing mills in the United States, Canada and other parts
of the Commonwealth and Europe. Sales of household paper products,
including facial tissues, have risen sharply to an estimated value of nearly
£50 million in 1965. Sales of cardboard boxes and cartons were valued at
^103 million in 1965 while those of fibre board packing cases totalled £94
million. Wallpaper manufacturing is dominated by one firm; a recent
development has been the introduction of plastic and plastic-coated wall
coverings. Scientific and technological research is conducted by the Paper
and Board Industry Research Association.
The printing industry produces an immense range of goods from national
newspapers and periodicals to books, catalogues and greetings cards. The
industry includes many very small enterprises. Mergers in recent years have
led to the formation of large groups in the newspaper, magazine and book
publishing sections. Four large firms employ more than 7,500 persons.
General printing, publishing, engraving and bookbinding remains essentially
an industry of small firms.

Publishers’ turnover in 1965 amounted to ^104-9 million, of which export
sales accounted for million. Consumers’ expenditure on books, news¬
papers and magazines totalled £312 million in 1964. Popularity of paper-backed
books has increased rapidly in recent years and a third of production is sold
overseas. According to the overseas trade returns, exports of printed matter,
manuscripts and typescripts were valued at ^50-7 million in 1965 including
books (£25-4 million), and newspapers and periodicals (£8-7 million), but
these figures do not include parcel post shipments which are considerable,
possibly as large again as the recorded totals. The United States and Australia
are the most important overseas markets. The Book Development Council
was formed in 1965 to promote the supply and use of British books overseas.
Firms have introduced the latest developments in high-speed printing
equipment, including electronic engraving machines and advanced processes of
photographic reproduction, and are experimenting with typesetting by
computer.
Other manufacturing industries include the timber and furniture group, with
304,000 employees, rubber manufacture, with 135,000 employees, and a group
of miscellaneous manufactures which together embrace some 204,000 employ¬
ees, including 91,000 employees engaged in plastics moulding and fabricating.
Britain’s rubber manufacturing industry is the oldest in the world, dating
from 1819. Macintosh invented waterproof garments, and Dunlop in 1888
devised the pneumatic tyre. Tyres and tubes represent more than half the
total output of the industry but firms also make a great variety of other rubber
manufactures, the most important being rubber footwear, conveyor belting,
cables, hose, and latex foam products.
The British industry is one of the largest in the world. In 1965 its consump¬
tion of rubber totalled 398,000 tons, comprising 184,000 tons of natural
rubber, 180,000 tons of synthetic rubber and 34,000 tons of reclaimed rubber;
the proportion of synthetic rubber used is increasing. In 1965, 206,000 tons
of rubber were used in the production of tyres and tyre products. Tyre
manufacturers include several subsidiaries of United States and other
overseas companies. Tyres and tubes exported were valued at £25-9 million;
this figure excludes large indirect exports on vehicles. Direct exports of all
rubber manufactures (including tyres) in 1965 were worth £46-9 million,
with Australia, Sweden, Denmark and the Federal Republic of Germany as
the main markets.
London is the largest centre for furniture manufacturing, but High Wycombe,
in Buckinghamshire, is an important centre for domestic furniture.
Deliveries of domestic furniture, which have risen 25 per cent since 1958,
had a value of ^157 million in 1965 and exports of furniture were worth
£14-4 million. There are numerous enterprises manufacturing furniture in
Britain (including domestic, upholstered, office, school and other furniture)
with a total labour force of 104,000. The bedding industry employs 19,000
people; sales of new bedding in 1965 were valued at £32-2 million. Many
firms are small but in recent years there has been a tendency towards increased
concentration.
Scientific research and technical information services are provided by the
Furniture Development Council and the Furniture Industry Research
Association. The Council is concerned with the management problems of the
industry and produces an annual statistical and economic review.
310 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The timber industry employs 103,000 people. Britain is mainly dependent
on imported supplies of timber (valued at £220 million in 1965) but sawmill
output of home grown timber totalled 22-9 million cubic feet in 1965* Other
products include plywood (44,100 cubic metres in 1965) and chipboard
(148,000 tons).
Toys, Games The number of people engaged in manufacturing toys and sports equipment
and Sports in Britain is 38,000. Sales of toys in 1965 were worth ^54-9 million and exports
Equipment had a value of £13-9 million. The Federal Republic of Germany, Australia
and the United States were the main overseas markets. The industry estimates
that current annual expenditure in Britain on toys amounts to about ^7 or £8
per child; current trends are towards increased production of small-scale
precision models of vehicles and equipment and greater use of plastics
materials; interest in construction kits is also growing.
The value of manufacturers’ sales of games was £4-1 million and that of
sports equipment £17-8 million, of which £6-2 million was for export.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its largest and
most important industries. It occupies about 800,000 people in Great Britain
or just over 3 per cent of those in civil employment, provides about 3 per
cent of the gross national product, and uses 46 million of the q? million acres
of land.
In Northern Ireland 27 million of the 3-3 million acres of land are in
agricultural use, and the corresponding proportion for employment and
gross output are 13 per cent and 15 per cent.
AND Land used for farming is conventionally divided into improved land suitable
for cultivation (crops and grass) and rough grazing, nearly all of which is
hill or mountain land with a native herbage of coarse grasses, rushes, bracken,
heather or scrub trees. Rough grazing has a low potential output—usually
assessed at about one-sixth of that of agricultural land—but is valuable for
sheep. In England and Wales only about one-sixth of farming land is classified
as rough grazing. In Northern Ireland the proportion is about one-quarter,
but in Scotland it is about three-quarters. In the United Kingdom as a whole
there are 307 million acres under crops and grass. Improved land and rough
grazing together represent 81 per cent of the land area. The rest is mountain
and forest, or put to urban and kindred uses. The area available for farming
is gradually decreasing to meet the needs of housing and industry; however,
the loss is more than outweighed by the increase in output from what remains.
The soils of the country are extremely varied. Many of those in the west
and north, overlying hard rocks, are poor and thin. The lowlands and river
valleys are usually fertile, varying in texture from clay to sandy loam, silt
and peat. Clay soils everywhere necessitate under-drainage, and as all are
constantly leached by rainwater, lime has to be applied at regular intervals.
In hill country the area of improved land is often small, but is usually supple¬
mented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
For many centuries the bulk of land in Britain lay in estates ranging in size
of from a few hundred acres upwards, comprising farms of varying sizes let to
tenants. Social changes of the past half-century have completely changed the
pattern of rural life in England and Scotland. Estate duties have been a
principal factor in the breaking up of estates. Most surviving estates are still
owned by private individuals or family trusts, but the Crown, local authorities,
and other corporate bodies hold considerable areas. Of the farms sold, many
have been bought by the tenants already in occupation. About half the farms
in Great Britain today are owner-occupied.
There are about 450,000 agricultural holdings in the United Kingdom,
giving an average size of about 100 acres. Slightly over half are part-time
holdings, the occupiers generally having another source of livelihood besides

farming. A recent survey has shown that there are about 220,000 full-time
holdings, and about half the industry’s total output comes from the 42,000
holdings classified as large ‘commercial’ farm businesses. A further 66,000
fell within the category of small ‘commercial’ businesses, which are able to
operate as viable enterprises. Of the remaining 112,000 full-time holdings,
farming is in general on too restricted a scale under present economic
conditions to provide a reasonable standard of living, and amalgamation into
larger units is being encouraged.
Taking full-time holdings only, the average size of holding in England and
Wales is between 135 and 140 acres of crops and grass. In Scotland the crops
and grass area of the 31,000 farms worked on a part- or spare-time basis
averages only 11 acres, but for the 27,000 full-time farms the average is
144 acres.
In Northern Ireland the land is divided into about 67,000 holdings,
practically all of which are occupied by the owner. About one-third of these
holdings are either very small or let in conacre (seasonal lettings for crops or
grazing), so that the number of effective farm businesses is about 43,000 of
which rather more than half can be said to provide a full-time occupation for
the owner. The typical farm size is between 40 and 70 acres of crops and
grass.
Most British farms produce a variety of products; the pattern varies from
farm to farm. In England the farms devoted primarily to arable crops for
sale are in the eastern part of the country, in East Anglia, Kent, Lincolnshire,
and the East Riding of Yorkshire. Potato and vegetable growing on a substantial
scale marks the farming of the Fens (south Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire),
the alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and Humber and the peaty
lands in south Lancashire. Elsewhere, horticultural crops are widely dispersed
amongst agricultural crops. In Scotland the rich lowlands of the east coast,
the Lothians and a fringe of land around the Moray Firth are also primarily
arable.
Interspersed between these arable areas, and also in the Midlands, the
south-east of England and the north-east of Scotland, there are large tracts
where, although much of the land is kept under the plough, the rearing and
fattening of cattle is an important enterprise. In the south-west of Scotland
dairying is extensively practised, but most of the north west is devoted to
rearing sheep on rough hill land. The parts of England bordering the Pennine
hills and most of Wales are also sheep-rearing areas, though a good deal of
dairying, based on purchased feedingstuffs, is also done there. Dairy farming
is widely practised throughout much of the rest of Britain. In Northern
Ireland mixed farming is practised, the most important products being milk,
fat and store cattle, pigs and eggs, with sheep and stock raising in the hill
areas. Oats and barley are widely grown, mainly for livestock feeding, and the
only important cash crop is potatoes, both ware and seed.
There are three main categories of grassland in the United Kingdom
temporary grass, permanent grass and rough grazing. Temporary grass may
be part of an arable rotation, providing a break of from one to seven years
between tillage crops, or it may be part of an all-grass system where its
advantages over permanent grass are that it can provide early and late season
grazing and often heavier crops.
Since the end of the second world war there has been an increase of about
1 million acres in the area of temporary grass and the total arable area is

about 5! million acres more than it was pre-war. In England and Wales about
two-fifths of the 24 million acres of crops and grass (excluding nearly 5 million
acres of rough grazing) is under permanent grass, nearly one-third under
cereals and one-sixth under temporary grass. About three-quarters of all
agricultural land in Scotland is in rough grazing and of the 4-3 million acres
of crops and grass about one-fifth is in permanent and two-fifths in temporary
grass. Excluding about three-quarters of a million acres of rough grazing the
crops and grass area of Northern Ireland is about 2 million acres, of which
about half is under permanent and nearly one-third under temporary grass.
Farmers everywhere are exposed to the vagaries of the weather, of pests and
diseases, and of the market; but over the past 30 years much has been done
in Britain to mitigate these risks. In part this has been effected through the
advance of science, in part through self-help by farmers’ organisations,
but probably in greatest measure by government action. The role of the
Government as guarantor and provider of technical and advisory services, is
described on p. 320.
The steady expansion in productivity which has taken place over the last 25
years is summarised in Table 18. Total cattle and sheep stocks rose steadily
each year between 1953 and 1961, but over the next three years showed a
slight decline and are only now beginning again to increase. The milk-
producing herd reached its peak level in 1962, thereafter suffering a temporary
decline with some recovery in 1965. Numbers of sheep and lambs have
shown a fairly steady increase each year, while pigs and poultry have under¬
gone a considerable expansion over the past decade. Production of wheat has
doubled since the end of the second world war, while barley output at just
over 8 million tons a year is now four times the 1946 figure. There has been
a marked fall in the production of oats, and a smaller but significant drop in
potatoes, a crop whose yield is particularly prone to severe weather fluctuations.
Between 1955 and 1965 output of pigmeat and eggs both increased by about
half and this, together with the increase in beef and milk output, resulted in
higher consumption of feedingstuffs, mostly from home resources. Imports of
concentrated feeds have in fact fallen in recent years, from 6-i million tons
in 1960-61 to 5-7 million tons in 1965-66.
The index of agricultural net output (all holdings) at constant prices has
risen steadily. By 1953-54 if was about 56 per cent above the immediate
pre-war average. Using the average of 1954-55 to 1956-57=100 as basis, it
reached 112 in 1959-60, 125 in 1962-63 and 137 in 1964-65; 139 is forecast
for 1965-66.
Since 1939 population of the United Kingdom has increased by 6 million,
or about one-eighth. In spite of this growth Britain now produces about half
of its total food requirements or two-thirds of all that can be grown in
temperate climates; this latter figure comparing with about one-half before the
second world war. Home production of the principal foods is shown as a
percentage by weight of total supplies in Table 19.
Table 20 shows how the level of the main food supplies passing into
consumption has changed since before the second world war and within the
last decade. The main trends reflected in the table are that consumption of
bulky foods (carbohydrates), such as flour and potatoes, tends to decline,
while that of high-protein foods, such as meat and eggs, continues to increase
with greater availability and rising living standards.

a Including sugar in all home-produced and imported manufactured foods, and in
brewing.
The possibilities of wheat growing, which is mainly confined to England,
have been changed radically by the advent of new strong strawed and heavy
yielding varieties, mainly from the continent of Europe but some home-bred.
These permit the liberal use of fertilisers, and spring dressings of nitrogen
have become accepted practice. Crop yields of 2 tons per acre are no longer
unusual. Over 3-7 million tons were harvested in 1965, with yields averaging
32-4 cwt. per acre.
There are two distinct markets for barley—for malting and for feeding to
stock. Malting barley has in the past commanded a much higher price than
feeding grain, but the disparity has now decreased. New varieties have
greatly enlarged yields. Since i960 the acreage under barley increased by
nearly 60 per cent and production has doubled.

Fodder Crops
Sugar Beet
Potatoes
Dairy Farming
The widespread use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation
of drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also widely
used on a co-operative basis.
In England and Wales the total acreage of fodder crops continues to decline
because in many cases farmers can provide winter feed more economically
by increased grass production and improved methods of conservation. In
Scotland the decline in the acreage of fodder crops has been less rapid and
the acreage of turnips and swedes is now greater than in England.
Beet is grown mainly in East Anglia and Lincolnshire where most of the beet
sugar factories are situated. The crop is grown under contract to the British
Sugar Corporation, which takes the entire output at guaranteed prices and
also provides technical advice and assistance. Precision drilling is the usual
method of sowing and more than three-quarters of the crop is mechanically
harvested.
Early potatoes are grown in England and Wales in numerous, widely scattered
districts with favourable soils and climate. The crop is marketed during the
summer months and reaches the consumer within a few days of lifting. Main
crop varieties, which are normally stored before sale, are grown chiefly in the
Fen counties, Essex, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. In Scotland early potatoes
are grown in coastal areas of Ayrshire and Wigtownshire, main crop
potatoes being grown mostly on the eastern side of the country; a substantial
part of the industry is concerned with supplying seed potatoes to English
and foreign growers. In Northern Ireland both main crop and seed potatoes
are produced, and a large part of the crop is shipped to Great Britain and
abroad. The long-term trend is for the area planted with potatoes in the
United Kingdom to diminish and for yields to increase. The acreage has
declined from 778,000 acres in 1964 to an estimated 680,000 acres in 1966.
The yield in 1965 was io-i tons per acre compared with the previous record
of 9 tons per acre in 1962. Although cultivation and harvesting is largely done
mechanically, a good deal of hand labour is still necessary for planting and
grading.
Milk is much more valuable when sold on the liquid milk market than when
converted into cheese, butter or other milk products. In Great Britain milk
is produced primarily for liquid consumption, but in Northern Ireland the
greater part of the milk is used for manufactured products. Production and
liquid sales are now much greater than before the war. The average consump¬
tion per head is now about 5 pints per week.
Average yields per dairy cow are still rising steadily; in England and Wales
they have increased during the last decade by more than 15 per cent and now
average over 800 gallons a year. Freedom from tuberculosis has reduced
herd wastage, and through the artificial insemination (AI) centres, operated
by the Milk Marketing Boards and other organisations, the influence of a
small number of high-potential bulls is widely disseminated. It is estimated
that about two-thirds of Britain’s total cattle are bred by AI. The Friesian
breed is dominant in the dairy herds of England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
but in Scotland the Ayrshire breed is the most numerous. Milk production
has also been stimulated by advances in grassland management, intensive
grazing techniques and new methods of making high quality hay; new methods
of conversion into silage are being exploited. Most dairy farmers practise some
degree of intensive grass management, but hay of the traditional type remains
the basic winter feedingstuff; it is supplemented with purchased concentrates.

Clean dairy farming methods and hygienic standards for equipment and
buildings used in milk production are prescribed by regulations made and
enforced by the appropriate ministers.
A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. It has been found that they meet the needs of breeders
in most countries and substantial export sales are made to buyers seeking
to replenish and improve their herds with British animals.
The majority of consumers no longer want joints from fully fattened beasts.
The average age of slaughter is about two years. Systems of semi-intensive or
intensive beef production, such as that involving large daily quantities of
cereals and correspondingly little roughage, were being increasingly adopted
in the early 1960s but are now tending to decline in popularity. In the hill
regions hardy herds of beef cattle are kept, especially of the Galloway breed
and its crosses; in marginal land and lower areas the sires used are predomin¬
antly of the Aberdeen Angus, Beef Shorthorn and Hereford breeds. Nowadays
much beef derives from the dairy herds, some females being mated to beef
sires, the majority by AI. There is a large and complex trade in store cattle
(increased by animals imported from the Irish Republic) whose general
movement is from the upland west to grazing areas in the Midlands and
arable areas in the east.
Britain has outstandingly good pastures for sheep. Moreover, veterinary
research has provided vaccine and sera protection against nearly all the
epidemic diseases to which sheep are subject. More than 30 breeds and
innumerable crosses are to be found in Britain, each breed having originated
within a circumscribed area. The basic stocks are everywhere maintained by
local selection.
In the hills, and especially in the Highlands, winter conditions are usually
severe. Draft ewes and lambs are brought from the hill areas every autumn
to swell the lowland flocks, usually in two stages: firstly, to farms at inter¬
mediate altitudes, where they are mated with rams of a larger and more
rapidly maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on in due course
to the more genial lowland conditions and especially to the Midlands and the
south and east of England, where they become crossed again with Down
rams for fat lamb production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness and the
lowland sires fecundity and early maturity.
Although wool is of increasing importance to the sheep farmer and research
into breeding for wool is being undertaken, the prime purpose of British
sheep farming today is the production of fat lambs, in response to the change
in the preference of consumers away from mature sheep.
Pig production is a complex enterprise, owing to the varying uses to which
the carcase is put. In Britain the carcase is used in three different ways:
for curing as bacon, for sale in fresh condition as pork, and for sausages or
other processed forms. Consumption per head, as pork, is now more than
double the pre-war level. For the several trades, pigs of three different weight
ranges seem to be called for but leanness is desirable in all three. Breeders,
in the main, aim at the long type required by bacon curers, for which there is
a classification system based on weight, carcase measurements of length
and back-fat. The Large White and Landrace breeds yield carcases which
meet the requirements of both the bacon and the pork trades.
Apart from type, breeders’ attention is now focused on utility qualities,
such as size and weight of litters, and on food consumed per pound of

liveweight gain. Litter recording and the performance and progeny testing
schemes for boars operated by the Pig Industry Development Authority are
providing basic data. The functions of this authority, which was set up under
the Agriculture Act 1957 to promote improvement in the production of pigs
and in the processing and distribution of pigmeat, are being taken over by
the Meat and Livestock Commission (see p. 327).
The organisation of the poultry industry has changed very considerably over
the past 20 years. Specialist techniques and intensive husbandry have been
introduced over a large part of the industry and considerable concentration has
occurred. There are now several flocks of over 100,000 birds and only a
small proportion of total production is in the hands of the smallest producers.
By 1965 about half the laying birds on farms were in flocks of 1,000 or more
With the rise in the poultry population and in the yield of eggs per bird
(now averaging over 200 eggs a year), the estimated production of eggs has
more than doubled the 1938 level and for several years nearly all eggs con¬
sumed in Britain have been home-produced.
Within the industry the trend is towards specialisation in the breeding and
supply of stock and in the production of eggs and table poultry. The mass
production of special table chickens, or ‘broilers’, has become a major
industry; it is estimated that about 180 million broilers were produced in
Britain in 1965.
Horticultural crops occupy only a minute fraction of the cultivated land of
the country—less than per cent of the area under crops and grass—but
their value in terms of output per acre is very high. The total value of
horticultural crops sold in 1965-66 is estimated at about £179 million,
compared with some £348 million for farm crops in the United Kingdom.
About 370,000 acres are under vegetables and about 250,000 acres under fruit.
Market gardening has grown up around all the large centres of population,
notably in the Lea Valley, near London. It has also flourished in more rural
areas with favourable soil or climatic conditions—in Bedfordshire, Cambridge¬
shire, Hampshire and Kent, and in a concentration of smallholdings around
Evesham, in the Avon valley. Districts with mild climates, such as the
Penzance region of Cornwall, have been favoured for the production of
selected early crops. More recently, selected vegetable crops have been grown
in increasing quantities by farmers as an alternative to potatoes.
Specialised horticultural holdings range from a few acres up to about
300 acres, and many have glasshouses, frames or forcing houses. Use of
fertilisers, particularly of an organic nature, is very heavy, and much of the
field work is mechanised. The larger holdings normally have specialised
packing sheds, with washing and grading machinery, and irrigation plants.
More and more growers, however, are coming together in co-operatives for
marketing their produce and many of these co-operatives provide grading
and packing facilities for members.
Britain has about 4,500 acres of glasshouses, about half of the area being
used primarily for the cultivation of tomatoes, the main centres of which
are the Lea Valley in Essex and Hertfordshire, and the Worthing district
in Sussex. In the Lea Valley, on a narrow belt of gravel and brick earth,
about 600 acres are covered with glass. Total production of tomatoes in the
country is estimated at about 75,000-80,000 tons annually and the value of
all glasshouse crops (including flowers) at slightly over ^40 million per year.
Hard fruits grow well in many parts of England and Wales, the chief risk
associated with their culture being late frosts. The main centres are in the

south, south-west and east of England, and Kent in particular. Production
of apples has been about equally divided between cooking and dessert varieties,
with Cox’s orange pippin heading the latter group, but production of cooking
apples is declining. About 25,000 acres of varieties of cider apple are grown
mainly in Devon, Herefordshire and Somerset for the cider-making industry.
In Northern Ireland there are 7,500 acres of cooking apples—Bramley
Seedlings—mostly concentrated in County Armagh. Plums and soft fruits
are grown in many counties; concentrations of plums are found in Kent
and Worcestershire, of blackcurrants in Norfolk, Kent and Hereford, of
cherries in Kent and of strawberries in Norfolk, Kent and Hampshire.
Raspberries are exceptional in that of some 8,500 acres grown in Britain nearly
three-quarters are in Scotland, mainly in the Blairgowrie district of Perthshire
and in Angus.
Hop-growing for the brewing industry is confined to two main areas, in
Kent and Sussex and in Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Capital outlay
and cultivation costs are very high, but crops per acre average about 13 cwt.,
worth some £460. The total annual value of the crop is about £8 million.
Estimates of farm expenses and sales and the aggregate net income of agri-
cultuial producers are prepared annually by the agricultural departments.
The estimates show that Britain s farming is based on livestock; fully
two-thirds of farmers’ income in Britain is derived from the sale of animals or
their products. 1 he aggregate net income of farmers rose from £390 million
in 1960-61 to ^475-5 million in 1964-65. The annual cost of government
support to the industry has averaged ^290 million during this past five
years.
Growing items of farm outlay are machinery and equipment, amounting
currently to about one-sixth of total expenses. Feedingstuffs amount to
almost one-third. Since 1956 wages have risen by over 60 per cent, offsetting
the lower costs resulting from the reduction in manpower made possible by
mechanisation.
Until 1958 rents tended to lag behind other costs. This was due partly to
the reluctance of landlords to put up the rents of satisfactory tenants, and
partly to the terms of reference given to arbitrators. These terms were
modified in the Agriculture Act 1958 and since 1959-60 rents in England and
Wales have gone up by about half.
The capital required for land and buildings may be provided by the farmer,
if he is an owner-occupier, or by the landlord, if the farm is let to a tenant.
Each year fixed capital totalling over £60 million is added to the value of
land and buildings (annual gross investment in fixed assets exceeds ^170
million). The bulk of the capital required to stock and run the farms is
provided by the occupiers. Bank advances are an increasingly important
source of outside capital, both fixed and working; about half the total bank
advances to agriculture are believed to be for short-term purposes. Agricultural
merchants are also an important source of short-term credit.
Accounts of some 2,000 farms in England and Wales, analysed by university
agricultural economists, show average valuations of occupiers’ capital ranging
from £20 to £55 per acre. In Scotland a similar sample of 900 accounts shows
a wide range in tenants’ capital per acre, from about £4 on hill sheep farms
■with extensive rough grazings to around £jo per acre on lower ground farms.
In Northern Ireland, on the small intensive farms, occupiers’ capital ranges
from £40 to £60 an acre. Dairy farms are usually more heavily capitalised

than other types of stock farms. On all types of farms machinery is a heavy
item; on dairy farms it is often £15 per acre and on arable farms up to £20
per acre; even on stock rearing farms it may amount to £6 per acre.
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with half a million
tractors in 1966, or one to every 36 acres of arable land. Power-take-off
implements now characterise arable farming; and some 63,000 combine
harvesters were in use in 1965. A wide variety of machines for harvesting and
preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are installed on all
except the smallest farms, many with mechanical means of handling milk.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Great Britain have an electricity supply
and accompanying equipment. There are some 1,300 farmers’ machinery
syndicates through which farmers have the use of expensive equipment
without tying up their own capital.
Research, development and testing of farm machinery are carried out at
the National Institute of Agricultural Engineering in Bedfordshire. This
Institute developed the first farm tractor in the world employing hydrostatic
transmission and also one of the most effective complete potato-harvesters
now in production.
The range of profits between individual farms is very wide, varying with the
type and size of farm, quality of land, and managerial ability of the occupier.
The average profit for farms of different types usually varies from about £5 to
£10 per acre and there is a marked tendency for small farms to show higher
profits per acre than large ones, reflecting the more intensive pattern of
farming on small farms.
Profits per acre on arable farms have, with occasional seasonal exceptions,
been maintained at a higher level than on other types; dairy farming has
shown consistent profits, coming near to arable farming in some years, but
profits per acre on stock raising farms have usually been lower these farms
are generally larger than the other types.
By the beginning of the 1930s the need for some form of State assistance to
agriculture had become pressing; it was during this time that the Government
initiated the various forms of protection and financial assistance for agriculture.
During the second world war and the immediate post-war years, agri¬
cultural production was closely controlled by the State, with County War
Agricultural Executive Committees, composed of landowners, farmers and
farm workers, acting as the Government’s local agents.
Government policy today is founded on the Agriculture Act 1947. The
main objective, as set out in Section 1 of the Act, continues to be a stable
and efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the
nation’s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interest it is
desirable to produce in the United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum
prices consistent with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers
and workers in agriculture and an adequate return on capital invested in
the industry’. To this end, the Government is empowered to provide, for
the main agricultural products, guaranteed prices determined in the light of
annual reviews (see p. 321).
Post-war policy falls broadly into two periods, with the dividing line about
1954. During the first, the chief aim was to encourage expansion and a return
to something like the traditional pattern of British farming. With the ending

SUPPORT POLICY
Annual Review

of the period of scarcity, policy has put stress on more economic production
of food of the kinds and qualities demanded by the market.
The Agriculture Act of 1957 assured farmers that the prices guaranteed
under the 1947 Act would not be steeply reduced, and at the same time
provided grants towards the cost of bringing fixed equipment up to date.
To secure a greater degree of stability in home-produced and imported
food supplies of cereals and meat, and to ensure that the support system
would not be undermined by excessively low market prices, which in turn
would increase the cost to the Exchequer of agricultural support, new
arrangements were introduced in the Agriculture and Horticulture Act 1964
which gave the Government powers to introduce minimum import prices
for agricultural and horticultural products. In the same year an understanding
with overseas suppliers on the sharing of the bacon market became effective
and agreed minimum import prices for cereals were introduced.
Under the National Plan (see p. 242) the agricultural industry was expected
to increase production to meet the major part of the growth in demand for
temperate foodstuffs by 1970 and to release substantial manpower resources.
The main emphasis in expansion is on the production of meat, particularly
beef. A substantial part of the increased demand for cereal feed would be
grown at home.
The functions of government in relation to agriculture are mostly exercised
by the agricultural ministers, that is to say, for England and Wales the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, for Scotland the Secretary of State for
Scotland, and for Northern Ireland the Home Secretary, who is the minister
responsible for United Kingdom aspects of Northern Ireland agriculture,
local aspects being the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Minister of
Agriculture. The agricultural ministers are assisted by a number of advisory
committees composed of general agriculturists and specialists.
The headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is
divided functionally, each division being responsible for a particular subject
or service. Its relations with individual farmers are conducted mainly through
its local offices, grouped in England in regions, each administered by a
regional controller working in close collaboration with the regional heads of the
technical services. Local offices in Wales are grouped under a Welsh Secretary
with similar functions and with special responsibility for Welsh affairs.
In Scotland most of the agricultural functions of the Secretary of State are
discharged through the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The
Secretary of State for Scotland also appoints the members of the Crofters
Commission and the Red Deer Commission, which deals with the conservation
and control of red deer.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture is responsible for imple¬
menting agricultural policy inaugurated by the Northern Ireland Government.
It is organised on similar lines to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food, for which it acts as agent in the administration in Northern Ireland
of United Kingdom agricultural schemes.
In February each year, in accordance with the 1947 Act, the agricultural
ministers review the economic condition and prospects of the industry.
Between annual reviews, a special review may be held if the ministers consider
it warranted, but this has seldom been necessary. In holding reviews, the
ministers are required to consult with representatives of agricultural pro¬
ducers—in practice, the three farmers’ unions in the United Kingdom. The
322

ministers consider such factors as production trends and market requirements,
world market prospects, the cost of subsidies, the trend of profits in the
industry as a whole, the increasing efficiency of the industry and changes in
production costs, trading relations (especially with the Commonwealth) and
the national economic situation. In the light of their conclusions, they
determine guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep, fat pigs, eggs, wool,
milk, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet. These guarantees apply to livestock
and livestock products for the ensuing 12 months, and to crops to be
harvested in the current year. Various grants in aid of particular kinds of
production or farming practice (known as ‘production grants’) are also
considered. Any changes in ‘relevant’ production grants (broadly, those
payable to occupiers rather than landowners) are taken into account. The
Government’s conclusions and its decisions on changes in guaranteed prices
and relevant production grants are published as a White Paper.
The long-term assurances provided for in the 1957 Act require the total
value of the guaranteed prices and relevant production grants in any year to be
maintained at not less than 97! per cent of their value in the preceding year,
after allowing for changes in costs. In addition, the guaranteed price (adjusted
for any change in the basis of the guarantee) for each commodity must be
not less than 96 per cent of that of the previous year. For livestock and live¬
stock products—where farmers’ decisions need time to take effect—there is
a further provision that reductions in the guaranteed price for any product
must not total more than 9 per cent in a period of three years. The cost of
government support to the industry in 1965-66 was about £244 million; the
estimate for 1966-67, adjusted for the effect of the 1966 review decisions,
forecast an increase to about £265 million.
The general policy of the Government is to use methods of agricultural
support that allow the ordinary channels of trade to flow freely. The form of
guarantee most generally used is the deficiency payment, which means that
the Government makes payments to producers, related to the differences
between the average market price realised and the guaranteed price, for
output eligible for the guarantee.
The deficiency payments schemes for cereals and fatstock are administered
directly by the agricultural departments. New arrangements, first introduced
for the 1961-62 season, provided growers with an incentive to hold barley
until later in the season. ‘Standard quantity’1 arrangements for wheat and
barley were introduced for the 1964 crop. Deficiency payments for fatstock
are made weekly to individual producers on certified sales on a liveweight or
deadweight basis but there may also be a second payment at the end of the
year for cattle and sheep.
For most of the remaining commodities the Government operates the
guarantee through the appropriate marketing board, which takes account of
any payments from or to the Government in deciding what to pay producers
for their produce. In the case of milk there are five such boards, and the full
guaranteed price is paid only on a ‘standard quantity’ which relates to the
1 The Agriculture Act 1947 postulates that the guarantees should be related to the
volume of agricultural produce which, in the national interest, it is desirable to produce
domestically (see p. 320). This is effected by including ‘standard quantities in the
guarantee arrangements for milk, pigs, barley, wheat, potatoes and sugar beet.
‘Standard quantity’ agreements vary in form but, in general, the basic guaranteed price
determined in the Annual Review is related to a specific quantity of produce marketed
annually on a national basis; if this quantity is exceeded the producers’ average unit
return falls.

volume of liquid milk sales plus a reasonable reserve. Milk produced in
excess of the standard quantity is sold for manufacturing considerably below
the full guaranteed price. The retail price of liquid milk is determined by
the Government so as to cover the full cost of the guarantee and, taking one
year with another, there is no Exchequer subsidy. For eggs, a subsidy is paid
to the British Egg Marketing Board on all first quality eggs sold to the Board
through packing stations. A deficiency payment is made for potatoes in years
in which the British growers’ average price for potatoes for human consump¬
tion (excluding new potatoes) is less than the guaranteed price; payment is
made to the Potato Marketing Board for the benefit of growers in Great Britain
and to the Ministry of Agriculture, Northern Ireland, for the benefit of
growers there.
For wool a fixed price is guaranteed to the British Wool Marketing Board
for every pound of fleece wool it buys from producers. This enables it to
fix in advance a schedule of producers’ prices, based on types and quality,
after making allowance for the Board’s marketing costs.
Under the Sugar Act 1956 and the Agriculture Act 1957 the British
Sugar Corporation contracts to buy the whole of the sugar beet crop produced
from a specified acreage (at present 443,000 acres) at a scale of fixed prices,
determined as a result of the annual review and related to sugar content.
Refined sugar produced by the corporation is sold, under market-sharing
agreements with the refiners, at a price based on the world price.
The Sugar Board buys Commonwealth sugar under the Commonwealth
Sugar Agreement and sells it commercially. The deficits or surpluses which
result from the transactions of both the Corporation and the Board are
ultimately reflected in the Board s accounts. When these accounts show a
deficit a levy is charged on all sugar, imported or home-produced, entering
the United Kingdom market, including the sugar content of composite sugar
imports, and when there is a surplus a distribution payment is made corre¬
spondingly, so that taking one year with another the Board balances its account.
The price supports outlined above relate only to current production. To
increase productivity, however, the Government offers to farmers a wide
range of inducements, known as production grants, for improvements to land,
crops, livestock and equipment. In 1965-66 the Exchequer’s contribution in
the form of production grants was £108 million. The form taken by these
schemes varies considerably but they fall into three main categories. Firstly,
improvement to land fertility, which is covered by a subsidy on fertilisers and
lime, by grants for drainage and water supply, and by grants for ploughing;
the Exchequer cost of these currently runs at nearly ^52 million a year. The
second type of inducement is aimed at maintaining and improving breeding
herds of cattle and sheep (particularly in upland areas) and includes a calf
subsidy on animals destined for the beef herds; the total cost is about
£40 million a year. The third type consists of a contribution towards farm
improvements generally but with particular reference to farm buildings,
silage, roads, drainage, fences and other equipment. A special scheme exists
within this category to assist farmers on small holdings in making them more
viable and a modified scheme now lays greater emphasis on business manage¬
ment and uneconomic holdings; payments are based on the implementation
of schemes submitted by the farmers and approved by the Agricultural
Departments and are limited per farm to .£1,000 spread out over three years.
This scheme at present affects some 80,000 holdings. It is estimated that some
120,000 holdings fall within the scope of these schemes.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Under the Agriculture Act 1966 the Government is empowered to make
grants to meet 50 per cent of the approved costs of voluntary amalgamations
of small farms with other land to form commercial units; and to pay lump
sums or annuities to farmers who give up such holdings for amalgamation.
Where an owner wishes to dispose of an uncommercial holding the Govern¬
ment may buy it outright for this purpose.
One-third capital grants are available towards expenditure incurred by
landowners or syndicates of farmers in erecting buildings to house machinery
or grain drying and storage facilities for use by farmers’ machinery syndicates.
Horticultural produce, because it is perishable and liable to seasonal variation
in quantity and quality, does not lend itself to a system of guaranteed prices.
Hitherto the principal means of support has been tariffs on imports, but
greater emphasis is now being placed on the need to strengthen the com¬
petitive efficiency of the industry so as to reduce its dependence upon the
tariffs. To this end grants of one-third are available to meet the capital cost
of a wide range of buildings, plant and equipment used in the production,
storage, preparation for market and transport of horticultural produce.
Additionally, small-scale horticulturists who are prepared to undertake a
three-year programme for improving the efficiency of their businesses may
qualify for a grant of up to £500. The cost to the Exchequer of these schemes
is about £2 million a year.
Special arrangements for agricultural and horticultural industries have been
made under the investment incentives procedure which replaced the invest¬
ment allowances in 1966. Broadly speaking, the Minister of Agriculture is
empowered to pay grants of 10 per cent of approved expenditure on fixed
equipment, plant and machinery, and agricultural tractors, and 5 per cent
supplements to other improvement grants with a basic rate of 45 per cent
or less.
A number of facilities for specific purposes enjoy government encouragement
and support.
In England and Wales finance for the purchase or improvement of agri¬
cultural property is available from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation
Ltd. (see p. 388). The Corporation’s funds are derived mainly from public
issues of stock, but it receives a measure of government support. Similarly
in Scotland, loans for agricultural purposes secured on agricultural land in
Scotland are granted by the Scottish Agricultural Securities Corporation Ltd.
Improvement loans for carrying out improvements to agricultural land and
buildings are also available to landowners from the Lands Improvement
Company, whose funds are provided privately.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds. The bulk of the loans issued are short-term for agricultural
machinery, but loans for such purposes as erection and improvement of
farm buildings, are for medium terms, usually up to ten years and occasionally
for longer periods in the case of farm dwellings.
Recently introduced schemes enable the Government to support financial
organisations who assist farmers, growers and their co-operatives to raise capital
by guaranteeing loans made by banks. The two financial bodies concerned
are the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Agricultural Finance

Federation, though the latter provides guarantee for co-operatives only. These
guarantees may extend to a maximum of 12 years and are available (within
prescribed annual limits) for the provision of fixed and semi-permanent
machinery and equipment, and also for the supply of working capital.
Since 1892 county councils and county borough councils in England and
Wales have had powers to provide land for smallholdings. County councils are
obliged by Statute to provide smallholdings and the Minister of Agriculture
is empowered to contribute towards their losses. In England and Wales,
about 15,000 smallholdings are provided by local authorities and about
I)300 by the Ministry. The Minister may also make loans for working
capital to tenants of statutory smallholdings. In this way they can be helped
to obtain livestock, machinery, implements and other necessary items; tenants
must, however, have available at least 25 per cent of the capital required.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which now owns and maintains about 430,000 acres of land
settlement estates, with some 3,750 holdings, mainly in the Highlands.
In the seven Scottish counties known as crofting counties—Argyll, Caithness,
Inverness, Orkney, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, and Shetland—much
of the land is farmed by crofters, tenant farmers whose holdings are generally
either rented at a cost of not more than ^5° a year or have an area not exceeding
75 acres.
In these counties there are about 20,000 crofts, which produce about
one-quarter of the total agricultural output of the area. The special problems
of the crofting counties, which had for some time been suffering from a
declining population, led to the setting up, in 1955, of a Crofters Commission
(appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland) whose functions are to
reorganise, develop and regulate crofting in the crofting counties, to promote
the interests of crofters and to keep under review matters relating to crofting.
The Commission’s statutory powers include the letting of crofts and (if the
crofters agree) the reallocation of land to form viable and self-contained
communities; it also acts as the Secretary of State’s agent in administering
development grants and loans, and collaborates with other bodies interested
in the welfare of crofters.
Land drainage in England and Wales is administered (since April 1965) by
27 river authorities (see p. 280), two catchment and 375 internal drainage
boards. Local authorities also have general drainage powers. There are no
comparable authorities in Scotland, where drainage is the responsibility of
owners and occupiers of land. River authorities have powers to maintain
and improve watercourses scheduled as main rivers. Their work is concerned
with the improvement of land drainage by increasing the capacity of rivers
and erecting pumping stations, the prevention of inland flooding—both urban
and agricultural and the erection of defences to protect low-lying areas
from coastal flooding. River authorities also have powers relating to water
resources generally, freshwater fisheries and river pollution.
Internal drainage boards are concerned with very much smaller areas and
their work is chiefly in low-lying agricultural districts. Their main function is
to keep the land drained in their area by improving the main drains and,
where necessary, by pumping from low-lying land.
The authorities derive their income directly or indirectly from ratepayers.
The Government pays grants towards the cost of the improvement schemes.
326
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Land Tenure
MARKETING
Grants to river authorities vary from 20 per cent to 80 per cent according to
the financial position of the authority. Internal drainage boards receive
grants at a flat rate of 50 per cent. Local authorities receive grants varying
from 20 per cent to 50 per cent.
In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Agriculture is the drainage authority
in respect of watercourses designated by the Drainage Council as main or
minor watercourses.
In Great Britain about half, and in Northern Ireland all, farms are owner-
occupied. The traditional form of tenancy in England and Wales runs from
year to year; in Scotland leases for terms of 10 to 14 years are more common,
although most tenants farm on a year to year basis. The tenancy agreement
may be either written or verbal and may (but need not) include provisions about
such matters as rights of cropping, liability for repair and maintenance, and
compensation for tenant’s improvements.
In order to protect the respective interests of landlords and tenants and to
eliminate uncertainty as to their rights and liabilities, a code of landlord and
tenant relationships has been written into legislation. The Agriculture Acts
1947 (England and Wales) and 1948 (Scotland) lay down the basic rules of
good estate management and good husbandry for owners and occupiers
respectively, while the Agricultural Holdings Acts 1948 (England and Wales)
and 1949 (Scotland) contain more detailed provisions.
The Acts provide for any tenancy of agricultural land, with the exception
of certain short-term lettings to which exemption can be given by the Minister
or Secretary of State, to continue in force from year to year until determined
by a valid notice to quit. With certain exceptions the tenant can contest it
by serving a counter-notice; the notice to quit then becomes inoperative
unless the landlord can satisfy an independent body (in England and Wales
the Agricultural Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court)
that his claim for possession is in the interests of sound estate management or
good husbandry or that the land is required for certain purposes specified in
the Acts.
The Acts lay down a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled
on termination of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between
landlord and tenant and may be varied by agreement at any time or, failing
agreement, by arbitration at intervals of not less than three years in England
and Wales and five years in Scotland.
Agricultural products are now marketed mainly through private trade channels
such as corn merchants, livestock auctions and markets, and bacon factories;
or through producers’ co-operative organisations. For certain commodities,
however, marketing arrangements are influenced by boards operating under
the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 (which consolidated earlier legislation).
These marketing boards are producers’ organisations with statutory powers
to regulate the marketing of particular products. The schemes under which
they are constituted and operate must be approved by Parliament and
confirmed by a poll of the producers. Most of the members of the boards are
elected by the producers but a minority are appointed by the minister or
ministers concerned. Further safeguards serve to protect consumers and other
interests affected by schemes and the public interest generally.
Marketing boards fall into two broad categories: first, those which have
powers to trade as the first selling agency for all producers not specially
exempted or, alternatively, to exercise a comparable influence by controlling

all contracts between producers and first buyers; and, secondly, boards
which maintain only a broad control over marketing conditions leaving
producers free otherwise to deal individually with buyers. The boards for
^ggs> hops, milk and wool fall into the first category and the potato board
into the second. Northern Ireland has its own marketing boards, based on
local legislation, for milk, pigs, seed potatoes and herbage seeds.
A Meat and Livestock Commission is being established under the Agri¬
culture Act 1966 charged with improving the production, marketing and
distribution of livestock and meat in Great Britain. It has a range of executive
functions extending from breeding to retail distribution, one of the most
important of which will be to evolve a general scheme of carcase classification.
It is not empowered to trade in either livestock or meat.
To improve the presentation of home-grown horticultural produce, the
statutory grading and labelling of fresh home-grown and imported supplies
is to be introduced. Initially grades will be prescribed for apples, pears,
tomatoes, cucumbers and cauliflowers.
To assist the financing of research and development in the marketing of
agricultural and horticultural produce, million was earmarked in 1962
by the Government, a similar sum being set aside by the industry. By spring
!966 grants totalling about £860,000 had been approved. The scheme has
been extended to March 1968. The majority of applications have come from
producer groups and more than half of the projects relate to livestock or
meat.
The Agriculture Act 1966 provides for the setting up of a Central Council
for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation to promote and develop
co-operation in agriculture and horticulture and to administer a scheme of
grants. The scheme is expected to incorporate and extend grants for the
co-operative marketing of agricultural (at present available mainly under the
Market Development Scheme) and horticultural produce, and also to cover
co-operative activities in agricultural and horticultural production.
The day-to-day work of treating animal disease is the responsibility of the
yetei inary profession in private practice. The State veterinary service,
inaugurated in 1865 and covering Great Britain, deals with situations beyond
the control of the individual veterinary surgeon. Centred on London and
Edinburgh, it is able, at any hour, to deal promptly with outbreaks of
notifiable diseases.
For many yeais Britain has been free from many serious animal diseases,
including rinderpest, sheep scab, glanders and rabies. A campaign is being
conducted to eradicate swine fever (hog cholera); during the three years up
to 1966 there was only a single isolated case of foot-and-mouth disease. In i960
the whole of the United Kingdom became a bovine tuberculosis attested
area. Bovine tuberculosis is now a disease of extreme rarity: all cattle are
tuberculin tested at regular intervals and reactors to the test are slaughtered,
compensation being paid to the owners.
The work of the service is backed by the extensive facilities of the Central
Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, and those of its subsidiary
laboratory at Lasswade, near Edinburgh. In addition, there are 19 investiga¬
tion centres with well-equipped laboratories in England and Wales. These
centres perform work requiring specialist knowledge and give advice on
disease problems to private practitioners. In Scotland a similar service is
provided by investigation centres attached to agricultural colleges.

In Northern Ireland the veterinary services are organised similarly to
those in Great Britain. Its geographical isolation has meant that it is free
from nearly all the major epizootic diseases. A scheme for the eradication of
brucellosis is expected to be completed by the end of 1968. The full-time
veterinary service is supplemented by the central veterinary laboratory at
Stormont, Belfast.
Advice to growers on the general control of plant pests and diseases is given
by the advisory services. In addition, the State plant health service is res¬
ponsible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests
and diseases present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones
from abroad. It also issues the health certificates required by other countries
to accompany plant material imported from Britain.
Voluntary certification schemes are operated to encourage the development
of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks, particularly of crops
subject to degenerative diseases.
Although the increasing use of pesticides has contributed appreciably to
the expansion of agricultural output in Britain, it has been recognised that
effective safeguards are needed against the dangers arising from their
uncontrolled use. The Regulations made under the Agriculture (Poisonous
Substances) Act 1952 provides protection for workers using the more toxic
chemicals. The voluntary Pesticides Society Precautions Scheme, operated
by the Government with the full backing of the industry, ensures that new
pesticides for use in agriculture and food storage, or new methods of using
existing pesticides, are not introduced until enough experimental work has
been done on their attendant hazards (including contamination of food and
harm to wild life) to allow the Government to make recommendations for their
safe use. There is also a voluntary Veterinary Products Safety Precautions
Scheme on similar lines.
A key role in the administration of both these schemes is played by the
Government’s Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Other Toxic Chemicals.
Reports of this Committee, published in 1964, concluded that there was no
evidence that the use of the persistent organochlorine pesticides presented
any immediate hazard to human beings and animals, apart from certain
species of predatory birds.
In England and Wales free technical advice on all agricultural and horti¬
cultural matters is available to every farmer and grower through the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s National Agricultural Advisory Service
(NAAS) which is organised on a regional and county basis. Every county has
a county advisory officer in charge of advisory work and is divided into
districts, in each of v/hich there is a district advisory officer who can call on an
extensive system of specialist advisers. In Northern Ireland advisory work is
organised by the Ministry of Agriculture, with a county organisation similar
to the NAAS. In Scotland the advisory services, likewise similar in scope to
the NAAS, are based on the three agricultural colleges.
The main functions of the Agricultural Land Service, which operates in
England and Wales, are:
1. to advise owners and occupiers of agricultural land on estate management
matters including farm buildings;

2. to provide professional advice and services to the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and his agents on all matters relating to farm land
and buildings;
3. to provide expert professional advice to the Minister and department
on the agricultural land use implications of planning proposals, including
the possibilities of reclaiming to agriculture, land worked for minerals
by open-cast methods; and
4. liaison with other departments and planning authorities about such
proposals.
In Scotland similar duties are carried out by officers of the Department
of Agriculture and Fisheries but advisory work regarding farm buildings is
undertaken by the agricultural colleges. In Northern Ireland advice on matters
relating to farm land and buildings falls within the scope of the Ministry’s
advisory service.
The work of the advisory and veterinary services is supplemented by
numerous technical publications.
Basic agricultural research in Britain is described on p. 205. In England and
Wales, research and advice on farm economics are combined in the Provincial
Agricultural Economics Service, which comprises ten university Departments
of Agricultural Economics and which is co-ordinated by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In Scotland, agricultural economists are on
the staff of the three agricultural colleges. The agricultural departments in
both England and Wales and Scotland have economics and statistics units.
The Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture also has an Economics and
Statistics Division and has, in addition, its own research institutions investi¬
gating problems of animal and crop production.
There are four types of institution which provide full-time education in
agricultural subjects: universities and agricultural colleges; in England and
Wales, county farm institutes, and in Scotland, farm schools. Twelve univer¬
sities in the United Kingdom provide degree and postgraduate training in
agriculture, and one other university offers postgraduate diploma courses. A
National College of Agricultural Engineering was established in i960 at
Silsoe, Bedfordshire. This is one of the national colleges (see p. 157)
established to train people for highly specialised industries, the needs of
which cannot be met at local technical colleges.
Two-year diploma courses and some specialised courses are given at five
agricultural colleges and at two of the county farm institutes in England and
Wales; three agricultural colleges in Scotland give two-year to three-year
diploma courses and also offer two- or three-term certificate courses. In
Northern Ireland there are two agricultural colleges and four more are planned.
There are 31 county farm institutes in England and five in Wales run by
local education authorities. They provide residential courses in general
agriculture, dairying, horticulture, poultry husbandry and rural domestic
economy. Local education authorities also provide a wide range of short
courses and classes for farmers, farm workers, horticulturists and domestic
producers.
There are nine farm schools in Scotland, run by local education authorities,
providing courses—mainly residential—of from one to three years’ duration
for boys and girls of from 12 to 16 years. There is one residential agricultural

school in Northern Ireland, which provides short courses for boys and girls
over 15 years of age.
Courses in land management are available at the Universities of Cambridge
and London and at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.
FISHERIES
Although the sea fishing industry contributes only about J per cent of the
United Kingdom’s gross national product, it is of greater importance to the
economy of Scotland. It is also by far the most important single source of
employment in some of the major fishing ports. The industry falls into three
main divisions, concerned respectively with white fish, herring and shellfish.
The major element of the catch (about 85 per cent by weight) is white fish:
the catches of herring and shellfish although important are relatively small.
White fish are demersal fish (such as cod, haddock, plaice, turbot and sole)
which live on or near the sea bed, and also pelagic fish (such as pilchard,
mackerel and sprats) which live mainly in intermediate waters or near the
surface. Herring is a pelagic species and constitutes a separate fishery.
Shellfish include Crustacea (such as lobsters, nephrops and crabs) and
molluscs (such as escallops, mussels, cockles and oysters).
The white fish section of the industry is made up of three main groups:
the distant water, the near and middle water, and the inshore fisheries. The
distant waters are those round Iceland and in the west Atlantic, Greenland,
Bear Island and the north coast of Norway, and the Barents Sea; the middle
water grounds lie around the Faroe Islands; and the near water grounds are
those in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and in the coastal areas around Britain.
The herring fishing grounds are mainly within 60 miles of land. The inshore
waters also yield considerable quantities of shellfish.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleet-
wood, Milford Haven and Lowestoft for white fish, and Great Yarmouth
and Lowestoft for herring. In Scotland the chief centres for white fish are
Aberdeen, Granton, Fraserburgh, the Moray Firth, the West Coast and
Shetland Islands; herring landings are made mainly at the east coast ports of
Aberdeen, Fraserburgh and Peterhead, the west coast ports of Ullapool,
Mallaig, Oban, Tarbert and Ayr, and in Shetland Islands. In Northern Ireland
the herring fishing ports are Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel.
The chief methods of catching fish are by trawling, seining, lining, and ring
and drift netting. Trawling is carried out throughout the year in the distant
and near waters for all species of demersal fish. Seining is also used for
catching demersal fish all the year round, mainly in the North Sea, the
Minches, the Firth of Clyde, and the Irish Sea. There are about 600 Scottish
and Northern Ireland seiners, and about 215 operating from English ports.
The pelagic fisheries are seasonal. There is summer fishing for herring
based on the Shetlands, the east coast ports of Scotland, and the north-east
coast ports of England, and autumn fishing off East Anglia based on Lowestoft
and Yarmouth. Other seasonal fisheries take place off the west coast of
Scotland, in the Isle of Man area and off Southern Ireland.
The inshore fisheries comprise a great diversity of types of vessels and
methods of capture; in addition, there are extensive fisheries for crabs,
lobsters, shrimps, mussels, escallops, cockles and oysters, and, off Scotland,

north-east England and in the Irish Sea there are substantial catches of
‘Norway lobsters’ (nephrops or prawns).
Distant water vessels, which operate mainly from Hull, Grimsby and
Fleetwood, numbered about 200 at the end of 1965. They are over 140 feet in
length and most of them make voyages of 17 to 23 days to fishing grounds in
the Arctic Circle. Recently, partly due to the introduction of freezer trawlers
and factory vessels, there has been an increasing tendency to fish the waters
bordering Newfoundland, Labrador and Greenland. These vessels spend
from one to three months at sea and freeze, in some cases as fillets, much or
all of their catch immediately it is taken. At the same date, near and middle
water vessels numbered 416; they are under 140 feet long and most of them
work nearer home, making voyages of from a few days up to more than
two weeks, although some of the larger vessels fish regularly off the Faroes and
seasonally as far afield as Iceland. Included in the near water group are
vessels engaged in drift net fishing for herring; these vessels usually make
daily voyages. The inshore group consists mainly of vessels of under 80 feet
which are seldom at sea for longer than two or three days and more usually
make daily landings, often fishing within sight of land.
In the British fishing industry in 1965 there were about 19,600 fishermen
in regular employment and some 6,300 occasionally employed; about two-
fifths of the former and one-third of the latter were from Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 480 regular fishermen.
In 1965 landings of fish, both demersal and pelagic, by British fishing vessels
totalled 884,000 tons (722,000 tons of demersal fish and 162,000 tons of
pelagic), valued at about £58 million. Landings at British ports by foreign
vessels totalled about 126,000 tons of fresh and frozen fish (including 41,000
tons brought direct from the fishing grounds), valued at about £23 million.
British landings of shellfish yielded ^3 million. Cod accounted for 43 per
cent of the total value of wet fish (that is, fish other than shellfish) landed by
British vessels; haddock (19 per cent) and plaice (10 per cent) were the other
most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Net imports of all types of fish (fresh, frozen, salted or canned) in 1965
amounted to about 216,000 tons valued at £67 million, including 43,000 tons
of canned salmon to the value of £28 million and other canned fish worth
j£ii-5 million.
Weekly consumption of fresh, frozen and cured fish (excluding shellfish
and imported canned fish) in Britain averaged about 16,100 tons landed weight
in 1965. Although consumption had been declining slightly, on an edible
(fillet) weight basis, it was estimated provisionally at 17-8 lb. per head in 1965,
the highest total for several years; it compares, however, with a peak total of
28-7 lb. in 1948 (see Table 20).
Processing and packaging of fish—curing, kippering, canning and quick-
freezing for consumer packs—are the subject of continuing research and
development. The production of quick-frozen fish has been increasing steadily
since 1952. With the increase in quick-freezing (which now processes over 17
per cent of all white fish landings), new export outlets have opened up for
white fish, which in 1965 accounted for over half the total British exports
of fish and fish products, valued at £10-2 million. Markets abroad for quick-
frozen fish, mainly in Europe, have been expanding; the decline in exports
of herrings has halted.

A valuable by-product of the industry is the manufacture of fish meal for
animal food and to a much lesser extent for fertilisers. Home production of
white fish meal and herring meal in 1965 was 85,000 tons.
The main commercial freshwater catches are salmon, sea-trout and eels. In
Scotland and Northern Ireland, fixed nets along the coast and sweep or
draught nets in rivers and estuaries are used; in England, drift nets are used
for catching salmon in the sea, and draught nets and fixed traps in estuaries.
In England and Wales the value of the salmon catch is approximately
£275,000 a year, in Scotland it amounts to over £1-5 million, and in Northern
Ireland to some £198,000. In Northern Ireland, eels worth about £320,000
a year are captured by long lines and by eel nets placed in river weirs.
The principal inland wholesale distributing centre for fish is Billingsgate
Market in London, which handles about 300 tons a day, but other large
cities also have central fish markets. The principal method of distribution is
through wholesalers, located at the ports, who buy at the auctions and sell
to inland wholesalers; the port wholesalers prepare the fish for onward ship¬
ment. Special express fish trains transport the catch daily from the ports to
inland centres, and increasing use is being made of road transport. Retail
sales are handled by some 25,000 to 30,000 fishmongers and fish friers; the
latter use about a third of the landings of white fish.
Recent developments include the entry of trawler-owning companies into
the system of distribution. This process is being speeded by the growing
popularity of quick-frozen consumer packs, which are sold by other retail
outlets as well as by fishmongers.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry are the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland
and the Ministry of Agriculture for Northern Ireland; the Ministry of Health
and the Scottish Home and Health Department are concerned with questions
of nutrition and hygiene affecting fish and fish products. The safety and
welfare of crews of fishing vessels are provided for under the Merchant
Shipping Acts, which are administered by the Board of Trade.
The Herring Industry Board was set up under the Herring Industry Act
1935 to reorganise, develop and regulate the herring industry; subsequent
amending Acts have also been passed. The Board consists of a chairman and
three other members, all part-time and independent of the industry, who are
appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the
Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home Secretary. The Board, whose
activities are financed partly by levies and licence fees and partly by govern¬
ment grants and loans is advised by the Herring Industry Advisory Council,
consisting of 33 members representing all sections of the industry and
consumers.
The functions of the Board include the promotion of sales of herring, both
at home and abroad, and the application of the benefits of technical progress
to the industry, including the adoption of new methods of catching, processing
and distributing herring. The Board administers the government grant and
loan schemes which provide for assistance towards the purchase of new fishing
vessels, and new engines for existing vessels. Fishermen may also obtain
loans from the Board towards the purchase of second-hand vessels under

80 feet in length and towards the cost of new nets and gear. Up to 31st March
1966, £1,661,300 in loans and £554,000 in grants had been advanced.
The White Fish Authority and the Committee for Scotland and Northern
Ireland of the Authority were set up under the Sea Fish Industry Act 1951.
The function of the Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate the white
fish industry, and that of the Committee to advise the Authority about the
exercise and performance of its functions in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The Authority is composed of a chairman and five members, and the Scottish
Committee of four members and a chairman who is a member of the
Authority. They are appointed jointly by the Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Home
Secretary. The White Fish Industry Advisory Council was also set up under
the 1951 Act to advise the Authority about the exercise and performance of its
functions. It consists of 53 members representing the various interests of the
fishing industry.
The White Fish Authority administers government grant and loan
schemes for the purchase of new fishing vessels and engines and the improve¬
ment of existing vessels. It also administers loans for the purchase of nets
and gear and processing plants. Up to 31st March 1966 £32-5 million in
loans and £15-4 million in grants were approved for these purposes by the
Authority. Its other activities are financed by a levy on first-hand sales of
fish.
To encourage the development of the sea fishing industry, Parliament has
authorised subsidies which vary according to the class of vessel used; they
are paid at the rate of so much per day at sea for the larger vessels and at so
much per stone of fish landed from the smaller boats. Subject to certain
conditions, herring sold for reduction to oil and meal attracts an additional
subsidy. No subsidy is paid for shellfish. Subsidies for white fish were first
paid in 195°) but were restricted to middle water (or nearer) catches until
1961, when they were extended to large vessels of over 140 feet in length
operating in distant waters; a total of £3,600,000 was paid in 1965-66. The
herring subsidy commenced in 1957, and amounted in 1965-66 to £342,000.
There are also the schemes mentioned above which make provision for
grants and loans to fishermen for vessels and engines to assist in modernising
fleets, including shellfish vessels. Following the report of a committee of
inquiry on the fishing industry, the Sea Fish Industry Act 1962 guaranteed
the continuance of these grants and subsidies for a period of ten years up to
1972, but provided for annual reductions in the rates of white fish subsidies
payable to vessels of 80 feet or over in length.
FORESTRY
The total area of productive woodland in Great Britain is 3-34 million acres,
or about 6 per cent of the total land area. If account is taken of areas of
scrub and old felled areas, including those cut down in the second world war,
the total rises to 4-35 million acres, or yf per cent of the land area; about
half of the area is in England, two-fifths in Scotland, the remainder in Wales.
The high proportion of unproductive woodland is largely a legacy of two wars
and, while rehabilitation of these areas continues to proceed, it is unlikely
that all areas (for instance, because of remoteness and poor site conditions)
will be replanted. A measure of the extent of rehabilitation is provided
334

by the fact that the area of unproductive woodland has been reduced by
300,000 acres since 1945.
The area of productive forest managed by the Forestry Commission, at
1-55 million acres, represents 47 per cent of the total. The annual rate of
forest extension has of late been of the order of 45,000 acres by the Commission
and nearly 20,000 acres by private woodland owners. The Commission’s
programme includes considerable planting in upland areas, especially of
Scotland, and consists mainly of conifers because of the difficult site conditions
encountered. The major species used are Sitka spruce, Lodgepole pine,
Scots pine and Norway spruce. In private planting the dependence on conifers
is high. In older woodlands and taking the country as a whole, the most
common coniferous trees are Scots pine, Sitka spruce, Norway spruce and
the larches, while among the broadleaved beech and oak occur widely.
Except for the period of the two world w'ars, when much over-felling took
place, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribu¬
tion to the nation’s total requirements of wood and wood products. Britain
imports 90 per cent of its needs by volume, and a higher proportion still by
value, the total import bill for wood and wood products averaging £470
million over the years i960 to 1964.
The Forestry Act 1919 established the Forestry Commission as the national
forestry authority charged with promoting the interests of forestry, the
development of afforestation and the production of timber in Great Britain.
As more and more of its coniferous woods reach the production stage the
Commission is assuming an increasingly important role as a timber seller.
The Commission consists of a part-time chairman, four full-time executive
commissioners and five part-time commissioners. The Minister of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales
are responsible for forest policy. Northern Ireland has its own separate
organisation (see p. 336).
The Commission’s total estate covers some 2-6 million acres and includes
i-8 million acres of forest land, of which about 1-55 million are under trees
in some 500 forests distributed throughout England, Scotland and Wales.
All these forests are covered by management plans, which provide for such work
as planting, road construction, thinning, fire protection, and timber production.
As already stated, a substantial amount of the Forestry Commission’s new
planting is carried out in Scotland, much of it in the Highland counties. The
poorer types of land are being used, such as sour, peaty soil which is unsuitable
for other agricultural purposes, and has become suitable for forestry as a
result of advances in the technique of deep ploughing.
Production of coniferous timber from Commission woodlands, mainly in
the way of thinnings, is expected to rise from some i-i million tons in 1966 to
about 2-8 million tons by 1980. Much of this kind of produce is meeting
traditional requirements of the coal mines but a great deal is also taken up by
the paper pulp industry and by new factories established to make chipboard.
The Forestry Fund was established under the 1919 Forestry Act; from it is
paid all the expenditure of the Forestry Commissioners and into it are paid
their receipts from sales of produce, rentals and other sources, together with
the amounts voted annually by Parliament. The net cost of managing the
Commission’s forestry enterprise in the year ended 30th September 1965
was £21 million. Expenditure on grants and services to private forestry was
j£i-5 million.

Privately owned woods comprise nearly two-thirds of the total forest area in
Great Britain and contain most of the mature and semi-mature timber. The
size of woodlands in individual ownership ranges from a few acres to several
thousand acres, and a high proportion of private woodland area is in small
ownership (that is, owners of up to about 250 acres).
Impetus has been given to the effective management of private woodlands
by the introduction of the Dedication of Woodlands Scheme, initiated in
1947. Under this scheme, owners are invited to put their land permanently
to timber production and to manage their woods in accordance with a plan
agreed with the Forestry Commission, in return for the provision of planting
and management grants and technical advice. By September 1965 the total
area dedicated was 827,000 acres. In addition, there are the woodlands
covered by the Approved Woodlands Scheme in which a planting grant,
but no management grant, is made; and these bring the total area managed
under agreed plans to nearly 1 million acres. Woodland owners are represented,
in their relations with the Forestry Commission, by the Forestry Committee
of Great Britain, which co-ordinates the work of two associations of woodland
owners, the Timber Growers’ Organisation (for owners in England and
Wales) and the Scottish Woodland Owners’ Association.
The Forestry Commissioners have encouraged the development of co¬
operative forestry schemes. The co-operative societies provide for landowners
and farmers the services of skilled staff, centralised purchasing facilities, and
a central agency for the disposal of forest produce. The Commission also
co-operates with the principal forestry societies, such as the Royal Forestry
Society of England and Wales and the Royal Scottish Forestry Society, in
disseminating technical knowledge.
In I959 the Home Grown Timber Marketing Corporation was established
by timber merchants to promote the use of home grown timber.
The Forestry Act 1945 established national committees for England, Scotland
and Wales, composed partly of Forestry Commissioners and partly of persons
outside the Commission. These committees act in an advisory capacity,
particularly as to the social, recreational and amenity aspects of the Commis¬
sioners’ activities and relationships with other land users.
Other bodies have been set up to provide for consultation on the marketing
and utilisation of home grown timber. The Home Grown Timber Advisory
Committee (HGTAC) is a statutory body and includes representatives of
associations of landowners and timber merchants, under an independent
chairman. In 1949 the Forestry Commissioners set up the Advisory Committee
on Utilisation of Home Grown Timber (now a sub-committee of the HGTAC)
to advise on measures designed to promote utilisation of produce from
British woodlands. A voluntary scheme was agreed upon in 1961 for consulta¬
tion on proposals for afforestation of land within National Parks (see p. 179).
The Forestry Commission, the Timber Growers’ Organisation and the
Country Landowners’ Association undertook to advise their members to
submit their proposals to the park planning authorities.
The Forestry Commission maintains three forester training schools: in
England, at Parkend in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire; in Wales, near
Betws-y-Coed in Caernarvonshire; and in Scotland at Faskally, near Pitlochry
in Perthshire. Northerwood House in the New Forest, Hampshire, is the
Commission’s educational centre, and is used for practical courses for
Commission staff and for university students, landowners and agents,

planning officers, school teachers and others connected with, or interested in,
forestry.
Higher education in forestry is provided at several universities; a
proportion of suitable graduates is recruited by the Commission as forest
officers.
The Commission’s Forest Research Station at Alice Holt Lodge, near
Farnham, Surrey, was opened in 1946. Expenditure on research work at this
station and in experimental areas in many forests in Great Britain amounted
to ,£554,000 in 1965. This sum included grants for special forestry research
work to various institutions and to university departments including the
Commonwealth Forestry Institute at Oxford, which is also financed by
the University, the Commonwealth Office and overseas Governments. Research
into the qualities of home grown timber is carried out by the Forest Products
Research Laboratory at Princes Risborough, Bucks, and also by grant-aided
research associations.
When the Government of Northern Ireland was formed in 1922, the new
Ministry of Agriculture became the forest authority working with similar
powers and duties to those conferred on the Forestry Commission by the
Forestry Act 1919. At that time the Ministry took over some 4,000 acres
for afforestation, of which 700 acres had been planted.
Forest policy in Northern Ireland is implemented by the Forestry Act
(Northern Ireland) 1953, which replaced earlier legislation. This Act pro¬
vides the Ministry with powers to acquire and manage land, and to give
financial and technical assistance for private planting. It introduced measures
for the protection of all woodlands, whether owned by the State or privately
owned, against destruction by over-cutting, fire or depredation by animals.
The State forest area has grown steadily and at a greatly accelerated pace
since the end of the second world war. By 1965 nearly 131,000 acres had been
acquired, of which about 79,000 acres had been planted. The present
afforestation programme provides for the creation, as soon as possible, of an
area of 150,000 acres of productive State forest.
Financial provision is made by sums voted annually by Parliament and
from receipts from forest produce and other sources. About 1,200 people are
employed in field labour and ancillary work. The area of exploitable private
woodlands is at present about 33,000 acres, and private planting, which is
gaining impetus, is assisted by schemes for the supply at a low cost of young
trees from the Ministry’s nurseries, by grants towards the cost of the estab¬
lishment of new plantations, and by free technical advice.
Pomeroy Forestry School at Pomeroy House, Co. Tyrone, provides
training and refresher courses for forestry workers, school teachers and
others interested in trees and forestry.

TRANSPORT AND
COMMUNICATIONS
337
Inland and overseas transport and communications employed 6-7 per cent
of the total labour force in the United Kingdom in June 1965. Of the 1-7
million persons so occupied, 29 per cent were engaged in road passenger
transport and road haulage contracting, 22 per cent in railways and 25 per
cent in postal services and telecommunications; sea and air transport absorbed
respectively 6 per cent and 4 per cent; port and inland water transport
and miscellaneous transport services and storage absorbed 14 per cent.
Transport and communications contribute about 8 per cent to the gross
national product and are responsible for 9 per cent of the nation’s gross fixed
capital formation.
SHIPPING
Of the world’s active sea-going tonnage of too gross tons1 and over, 14 per
cent is registered in the United Kingdom, making the British merchant fleet
the largest in active employment. The British shipping industry is, however,
exposed to severe international competition. The position has been made
more difficult by the prevalence among competitors of such practices as flag
discrimination, the use of ‘flags of convenience’ and the special tax privileges
granted by some governments. While from 1955 to 1965 Britain’s merchant
fleet increased by io-8 per cent from 19-4 million to 21-5 million gross tons,
the total tonnage of all other countries excluding the US reserve fleet increased
by 93 per cent, from 67-2 million to 129-4 million gross tons. After being
positive until about 1959 tho balance of payments for shipping services has
since become adverse, the deficit in 1965 amounting to £11 million. Even so,
shipping still makes one of the largest contributions to Britain’s foreign
exchange earnings. In 1965 freights, charter receipts and passage money
amounted to ^72^ million, or about one-quarter of the total value of invisible
exports. Gross earnings of the shipping industry were estimated at about
^900 million in 1964, nearly all arising from foreign trade.
During recent years, steam has steadily given way to diesel power, over 50
per cent of all tonnage being diesel-driven in 1965. In a variety of ways
technological change has been proceeding more rapidly under the current
conditions. Vessels are becoming obsolescent over a shorter period and as they
do so are being replaced by larger ships, whose building costs per ton tend to
be lower, and, equipped with labour-saving devices, their greater speeds and
faster turn-round facilities can reduce operating costs. The tendency to greater
average size has been the most marked in tankers and dry bulk cargo ships.
1 One gross ton (g.t.) = 100 cubic feet. One deadweight ton (d.w.t.) = 1 long ton
(2,240 lb-)- Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed spaces on a ship.
Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which a vessel can carry before
submerging the load-line.

SHIPOWNERS
Particularly for the shorter sea routes, more ships are being designed to carry
fully loaded road vehicles. Two British consortia have been set up to build
and operate specialist container ships, as containers involve less handling in
port and ensure faster carriage from door to door. As a result of the rapid rate
of replacements, 60 per cent of gross tonnage of Britain’s merchant fleet in
1965 was under ten years old, the corresponding figures for tankers being
75 per cent. The current average age of the tramp fleet has been estimated as
61 years.
In 1966 there were two liners from British shipyards of 30,000 gross tons
and over operating on transatlantic passenger services: namely, the Queen
Elizabeth (83,673 g.t.) and the Queen Mary (81,237 g-t-)- The two largest
liners to be built in the United Kingdom in recent years, the Oriana
(42,000 g.t.) and the Canberra (45,000 g.t.), came into service in i960 and 1961
respectively on the services from Britain to Australia and across the Pacific
to North America. A new liner, of about 58,000 g.t., is being built for the
Cunard Steamship Company.
Of the 21-5 million gross tons of merchant shipping of 100 gross tons and
over registered, but not all owned, in the United Kingdom on 30th June 1965,
tankers accounted for 8 million gross tons and 14 per cent of the world’s
sea-going tanker tonnage.
In June 1965, 17-2 million gross tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons
and over were both owned and registered in Britain.1 The usual employment
of this fleet has been analysed by the United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping
as follows: 7-4 million gross tons were employed as ocean-going passenger
and cargo liners; 3-1 million gross tons as ocean-going tramps; 5-8 million
gross tons as ocean-going tankers; and 0-9 million gross tons in coasting and
trade with ports between the Elbe and Brest (home trades).
About half of British-owned shipping registered in the United Kingdom
consists of ocean-going passenger-cargo and cargo liners, mostly the latter.
Practically all these ships are owned by large liner companies. Many of them
operate wide networks of scheduled cargo and passenger services which,
between them, cover every ocean. The 3 million gross tons of ocean-going
tramp ships are operated by a large number of private owners, some of them
having only a small number of ships and some only one ship.
According to a survey published in 1959, the British shipping industry was
composed of some 270 companies, over half the tonnage being owned by
nine or ten main groups controlling about 50 companies. Since then liner
companies have been further concentrated into eight main groups. The many
world-famous British shipping lines operating services on international routes
include: the Cunard, to North America; the Royal Mail, to South America;
the Blue Funnel, to Australia and the Far East; the Peninsular and Oriental
(P. and O.) and the British India lines, to India, Australia and the Far
East; the Union Castle, to South and East Africa; Elder Dempster, to West
Africa; Furness Withy, to North America and the West Indies; the New
Zealand line, to North America, Australia and New Zealand; and Shaw Savill
and Albion, to Australia and New Zealand.
1 The remaining tonnage included fishing vessels, tugs, river and estuary craft,
Admiralty vessels (mostly tankers) not usually engaged in the commercial carriage of
cargo, and shipping registered in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries
(including over 1 million gross tons of tankers).

Over two-thirds of the total tanker fleet belong to the oil companies,
although there are a few important independent United Kingdom tanker¬
owning companies. A new type of specialised bulk carrier—the ore-carrier—
is in use on a substantial scale; some of the ore-carriers are partly owned by
the British Iron and Steel Corporation, but are managed and operated by
shipping companies.
The main organisations concerned with the activities, interests and common
problems of the industry are as follows:
Lloyd’s Register is an organisation (distinct from the Society of Lloyd’s, see
p. 391) which surveys and classifies ships with particular regard to their
safety and operational efficiency. It will accept responsibility for surveying
and giving technical advice on vessels of all flags from the initial stages of
building, at regular intervals during their service, and after casualties. A
satisfactory Lloyd’s classification is a guarantee to an underwriter that he may
accept the risk of a vessel, and this forms a strong link between the Register
and the Society of Lloyd’s.
The representative body speaking for shipowners generally (excluding, for
the most part, owners of fishing vessels) is the Chamber of Shipping. There
are a number of local associations of shipowners centred around the main
port areas. Other organisations represent companies specialising in a particular
trade or type of cargo.
The British Shippers’ Council, formed in 1955, represents the shipping
interests of exporters and importers in matters of both national and inter¬
national concern.
The Shipping Federation and the Employers’ Association of the Port of
Liverpool are the employers’ organisations concerned with labour relations
and the regulation of employment throughout the Merchant Navy. They are
responsible for the administration of the Merchant Navy Established Service
Scheme, under which shipowners engaging crews for ships of 200 gross tons
and above engage them through the Merchant Navy Establishment Adminis¬
tration unless they are prepared to offer two-year Company Service contracts.
The National Maritime Board is composed of equal numbers of representa¬
tives of the shipowners and seafarers and is responsible for all negotiations
of wages and conditions of sendee in the Merchant Navy.
British shipping companies operating liners have associated with each other
and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes in
a series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of
rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential
principle of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight
rates or passenger fares from each port of departure. Each conference meets
from time to time to review and revise existing rates, or to compile new ones.
Some of the conferences are connected by rate agreements, or have joined
together to form wider groupings. There are over 60 conferences dealing
with trade to and from the United Kingdom.
The Baltic Mercantile and Shipping Exchange, which originated in one of
London’s seventeenth-century coffee houses, is the world’s largest market

for the chartering of ships of all nationalities. Shipbrokers and merchants’
representatives meet here to arrange the chartering of dry-cargo tramp ships
for the carriage of goods to and from all parts of the world.
The Board of Trade is the government department responsible for most
matters connected with merchant shipping, having taken over this responsibility
from the Ministry of Transport in February 1965. Under the Merchant
Shipping Act 1894 and subsequent legislation, it administers many regulations
for marine safety and welfare, for instance: certifying the load-line (or Plimsoll
line) that shows that a ship is not overloaded; ensuring that standards of
safety are observed in ship construction; ensuring the provision of adequate
life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment; and dealing with the discipline,
professional standards, health and accommodation of seamen. Most of the
work which these responsibilities entail is carried out by the officers of the
Marine Survey and Mercantile Marine at the ports. There is also a Registrar-
General of Shipping and Seamen in whose office at Cardiff a complete record
of all British ships and seamen is kept.
Abroad, certain parts of the Merchant Shipping Acts, in particular those
provisions dealing with the engagement and discharge of crews outside the
United Kingdom, are administered by H.M. Consuls and by officers of
Commonwealth and Colonial Governments.
Britain is a party to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention
of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil which came into force in 1958. The nations
which have ratified this convention agree to prohibit their national fleets
from persistent discharging of oil within 50 miles of any coast and also in
extensive areas of the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and around Australia.
Amendments to the Convention were agreed at an international conference
held in London in 1962. British ships registered in the United Kingdom were
already prohibited from discharging oil within a wide zone of the sea around
the United Kingdom under the Oil in Navigable Waters Act 1955 (the
discharge of oil from any source into United Kingdom territorial waters and
harbours was first prohibited in 1922); a further Act was passed in 1963 giving
effect to the amendments agreed at the 1962 conference.
The Board of Trade administers the Coastguard Service. This is primarily a
life-saving organisation which keeps watch at danger points around the coast
for vessels in distress and renders assistance either by coastguard rescue
equipment or by informing other authorities who may be able to give help.
During the year ended 31st March 1966 life-saving action was taken on
2,912 occasions. There is close liaison between the Coastguard Service and
the Royal National Life-boat Institution. The latter maintains lifeboats and
fast inshore rescue boats around the coast of the United Kingdom; it is
supported entirely by voluntary contributions, and depends largely for its
operation on voluntary workers. From its foundation in 1824 to the end of
1965 the Royal National Life-boat Institution saved 86,602 lives. Lifeboats and
inshore rescue boats were launched 1,500 times in 1965) and rescued 1,099
people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel
Islands and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which received its
first Royal Charter in the sixteenth century and is administered by a Board
of ten Elder Brethren, elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.

Trinity House is also the chief pilotage authority, licensing some 750 pilots
in 41 districts in England and Wales, including London. In some cases the
harbour authority or local council is the pilotage authority. The Board of
Trade also has certain responsibilities in connection with lighthouses and
pilotage.
At the end of 1965 there were about 120,000 United Kingdom personnel
and 40,000 aliens employed by the merchant fleet; of these, masters, deck and
engineer officers numbered 38,000.
The Board of Trade holds examinations for, and issues certificates of
competency to, ships’ officers as master, first mate and second mate of
foreign-going ships, or master and mate of home trade ships and as first-class
engineer and second-class engineer. Officers may not normally serve on board
ships in these grades unless they hold the appropriate, or a higher, certificate.
Radio officers are required to hold certificates of competency in radio¬
telegraphy issued by the Postmaster General on the results of an open
examination.
A seaman may not be rated as A.B. (Able Seaman) in United Kingdom
registered ships unless he holds a certificate of competency as A.B. granted
by the Board of Trade, or an equivalent certificate. To obtain this certificate
a seaman must, among other qualifications, have served three years at sea on
deck, have obtained a certificate of efficiency as lifeboatman and have passed
a qualifying examination.
Seamen qualify by seniority for promotion to the rating of petty officer.
Service as a deck rating qualifies for the purpose of admission to the examina¬
tion for a second mate’s certificate.
The Merchant Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies
of apprentices, cadets and ratings who are preparing for their examinations
for the various certificates of competency.
Wages and conditions of employment are negotiated by the National Maritime
Board. Minimum wages and holidays with pay are guaranteed for both officers
and ratings. Moreover, the Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme,
introduced by the Board in 1947, has removed a great deal of the uncertainty
formerly associated with a seafaring life. Officers and men can now take
two-year contracts, not only with individual shipping companies but with
the industry as a whole, and get special benefits, in addition to the normal
unemployment insurance benefit, when they are ashore between voyages.
There are over 300 ports in Britain. In 1965, 151 million tons of imports,
including 83 million tons of petroleum and petroleum products, passed
through the ports and 35 million tons of exports and re-exports, including
5 million tons of coal.
As a result both of the anticipated increase in the country’s trade and of
technological changes affecting sea-going traffic (such as the shift to larger
tankers and bulk carriers implying a need for more deep-water berths,
demand for the development of mechanical handling methods, packaging of
general cargo in standard sizes and ‘roll-on, roll-off’ services) large-scale
modernisation of the ports system has become necessary.
342
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Principal
Ports
The National Ports Council published in July 1965 an Interim Plan covering
the period up to 1971. Development schemes were recommended for 14
ports, in particular London, Liverpool and Bristol, involving the building of
about 70 new berths and the renovation of about 46 more, at a cost of about
£150 million. Expenditure is estimated to rise to £60 million a year by 1967,
as against the average of £20 million for recent years.
The Council, set up in 1964 as a statutory body under the Harbours Act
of that year, is financed by a levy on harbour authorities and is primarily an
advisory body, with the executive powers for the carrying out of its recom¬
mendations vested in the Minister of Transport. It advises the Minister on
major port developments, and has various responsibilities in relation to
research, training and charges. Its main task is the preparation and supervision
of a long-term national plan for the ports as a whole. The Council is encouraging
the improvement of port organisation by means of amalgamation of harbour
authorities in an estuary into a single port authority; the Clyde Port Authority
came into existence in 1966.
In June 1966 the Minister of Transport announced proposals to make
grants of 20 per cent of approved capital expenditure to statutory and other
harbour authorities and persons carrying out harbour operations. The first
grant payments will be made in the second quarter of 1967.
The Port of London, with 92 miles of waterway and about 4,000 acres of
dock estate, including 3 5 miles of quayage, is the largest port in the Common¬
wealth and, with New York and Rotterdam, is one of the three largest ports
in the world. Goods of every kind, from meat to marble, from plywood to
perfume, pass through the docks; about 59 million tons of cargo were handled
in the year ending in March 1965. Imports are distributed all over the United
Kingdom, though the port primarily supplies Greater London and the home
counties. The Thames Navigation Service, operating from Gravesend, provides
navigational surveillance and information, by means of radar and radio
telephone and other methods, for vessels between the estuary and London
Bridge.
Liverpool is the second largest port and the major export cargo outlet of
the United Kingdom. The port handles one-sixth of Britain’s grain imports
and has one of the largest grain-handling plants in Europe. There are tobacco
warehouses with a capacity of 200,000 casks and, for wool imports, a warehouse
with a capacity of 60,000 bales. In 1965, 9 million tons of imports (excluding
petroleum and cattle) passed through the port. Full use of the new terminal
at Tranmere raised imports of oil from under a million tons in i960 to 10
million tons in 1965, and crude oil is now the major commodity entering the
port of Liverpool. In 1948 the Harbour Board became the first in the world to
install radar to cover its sea channels.
Manchester is an inland port, access to which is by the Manchester Ship
Canal. Petroleum is both the main import and export. At Eastham is the
largest oil dock in the United Kingdom, covering 19 acres.
Southampton is the chief port for ocean passenger traffic, and the principal
port for imports of deciduous and citrus fruits. Southampton’s value as a
port is enhanced by its deep water, double tides and its easy access to
London. A considerable volume of oil for the refinery at Fawley (see p. 270) is
handled.
Newcastle upon Tyne and the other Tyne ports serve the industrial north¬
east of England and comprise the most important coal-shipping and largest
ship-repairing centre in the country.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS 343
Hull, on the Humber estuary, serves particularly the industrial centres of
Yorkshire and the Midlands, and is one of the largest white fish ports in
the world. Other imports are grain, timber and oil.
Tees ports are one of the largest centres for importing iron ore and for
exporting steel and engineering products.
Swansea has the largest trade of the group of ports serving South Wales.
As well as coal, Swansea exports the steel and tinplate manufactured in its
immediate neighbourhood. It is also an important oil port.
Newport (Monmouthshire) and Port Talbot are two of Britain’s principal
ore-importing centres. Newport has an important and growing general cargo
trade.
Bristol and nearby Avonmouth serve the industrial Midlands as well as the
city of Bristol itself, and also have a large coastal trade. About 71 million tons
of cargo are handled annually, including a quarter of Britain’s banana imports
and one-fifth of its tobacco imports. There are also extensive oil installations.
Glasgow, the principal Scottish port, serves as an entrepot centre for the
industrial area of central Scotland, and is the principal outlet for exports of
Scotch whisky.
Grangemouth, Scotland s second port, is associated particularly with oil
and timber.
Leith is the port of the city of Edinburgh. The chief import is grain and
the main export coal from the Lothian coalfields.
Belfast is the principal port of Northern Ireland and handles the main
traffic across the Irish Sea.
Other major ports are Immingham, with an important trade in chemicals,
coal and petroleum, Cardiff, for iron ore, petroleum and general traffics'
and Milford Haven for oil.
Constructions in progress include major improvements at Hull, a project
costing about £6 million at Leith, and work costing £9-5 million on extensions
to Tilbury Docks in London. Developments completed in 1965 included a
^1-3 million dry dock at Glasgow and £6 million improvements to Tilbury
Docks including two new deep-water berths. Early in 1966 the British
Transport Docks Board (BTDB) announced an £88 million investment
programme to cover the next five years, with major plans for deep-water
berths at Southampton, Hull, Immingham and Newport and extensive
dredging activities. The BTDB and Steel Company of Wales are building a
new deep-water harbour at Port Talbot to serve as an ore terminal at a cost of
£17 million.
Since 1948 about a third of the total port capacity has been Government
owned, the British Transport Docks Board (see p. 346) owns the majority of
such ports which include Southampton, Hull, Immingham, Cardiff and
Swansea.
Certain ports and docks used largely for the cross-channel services of the
railways are administered by the British Railways Board: examples are
Folkestone, Holyhead, Heysham, Stranraer and Parkeston Quay (at Harwich).
In 1965 shipping arrivals and departures at BTDB docks, at which 11,100
were employed at the end of that year, totalled 89 million net registered tons
(including fishing vessels), and the total cargo handled was about c2 million
tons.
Other ports are controlled by public trusts on which are represented users
of the port (such as shippers, importers and shipping companies) and other
bodies, such as local authorities. Examples are London (controlled by the
M

Port of London Authority), Liverpool (Mersey Docks and Harbour Board),
and Belfast (Belfast Harbour Commissioners).
The powers and responsibilities of the port authorities are, in the main,
set down in private Acts of Parliament. A model set of clauses dealing with
many of the details is set out in the Harbours, Docks and Piers Act 1847.
Most ports are represented on the Dock and Harbour Authorities’
Association, formed in 1917 to represent the common interests of port
authorities in their relations with government, shipowners and traders.
About 120,000 people are employed in the operation of ports in the United
Kingdom. At the end of 1965 there were 64,000 dock workers employed by
the National Dock Labour Board and doing physical handling of cargo, the
remainder including administrative, clerical and technical staff, and pilots,
lightermen and customs officials.
Because arrivals and departures of ships are liable to occur at irregular
intervals without conforming to set schedules a system of largely casual labour
has always existed at the docks. However, a start was made on ‘decasualisation’
in 1941 when war-time controls were imposed. In 1947 the National Dock
Labour Board was established, with members appointed by the Minister of
Labour and representing both employers and employed. The Board administers
a scheme under which registered workers receive a guaranteed minimum wage
for attendance even when no work is available. A minority of the labour force,
at present about one-quarter, is engaged on a permanent basis by the port
employers. Efforts are now being made to work out a new scheme to put all
employment on a permanent basis, in line with the recommendations of the
1965 Devlin report on labour relations in the docks. A National Modernisation
Committee for the Port Transport Industry, drawn from both management
and labour sides, has been set up to consider how this should be done.
Most of the oil tankers coming to the United Kingdom to discharge crude
oil are berthed at special tanker terminals which are near the oil refineries
and are owned and operated by the oil companies. The maximum deadweight
tonnage of tankers that some of the most important terminals can accommodate
at present is: Finnart (West of Scotland) 100,000; Isle of Grain (Thames
estuary) 42,000; Coryton (London) 45,000; Tilbury Reach (London) 47,000;
Thames Haven (London) 60,000; Tranmere (Liverpool) 65,000; Milford
Haven (Pembroke) 100,000; and Fawley (Southampton) 90,000. Long
pipelines connect Finnart with the refinery at Grangemouth on the Firth of
Forth, and Angle Bay (Milford Haven) with the refinery at Llandarcy (near
Swansea).
New terminals for crude oil are being built at Milford Haven, at the Isle of
Grain and on the river Tees, whilst the capacity of existing terminals on the
Tyne and the Thames is being increased by dredging.
INLAND TRANSPORT
The dense passenger and freight traffic of Great Britain1 is carried mainly
by road and rail, although coastal shipping and, to a lesser extent, inland
waterways and pipelines are important in carrying certain types of freight,
particularly bulk cargoes.

TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Long-term
Trends in
Transport and
Traffic
345
Part of the inland transport system of Great Britain is nationalised; namely,
the railways, passenger transport in the London area, certain road haulage
and road passenger services, most of the inland waterways and some of the
vessels on them. Many local authorities and private firms run road passenger
services, while road haulage is largely, and coastal shipping entirely, in the
hands of private enterprise.
At the end of 1965 there were 12-9 million vehicles licensed for use on the
roads. Of these, 8-9 million were motor cars and 1-7 million motor cycles.
Road goods vehicles numbered 1-7 million, of which 2 per cent were operated
by nationalised transport services, which also owned 15 per cent of the public
road passenger vehicles.
The most recent sample survey of goods transport by road was made by the
Ministry of Transport in 1962. It showed that 81 per cent of the total tonnage
carried in that year (estunated at 1,540 million tons) went by road, while in
terms of ton-mileage1 the proportion was 55 per cent. The railways accounted
for 15 per cent of all tonnage carried and 26% per cent of the ton-mileage. The
proportions for coastal shipping were 3^ per cent and 18 per cent, and for
inland waterways slightly less than 1 per cent of the total tonnage. A previous
survey in 1958 had already shown that road transport had become the major
means of inland carriage of goods whatever unit of measurement was used.
In terms of ton-mileage, transport by road exceeded that by rail for the
first time in 1955; three years later it was responsible for 47 per cent of the
total ton-mileage (against 35 per cent for rail) and a further expansion resulted
in it accounting for over half the total in 1959.
The rapid growth of private and commercial motor traffic, causing congestion
problems of increasing severity, especially in cities and towns, and the changing
pattern of demand for transport services have led the Government to under¬
take a series of long-term studies cf probable trends in transport and problems
which may arise therefrom. A survey of needs for inland transport facilities
over the next 20 years (the Hall report, published in March 1963) envisaged
an annual rate of increase in total traffic of 4 to 5 per cent; a large rise in
ownership of private cars by 1980; and a further switch of goods traffic from
rail to road. A systematic assessment of the future of the railway system was
also published in the same month (the Beeching report) and supplemented by
a further report in February 1965.
The study group set up to make an independent report on the long-term
problems of traffic in urban areas issued its report (the Buchanan report) in
November 1963. It estimated that Britain would have 40 million vehicles on
its roads by a.d. 2010 and proposed radical measures to rebuild and adapt
cities and roads to handle the growth of traffic.
A White Paper, Transport Policy (Cmnd. 3057), published in July 1966,
set out the Government’s plans to integrate and modernise the national
transport system. It proposed: that a decision should be taken on the size and
shape of the future basic railway network; that the British Railways Board
should be relieved of the responsibility for losses on services maintained for
reasons of social need; and that the Board’s financial and management structure
should be overhauled. Other proposals included a national freight organisation,
a review of road haulage licensing arrangements and nationalisation of the
ports.

Fifiancial Changes
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The present role and structure of the nationalised transport undertakings are
the result of a series of legislative measures, starting with the 1947 Transport
Act under which they were taken into public ownership. In accordance with
this Act the British Transport Commission (BTC) was established on
1st January 1948 and assumed control of Britain’s railways, all railway-owned
steamships, docks, hotel and road transport interests, most of the country’s
canals (including all those owned by the railways), certain rivers (as navigation
authority) and the whole of the London passenger transport system. It was
also to arrange for the gradual acquisition of privately owned long-distance
road haulage firms.
Changes of policy following the coming into power of a Conservative
Government in 1951 were put into effect under the Transport Act 1953 which
modified the functions of the BTC. The Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage
Properly7) Act 1956 provided for the completion of the denationalisation of
road haulage, a process begun under the 1953 Act. Later it was decided that
the activities of the BTC were so large and diverse that they could not be
run effectively as a single undertaking. The Transport Act 1962 therefore
dissolved the BTC and set up four Boards for British Railways, London
Transport, British Transport Docks and British Waterways. Each of these
is responsible directly to the Minister of Transport, who appoints the
members.
Road passenger and haulage undertakings, such as British Road Services, the
Tilling Bus Group, the Scottish Omnibus Group, Road Freight Shipping
Sendees, Thomas Cook and Son and other holdings, are operated as com¬
panies incorporated under the Companies Act, with their own boards; they
are grouped under a Transport Holding Company, responsible to the Minister
of Transport, who appoints its directors. The hotel property of the BTC was
transferred to British Transport Hotels Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary, first
of the BTC and later of the British Railways Board.
The cross-channel shipping sendees operated by British Railways and
certain ports and docks used for them passed to the British Railways Board.
Each board is required to conduct its business so as to pay its way, taking
one year with another, and to set up general reserves. However, the Railways
Board, the London Transport Board and the British Waterways Board may
receive financial assistance from the Exchequer for six years from vesting date.
All the boards may borrow up to specified limits from the Minister with the
approval of the Treasury. The Act facilitates operations on a commercial basis
by conferring on the boards powers to sell or develop their land and to
construct and operate pipelines, and by freeing them from controlled charges
schemes. Except for railway passenger fares in the London Passenger Trans¬
port area, certain harbour charges and road passenger fares in an area including
London, the boards are free to fix the rates charged for their services. The
boards are also released from common carrier obligations as regards carriage
by rail or inland waterway.
The Treasury assumed responsibility for outstanding British Transport stock
(amounting to about £1,450 million) and the four boards and the Transport
Holding Company assumed debts to the Minister broadly equivalent in
aggregate to the total British Transport stock and existing debt in respect of
loans previously made by the Minister for capital purposes. Of the BTC’s
accumulated deficit on revenue account 1948-62 £392 million had already
been met by grant, and the balance of the total deficit of £875 million was
written off.

Under the Transport Finances Act 1966 the limit on the Government
subsidy to the British Railways Board, previously £450 million to the end of
1967, was raised to £800 million to the end of 1968. The Act also enabled the
Government to pay a £16 million subsidy to the London Transport Board over
the same period.
A Nationalised Transport Advisory Council of up to 12 members advises
the Minister on questions relating to the co-ordination and other aspects of
the nationalised transport undertakings. Another body, the Transport
Tribunal, sits in two divisions, one having jurisdiction over changes of London
road and rail fares and the other hearing appeals relating to applications for
road haulage licenses. The Area Transport Users’ Consultative Committee,
originally set up under the 1947 Transport Act to consider complaints and
suggested improvements of nationalised transport sendees, now participates
in the statutory procedure which the Railways Board and the London Trans-
port Board must follow if they want to close a railway passenger sendee. The
area committee concerned in any particular case considers objections from
users and reports to the Minister, who then decides whether to consent to the
closure.
There is also machinery whereby complaints on charges from coastal
shipping in connection with competition from the railways may be made to
the Minister of Transport.
Britain was the pioneer of railways. The opening of the Stockton to Darlington
Railway in 1825, and of the Liverpool and Manchester line in 1830, when
George Stephenson’s famous ‘Rocket’ locomotive was used, began a century
of widespread railway development. The great period of railway building
was from 1840 to 1875.
The railways first came under centralised government direction during the
first world war, and afterwards some 130 private companies were amalgamated
into four large regional groups under the Railways Act 1921. Thereafter they
suffered from the prolonged industrial depression and growing competition
from road transport, and following the second world war the Transport Act
1947 brought the railways under public ownership as a single enterprise,
British Railways. It was grouped in six regional sub-divisions and operated
under the overall management of a Railway Executive established as the agent
of the BTC. The 1953 Transport Act abolished the Railway Executive and
provided for decentralisation of the administration. Under the Transport
Act 1962 the British Railways Board was set up and came into existence on
1 st January 1963, with sole responsibility for managing railway affairs. Under
the Act the railways were relieved of much of their burden of accumulated
debt and were given freedom to alter their charges at will, except for passenger
fares in the London area. The Board s responsibilities for the operation of the
various parts of the system are delegated to sLx regional boards.
The process of rationalisation arising from changing public transport require¬
ments is reflected in the reduction of over 3,300 miles of standard-gauge route
since 1961. A total of 865 million passenger journeys was made and 229 million
tons of freight traffic conveyed on British Railways in 1965. The financial
position of the railways has not improved as quickly as was hoped despite
increases in fares and freight charges. The operating deficit in 1965 increased
to £73-i million after showing a reduction of £14-1 million in 1964 to

£6j-$ million. In 1965 there was a surplus of £8-3 million on other activities—
ships, harbours, hotels and letting of land—compared with £8-8 million in
1964. At the end of 1965, 365,043 were employed by railways, a reduction of
I35>391 f°ur years.
At the end of 1965 British Transport Hotels Ltd. (which provides all
catering facilities on British Railways’ trains) managed 34 hotels and refresh¬
ment rooms at 222 stations.
In 1955 the BTC produced a modernisation plan which was designed to trans¬
form virtually all the services offered by the railways. The plan has since been
modified in the light of ensuing economic and technical developments.
Capital expenditure has been substantial over the past few years and amounted
to £121 million in 1965, a slight increase on the previous two years.
In spite of the considerable injection of new capital over the period 1955-62
British Railways incurred a steadily increasing overall deficit (including
interest charges), which rose to a peak of more than £150 million in 1962.
The new Railways Board was given the task of preparing a scheme for re¬
organising the railways in such a way that they could be run as a commercially
viable undertaking. In March 1963 a Report on the Reshaping of British Railways
(‘Beeching Report’) was published and was accepted in principle by the
Government. Its proposals included the withdrawal of passenger services from
about a third of the country’s railway system. These little-used lines carried
only 1 per cent of the total passenger traffic.
Other important proposals were for the improvement of inter-city passenger
services, with the emphasis on speed, reliability and comfort; the introduction
of express freight services (‘freightliner trains’) to link all the main industrial
areas, increased mechanisation in the carrying of coal (the railways’ most
profitable traffic); and the continuing replacement of steam by diesel and
electric traction. A further report, The Development of the Major Railway
Trunk Routes, was published in February 1965.
On main lines in 1955 there were about 18,000 steam, 7 main line diesel
and 71 electric locomotives. At the end of 1965 the corresponding figures
were 2,987 steam, 2,810 diesel and 277 electric locomotives. In addition,
there were 4,109 diesel and 7,148 electric passenger-carrying multiple units.
The phase of railway modernisation represented by the introduction of the
diesel multiple unit was completed by 1961.
Passenger services have improved in speed and comfort with the replace¬
ment of steam by electric or diesel traction, which has also helped to reduce
operating costs. It is planned to eliminate steam locomotives by 1968. The
replacement of out-of-date passenger coaches by new stock, with improved
amenities, is still proceeding.
On certain sections of the London-Bristol-South Wales line and of the
London-Edinburgh line passenger trains are permitted to run at up to
100 m.p.h. Similar speeds are also in operation on the London Midland
Region’s services on the electrified line between London and Manchester and
Liverpool, introduced in 1966. This electrification scheme is the largest
modernisation project so far undertaken by British Railways and its cost when
completed will be about /175 million, including station reconstruction, bridge
works, a new colour-light signalling system and new rolling stock. The final
stages of the scheme, involving extension of the electrified route to Birmingham
and Wolverhampton via Rugby and Coventry and to Manchester via Stoke
are due to be completed by 1967.
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS
Channel Tunnel
ROADS

There has been considerable development of motorail services (carrying
both passengers and cars) and in May 1966 the world’s first car-train terminal
was opened in London.
The efficiency of freight services is being improved as new and modern
type freight vehicles come into service and as facilities for concentrating freight
traffic at fewer and better equipped and sited marshalling yards and terminals
are completed. There are now fully automated marshalling yards at Tinsley,
near Sheffield, and Bescot, near Walsall, providing faster and smoother working
with considerable saving in labour costs. To exploit the trend towards greater
use of standardised containers an inland freight depot has been set up at
Lawley Street, Birmingham, for customs clearance of imports and exports.
The first three ‘freightliner’ services using specially designed containers and
rolling stock now link London with Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool, and
extensions to other main centres are being planned.
A new signal box was opened in 1966 at Cardiff, marking the completion
of the key stage in a £3 million signalling modernisation scheme, and linking
two modern schemes already installed at Newport and Port Talbot. The
scheme involves the closing of 33 signal boxes. Work has begun on the
modernisation of the signalling system centred on Swindon at a cost of nearly
^ij million.
Efforts are being made to secure more bulk products traffic. Oil is being
moved from refineries under long-term contracts, while coal will soon be fed
direct from collieries to power stations in ‘merry-go-round’ trains, on which
coal is loaded and discharged automatically from a new type of high-capacity
wagon. Long-term contracts have also been signed for the carriage of cars,
china clay, milk, grain and newspapers.
Early in 1964 the British and French Governments agreed in principle to the
construction of a rail Channel Tunnel (either a bored tunnel or an immersed
tube). The cost is estimated at from £155 million to ^170 million. The
preliminary geological survey to determine the line of the tunnel has been
completed.
The advent of the motor vehicle made it necessary for the Government to
set up a central road authority; accordingly, the Road Board was established
by the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909. In 1919 the
Board’s responsibilities were taken over by the newly established Ministry
of Transport.
In April 1965 Great Britain had 201,056 miles of public highway. There
were 340 miles of motorway, 8,355 miles °f trunk roads, 19,866 miles of
Class I roads, 17,642 miles of Class II roads, 48,998 miles of Class III roads
and 105,855 miles of unclassified roads. Roads are classified according to
their traffic value, those of purely local traffic importance remaining un¬
classified. On maps and signposts the trunk and Class I roads can usually
be identified by the letter ‘A’ in front of a route number, and Class II roads
by a letter ‘B’. Trunk roads are the main arteries of national traffic and the
whole cost of their upkeep is met from Exchequer funds. The Minister of
Transport is the highway authority for trunk roads in England and on these
roads he administers expenditure, which is provided wholly from central
government sources, although for many purposes he employs local authorities
as his agents. The highway authority for Class I, Class II and Class III roads
is, in general, the council of the county or county borough in whose area the
roads lie. The Minister makes grants towards approved expenditure on con¬
struction and major improvement of these roads at the rate of 75, 60 or

50 per cent according to the class of road. (Classified roads include nearly all
the main streets of the large cities). The Secretary of State for Scotland has
corresponding responsibilities for roads in Scotland and the Secretary of State
for Wales for roads in Wales. Unclassified roads are entirely the responsibility
of the local authority in whose area they lie.
While it was impossible for several years immediately following the second
world war to spend much more on the roads than was required for their
essential maintenance, a large and steadily expanding road-building pro¬
gramme has now been in progress since 1955. By 1970 annual public
expenditure on new and improved roads in Great Britain is expected to
reach about £320 million as compared with just over £200 million in 1966-67.
A substantial part of central government expenditure will be in the form of
grants to local authorities for work on classified roads, mainly in urban
areas. The current programme includes Britain’s first motorways, constructed
for the use of limited classes of traffic under the powers granted to the
ministers by the Special Roads Act 1949 (consolidated in the Highways
Act 1959).
The motorways form part of a programme designed to provide a national
network of modern through routes. At the same time, work done under this
programme will eliminate the worst bottlenecks in urban areas and thus give
free outlets from the big cities and from other main sources of traffic to the
trunk routes.
It is planned that 1,000 miles of motorways should be completed by the
early 1970s. At the end of July 1966, 389 miles had been opened for traffic and
construction had started, or tenders had been invited, for a further 137J miles.
The lines of a further 306! miles had been fixed and draft schemes
published for a further 79! miles. It is probable that 600 miles of motorway will
be in use by 1968-69 and the map on opposite page shows the planned motor¬
way system. Among the motorways in Great Britain open to traffic or under
construction in July 1966 were:
Mi—London to Yorkshire (Leeds). The projected length of this motorway
is about 190 miles, providing links between London, Birmingham and
the north; 120 miles have been opened to traffic in the last seven years.
About 50 miles of the northward extension (up to Nottingham) had been
completed by 1966 and the remainder is due for completion in 1968.
An 8|-mile extension southwards into London was also due to be completed
in 1966.
M2—Medway motorway, London to Dover. The 26 miles of this motorway
came into use in 1963.
M4—London to South Wales. The projected length of this road, which
will link London with Newport, is 140 miles. In the east, 24-!- miles are in
use from Chiswick to Maidenhead, including a one-mile spur to London
Airport; a section of 20 miles of road from Newport (Monmouthshire) to
Tormarton (Gloucestershire) including the new bridge over the Severn will
be in use early in 1967.
M5—Birmingham to Bristol. Of this 117-mile motorway reaching to East
Brent (20 miles beyond Bristol), the first 26 miles running south from
Birmingham were opened in July 1962 and a further 6 miles of the north¬
ward link with the M6 was opened in 1965. There will be a connection with

the M4 north of Bristol. The 21^-mile Ross Spur (M5o), opened in i960,
links the M5 with the existing road system leading from Ross-on-Wye
(Herefordshire) to South Wales.
M6—Birmingham to Carlisle. The projected length of this road is 172
miles, of which m miles, linking Dunston (north of Birmingham) with
Lancaster, are open to traffic. It includes the 8|-mile Preston bypass, the
first section of motorway in Britain, opened in 1958. A system of motorway
links will connect this road at its southern end with the Mi and M5. The
works connecting Darlaston and Shareshill (6 miles) and Shareshill and
Dunston (8J miles) were completed in 1966.
M62—Lancashire to Yorkshire. A 6-mile stretch from Stratford to Eccles
bypass was finished in i960. Schemes have been made for 44 miles from
Worsley to Lofthouse, and a draft scheme published for the final 10J miles
from Lofthouse to the Mi.
In Scotland about 73 miles of motorways are planned including motorways
between Glasgow and Edinburgh, Edinburgh and Stirling, and a 16-mile
section southwards on the Glasgow-Carlisle route. The first section of the
Glasgow to Edinburgh motorway was completed in 1965.
Notable schemes for improving existing trunk roads include those for the
Great North Road (Ai) between London and Newcastle, of which 175 miles
of dual carriageway, several sections built to motorway standards, are already
open, including the ten-mile Darlington bypass opened in 1965. Improve¬
ments on the A40 route, linking London with Gloucester and South Wales via
Oxford, include a i3|-mile bypass around High Wycombe, in Buckingham¬
shire, built to motorway standards. The first stage of this was completed in
1965, and the remaining stretch should be finished in 1968. Other projects
include plans and expenditure of ^53 million on classified roads in south-east
Lancashire, and of £16 million in the Tyneside area.
The largest bridge building programme in Britain for over a century is in
progress. The -£2-3 million Medway Bridge, which is part of M2 and one of
the largest prestressed concrete structures of its kind in the world, was com¬
pleted in 1963 and the suspension bridge across the Firth of Forth, the
main span of which is the largest of its kind in Europe, was opened in 1964.
The Severn Bridge, whose main span is nearly as long as that of the Forth
Bridge, and the 7,000-ft. bridge across the Firth of Tay were opened in 1966.
The second Blackwall Tunnel (under the Thames), which is expected to
cost ;£6-5 million, is nearing completion and the £12-6 million Tyne Tunnel
between Wallsend (Northumberland) and Jarrow (Durham) is in use. The
first Whiteinch Tunnel (under the Clyde) was completed in 1963 and the
second in 1964. The £11 million Dartford-Purfleet tunnel (under the Thames)
has been open to traffic since the end of 1963.
Research on roads is carried out at the Road Research Laboratory (see p. 197)-
Its aims are to find more economical ways of designing, constructing and
maintaining roads and of facilitating the flow of traffic on them and to reduce
road accidents. The layout of roads, their traffic, the safety features of road
vehicles and the behaviour of road users are investigated, and new methods,
materials and processes are developed for building roads and providing
them with a smooth, safe and durable surface. The Laboratory has a
Tropical Section, which undertakes research and advice on road problems
overseas.

At the end of 1965 there were 12-9 million motor vehicles licensed to use
Great Britain’s roads. Of these, 1-7 million were goods vehicles and 1 million
were public road passenger vehicles (that is buses and taxicabs).
The first world war greatly stimulated the development of motor vehicles
and road transport began to make itself felt as a serious competitor of the
railways. The first step towards government regulation of public road
transport was the passing of the London Traffic Act 1924, which gave the
Minister of Transport power to control the number of buses and their
journeys in London; this was followed in 1933, by the setting up of the
London Passenger Transport Board (see p. 357).
The Road Traffic Act 1930 ended the licensing of public service vehicles
(that is buses and coaches) by local authorities and set up instead traffic areas,
of which there are now eleven, covering the whole country and each under
the control of three traffic commissioners (except for the London metropolitan
area, which has one) appointed by the Minister. The commissioners regulate,
b^ means of a licensing system, all public road passenger transport services,
and they sanction routes and time-tables in order to secure proper co-ordina¬
tion of services and eliminate unnecessary competition; they may also control
fares.
The Road and Rail Traffic Act 1933 established a system of licensing for
road haulage vehicles, which is still in operation, designed to restrict vehicle
operations to proved needs and to eliminate wasteful competition. A licence
has to be secured from the licensing authority (the chairman of the appropriate
body of traffic commissioners) before a goods vehicle can be used on the road
There are three types of licence: the ‘A’ licence for general public haulage;
the B licence for public haulage limited to certain goods or certain areas and
covering also the carriage of the licensee’s own goods; and the ‘C’ licence for
the carriage by traders solely of their own goods. Applications for ‘A’ and ‘B’
licences are examined by the licensing authorities to see if they are necessary
m view of existing transport services, and competitors may raise objections.
There is a right of appeal to the Transport Tribunal against the decision of
the licensing authorities. The lC’ licence is granted on application, as of right.
All goods vehicle operators are bound by regulations concerning the fitness and
loading of vehicles, the movements of large vehicles likely to obstruct traffic,
the keeping of records, and driving hours and rest periods of their employees!
The main licensing provisions contained in the Road Traffic Act 1930, and
the Road and Rad Traffic Act 1933, as subsequently amended, were con¬
solidated in the Road Traffic Act i960.
From September 1956 to January 1963 the nationalised road haulage services
were controlled by British Road Services (BRS), a division of the British
Transport Commission, and operated through five companies, which together
owned about 16,000 vehicles: British Road Services Ltd. (general haulage);
BRS (Bickfords) Ltd. (special traffic and some contracts); BRS (Contracts)
Ltd.; BRS (Parcels) Ltd.; and BRS (Meat Haulage) Ltd. Under the Transport
Act 1962, these organisations have been operating as companies incorporated
under the Companies Act, with their own boards. They are grouped together
under the Transport Holding Company, responsible to the Minister of Trans¬
port. All the companies’ vehicles are subject to the licensing system.
The number of licensed vehicles in the road goods transport industry has
shown only a relatively slow growth, from 1-4 million in i960 to 1.7 million
in 1965, when 86 per cent (1,324,000) were on ‘C’ licence. Of the other
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
217,000 vehicles, with ‘A’ and ‘B’ licences, about 18,000 are operated by
British Road Services and the rest are operated by some 46,000 hauliers.
There are only a few operators with large fleets of vehicles in any of the
licence categories. ‘C’ licence vehicles include a large number of small
vehicles used locally in the delivery of groceries and other goods. Other vehicles
in this class are engaged in long-distance carriage of traders’ own goods. A
sample survey made by the Traders Road Transport Association in 1958
indicated that ‘C’ licence operators with fleets of over 100 vehicles were
probably fewer than 3 per cent of the total number of operators, but accounted
for over half the ‘C’ licence vehicles in use in the country.

With the exception of the London transport system which is operated by the
London Transport Board, road passenger transport in Great Britain is run
by about 5,000 operators, 95 of them being local authorities owning and
operating urban bus and trolleybus services. About 4,700 are independent
operators of coaches and, of these, 3,600 have not more than 5 vehicles. Most
of the remainder operate both bus and coach services and belong to three main
groups—Tilling, Scottish Omnibuses and British Electric Traction. The
British Electric Traction Group is a private concern but substantial share¬
holdings in many of its companies, without any controlling interest, are held
by the Transport Holding Company, who own the Tilling and Scottish
Omnibus groups outright. The Tilling bus companies are grouped into six
regions covering England and Wales, with a total vehicle strength of about
9,600. The Scottish group, with a vehicle strength of 4,700, covers most of
Scotland, with the exception of the major municipalities of Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen and services in the Highlands and
Islands.
There are some 250 concerns operating fleets of over 24 vehicles, about
one-third of which are local authorities, the largest being the Corporations of
Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester.
Britain has the highest density of road traffic in the world. In 1965, 7,952
people were killed on the roads and about 390,000 injured. This compares with
over 7,000 persons killed and 230,000 injured in 1934, when there was one-
fifth of the present number of motor vehicles on the roads—an indication
that the problems have, to some extent, been held in check by road safety
measures introduced since 1930. Since 1946 the volume of traffic has at least
trebled: but road accident casualties have only doubled. The fatal accident rate
in Britain is better than that in most other European countries, but slightly
worse than in the United States. Road accident statistics are compiled and
published by the Ministry of Transport, the Scottish Development Depart¬
ment and the Welsh Office from reports made by the police.
Modern roads, designed for present-day traffic and segregating pedestrians
from vehicles, are safer than the roads they replace and surveys have shown
they result in a marked fall in casualties. The more important measures
directed primarily towards road safety include speed limits of 30 and 40 m.p.h.
in and around built-up areas and 50 m.p.h. on certain trunk and important
classified roads in rural areas; the provision of pedestrian crossings some
illuminated by flashing beacons and marked with conspicuous white stripes
(‘zebra’ crossings); and the system of road markings and traffic signs (which
are being replaced by greatly improved signs over the next few years).

including motorways, and an advisory 30 m.p.h. limit on motorways in

hazardous weather conditions, for example, fog, were imposed at the end of
j965-
The safety of vehicles, both in design and use, is controlled by regulations;
a system of vehicle testing, which applies at present to vehicles four or more
years old, is being gradually extended. Heavy goods vehicles were previously
subject to a separate procedure of spot checks but legislation enacted in 1966
established a system of annual tests and stricter requirements in respect of the
condition of vehicles.
All drivers of motor vehicles, including motor cycles, motor scooters and
powered pedal cycles, unless they have either held a full British licence or
passed the driving test in the last ten years are required to pass the test before
being granted a full licence to drive.1 Until they pass the test they must obtain
a ‘provisional’ licence which necessitates their displaying ‘L’ (Learner) plates
on their vehicle, and in all cases where vehicles are constructed to carry
passengers, other than pillion passengers, learner drivers must be accompanied
by a qualified driver (a person who holds a current driving licence for the same
type of vehicle as that driven by the learner). A learner driver of a motor cycle
is restricted, until he passes the driving test, to a machine not exceeding 250 c.c.
The Road Traffic Acts, which embody the law relating to road users, are
enforced by the police and the courts. A person convicted of any of the 26 most
serious offences is liable to be disqualified from driving for a period. The
standard of conduct for all road users—pedestrians and drivers—and a sum¬
mary of the requirements of the law is set out in easily understandable form
in the Highway Code. A failure to observe the code does not of itself render a
person liable to criminal proceedings but may be taken into account in any
such proceedings. Free copies of the code are issued to all learner drivers and
to motorists visiting Britain from abroad.
A National Road Safety Advisory Council was set up by the Minister of
Transport in 1965 to keep under review the road accident situation in Great
Britain and methods of accident prevention, and to report on other matters
affecting road safety.
A Bill making it an offence to drive with more than a prescribed level of
alcohol in the blood was introduced in 1966.
National campaigns to persuade people to take greater care on the roads
are conducted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, acting
as the Government’s agent and with the participation of the local authorities.
The police and education authorities also help by arranging courses of
instruction, especially courses for children.
The Road Traffic and Roads Improvement Act i960 permits the employment
of traffic wardens (with strictly limited powers), and provides for fixed
penalties (the ‘ticket’ system) for parking offences. Other measures in the
Act, designed to reduce traffic congestion, include the granting of greater
powers of action to local traffic authorities. In 1965 the Greater London
Council became the traffic authority (formerly the responsibility of the
Minister of Transport) for the whole of Greater London. Several extensive
schemes for the improvement of road safety and the relief of traffic congestion
are being undertaken: these include ‘fly-overs’ at road junctions; new outlet
roads from cities; and the designation of certain stretches of trunk roads as
‘clearways’, on which waiting on the carriageway is (with certain exceptions)
prohibited. In London and most of the other large towns street parking in
certain areas is permitted only for limited periods and on payment at parking

meters, and increased off-street parking facilities are being provided; some
towns, such as Leicester and Cheltenham, are experimenting with other
methods of controlled street parking.
Increasing use is being made of traffic management to promote the smoother
and more rapid flow of traffic. In i960 a Traffic Management Unit was set
up in London by the Minister of Transport. This was superseded in 1965 by
a Traffic Advisory Unit, with the object of making available to all traffic
authorities the experience gained in London and elsewhere since i960. The
main measures introduced are comprehensive control of street parking and
comprehensive one-way working systems. Others include the banning of turns,
particularly right turns, peak hour clearways and ‘tidal flow’ arrangements.
In June 1964 the Smeed Committee, appointed by the then Minister of
Transport in 1962 to study the technical possibilities of road pricing, reported
that it considered it was possible, by means of various mechanical devices, to
charge road-vehicles according to the extent to which they use congested areas.
In June, also, the Minister announced the setting up of a group which would
study how the design of vehicles (size, power, fumes and manoeuvrability)
could make them more suitable for use in towns.
In 1761 James Brindley completed the Bridgewater Canal to take coal from
the collieries owned by the Duke of Bridgewater at Worsley to Manchester.
This marked the beginning of canal building in modern Britain, with which
the names of Brindley, Telford, Rennie, Jessop and other great engineers are
associated. Canals played an important part in promoting industrial and
commercial expansion in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
The whole canal system was practically complete by 1830. As a result of
developing competition from the railways, however, about one-third of the
canal mileage had passed to the control of the railway companies by the middle
of the nineteenth century. During the first world war government control of
railways included railway-owned canals and, under the Transport Act 1947,
most of the country’s canals passed from government control, which had
been re-established in the second world war, to that of the British Transport
Commission in January 1948. From 1955 the canals were managed separately
by the waterways division of the Commission, known as British Waterways;
under the Transport Act 1962, control has been vested in the British Water¬
ways Board since 1st January 1963.
There are about 2,500 miles of navigable inland waterways in Great Britain,1
some 2,000 miles of which belong to the British Waterways Board; the
remainder are mainly still in the hands of local authorities or private companies.
Many of the Board’s canals are narrow waterways which can generally be
used only by boats not exceeding 7 feet in width, capable of carrying a load
varying from 25 to 30 tons; the remainder are broad waterways and canalised
rivers some of which can be used by craft of up to about 700 tons capacity.
The canals in Scotland are all broad waterways. Of the 2,000 miles of inland
waterways under the control of the British Waterways Board about 500 miles
are closed to navigation or abandoned and some further 600 miles were no
longer used for commercial navigation. Of these ‘disused’ canals some are
unnavigable, either wholly or in part.
For certain operational purposes, such as maintenance engineering and
estates work, the canals of England and Wales are administered from two

transport purposes is the Lower Bann Navigation.

regional centres, one at Gloucester and the other at Leeds. Sales promotion
is, in the main, centrally and nationally directed by the Board’s headquarters
in London. In Scotland the canals (other than the Caledonian, which is run
by a manager) are, for engineering purposes, under the control of an area
engineer; estates work is supervised centrally.
In 1965 total traffic on British Waterways amounted to just over 8-4 million
tons, of which 3-4 million tons were coal, 2-1 million tons liquids in bulk
and 3 million tons general cargo. Some 95 per cent of the total traffic is
carried on about 400 miles of broad waterways, which are mainly canalised
rivers.
Although the British Waterways Board is the largest single carrying
operator, most of the traffic is handled by independent carriers or by traders
in their own craft. The Board at the end of 1965 owned 13 tugs and 743
carrying craft, with a carrying capacity of 32,749 tons, including 83 power-
driven craft with a carrying capacity of 5,209 tons.
The British Waterways Board now controls about 300 miles of first-class
waterways linking important industrial districts with ports. Large investments
in improved facilities have been made. These waterways are the Aire and
Calder Navigation, the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation, the Trent
Navigation, the Lee Navigation (below Enfield Lock), part of the river
Severn, including the Gloucester & Sharpness Canal, the Weaver Navigation
and the Grand Union Canal (below Uxbridge).
The total revenue of the British Waterways Board in 1965 amounted to
£4-7 million, of which only £0-7 million arose from the Board’s own freight
carrying activities. The sale of water is an important source of revenue and
has more than trebled since 1948- British Waterways encourages pleasure
boating and receipts from this source are rising reaching almost .£100,000 in
I9^5- Income from fishing rights was £22,070 in 1965.
In a report published in December 1965 the Board proposed that the
eight most important waterways should be grouped together as a commercial
undertaking together with the Board’s warehouses, docks, fleets and non-
operational estate. Certain other waterways might remain as commercial
navigations, but the remainder should have operating losses met from
Exchequer subsidies.
London is, with Tokyo and New York, one of the world’s three largest cities.
The area known as Greater London, within a radius of about 15 miles from
Charing Cross, contains over 8 million people.
London’s passenger transport system, in its modern sense, began in 1829
when the first omnibus, horse-drawn, appeared on the London streets. The
first regular tram service, also horse-drawn, began in 1870. In 1863 the first
underground steam railway, the Metropolitan, was built by digging a great
trench for the line and roofing it over. In 1870 the world’s first tube railway,
the Tower Subway, was constructed under the river Thames; it was cable-
operated and ran for only a few months. The first electric tube railway in the
world, the City and South London line, was opened in 1890, and this was
followed in 1900 by the opening of the Central London Railway. Shortly
afterwards the steam-operated underground lines were electrified. Meanwhile,
horse-drawn buses and trams were being replaced by motor buses and
electric trams.
Until 1933 there were many separate undertakings providing passenger
transport facilities in London, but in that year they were all vested in a single

public corporation, the London Passenger Transport Board. In 1948, with
the establishment of the British Transport Commission, the London Trans¬
port Executive took over control as an agency of the Commission.
Under the Transport Act 1962 the London Transport Executive has been
replaced by a financially independent board, the London Transport Board.
Exchequer loans finance the Board’s external capital needs. The limits
of its borrowing powers were raised by £50 million to £250 million
in 1965.
The London Transport undertaking operates all road and rail passenger
transport services in the London area with the exception of the London lines
of British Railways and the taxicabs. (Some 6,000 taxicabs that ply for hire
in the streets are privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are
licensed annually by the metropolitan police.) London Transport’s operations
extend beyond Greater London to cover an area of 2,000 square miles (known
as the London Passenger Transport Area) with a radius of about 25 miles
from Charing Cross and with a population of 10J million. Between 1955
and 1965 the number of passenger journeys made annually on the London
Transport system fell from 4,095 million to 2,789 million, largely owing to
increased private motoring and changes in leisure-time habits and also to
some shifting of population away from the centre of London.
London Transport’s railway network stretches 18 miles from north to south
and 32 miles from east to west. The total length of the railway over which
London Transport trains operate is 244 miles, of which 88 miles are under¬
ground. London Transport trains serve 273 stations, and its buses and coaches
travel over 3,200 miles of roads. To carry traffic over all this area, in December
1965 London Transport owned 4,124 railway cars and 8,219 buses and
coaches. The total staff employed was 73,500.
Improvements carried out by London Transport have included complete
renewal of the bus and coach fleet, replacement of trams and trolleybuses by
diesel buses, and extension and modernisation of parts of the Underground
system. In 1962 work started on the building of a new 10^-mile tube railway
between Victoria Station and Walthamstow, in north-east London. It is
estimated that the work will cost about £57 million and it is hoped to open
the northern part of the line towards the end of 1968, and the remainder in
1969. The Board has announced plans for another tube line across London,
and for extensions to the existing system.
Public transport in Northern Ireland is in the process of being reorganised.
The Ulster Transport Authority is still responsible for all rail services in
Northern Ireland, but as a result of the withdrawal of certain passenger and
freight services in 1965 the total railroad mileage has been reduced to 203
miles. The Transport Act (Northern Ireland) 1966 ended the monopoly by
the Ulster Transport Authority in the carriage of goods by road, and on
1 st July 1966 a private enterprise system of road haulage under licence was
created. A new company is to be set up to take over the road passenger opera¬
tions at present being carried out by the Authority. Pending the introduction of
legislation, the Authority, which in the past provided all public road passenger
services in Northern Ireland, apart from Belfast city services, is giving consent
to a limited number of private operators to provide services in certain areas.
Legislation is also to be introduced for the winding up of the Authority, the
provision of an organisation to operate the present railway system and the
provision of a limited licensing system for private road passenger operators.

On 31st March 1966, there were 13,915 miles of public roads in Northern
Ireland, comprising 399 miles of trunk roads, 958 miles of Class I roads,
I>735 miles °f Class II roads, 2,864 miles of Class III roads and 7,959 miles
of unclassified roads.
The Ministry of Development is directly responsible for the trunk road
system and bears the entire cost of maintenance and reconstruction work on
these roads. In addition to major reconstruction schemes on trunk roads, a
total of about 100 miles of motorway are planned by the mid-1970s.
The Ministry of Development administers the Road Fund (the proceeds
of motor vehicle taxation, driving licence fees, etc.), from which grants are
paid to the local authorities (county, county borough, borough and urban
district councils) who are responsible for the other roads. The rates of grant
range from 90 per cent for major improvement works on Class I roads to
25 per cent for maintenance work on unclassified roads.
Gross expenditure on all roads in the financial year to 31st March 1966,
was £i8‘3 million. Expenditure in the five-year period 1966-71 is expected
to be about ^75 million, compared with about j£6o million in the five-year
period to 1965.
CIVIL AVIATION
British airmen were among the first to carry mails (at the time of the
Coronation of King George V in 1911) and among the first to operate regular
mail and passenger services, which were inaugurated on 25th August 1919,
when a daily passenger service was opened between London (Hounslow)
and Paris (Le Bourget).
In April 1924 four small British companies merged to form Imperial Airways
Limited, which received a government grant of million. This company
pioneered the commercial development of intercontinental air routes (includ¬
ing the organisation of ground services), following up, in many cases, the
exploratory work of the Royal Air Force. By 1929 there was a through service
from England to India. In 1931 the first service was established to Central
Africa. The first mail service to Australia started in December 1934, followed
by a passenger service in 1935.
The British Overseas Airways Corporation, a public corporation, took over
the undertakings of Imperial Airways Limited and British Airways Limited
in 1940. British European Airways was established under the Civil Aviation
Act 1946 as a separate public corporation to cover the United Kingdom
and Europe. In addition to the two nationalised corporations, there are about
30 independent air transport operators.
General responsibility for the development of United Kingdom civil aviation
was transferred during 1966 from the Ministry of Aviation to the Board of
Trade.
Under the post-war nationalisation legislation the corporations had a statutory
monopoly of scheduled services and independent operators were broadly
confined to charter work. The independent operators were given increasing
freedom to develop scheduled services. The Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act
i960 abolished the corporations’ statutory monopoly. The Act also set up an
Air Transport Licensing Board. From 31st March 1961 the independent
operators were entitled to apply to this Board for permission to operate

schedules or charter services on an equal basis with the corporations. In a
statement in February 1965, however, the Government announced restrictions
in the granting of new licences to British operators of scheduled services on
both international and domestic routes.
The ATLB consists of six to ten members appointed by the Minister of
Aviation (in future to be appointed by the Board of Trade). The Board is
responsible for considering all applications for licences (or their revocation
or variation) and in reaching its decisions must take into account an operator’s
experience, financial resources, equipment, organisation and staffing arrange¬
ments, the adequacy of existing services and any objections from other
interested parties. There is provision for appeals to the Minister from decisions
of the Board and the Minister appoints an independent commissioner to
advise him upon every appeal. In the period from its inception to 31st March
1966, the Board received over 5,600 applications for licences for air services
of various kinds, including charters and holiday tours, of which about 4,000
were granted.
The existing powers and constitutions of BOAC and BEA are laid down by
the Air Corporations Acts 1949 to 1966 (though the Corporations’ monopoly
of scheduled services was repealed by the i960 Civil Aviation (Licensing) Act
as noted above). Each corporation consists of 5 to 11 members, including the
chairman. The chairman of each board is also a part-time member of the other.
Under the Air Corporations Act 1966, BOAC’s financial structure was
reorganised. The Government extinguished BOAC’s borrowings at 1st April
1965 of ^176 million and set up in their place capital of .£66 million and a
reserve of £110 million. Of the £66 million, £31 million is loan capital of
the type usual in nationalised industries bearing a fixed rate of interest, and
£35 million is ‘Exchequer Dividend Capital’ on which dividends will be
payable out of profits, an arrangement which is to be experimental over a
five-year period. The limit on the Corporation’s loan capital is now £90
million which can be increased by Order to £ 120 million. The Act withdraws
the power conferred by the Air Corporations Act 1962 to use Exchequer loans
for deficit financing from both BOAC and BEA. The limit up to which BEA
may borrow remains at £110 million.
Although the Minister of Aviation has had certain statutory powers of
direction over the corporations, including powrer to give general directions as
to the exercise of their functions on matters affecting the national interest, these
powers have very seldom been used. The corporations function as com¬
mercial undertakings with autonomy in matters of day-to-day management.
However, there has in practice been close co-operation, consultation and
exchange of information between them and the Ministry. It has also been the
practice of the corporations to seek the approval of the Minister and the
Treasury for orders of aircraft, which account for the bulk of their capital
expenditure, and for investments in foreign airlines, which commonly involve
foreign currency and may have political implications.
Total capacity ton-miles offered on all services more than doubled between
March 1956 and March 1961 and a further increase took place in the following
three years. In 1955, 2-5 million passengers entered or left the L^nited
Kingdom by air, compared with 5-7 million who arrived or departed by sea; in
1962 there were for the first time more air than sea passengers, and by 1965 the
figures had risen to n-2 million by air and 8-7 million by sea.

BOAC is engaged on long-haul airline operations. Its scheduled services link
Britain with Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia, Africa and
North and South America, and it also provides a complete round the world
service. It co-operates closely with airlines of several other Commonwealth
countries; it also has financial interests in five companies operating local and
regional services in the Far and Middle East, in areas adjacent to BO AC’s
main routes. BOAC-Cunard Ltd., formed by BOAC and the Cunard Steamship
Company in 1962, operate between Britain and North and South America
and the Caribbean; BOAC bought out Cunard’s share in 1966.
The capacity offered on their own scheduled services by BOAC and BOAC-
Cunard Ltd. reached 1,234 million capacity-ton-miles at the end of March
1966, having risen by 61 per cent in the last four years. Nearly two-fifths
was on the western routes to North and South America. The overall load
factor in 1965-66 was 48-9 per cent: the break-even load factor (the figures
at which operating costs are covered) was again lower. The Corporation’s
passenger fleet, made up entirely of pure jets, consists (June 1966) of Super
VC 10s (8, with a further 9 on order), VC 10s (12), Boeing yojs (20) and
Boeing 336C all freighters (2). The VC 10, introduced into service in 1964,
operates on African, Middle East and Far East routes. The Super VC 10
(a larger and more powerful aircraft than the standard version) went into
service in April 1965 on transatlantic routes. Both aircraft have set up
passenger-carrying records on many routes. The Boeing 336C took over the
transatlantic all-freighter operation in January 1966. BOAC is building its
own £y million passenger terminal at Kennedy International Airport, New
York, to be opened in 1968.
BOAC s financial position has shown a great improvement in the last two
years, after several years of deficits. In 1965-66 the Corporation, together
with its BOAC-Cunard subsidiary, earned a record operating surplus of over
£20 million and net profits of ^8 million after interest on borrowings and
taxation. Of its gross revenue (nearly £125 million) £83 million was earned
in foreign currencies, of which £30 million came from the sterling area and
£38 million from the dollar area. Economies in staff and overheads have again
improved the operating costs.
BEA operates a network of services to over 80 places in Britain, Europe,
North Africa and the Middle East. Its services in Britain include a number
which cannot be operated on a commercial basis but which meet a vital
social need; these include services to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
BEA maintains a close working relationship with BOAC, whose aircraft, by
agreement, use a number of European stopping points. BEA also co-operates
with other airlines in order to create ‘through travel’ facilities. It has a
financial interest in several associated companies, most of which collaborate
with BEA in providing a network of services.
For the year ended 31st March 1966, the increases in capacity offered, and
passenger-miles and freight-ton-miles flown were 10-4 per cent, 111 per cent
and 25 per cent respectively over the previous year; in the same year some
6-8 million passengers were carried, an increase of 12 per cent.
In 1965 BEA’s passenger fleet consisted of Comets, Vanguards, Viscount 800s
and Tridents. The Trident, introduced in 1964, is a three-engine 600 m.p.h.
jet designed for medium-haul routes: delivery of 24 of these aircraft was
completed in 1965. A new version, the Trident 2, due to come into operation

in 1968 is on order. A 25-passenger Sikorsky helicopter has operated a service
from Penzance to the Isles of Scilly since 1964.
BEA first made a profit in 1954-55. From then until 1965-66 profits before
payment of interest on stock and advances have amounted to £36 million, of
which £24 million has been paid to the Treasury in interest. Profit before
interest in 1965-66 was £5-7 million, representing a return on capital of
6-4 per cent, just over the target level of 6 per cent set for BEA by the
Government.
The official body representing the majority of independent operators is the
British Independent Air Transport Association. (The largest company,
British United Airlines, is not a member.) The Association also represents the
air taxi operators and a large number of companies which, although not them¬
selves aircraft operators, have substantial air transport interests; total
membership is 45.
Although the two State Corporations had a statutory monopoly up to 1961
and government policy since 1945 has imposed certain restrictions on the
private sector, there has been a significant expansion in recent years not only
of the number of passengers and volume of freight carried but also in the
diversity of services operated. As well as a wide network of domestic and
international services the independent operators provide the public with
opportunities for cheap holiday tours abroad; an expanding vehicle ferry
organisation; and specialised air cargo facilities. They have also been largely
responsible for meeting the government’s commitments for the movement of
service personnel and supplies all over the world. In 1965-66 they carried
some 5 million passengers. To meet future demand a large programme of
aircraft re-equipment is in progress. Many new jet aircraft are already in
service and orders worth millions of pounds sterling are in hand. The first
company to introduce jet airliners on domestic routes in Britain was British
United Airways.
In addition to the public transport operators there are a large number of
companies engaged in miscellaneous activities such as crop-spraying, aerial
survey and photography, and flying instruction.
The proportion of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air is steadily increasing.
In 1956, 1-7 per cent of imports and 2-9 per cent of exports (by value) were
carried by air. In 1965 these percentages were 8 per cent in both cases, and
the total value of exports, imports and re-exports by air was ,£862-6 million.
The chief export items were expensive machinery and parts, aircraft and
vehicle parts, and electrical and electronic products; furs and skins accounted
for a large proportion of the total value of re-exports by air.
The estimated number of aircraft on the United Kingdom register used for
business and private purposes is over 600, while approximately 500 are
owned by clubs, groups and training schools. Private pilot’s licences are
held by about 8,000 people. Some 80 companies are in the Business Aircraft
Users Association.
The Board of Trade has a general responsibility for civil aerodromes. It may
itself establish and maintain airports, and local authorities may also do so
subject to its approval. Other airports are privately owned; virtually all not
operated by the Government which are used for passenger traffic or flying
instruction are subject to government licensing, inspection and regulation.

The British Airports Authority, set up in June 1965 as an independent
statutory body, took over the ownership and management of London’s two
major airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, Stansted in Essex and Prestwick, in
Scotland, in April 1966. (Stansted is the proposed site for London’s third
airport.) At these airports the Board of Trade is responsible for navigation
facilities, safety standards and regulation of noise levels. The Authority’s
borrowing needs are provided by the Exchequer. It is required to pay its way,
taking one year with another.
There are approximately 120 civil aerodromes in the United Kingdom and,
in addition, 55 Service aerodromes are available for civil use. Those under
civil control include 19 directly controlled by the Board of Trade, 3 in the
Channel Islands and 1 in the Isle of Man administered by the local island
governments, and 34 aerodromes licensed for public use, of which 25 are
owned by municipalities. Nine of the Board of Trade’s aerodromes and 19
others are designated Customs airports; limited customs facilities are available
at a further eight aerodromes.
Aircraft and passenger movements at the principal airports have risen very
markedly in the last five years, and in 1965 United Kingdom civil airports
handled 20-6 million passengers. The number of movements of aircraft
engaged on commercial transport operations was 507,500.
For international scheduled services Heathrow and Gatwick are the main
airports, and Heathrow is the largest and busiest airport in Western Europe.
The annual increase in the number of passengers handled has been about
one million in recent years, reaching 10-7 million in 1965.
Domestic and European short-haul services are handled at the passenger
building in the central terminal opened in 1955. An additional building for
short-haul services is being constructed. Travelling time from Central
London to Heathrow has been appreciably shortened by the opening of a
section of the M4 motorway in March 1965. A new £6 million freight terminal
is being built to handle the further large increases in freight traffic. The airport
at Gatwick, 25 miles south of London, was opened in June 1958 as the second
airport for the London area and has since been considerably extended includ¬
ing a £2-5 million extension, which has more than doubled the size of the
terminal buildings, and a third passenger pier was added and completed in
1965. Plans have been made to extend the 7,000-ft. runway to enable it to
handle the larger aircraft likely to come into use for short- and medium-haul
services as well as the largest jet airliners diverted from Heathrow. Built
alongside the main London to Brighton railway, London (Gatwick) Airport is
the first in the world to contain road, rail and air transport in one unit. In
1965 Gatwick handled 1-4 million passengers.
A privately owned helicopter terminal (or ‘heliport’) was opened in
London, on the south bank of the Thames, in April 1959.
Prestwick handled over 450,000 passengers in 1965. It has been developed
to accommodate large jet aircraft and a new passenger terminal and freight
area were brought into use in 1964. The freight premises are to be enlarged
and the terminal building is to be extended by 1970. A ^6 million new airport
at Abbotsinch, near Glasgow, was opened in May 1966, taking over services
from Renfrew. Owned and run by the Glasgow Corporation, it is expected to
handle over 2 million passengers a year by 1970. Manchester (Ringway) and
Renfrew both handled over a million passengers.
In the autumn of 1963 Belfast’s services were transferred from Nutt’s Corner
to a new civil terminal built on the former RAF aerodrome at Aldergrove.
The terminal is now being enlarged and the work should be completed by 1967.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
From 1962 the hovercraft, a vehicle which rides on a cushion of air over both
land and water surfaces, has been used experimentally in public passenger
services. Regular services were started around Britain’s coasts in 1965, and
in 1966 across the Channel to France.
The role of the Government in promoting air safety lies in research and in
setting up and supervising standards for both aircraft and personnel.
Research on aircraft design and construction is done at the Royal Aircraft
Establishments at Farnborough and Bedford, which are exceptionally well
equipped with testing facilities.
The Ministry of Aviation (see p. 49) has determined the policy and legislative
requirements for the safe operation of civil aircraft, analysed accidents and
incidents and initiated preventive measures and research in flight safety.
All aircraft registered in the United Kingdom must have a valid certificate
of airworthiness issued (or rendered valid) by the Government on the recom¬
mendation of the Air Registration Board. This Board was set up in 1937 and
consists of 18 members, six of whom are independent, the others being
representatives of constructors, operators and insurers of aircraft. No aircraft
built in Britain is granted a certificate of airworthiness unless it has been
constructed in accordance with British Civil Airworthiness Requirements, a
code compiled and frequently reviewed by the Board. Continued airworthiness
is ensured by regular inspection and by requiring aircraft to be maintained in
accordance with a schedule approved by the Board.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain size used for public transport must
possess an Air Operator’s Certificate issued by the Director of Aviation
Safety (who is appointed by the Government) when satisfied by inspectors
that all safety precautions are constantly taken by the operator.
Each member of a flight crew must hold the appropriate official licence.
Operators are required to ensure that pilots employed by them have adequate
knowledge of routes, and Ministry inspectors check the standards maintained
by the operators, which must be adequate for purposes of the Air Operator’s
Certificate.
In order to replace the supply of well-trained pilots for civil airlines from the
Royal Air Force, which has declined in recent years, the College of Air
Training was set up at Ramble in i960. It is sponsored and financed by the
Government and the two Airways Corporations. Ultimately over 100 trained
pilots a year will graduate from the College. As it can supply only about half
the pilots needed, the Government may approve independent colleges, whose
standards are adequate for the training of professional pilots. Airwork Services
Training, Perth, and the Oxford Air Training School have been approved
so far.
Responsibility for policy, planning and execution of both civil and military'
air traffic control over the United Kingdom and the surrounding seas rests
with the national Air Traffic Control Sendees Organisation, under the joint
control of the Board of Trade and the Secretary of State for Defence.
This organisation has an integrated policy and planning staff drawn from both
ministries.
In 1950 the then Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation introduced a
system of airways covering the main traffic routes with controlled zones
around the major airports. During 1957 and 1958 a revised and extended
TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS

airways system was brought into use. There are three main air traffic control
centres: at London (Heathrow) Airport for southern England, at Preston for
the north of England and Wales, and at Prestwick for Scotland and the
Atlantic Ocean to 30° W.
A variety of radar installations and equipment provide the means by which
the system can accept the increasingly heavy load of air traffic. Britain
was the first country to use radar for the control of civil air traffic. The
radar approach system known as Ground Controlled Approach (GCA)
is now in use at all major airports in the United Kingdom, in addition
to the Instrument Landing System (ILS). During the next few years
virtually the whole of the airspace over the United Kingdom above 5,000
feet will be brought under surveillance by the latest types of radar equipment,
which will provide data to be used in two new Air Traffic Control Centres,
located at West Drayton (near London) and Preston, Lancashire. A subsidiary
centre will be located at Prestwick, to deal with traffic over Scotland. Extensive
use will be made in these centres of automatic data-processing and other
advanced electronic techniques.
The Ministry of Aviation (see p. 49) has provided a number of radio
navigational aids to help aircraft to remain safely within the controlled airspace
and to make accurate estimates of their time of arrival. In addition, the
Ministry has supported the Decca Air and Marine Navigator System now
operating over a wide area of the United Kingdom and northern Europe, which
can be used, by arrangement with the Decca Company, by any aircraft fitted
with the appropriate receiving equipment.
Research is in progress into automatic landing systems. A unit of the Royal
Aircraft Establishment, at Bedford, in co-operation with industry, has
successfully developed an instrument system which was used for the first
time in a passenger-carrying aircraft in June 1965, on a scheduled flight
operated by BEA, to achieve an automatic landing. This makes Britain the
pioneer in all-weather landing systems. The fully automatic landing, under
blind conditions, is expected to be achieved by 1968.
To cope with the new problems caused by high-flying, high-speed jet aircraft,
a European international agency, Eurocontrol, formed by Britain, France,
Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, provides air traffic
control at the higher flight levels for civil aircraft and for military aircraft
operating according to civil procedures.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides the postal and public tele¬
communications services of the United Kingdom. Although at present a
government department it is in effect a nationalised industry, and is to become
a public corporation in 1969.
The political head of the Post Office is the Postmaster General (see p. 57).
For most operational purposes Britain is divided into nine geographical
regions, each under a Director (two in London) with his own supporting
staff. In March 1966 the Post Office had 397,000 employees and 25,000
post offices.
Finance
The Post Office Act 1961 recognised the commercial character of the Post
Office by separating its finances from the Exchequer and giving the Postmaster

General sole responsibility for them. Post Office expenditure is generally
subject neither to Parliamentary control by Estimate nor to Treasury control.
Income is determined by tariffs which the Postmaster General fixes, subject
only to negative resolution of Parliament. The Post Office makes its own
investment plans, subject only to the same need for broad government
approval as applies to other nationalised industries. Like them, it is expected
to aim at an adequate return on its capital and to contribute suitably to the
financing of its investment. Its present financial target is an average return on
net assets of 8 per cent over the period 1963-64 to 1967-68.
Table 21 gives recent figures of income, profit and capital. Nearly all the
capital is invested in telecommunications, which are drawing rapidly ahead
of the postal services in size and profitability.
The development of postal communications in Britain can be traced from
the time when horsemen carried dispatches to the Tudor Court up to modern
airmail transport. The first dispatch of mails by train was made in 1830
between Liverpool and Manchester. The inauguration of the penny post
(the uniform charge for any inland distance being prepaid by means of
postage stamps, which originated in Britain) in 1840 was followed by a rapid
extension of the scope of the postal services. The registered post, ensuring
additional safety for valuable mail, was introduced in 1841. The money order
system, which had operated as a private venture from 1792 to 1838, was
supplemented in 1881 by the issue of postal orders for fixed amounts.
Letterboxes had been instituted in London in 1855, and in 1883 the parcel
post was introduced. In 1919 the Post Office inaugurated its own motor
transport fleet and the first mail was carried by air in Britain in 1911.
Table 21 gives statistics of items of inland and overseas mail carried. Each
year about 7,000 tons of mail are carried by air within the United Kingdom.
Out of the 518 million items of overseas mail carried in 1965-66, 64 per cent
were carried by air, compared with 51 per cent in 1955-56. The air parcel
service now operates to all countries in Europe and to over 180 countries
outside Europe.
The Joint Research and Development Group of the Post Office and the
Ministry of Public Building and Works has evolved a range of standard
designs for sorting offices and ancillary accommodation which will reduce
planning time and allow the use of industrialised methods of construction.
In mechanisation and automation a simple, efficient and economic parcel
sorting machine has been developed and has so far been installed in Worcester,
Leeds, Preston, Aberdeen and Southampton. Machines are being installed
which will separate mail into various classes, arrange the letters with the
stamp in a common position and then automatically obliterate the stamps.
In the future letters will be coded with phosphorescent dots and thereafter
sorted automatically by high-speed sorting machines. The first fully auto¬
mated letter sorting office is now working at Norwich, and plans are now
being made for the larger offices to be converted to fully automatic letter¬
sorting centres.
A Postal Consultancy Service has been established and its facilities are
offered to overseas countries to aid them in the planning and mechanisation
of their new offices.
At the post office counter, besides making use of its postal and telegraph
facilities, the citizen can draw his pension and his family allowance, buy a
licence for his dog, sound radio or television receiving set, renew his car

range of facilities for savings and investments (see p. 387). In much of the
work at its counters the Post Office acts as agent for other government
departments or local authorities. The value of some important items is shown
in Table 21.

All private telegraph systems in Britain were transferred to the control of
the Postmaster General in 1870. Teleprinter-working for the transmission
of inland telegrams was introduced generally in 1928 and conversion to the
present automatic switching system was completed in mid-1954. It is now
one of the most up-to-date systems in the world and gives direct connection
between any of the 450 larger telegraph offices. The overseas telegraph
services were shared until 1950 between the Post Office and Cable and
Wireless Ltd. This company was brought into public ownership in 1947.

Services
The Post Office, which acquired the British services, operates all overseas
telegraph services from the United Kingdom, except those offered by foreign
telegraph companies. Cable and Wireless Ltd. continues to operate its cable
and wireless services in many dependencies and foreign countries.
Telegraph services to overseas countries are operated from Electra House in
London, the world’s largest overseas telegraph office, and from nine other
London and provincial area telegraph offices. Direct connection via the Centex
system between these British offices and the larger towns in Belgium, France,
Germany, Holland, Luxembourg, Italy and Norway minimises delivery delay.
In addition, the Post Office is well to the fore in the development of telegraph
message relay techniques for services beyond Europe.
The Telex Service (opened in England in 1932) combines the speed of the
telephone with the accuracy of the printed word. Calls may be made direct
between the rapidly increasing number of telex users in the United Kingdom
(over 19,000 by the end of 1966) and also to over 250,000 subscribers through¬
out the world. For call charging purposes Britain is divided into 50 charging
areas, each with its own telex centre. The United Kingdom telex service is
fully automatic and immediate connection is made by direct dialling to any
subscriber in this country, and to many subscribers in Europe, New Zealand,
the United States and Canada. Other overseas calls are connected by operators
at the International Telex Exchange in London which provides a teleprinter
service to over 100 countries abroad. Once a call is established the subscriber
types his message on the keyboard of his teleprinter, it is then reproduced
simultaneously on both the sending and receiving subscribers’ installations.
The service is available day and night except for a few routes outside Europe,
and messages may be transmitted to a subscriber even though his teleprinter is
unattended, for attention when his office reopens. Inland and overseas telex
traffic is growing annually by about 25 per cent; the Post Office is planning for
a system of about 35,000 United Kingdom subscribers by 1970. The Post
Office’s remotely controlled high frequency radio station at Leafield, Oxford¬
shire, became fully operational in 1966. It is the most advanced of its kind in
the world and will handle overseas public radiotelegraph and telex services
as well as broadcasting news services overseas.
When the Post Office bought the property of the National Telephone Com¬
pany in 1912 it became the owner of almost the whole telephone service in
the country. Hull Corporation was the only municipality to exercise its option
of operating its own service under licence from the Postmaster General; this
service (and the service in the Channel Islands, also operated under licence)
is connected to the Post Office trunk network. At the end of March 1966
there were 6,028 local telephone exchanges and about 10-7 million telephones
in Britain.
In March 1966, 94 per cent of the 6-5 million telephones (exchange con¬
nections) in the United Kingdom were connected with automatic exchanges
and less than a tenth of the exchanges remained to be changed to automatic
working. Trunk dialling by subscribers began in Bristol in December 1958;
by March 1966 the facility had been extended to 1,116 exchanges, serving 63
per cent of all subscribers; by 1970 it will be available on over 90 per cent of
all telephones. The introduction of the new group routing and charging
equipment brings the advantages of quicker service, automatic accounting and
cheap long distance calls of short duration, and constitutes the most radical
reform of the telephone service since the Post Office assumed national
responsibility for it.

The widespread introduction of electronic exchanges is planned. Following
public service trials of electronic units at Leamington and Peterborough,
orders for some 50 electronic exchanges with from 200 to 2,000 lines have been
placed in 1966.
International subscriber dialling between London and Paris was inaugurated
in March 1963, extended to the rest of France, Belgium, Switzerland, the
Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands in 1964 and to Luxembourg
in 1966. Edinburgh, Birmingham, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester are
now included in the network.
Operator-connected calls are handled at the London Continental Exchange,
from which nearly 1,500 direct telephone circuits give service to European
countries. These circuits are also used to send and receive pictures, and
special circuits are used for broadcast transmissions.
A radio tower, 620 feet high, has been erected in London to provide more
microwave radio links for carrying long-distance telephone and television
circuits. It was opened for operational purposes in October 1965. There are
now over 100 Post Office communications towers in use; one of 500 feet in
Birmingham will be brought into operation early in 1967.
There are several specialised services available by telephone, including the
‘999’ emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected as
quickly as possible, and free of charge, to the police, ambulance or fire brigade
services; the speaking clock; and a telephone weather forecast service available
in 23 centres. In London a telephone information service provides details
in English, French, Spanish and German of important events being held in
and around the capital on the day of the call and a similar service (in English)
in Edinburgh exists during the summer months. A recorded daily cooking
recipe is provided at 15 centres. A test match cricket score service operates
at more than 30 centres during the cricket season and a road weather service
is provided in collaboration with the Automobile Association at 14 centres
from 1st October to 30th April.
A public radiotelephone service, introduced in 1959, enables the users of
vehicles fitted with suitable radio equipment to make calls to, or receive them
from, any telephone in the United Kingdom network. The area of this service
was initially restricted to South Lancashire and parts of Cheshire but a service
to cover the Greater London area was opened in 1965.
Telephones transmitting messages through loudspeakers instead of through
instruments held by hand were made available to the public in 1961.
In March 1966 there were 99,000 private circuit stations not connected with
the public exchange networks. These are associated with circuits rented for
private use for telephone conversations, teleprinter connections, photo¬
telegraphy, television, music, or for the transmission of signals which
represent data for computers or operate other devices.
In addition to the radio stations for overseas telecommunications, the Post
Office has 11 coast radio stations in the United Kingdom. These stations
provide radiotelegraph and radiotelephone communications with ships at sea
at ranges of up to some 500 and 300 miles respectively. There is also the
long-distance radiotelegraph station, Portishead-Radio, which communicates
with ships in all parts of the world.
These coast stations play an important part in the services concerned with
safety of life at sea. They keep continuous watch on the international radio¬
telegraph and radiotelephone frequencies for distress calls from ships or

aircraft and take immediate action to obtain assistance for any vessel in
distress. During 1965-66 the stations handled 747 urgent and SOS calls
from ships and aircraft.
In addition to the services for safety of life at sea, the stations exchange
radio-telegrams with ships and connect radiotelephone calls between telephone
subscribers ashore and suitably equipped ships; they also broadcast naviga¬
tional warnings and weather bulletins.
The stations also operate a free medical advice service whereby the Master
of a ship of any nationality may obtain advice from appropriate medical
authorities on the treatment to be given in cases of sickness or injury aboard
ship. During 1965-66 409 medical enquiries were dealt with in this service.
The first transatlantic telephone cable, to the United States and Canada, was
laid in 1956 and its high quality, speed and reliability opened up a new era in
the world of communications. The Post Office, in co-operation with Cable
and Wireless Ltd., is taking part in the extension of the Commonwealth
submarine cable links. The first of these (Cantat), which links Britain with
Canada, was laid and opened in 1961; the second link, between Australia and
New Zealand, started working in 1962 and the trans-Pacific link between
Canada and New Zealand (Compac) towards the end of 1963; these links
provide a 16,000-mile all-Commonwealth connection between London and
Sydney. A second cable to the United States from Britain came into use in
1963. A further route to Canada was established by the linking of the Scotice
cable (Scotiand-Iceland) with the Icecan cable (Iceland-Canada) towards the
end of 1962 but at present this transatlantic routing is used only for special
services. The transatlantic cables supply 107 public telephone circuits from
Britain to the United States, 36 to Canada, 71 circuits linking the United
States and Canada with Europe, 23 circuits linking Britain to Australia and
Asia, and numerous telegraph channels and private circuits. The first two
sections of the Commonwealth South-East Asia cable (Seacom) linking
Singapore, Sabah (Malaysia) and Hong Kong were opened in 1965. The
complete Seacom system, linking Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Guam,
New Guinea and Australia will be completed in 1967.
Many more circuits between Britain and Europe have been provided by
cables laid across the North Sea since 1964. Three cables with the largest
capacity of any in the world are due to be laid by the end of 1967, connecting
Britain with Jersey, Norway and the Netherlands.
The Goonhilly satellite communication earth station in Cornwall was
brought into operation in 1962. After participating in the experimental
phases of commercial satellite communication, it is now in regular use
providing telephone circuits for the public service between Britain and North
America, and occasional television transmission facilities across the North
Atlantic. There are plans for major extensions to the station in order to
provide circuits to many other distant countries by 1968, when the INTELSAT
(International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium) Global System
is to be set up.

FINANCE
PUBLIC FINANCE
Public finance is concerned with the way public authorities (that is, the
central Government and local authorities) finance their activities—how their
expenditure is decided upon and how their revenue is obtained.
Money administered by public authorities1 can be roughly divided into
two categories:
1. The funds of the central Government, raised mainly by taxation, but
also in part by borrowing, and paid into and out of the Exchequer2 in
accordance with the proposals of the Government, as approved by
Parliament (principally the House of Commons).
There are also funds administered for special purposes by central
government departments and wholly or partially maintained by receipts
which do not pass through the Exchequer. The most important one is
the National Insurance Fund, administered by the Minister of Social
Security and used for the payment of benefits under the National
Insurance Scheme.
2. The funds of local authorities, obtained partly from rates (local taxes
on dwelling houses and other real estate) and income from property
and trading receipts, partly from grants and loans from the Exchequer,
and partly from loans raised in the open market (see p. 73).
The following broad account of government finance is concerned mainly
with the Exchequer and only incidentally with local government and other
public funds.
Financial control, as exercised by the House of Commons, is based on law,
parliamentary rights and custom.
As the power of Parliament grew in late medieval and Tudor times, the
principle that taxation by the Crown required parliamentary consent was
gradually evolved. The principle was established, at the end of the constitu¬
tional struggles of the Stuart period, by the Bill of Rights 1689.
In medieval, Tudor and Stuart times, it is broadly true to say that once
the King was granted the right to raise a given sum by taxation, he was free
to spend it as he chose. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the House
of Commons gradually developed the modern system of controlling expendi¬
ture through the device of Appropriation which was embodied in the
Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866. But by a Standing Order of
the House of Commons dating from the early eighteenth century the Crown’s
consent is required for all new spending proposals. The House of Commons
cannot, therefore, initiate expenditure which must be proposed by a Minister.
From the very early days of Parliament it had been established that such
financial control as Parliament possessed should be exercised by the House of
1 For an account of public finance in Northern Ireland and its relationship to that
of the United Kingdom, see pp. 381-2.
2 The term ‘Exchequer’ took its name from the ‘chess-board’, or table with chequered
cloth, round which the King’s financial officials sat for accotmting purposes in the
twelfth century.

Commons. This control became effective, as regards taxation, in the seven¬
teenth century, but as regards expenditure it was not effective until the
nineteenth century. The controlling power of the House of Commons is
acknowledged today in the Speech from the Throne at the opening of a new
session of Parliament, which is addressed to both Houses but contains a
special paragraph on expenditure addressed to the Commons alone.
The Commons have traditionally claimed that the Lords have no power
to modify financial provisions, though they may reject such provisions; thus,
to minimise the chance of rejection, the practice was started in 1861 of
embodying the main financial provisions for the ensuing year in a single Bill.
Since the passing of the Parliament Act 1911, however, a Bill certified by the
Speaker to be a Money Bill may be presented to the Queen for the Royal
Assent and become law without the consent of the House of Lords if it has
not been passed by them within one month (see p. 38).
Today, the authority of the House of Commons has to be obtained for all
expenditure by the central Government itself and for the raising of revenue
by taxation or borrowing. All government revenue, other than sums received
by government departments in the course of their normal activities (known
as appropriations-in-aid), is paid into the government account with the
Bank of England—known as the Exchequer Account or the Consolidated
Fund. With certain exceptions (the main one, as previously stated, being
National Insurance benefits), all payments by the Government come out of
this account.
The following sections outline the machinery by which expenditure and
revenue are authorised and controlled, the purposes on which public money
is spent and the sources from which revenue is obtained.
Central government expenditure falls into two main groups:
1. Expenditure which is specifically authorised by Acts of Parliament other
than annual Appropriation Acts. This expenditure includes the loans
made by the Government to nationalised industries, local authorities
and other public and private concerns for which the Treasury has
specific statutory authority to borrow. It also includes the Consolidated
Fund Standing Services which represent a permanent charge on the
Consolidated Fund, covering the interest on and cost of management of
the National Debt, the financial provision made for members of the
royal family, and salaries and pensions of judges and certain high
officers whose independence of the Government is thought to be better
guaranteed by permanent grant than by annual vote.
2. All other government expenditure is authorised by annual Appro¬
priation Acts and includes expenditure on defence, on the social services
and on the general administration of the country. These are called Supply
Services because the House of Commons, when voting money, is
granting to the Crown ‘such aids or supplies as are required to satisfy. . .
the pecuniary necessities of the Government’. It should be noted that
some of this expenditure may also depend on legislation, such as the
National Health Service Acts, which relates to a specific object of
expenditure.
The Estimates for these Supply Services are considered by the House of
Commons in Committee of Supply (that is, in Committee of the whole House
with the Chairman of Ways and Means, instead of the Speaker, in the Chair).
FINANCE
Scrutiny of
Expenditure
The Treasury
373
The committee usually discusses general questions of policy relevant to the
Estimates, though any Estimate may be examined in detail if members wish
and if time allows (see p. 40).
Estimates for Supply Services in the financial year beginning on 1st April
are submitted to the Treasury by each department in the preceding December.
Estimated expenditure is grouped under main headings called ‘Votes’ which
are further broken down into subheads and items. If the House of Commons
approves the Estimates, the sums asked for are voted and later confirmed
in the Appropriation Act; this Act appropriates the money to specific Votes.
Within each Vote, ‘virement’, that is, the spending of money on one subhead
instead of on another, is permissible so far as Parliament is concerned, but
only with Treasury consent. The Service departments may spend money on
one Vote instead of another, but only with Treasury sanction which, in turn,
requires the retrospective authorisation of Parliament. Departments are free
to distribute expenditure within subheads as they please subject to Treasury
approval of the type of expenditure involved.
An insufficient Estimate, or a new service not covered by the Vote, or
virement of a magnitude or character which the Treasury considers should
be brought to the attention of Parliament, requires a Supplementary Estimate.
The Treasury exercises the same power of scrutiny over this as over the
ordinary Estimates.
Control of expenditure is maintained by the Treasury, by the Comptroller
and Auditor General, and by the Public Accounts and Estimates Committees
of the House of Commons.
The power of the Treasury to control expenditure derives from the res¬
ponsibility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the financial policy of the
Government.
A central function of the Treasury is to present the Civil Estimates to the
House of Commons. In considering the Estimates submitted by departments,
the Treasury has to look at the proposals for expenditure in relation to
prospective national resources and to weigh the advantages of administrative
proposals against the monetary and economic cost, taking into account
current government policy; to decide the relative merits of expenditure
proposed by different departments; and to eliminate any overlapping,
uneconomic or wasteful expenditure where this has escaped the net of depart¬
mental financial control. Quite apart from the scrutiny of Estimates, through¬
out the year the Treasury keeps a close control over such matters as rates
of pay and the aggregate size of the staff in all government departments, in
addition to exercising a general supervision over all departmental expenditure.
The Treasury also lays down general rules of financial and accounting
procedure for departments and prescribes the principles on which depart¬
mental contracts shall be made and the limits within which losses may be
written off.
In 1961 the Plowden Committee on the Control of Public Expenditure
recommended in their Report {Cmnd. 1432) that regular surveys should be
made of public expenditure as a whole over a period of years ahead and in
relation to prospective resources, and that decisions involving future expendi¬
ture should be taken in the light of these surveys. Surveys, therefore, are now
made annually and have become an established part of the Government’s
machinery for the planning and control of expenditure (see p. 243). Expendi¬
ture in the public sector, excluding the nationalised industries, is currently
being related to the prospective increase in national production.

Committee
Control over issues of money to departments and the audit of accounts is
exercised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who holds a permanent
appointment with the status of an officer of the House of Commons. Since
1866 he has had two functions: as Comptroller of the Exchequer he controls
receipts and issues of public money to and from the Exchequer Account;
and as Auditor General he audits departmental accounts and submits his
report on the Appropriation Accounts and other accounts, as required by
statute, to Parliament. His statutory function is to ensure that all expenditure
is properly incurred, for example, that no payments are made which go
beyond any relevant statutory authority, and that Treasury sanction has been
obtained wherever necessary. In addition, however, he has been encouraged
by successive Committees of Public Accounts (see the next paragraph) to
examine departmental expenditure with a view to drawing attention to any
cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
The accounts of each department and the reports on the accounts made by
the Comptroller and Auditor General are considered by a select committee
called the Public Accounts Committee. This was first set up in 1861, on the
motion of Mr. Gladstone, for the purpose of ensuring that expenditure was
properly incurred in accordance with the purpose for which it was voted and
with any relevant Acts of Parliament. The terms of reference of the committee
are to examine the accounts and these terms have been widely interpreted by
successive committees which have investigated whether full value has been
obtained for the sums spent by departments and have examined cases in which
the administration appears to have been faulty or negligent. The committee
has therefore become a powerful instrument for the exposure of waste and
inefficiency. It embodies its findings in reports which may be debated in
the House of Commons. Its recommendations are considered by the Treasury
in consultation with departments and put into effect, so far as they are
accepted, according to Treasury instructions. A reply to each report is
submitted by the Treasury to the committee of the following session and
where the recommendations have been unacceptable to the Treasury the
committee may either accept the objections or return to the charge in sub¬
sequent reports.
This committee was originally set up in 1912 and has been reappointed
annually except during the war years. In i960 it was made a select committee
set up each session under standing orders. The committee’s functions are
to examine the Estimates, to report how, if at all, the policy implied in the
Estimates can be carried out more economically and to consider the principal
variations between the Estimates of the current year and those of the previous
year and the form in which the Estimates should be presented. Usually,
the committee selects each year a few Votes for review.
Through the medium of seven sub-committees, the committee carries out
extensive investigations into the departments under consideration. In practice
the Estimates for the current year are not affected, but the committee’s
recommendations produce cnanges in future Estimates and strengthen
Treasury control. In i960 a sub-committee was set up to examine the spring
supplementary estimates and the principal variations between the estimates
presented and those of the previous year. In 1965 the sub-committees were
reorganised on functional lines, each sub-committee being allocated a different
sphere of Government policy and administration. Additional parliamentary
time has been allocated for discussion of the reports of the Estimates and
the Public Accounts Committees.
FINANCE
THE BUDGET
Budget Policy
375
‘Budget’ is an old word meaning a bag containing papers or accounts. The
use of the word in public finance originated in the expression ‘The Chancellor
of the Exchequer opened his Budget’, which is applied in Parliament to
the annual speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining his proposals
for balancing revenue and expenditure.
The Budget speech is normally the main occasion of the year for reviewing
the Exchequer finances and the economic state of the nation, and its formal
basis is the Chancellor’s proposals for raising money by taxation. By the
time the Budget is introduced (usually in April) the Estimates of expenditure
under various headings will have been presented to Parliament and published,
and the expected total of government expenditure for the year will be known!
The Chancellor estimates the yield of the revenue on the basis of existing
taxation and proposes such changes in taxation as he considers desirable on
economic grounds. These proposals are later embodied in detail in a Finance
Bill. The interval between the Budget Statement and the Royal Assent to
the Finance Bill (usually given in July) is covered by the Provisional Collection
of Taxes Act iqtS* as amended, whereby changes in income tax, purchase tax,
and customs and excise duties have immediate statutory effect if adopted by
Resolution of the House of Commons.
The Budget speech also gives figures relating to loans from the Consolidated
Fund. In 1965-66 rather less than half of the net issues from this Fund were
loans to nationalised industries; about the same proportion were loans to other
public bodies, largely the local authorities; the remainder were loans to
overseas governments and private industry, and miscellaneous advances and
repayments. Since 1961 figures of these transactions have been published
in a White Paper issued immediately before the Budget.
The original purpose of the Budget was purely financial—to provide money
for government expenditure. From an early stage, however, it was appreciated
that taxation would affect the distribution of income and property and the
level of expenditure on particular goods and services. At a later period it was
realised that taxation also affected the nation’s total expenditure and therefore
the general level of economic activity. Since the second world war, Budgets
have been consciously designed in greater or lesser degree to bring the total
demand for goods and services into balance with the supplies which could be
made available.
Taxation on income and capital affects the distribution of wealth because
the rates vary according to the size of the income or capital, the proportion of
a high income or capital taken in tax being much greater than the propor¬
tion of a small one; at the same time, the services provided by the Government
(whether in cash or kind) are generally available to all, irrespective of wealth,
but in some cases they are specially designed to benefit people with lower
incomes. Taxes on expenditure (see p. 377), do not affect the distribution of
income, their main purpose has always been the raising of revenue, but by
discouraging or encouraging consumption of particular goods they can be used
to influence the allocation of resources and the pattern of trade.
The Budget affects the general level of expenditure and, therefore, the
total demand for goods and services in the following way: if there is an
increase in government expenditure without an increase in taxation then
total demand for goods and services will tend to rise; the same thing will
happen if there is a decrease in taxation without a decrease in government
spending. In this way the Budget can be used to counter unemployment.
On the other hand, if there is an increase in taxation without an increase
N

Revenue
Income Tax and
Surtax
in government expenditure or a decrease in government expenditure without
a decrease in taxation then the total demand for goods and services will
tend to fall. In this way the Budget can be used to counter inflation or deflation.
For example, the aim of the 1961 Budget was to counter inflation and
encourage exports, while that of 1962 was designed to keep the economic
position in balance. The purpose of the 1963 and !9^4 Budgets was to contri¬
bute towards achieving the target of a 4 Per cent growth rate in the national
economy: in 1963 by giving a stimulus to demand and in 1964 by restraining
consumption. Budgetary policy in 1965 and 1966 has aimed at reducing the
net outflow of long-term capital and decreasing the pressure on domestic
resources. A prominent feature of the 1966 Budget was the introduction of
the selective employment tax (see below), which is expected to encourage the
long-run structural changes in the economy needed to achieve a healthy balance
of payments.
Money to meet ‘Ordinary’ (mainly current) Budget expenditure of the central
Government is in normal years derived from taxation. In the United Kingdom
the principal taxes fall into three main categories. First, taxes on income
which include income tax, surtax and corporation tax; secondly, taxes on
capital which include estate duty, capital gains tax and the tax on short-term
gains; and thirdly, taxes on expenditure (including taxes on the ownership
or use of certain assets). These include not only customs and excise duties
and the purchase tax, but also the selective employment tax (on services),
local rates, stamp duties, licence duties (for example, on motor vehicles,
firearms and dogs) and fines. Taxes on individual (though not corporate)
incomes are progressive taxes, that is, larger incomes and estates bear a
proportionately higher rate of tax. The Board of Inland Revenue collects the
taxes on income and capital and the stamp duties, the Board of Customs and
Excise collects the most important taxes on expenditure, the customs and
excise taxes and the purchase tax, while a variety of authorities are responsible
for the collection of the remainder, including the Ministry of Social Security
for the selective employment tax.
Income tax is imposed at a standard rate for the year of assessment beginning
on 6th April, which is at present 8s. 3d. in the £ (41-25 per cent). The tax
imposed on an individual is graduated by means of personal allowances and
reliefs, by reduced rates of tax on the first sections of taxable income1 and by
the surtax.2 In the case of a married couple the incomes of husband and wife
are aggregated and are treated as one income, but higher allowances are given
than for a single person. Earned income bears less tax than other income as
certain fractional deductions (‘earned income relief’) are allowable.
A single person earning £1,000 a year pays £186 in income tax, while a
married couple with the same earned income pay £137; if the couple have
1 The balance of income remaining after deduction of the personal allowances and
reliefs is taxable income. For 1966-67 the reduced rates are: 4s. od. in the £ on the
first £100; and 6s. od. in the £ on the next £200. The remainder is charged at the
standard rate.
2 The surtax, which is essentially an income tax at higher rates, is charged on personal
incomes exceeding £2,000 a year after deducting certain personal allowances in excess
of the single person’s basic allowance. In addition, the same earned income relief as
for income tax and a special earnings allowance (not exceeding £2,000) are deductible
from earned income only. Surtax is imposed at rates which increase progressively until,
on the portion of income above £15,000, the combined rate of income tax and surtax
payable in 1966-67 (being income tax for 1966-67 and surtax for 1965-66) reaches
18s. 3d. in the £. In addition, a surcharge of 10 per cent (operative for one year only)
levied on surtax liabilities for the year 1965-66 for payment on 1st September 1967
was amongst measures announced in July 1966.

two children under the age of n, their tax falls to £52; when the children
are between the ages of 11 and 16, the tax is £37; if the children are over 16
and receiving full-time education, only £22 is paid. The range of tax payable
by a single person varies from, for example, £41 on an earned income of £500
a year to £1,515 on an earned income of £5,000; if the income is unearned,
tax liability on £500 will be £54, and on £5,000 will be £2,440.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (Tay-as-
you-earn) scheme, under which tax is deducted at source, thus enabling
them to keep up to date on tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in the
United Kingdom and on all income arising abroad of persons (including
companies) resident in the United Kingdom. The main exceptions are that
interest on certain United Kingdom government securities belonging to
persons not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom is exempt; and
income from certain classes of possessions abroad is chargeable not on the
amount of income arising but on the amount of income remitted to the United
Kingdom. The United Kingdom has entered into agreements with many
countries providing for relief from double taxation; where such agreements
are not in force unilateral relief is allowed.1
Under the 1965 Finance Act tax is charged on capital gains accruing on the
disposal of assets after 6th April 1965. The charge is not retrospective and
is restricted to the part of any gain attributable to the period after 6th April
I9^5- Net gains of persons other than companies are chargeable to the tax at
the rate of 30 per cent. Certain assets are exempt from the tax, including a
principal private residence, chattels worth less than £1,000, private motor
cars and National Savings securities. The 1965 Act also amended the existing
short-term gains tax, making gains which arise from the disposal of assets
within 12 months of their acquisition chargeable to income tax (and surtax) as
unearned income of the year, and not to capital gains tax.
The Finance Act 1965 introduced a new system of taxation of companies
by means of a corporation tax on profits instead of income tax and profits tax.
A company will in future deduct tax from dividends and other distributions
and pay it oyer to the Inland Revenue as a separate matter from its own
liability. The initial rate of corporation tax for the financial years 1964 and 1965
was fixed at 40 per cent in the 1966 Budget. The tax is assessed on the profits
of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate for the financial year in
which the accounting period falls. The basic rule for the calculation of
income for corporation tax purposes is that, except for special provisions, it
is computed in accordance with income tax principles.
Estate duty is chargeable on the value of property (whether legally settled or
not) which passes or is deemed to pass at death. Thus, it is not limited to
property owned by the deceased. It may, for example, extend to trust funds
to the income of which the deceased was entitled during his lifetime, and to
gifts made by the deceased within five years of his death (one year in the case
of a gift for public or charitable purposes). Estates with a net capital value of
£5,000 or less are exempt from duty, but on estates of a higher value there
is a progressive duty ranging from 1 per cent to 80 per cent.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the
Customs and Excise Department, namely, the duties on tobacco, purchase

tax, hydrocarbon oil, alcoholic drinks, protective duties, betting and some
miscellaneous smaller items. In British usage the distinction between customs
and excise depends on whether the goods are imported (customs duties) or
British produced (excise duties). These taxes are sometimes known as indirect
taxes since they are normally paid by the importer, manufacturer, or whole¬
saler who adjusts prices charged to customers accordingly. In 1966 the tax
burden was equivalent to 3s. yd. on a gallon of petrol, 4s. 2d. on a packet of
20 standard plain cigarettes, 37s. 6d. on a bottle of whisky, and io|d. on a pint
of beer of average strength.
Purchase tax is charged on a wide range of goods, nearly all of them con¬
sumer goods, at three rates which after allowing for the surcharge mentioned
below are 11 per cent, i6| per cent and 27^ per cent of the wholesale value.
Articles subject to revenue duties of customs and excise are in general exempt
from this tax; other goods free of purchase tax include food (other than
confectionery, soft drinks and ice cream), fuel, books and newspapers, young
children’s clothing and footwear, certain non-proprietary drugs and medicines,
some household appliances and textiles.
Since 1961 the Chancellor of the Exchequer has had power to vary by
order the rate of purchase tax and of the other main customs and excise
duties (except the protective duties) by up to 10 per cent in either direction.
In the 1964 Finance Act this power was amended so as to allow one or more of
the five groups of Customs and Excise Taxes that is, tobacco, alcohol, oil,
purchase tax and the minor revenue duties, to be excluded from its use.
Provision was also made for the surcharges or rebates to be applied at different
percentages for different groups. These powers were exercised in July 1966
in the imposition of a 10 per cent surcharge on alcohol, oil and the purchase
tax. They require annual renewal.
The principal betting duties are: a pool betting duty (applying mainly to
football pools) including betting by coupon or fixed odds, which is charged at
a rate of 25 per cent of the stake money; and a tax introduced in the 1966
Finance Act at the rate of per cent of stakes on most other betting. Gaming
is taxed at different rates by licence fees.
Taxes on motor vehicles are collected by the local taxation authorities (the
county or county borough councils in England and Wales and the corresponding
councils in Scotland); the proceeds are paid by the local authorities into the
Exchequer. The licence duty on a private motor car is £17 10s. a year; motor
cycles and three-wheel vehicles, etc., pay £2, £4 or £8 a year according to
engine capacity.
A selective employment tax, designed to encourage economy in the use of
labour in the service industries, was introduced in the 1966 Budget; it
became operative in September 1966. It is paid by all employers throughout
the United Kingdom at a rate per week of 25s. for men, 12s. 6d. for women
and boys and 8s. for girls. Employers, however, are affected in various ways.
Employers in manufacturing industries receive a refund of tax and a premium
together amounting to 32s. 6d. for men, 16s. 3d. for women and boys and
1 os. 6d. for girls. Employers in transport, public service, including the
nationalised industries, agriculture, extractive industries and charities have
the tax refunded but receive no premium, while employers in service industries
and construction pay the tax without refund.
In the 1966 Budget total expenditure for the financial year ending 31st March
1967, was estimated to reach £9,177 million, including £1,449 million for
Consolidated Fund Standing Services and £7,728 million for Supply

Services. The estimate for total revenue (after allowing for the Budget
changes) was £10,224 million of which £9,331 million was receipts from
taxation. There was therefore a surplus of £1,047 million. Loans from the
Consolidated Fund (see p. 372) to industry were estimated to reach £764
million and for other purposes £57° million. After allowing for the surplus
of revenue over expenditure, there was an estimated deficit of £287 million
to be met by Exchequer borrowing and special transactions.
Table 22 shows the Budget estimates for 1966-67 in comparison with the
outturn (Exchequer receipts and issues) for the previous year and Table 23
gives a general functional analysis of the Estimates.
Capital expenditure dealt with in the Budget statement consists chiefly of
loans from the Consolidated Fund to the nationalised industries, the local
authorities and other public bodies, such as the New Towns Development
Corporations; it also includes loans under the Export Guarantees Acts and
loans for overseas assistance. If, on balance, there is a deficit on capital
expenditure, it is met from the proceeds of government borrowing and
special transactions, for instance, borrowing from the Exchange Equalisation
Account, from extra-budgetary funds such as the National Insurance Fund,
or from the surplus, if any, in revenue and expenditure; while if there is a
surplus it goes to reduce the National Debt.
Exchequer borrowing may be in the form of direct borrowing from the
public either through the National Savings Movement (see p. 386) or by
borrowing on the market by means of new issues of securities. New issues of
government securities are made from time to time for the purpose of
refinancing maturing issues (conversion issues) or to raise new money (issues
for cash). Since 1956 capital requirements of the nationalised industries have
been met in full by the Exchequer, while those of the local authorities are met
partly by the Exchequer through the Public Works Loan Board (see p. 75)
and partly by the local authorities borrowing direct from the public in the
form of mortgages or stock issues.

So far, borrowing on a large scale has been undertaken only to finance deficits
during or immediately after a war. The National Debt rose from £651 million
in 1914 to £7,435 million at the end of the first world war, and from £7,131
million in 1939 to £23,637 million in 1946. On 31st March 1966, the total
National Debt (provisional) was £31,327 million, of which £1,795 million was
repayable in currencies other than sterling, mainly to the United States and
Canadian Governments. Of the £27,923 million of internal debt, £5,425
million was short-term debt, mainly in the form of 91-day Treasury bills,
while the long-term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds, loans, and
certificates carrying fixed rates of interest (ranging from 2J to 6 per cent)
and with fixed or indeterminate dates of repayment.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main
features, similar to that operating in the United Kingdom as a whole, under
which public revenues, with a few minor exceptions, are paid into the
Exchequer, from which no money can be withdrawn except on the authority
382
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of Parliament. That authority is expressed in the case of Consolidated Fund
charges in permanent legislative form, and in the case of Supply Services by
annual Appropriation Acts based on estimates prepared by departments and
sanctioned by the Ministry of Finance.
The major portion of taxation (customs duties and most excise duties,
purchase tax, income tax, surtax, corporation tax and capital gains tax) is
imposed by the United Kingdom Parliament over the whole country, and is
paid, in the first instance, into the United Kingdom Exchequer. From the
amount attributable to Northern Ireland, known as ‘Reserved ’ Revenue,
there is deducted and retained by the United Kingdom Treasury, under
the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the sum contributed by Northern
Ireland towards Imperial Services (called the ‘Imperial Contribution’), the
cost of the administration of the Supreme Court, and other Reserved Services,
and the cost of collecting Reserved Revenue. The balance, termed the
‘Residuary Share of Reserved Taxes’ is paid over to the Exchequer of
Northern Ireland and joins with the proceeds of taxes levied and collected
by the Government of Northern Ireland, called ‘Transferred’ Taxes, and with
other non-tax receipts of a miscellaneous nature, to form the public income.
Among items of Transferred Tax Revenue are estate duties, stamp duties,
betting duties, various excise licence duties, motor vehicle duties and selective
employment tax.
A joint Exchequer Board, representative of the Treasury and the Ministry
of Finance for Northern Ireland, constituted in accordance with the Govern¬
ment of Ireland Act 1920, determines the amount of Reserved Revenue and
the cost of Reserved Services attributable to Northern Ireland for each year, the
amount of the Imperial Contribution, and such other questions affecting
the financial relations of the two Governments as may be referred to it.
In the Northern Ireland Budget for 1966-67 (year ending 31st March), total
revenues were forecast at £202 million and expenditure at ^198 million.
After allowing for the Imperial Contribution, provisionally estimated at £3-5
million, there was a Budget surplus of .£58,490.
The Public Debt of Northern Ireland, totalling £165 million on 31st
March 1966, is fully covered by repayable advances and investments held
by the Ministry of Finance.
Outside the Exchequer system in Northern Ireland, various funds have
been established, in addition to statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for
specific purposes. In general, these funds follow the United Kingdom pattern,
the principal funds being those relating to National Insurance and govern¬
ment loans. The latter constitutes a pool of capital money available mainly
for local and public authority borrowings; on 31st March 1966, a sum of
approximately £141 million was outstanding against such borrowers.
BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCE
The British banking system is long established and well integrated. It
comprises a central bank; commercial banks which carry on the usual main
banking services; the United Kingdom offices of various banks whose main
business is in other countries; and various specialised banks and similar
financial institutions.1
1 For a detailed description of the British financial system see the Report of the
[Radcliffe] Committee on the Working of the Monetary System (Cmnd. 827), published
in August 1959.
FINANCE
The Bank of
England
The
Commercial
Banks
383
The Bank of England is the central bank and its principal business is to act
as banker to the Government and to the other banks, as the agent of the
Government for important financial operations and as the central note¬
issuing authority; it also maintains relations with central banks overseas. It
was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal Charter as a corporate
body, and its entire capital stock was acquired by the Government under
the Bank of England Act 1946.
As the central bank, the Bank of England is responsible for co-ordinating
the application of the Government’s monetary policy. One of the main instru¬
ments for this purpose is the Bank Rate—the minimum rate at which the
Bank of England will discount approved bills of exchange and a key factor in
the general pattern of interest rates.
As banker to the Government, the Bank of England holds the main
government accounts and it acts as the Government’s agent for the issue and
registration of government loans. It also operates, as agent for the Treasury,
the administration of exchange control which has been in force since 1939.
The commercial banks maintain large balances with the Bank of England
and these balances form part of the banks’ cash reserves. In addition, under
an arrangement made with the London clearing banks and Scottish banks in
I95%> the Bank of England might call on these banks for ‘special deposits’
which, not being freely disposable, do not rank as part of their liquid assets.
Deposits under this scheme, designed to restrict the liquidity of the banking
system should the need arise, were made with the Bank of England between
June i960 and December 1962 and again in May 1965 and July 1966. The
Bank of England has also given guidance on a number of occasions to the
main banking and financial organisations on the advances policy the authori¬
ties wish them to adopt.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. Notes thus issued need a 100 per cent cover in gold and securities,
together with a limited amount of coin, the part covered by securities and
coin being the Fiduciary Issue’, the level of which is subject to parliamentary
control. In practice very little gold is now held by the Issue Department of
the Bank of England, the bulk of the United Kingdom gold (and foreign
exchange) reserves being in a separate government fund, known as the
Exchange Equalisation Account; this account was originally established in
I932 f°r the purpose of checking undue fluctuations in the exchange value of
sterling, and is operated by the Bank of England as agent for the Treasury.
The provision of coin for circulation is the responsibility of a government
department, the Royal Mint.
The principal commercial banks in the United Kingdom are the 11 London
clearing banks,1 3 Scottish banks and 3 Northern Ireland banks. They are
limited liability companies which in the main are subject to the ordinary
law relating to such companies. Together, their deposits amounted to over
£9,700 million at the end of 1965 and accounted for about two-thirds of the
total deposits of the banking sector, which also includes the overseas banks,
accepting houses and the discount market. They provided full banking services
throughout the United Kingdom through nearly 14,000 branches at the end
of 1965. Several have interests in another clearing or domestic bank, and in
recent years have extended their connections with overseas banks. Together
^ Three of these banks have their headquarters outside London at Liverpool and
Manchester.

with the Bank of England the London Clearing banks make up the membership
of the London Bankers’ Clearing House. In 1965 cheques, bills and drafts
valued at nearly £34,300 million monthly passed through the clearing house,
and credits valued at a further £y24 rnillion monthly under the credit transfer
scheme which was introduced in i960.
The primary business of the commercial banks is the receipt, transfer and
encashment of deposits. Deposits on current account on which no interest is
paid are repayable on demand, while on balances on deposit account interest
is paid at a rate generally 2 per cent below bank rate. The London clearing
banks maintain a ratio of about 8 per cent between cash reserves and total
deposits. Until 1963 it was a convention that at least 30 per cent of deposits

should be covered by cash and other liquid securities; but since then this
ratio has been varied, and now stands at 28 per cent.
The banks profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts and partly in the form of loans (with or
without collateral security); these are normally for a short term only unless
renewed. The ratio of London clearing bank advances to total deposits
declined from about 43 per cent in 1938 to 17 per cent at the end of the
second world war. In recent years it has been affected by official requests to
banks to restrain their lending, but in June 1966 it stood at 51-5 per cent.
The banks liquid assets, that is, those that are quickly realisable are their
loans to discount houses (money at call), and their holdings of Treasury and
commercial bills: they also hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio
(mainly British Government securities) or trade investments. The diagram on
p. 384 shows the relative size of bank advances to different sectors of the
economy.
The increase in the value of advances in recent years has been accom¬
panied by innovations in bank lending practices including the introduction
of schemes for personal loans repayable by fixed monthly instalments over
periods up to two years, facilities for limited service accounts at low cost
and credit cards (see p. 420). Another development was the acquisition by
many banks of share capital in hire-purchase finance companies.
A new departure in British banking is the Government’s proposal for a
Post Office giro which will provide a postal cheque service for all customers
with a current account, but no overdraft facilities. A central office will be set
up on Merseyside and, it is hoped, will come into operation in 1968 or 1969.
The Scottish and Northern Ireland banks have limited rights to issue
notes; these issues, apart from an amount specified by legislation for each
bank, must be fully covered by Bank of England notes and by coin.
There are also 32 British overseas and Commonwealth banks many of
them having their headquarters in London. They provide a comprehensive
banking service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of
trade not only between Britain and other countries but also between third
countries. Currently there are also 11 United States banks in London,
8 Japanese banks and over 50 other foreign banks.
The merchant banks have helped to give London an international reputation
as a world financial centre for short-term and long-term borrowing. They
are of two kinds, and are known as accepting houses and issuing houses,
according to whether they specialise predominantly in the work of acceptance
credit or in transactions involving the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf
of their customers. They participate in the issue of long- and short-term loans
to governments of, or concerns in, overseas countries in sterling (where
permitted by exchange control regulations) or in other currencies which
have been deposited with them; this latter type of transaction has increased
considerably in recent years. They are also engaged in the work of the
gold and foreign exchange markets, and they have many other functions in
connection with the financing of trade, investment management, and
insurance.

The Discount
Market
The National
Savings
Movement
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The London discount or money market is a distinctive part of the British
banking system. It consists of 12 discount houses and its principal function
is to marry the needs of lenders of money for short periods with those of the
borrowers of such money.
The discount houses borrow ‘at call’ from banks and other financial
institutions at a low rate of interest. To them the Bank of England acts as a
lender of last resort. The clearing banks do not borrow money directly from
the Bank of England; if they need to add to their cash resources they call
in part of their loans to the discount market. If, as a result, any particular
discount house is unable to cover its needs for cash elsewhere, it is obliged
to borrow from the Bank of England, normally at bank rate, although if the
need arises a higher rate may be charged.
An important part of the money borrowed by the discount houses is
invested in British Government Treasury bills. The discount houses have
come to accept as an informal responsibility that they should cover the
Government’s need to borrow on Treasury bills, which are offered on tender
each week.
The commercial banks do not, in the ordinary way, buy Treasury bills
at the weekly tenders except on behalf of customers, but they purchase,
from the discount market, bills which are of a maturity required by the
banks.
The discount houses provide a specialised market in commercial bills
and in short-dated Government bonds, that is, those with not more than
five years to run before repayment, and local authority bonds.
The National Savings Movement started in 1916 to help finance the war by
promoting savings and spread rapidly. The present National Savings
Movement encourages the widespread investment of savings in Trustee
Savings Banks and the Post Office Savings Bank and in National Savings
securities. The movement is led by the National Savings Committee for
England and Wales and similar committees for Scotland and Northern
Ireland.1 The committees are bodies of independent persons representing
regional savings organisations and various national institutions connected
with such matters as finance, industry and education. They are assisted by
a salaried staff of civil servants. Voluntary local savings committees, often
assisted or promoted by local authorities, co-ordinate the work of voluntary
local savings groups.
Three forms of National Savings securities are now on sale: the National
Savings Certificate, the National Development Bond, and the Premium
Savings Bond. National Savings Certificates, in units of 20s., are encashable
at par at any time; interest, which is free of income tax and surtax, is only
paid on encashment; the limit on individual holdings is 500 units. National
Development Bonds, sold in units of £5, with a maximum holding of £2,500
are repayable at par on one month’s notice. Premium Savings Bonds are in
units of £1 and individual holdings are limited to £1,000. After a qualifying
period of three months the Bonds give investors a chance to win tax-free
prizes instead of receiving interest. There is a monthly draw with prizes
ranging from £25 to £5,000 and one quarterly prize of £25,000. At the end
of June 1966 £557 million was invested in this form of savings. Nearly all

British Government securities are held on the Post Office Register and can
also be bought or sold at most post offices in the United Kingdom.
The Post Office Savings Bank, which celebrated its centenary in 1961, is
the largest organisation of its kind in the world. It provides a country¬
wide system for depositing and withdrawing small savings and has over
23 million active accounts. All deposits carry a Government guarantee; in
June 1966 they totalled ,£1,813 million. They bear interest at 2-3- per cent and
the first ,£15 of interest is tax free. Up to £10 can be withdrawn on demand at
any Post Office, but a few days’ notice is required for larger amounts. The
moneys are lodged with the National Debt Office and are invested in Govern¬
ment securities. In June 1966 the new Post Office Investment Accounts were
opened, investors must have a qualifying deposit of ,£50 in the Ordinary
Department. On these a higher rate of interest is paid.
The Trustee Savings Banks, also started in the nineteenth century, operate
under their own trustees but are subject to statutory provisions and National
Debt Office surveillance. There are 78 individual banks with 1,374 Trustee
Offices and over 10 million accounts. Deposits can be made either in the
Ordinary Departments or the Special Investment Department. The terms
for deposits in the Ordinary Department are similar to those in the Post Office
Savings Bank, paying the same rate of interest (2^ per cent) with the same
tax concession on the first ^£15 of interest. Withdrawals can usually be made
on demand though notice is required for large sums. Deposits are invested
with the National Debt Commissioners and both capital and interest are
guaranteed by the Government. The Special Investment Department offers a
higher rate of return (between 5 and 5^ per cent, taxable). Deposits are
limited to ^5,000, but are not Government guaranteed. At the end of June
1966 total sums in the Ordinary Departments of the Trustee Savings Banks
were £i>°73 million and in the Special Investment Department ,£1,052
million. In mid-1966 about half the Trustee Savings Banks were operating
cheque services, first authorised in I964" Jun-e 1966 National Savings
totalled ,£8,387 million, about a quarter of the National Debt.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Co-operative Wholesale Society formed a deposit and loan department
about the year 1870, and the right of a co-operative society to engage in
banking was legally defined in the Industrial and Provident Societies Act of
1876. The primary purpose of the Co-operative Wholesale Society Bank
was to serve the co-operative movement, whose financial centre it has
become, but the clients of the bank now include trade unions and other
mutual societies, local authorities and individual depositors. The bank’s
headquarters are in Manchester. The Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society,
which has its headquarters in Glasgow, has similarly engaged in banking
since 1948.
It has been the policy of the commercial banks to leave the provision of
many special financial facilities to other financial institutions. These facilities,
which are supplementary to the credit facilities of the banking system, are
mainly provided through the savings banks, finance corporations, hire-
purchase finance companies, the Stock Exchange, investment trusts, building
societies and the insurance market. The firms engaged in such activities are
in the main highly specialised, for example, discount and other finance houses,
stockbrokers, insurers, insurance underwriters and brokers.
Two corporations, the Finance Corporation for Industry Limited and the
Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation Limited, were set up in
1945 to assist in dealing with the problems of post-war reconstruction and
development. Although the Government displayed considerable interest in
their formation, the corporations themselves are ordinary limited companies
with no official representation on their boards and having no recourse to
public funds. Another finance corporation, the Commonwealth Development
Finance Company Limited, was established in 1953 to assist development
projects in the Commonwealth. Among other financial corporations of note
are the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Limited, and the Scottish Agri¬
cultural Securities Corporation Limited.
The FCI was formed to assist in the provision of capital (in amounts of
£200,000 and upwards) for the re-equipment and development of major
industries in the national interest with a view to promoting efficiency and
thereby assisting in the maintenance and increase of employment.
The FCI has an authorised and issued capital of £25 million and may
borrow up to four times this amount, making a possible total of resources of
£125 million. The share capital is held as follows: 40 per cent by insurance
companies, 30 per cent by investment trust companies and 30 per cent by the
Bank of England. At 31st March 1966, the capital called and paid up was
2 per cent (£500,000); the Bank of England paid £5 million in advance of call
in 1959. The liability of the shareholders in respect of the uncalled capital
represents security to the banks providing loans for the corporation’s working
capital. The value of its investments at that date was £95-8 million. The
enterprises assisted by the FCI are concerned with a variety of products,
such as steel, shipping, diesel engines, oil and chemicals.
The ICFC has a smaller issued capital than that of the FCI and has as its
main object the provision of credit and finance by means of loan and share
capital of between £5,000 and £300,000 for small- and medium-sized industrial
and commercial concerns in Great Britain, particularly in cases where the
existing facilities provided by banking institutions and the Stock Exchange
are not readily or easily available.
FINANCE
389
The authorised and issued share capital of the ICFC at 31st March 1966
was £2° million paid up fully and a line of credit of £6 million, both provided
principally by the London clearing banks and the Scottish banks in proportion
to their size, with a token participation by the Bank of England. In addition,
public debenture issues have been made to a total of £30 million. The current
resources of the ICFC, including reserves shown in the balance sheet,
therefore total more than £80 million.
Commomvealth The Commonwealth Development Finance Company was set up in 1953 as
Development a new channel for the investment of private capital in Commonwealth
Finance Company development schemes. Its authorised share capital is £^o million, of which
Limited about 14I million ‘A’ ordinary shares of £1 (2s. paid) are held by industrial,
shipping, mining and banking interests in the United Kingdom, and nf
million ‘B’ ordinary shares of £1 (10s. paid) are held by the Bank of England
and certain central banks in the Commonwealth. Commitments entered into
from its inception in 1953 up to the end of March 1966 amounted to the
sterling equivalent of approximately £35 million.
The Stock There are 23 stock exchanges in the British Isles, of which 15 are in England
Exchanges and Wales, five in Scotland, one in Northern Ireland and two in the Irish
Republic. In addition the Provincial Brokers’ Stock Exchange operates in
no cities and towns throughout Britain and the Irish Republic. The
Federation of Stock Exchanges in Great Britain and Ireland, comprising with
one exception all these organisations, was set up in July 1965 to co-ordinate
their work. Four of the Scottish stock exchanges are linked, as are also the
stock exchanges in the north of England.
The London Stock Exchange is by far the most important of these stock
exchanges and is one of the world’s two foremost free markets in securities.
Some 9,400 securities are quoted on the London Stock Exchange; at the
end of March 1966 these had a total market value of .£78,000 million. Nearly
8,400 securities of companies are quoted, including a number of leading overseas
companies. At nominal values 38 per cent of the securities represented com¬
pany issues and the remainder British and overseas government and
corporation stocks; at market values the proportion was about three-quarters.
The London Stock Exchange is linked by cable or telephone with stock
exchanges all over the world. Therefore, a quoted company, subject to any
limitations imposed by the exchange control regulations, has a world-wide
market for its issues. This is an important factor in the raising of new capital
by government and commercial borrowers. Arbitrage transactions by brokers
—the buying or selling of a particular security on one stock exchange with the
intention of reversing it on another—play an important part in equating
price differentials between different markets and maintaining a continual
flow of business between centres.
The stock exchanges do not fix dealing prices; the terms on which bargains
are made between members reflect the interaction of supply and demand
for the securities concerned. All the stock exchanges operate under strict
rules of conduct which they formulate themselves.
In recent years there has been a constantly rising demand for ordinary
(equity) shares, partly in expectation that such shares will maintain their real
value or grow in value in periods of rising prices. Insurance companies and
pension funds now invest a larger proportion of their assets in these shares
than formerly, and the Trustee Investments Act 1961 permits trustees,
under certain conditions, to invest up to half the funds they hold in trust in
equity shares.

The ownership of Stock Exchange securities in the United Kingdom is
much more widespread than formerly: it is estimated that there are about
2| million shareholders and that their shareholdings are widely distributed.
The largest public company in Britain has nearly 600,000 shareholders and
there are several others with more than 100,000.
Through investment trusts and unit trusts, investors may spread their risks
and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The ordinary type of investment trust is constituted as a public company
registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business is
to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies,
it may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits
to build up reserves. Investment trusts grew to importance in the latter half
of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the securities. Normally, the managers
sell units to the public and invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of
Stock Exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly
by an initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit, and partly by a
semi-annual service charge which is taken usually out of the income of the
trust. The level of both charges is controlled by the Board of Trade, whose
authorisation is required before units can be offered to the public; this is
only granted if the Trust Deed is satisfactory to them.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and by 1939 there were
98 trusts, with assets estimated at £80 million. This medium of saving
suffered a decline after the war, owing mainly to government restrictions
on new capital issues, but has grown considerably since 1957. At the end of
June 1966 there were about 1^ million unit holdings. The value of the funds
invested in authorised trusts, numbering some 130, has risen from £60 million
in 1958 to £640 million in June 1-966; it has more than doubled since mid-
1963. There are now a wide variety of trusts, both as to the range of
investments covered and the ways in which they cater for the differing needs
of investors.
Although a certain amount of insurance is provided by Friendly Societies and
trade unions, most insurance services in Britain are in the hands of either
mutual or joint stock companies or Lloyd’s underwriters.

premiums are collected at frequent intervals of two months or less by house to house

and the latter for a further £194 million.

Table 24 shows the distribution of business in terms of net premium
income in 1964} the latest year for which figures are available.
There are about 400 insurance companies incorporated in the United Kingdom
but most of the business is in the hands of about 100 companies. Most
British insurers write several of the main classes of business although some
specialise in one class, particularly in life assurance where about 40 companies
write only that type of business. A few specialise in re-insurance.
In addition about 150 overseas companies carry on business (and even more
companies are represented) in the United Kingdom, thus emphasising the
international nature of the market. The natural centre of the market is in
London, but some of the large companies have their administrative head¬
quarters elsewhere.
In 1964 the total insurance funds of the British insurance companies and
collecting societies amounted to £11,200 million, the bulk of which is in
respect of life assurance business. With the growth of group pension schemes
the rate of accumulation of life funds is gradually increasing.
There is no government control over the investment policy of insurance
funds and these represent one of the most important sources of funds for
investment in commerce and industry. More than a third of the total assets
of British insurance companies are invested in equity shares and debentures,
and this proportion has been rising slowly.
Lloyd’s is an incorporated society of underwriters in London. The name
Lloyd s is derived from Edward Lloyd’s coffee house, established in the late
seventeenth century, where merchants with maritime and other interests
gathered to transact business. By the middle of the eighteenth century,
Lloyd s coffee house had become the principal centre of underwriting business
and of intelligence about shipping movements. Although in its earlier history
the activities of Lloyds were confined to the conduct of marine insurance
business, there has also been built up at Lloyd’s a very considerable world¬
wide market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business, except
life assurance of which the amount transacted at Lloyd’s is negligible’.
Lloyd’s is now regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting
in ^y i, the affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are
administered by the Committee of Lloyd’s, which does not itself transact
insurance business.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business
is transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and
in competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through
Lloyd s brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the
insured. Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact
insurance with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent
financial regulations laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to
transact business at Lloyd s; these financial safeguards give a security behind
the Lloyd’s policy which is second to none.
Today there are over 5,800 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped into
some 300 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents who
accept risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
In conjunction with its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a
world-wide organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence.
The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on
behalf of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and
a valuable part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in re-insurance

business, acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between
companies, both British and overseas, and often acting as London repre¬
sentatives of the latter.
Over two-thirds of the fire, accident and marine insurance business is
carried on overseas, partly by re-insurance on the London market and partly
through branches and agencies established in over 100 countries. The basic
principle of this international business is that resources capable of meeting
any potential loss are instantly available for use in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very
substantial assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of
uncalled capital, and the whole of the deposits, underwriting trust funds and
personal fortunes of Lloyd’s underwriters.
The principal function of building societies is to supply long-term loans on
the security of private dwelling-houses purchased for owner occupation,
though loans are occasionally made on the security of commercial and
industrial premises and farms. The funds of building societies are derived
mainly from the general public who invest in shares or deposits. The amount
of share capital is not fixed; shares, which have a fixed value, are not dealt
with on the Stock Exchange but may be withdrawn in cash if notice is given.
The Building Societies Acts 1874 to 1962 prescribe the general way in
which societies must conduct their business. The Chief Registrar of Friendly
Societies has discretionary powers to stop a society either advertising or
accepting money from investors if he considers that the way in which the
society’s business is conducted is jeopardising investors’ money. The rapid
expansion of building society activity in the twentieth century has been
accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands of a
few very large societies. At the end of 1965, 605 societies were in operation,
with total assets of ^5,532 million. Eleven of the largest societies, however,
each with assets of over £100 million, account for 60 per cent of the total
funds. The amount advanced on mortgage in 1965 was £995 million.

OVERSEAS TRADE
Although relatively small in area and accounting for less than 2 per cent of
the world’s population, the United Kingdom is the world’s third largest
trading nation, conducting about 14 per cent of international trade in
manufactured goods in 1965.
In the nineteenth century Britain attained a pre-eminent position in
international trade. At the end of the century Britain’s share of exports of
manufactures entering into world trade was about 33 per cent. Its share of
world imports of all goods was somewhat larger than that of world exports,
as imports into Britain were paid for both by exports of goods and by interest
on overseas investments and net receipts from shipping and a variety of
financial services. As other countries followed Britain in becoming fully
industrialised, it was natural that Britain’s share of world exports of manu¬
factures should fall. Even before 1914 this supremacy was being increasingly
challenged by other nations, including Germany and the United States,
and, although Britain’s imports and exports increased in absolute terms over
the years, its share of the world total tended to decline. By 1937 Britain’s
share in world exports of manufactures, measured by value, had fallen to
21 per cent compared with 22 per cent in 1929 and 30 per cent in 1913. In
the years immediately following the second world war, Britain’s share rose
again and in 1950 was nearly 25 per cent; but by 1965 it had fallen to about
14 per cent.
For over a century international trade has been of vital importance to
Britain’s economy. Britain relies upon imports for about half its total con¬
sumption of foodstuffs and nearly all the raw materials needed for its industries.
Its exports of goods and services together represent over a fifth of the gross
national product. It is a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal
manufactures, electrical apparatus, chemicals and textiles. It is the world’s
largest market for foodstuffs, and among the largest for metals, cotton, wool,
petroleum and many other products.
For some hundreds of years Britain has also been an important centre of
entrepot trade, the importance of which, however, in relation to total United
Kingdom trade, has declined in the last half-century.
Changes in value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
imports and exports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
The value of imports (c.i.f.) passed the £2,000 million mark in 1948 and,
with rapidly rising prices of raw materials, reached ,£3,946 million in 1951.
Because of the tendency in subsequent years for import prices to fall, the
1951 level was not reached again until 1957. Since i960 imports have
recorded peak levels except in 1961 and 1962. There was a particularly rapid
expansion in 1963 and 1964 but a smaller rise in 1965 when they were valued
at £5>763 million. The increase in exports has been at a steadier rate. The
1948 total of ,£1,563 million (f.o.b.) had increased to £2,621 million by 1951,
and thereafter increased in most years. In 1965 exports reached a new record
394
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of £4,724 million, an increase of 7 per cent over 1964. This was the seventh
successive year in which the previous total was surpassed.
Between 1961 and 1965 the volume of exports rose by 17 per cent and
that of imports by 20 per cent. Since 1956 the terms of trade, that is, the ratio
between the general level of export prices and that of import prices, have
moved progressively in Britain’s favour except for small adverse movements
in the two years 1963-64. In 1965 the ratio returned to the 1962 level.
The value and volume of exports and imports in selected years from 1956
to 1965 are shown in Table 25.

Commodity
Composition
Imports
The expansion of domestic agriculture has reduced Britain’s dependence on
imported food supplies and the proportion of imported foodstuffs to total
imports has not been above 40 per cent since before 1954. Imports of food¬
stuffs (including beverages and tobacco) in 1965 (representing 30 per cent of
total imports by value) fell by 3-5 per cent from their peak value in 1964 to
£1,711 million; this was partly due to the lower world prices of sugar. There
has been a similar downward trend in the proportion accounted for by basic
materials—from 30 per cent in 1954 to 19 per cent in 1965, but in both cases
the rate of change has generally been less fast in recent years. Industrial
production has tended to increase faster than the consumption of imported
raw materials. This is partly because there has been a growing economy in
materials’ consumption per unit of output, partly because of a gradual
switch from the production of goods with a high material content (for example,
textiles) to those with a relatively low material content (for example, engineering
products), and also because of increasing use of substitutes and synthetic
materials.

Imports of crude petroleum and lubricants are by far the biggest single
item by value among Britain’s imports: they accounted for n per cent
(£617 million) of the total value of imports in 1965, compared with 7^ per
cent in 1948 and 10 per cent in 1954.
The most rapid change in recent years has been the rise in the proportion
of imports of finished manufactures from 6 per cent of total imports in 1956
to 15 per cent in 1965. Strong growth in the group of products is a common
feature in the trade of industrial countries. Imports of semi-manufactures
have also been increasing steadily and in 1962, for the first time, accounted
for a greater proportion of the total import bill than basic materials. This
long-established trend is due partly to economies in the transport of semi¬
manufactures compared with basic materials and partly to the increasing
specialisation in production. Imports, by value, of semi-manufactured
(excluding chemicals) and manufactured goods amounted to £1,088 million
and £882 million respectively in 1965, accounting for 19 per cent and 15 per
cent of Britain’s total imports, compared with 19 per cent and 6 per cent in

COMMODITY COMPOSITION OF IMPORTS AND EXPORTS IN 1965
(Percentages of total values)
More than five-sixths of Britain’s exports consist of maufactured goods.
By far the most important group are engineering products, which in 1965
accounted for 44 per cent of the total, compared with 43 per cent in 1958.
Within this group, exports of many types of machinery, electrical equipment,
road vehicles, tractors and scientific instruments have expanded markedly
over this period. The share represented by chemicals has grown fairly steadily
and now represents 9-3 per cent of total exports. The proportion accounted
for by metals has tended to fall in recent years; it rose slightly in 1964 and 1965
396 BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
but remained below its 1962 level. Exports of textiles have fallen from over
19 per cent of the total in 1948 to 10 per cent in 1956 and 6 per cent in 1965.
Exports of coal in 1965 were less than 1 per cent of the total, in contrast to
their importance in the pre-war period. Exports of petroleum products,
which have been about 3 per cent of the total in the last few years, fell slightly
to 2-3 per cent in 1964 where they remained in 1965. The proportion accounted
for by foodstuffs has also shown little change in the past few years.

British Markets
and Sources of
Supply, 1965
The growth of trade between Britain and Western Europe has been a feature
of the area distribution of trade in recent years, but conversely there has been
a decline in the proportion of Britain’s exports going to primary producing
countries. In 1954, 28 per cent of exports went to Western Europe, but in
1962, for the first time, these exports began to exceed those to the sterling
area and by 1965 they formed 37 per cent of the total. The rise in exports to
Western Europe in 1965 (4 per cent) was modest compared with the rate of
growth in the previous years. This was because the rate of growth in exports
to the European Economic Community (EEC) which had been particularly
marked up to 1963 have slackened since then; exports in 1965 increased by less
than 1 per cent compared with 3 per cent in 1964 and an average rate of
some 9 per cent per annum over the past decade. The growth in exports to the
European Free Trade Area (EFTA) was higher (7 per cent) but less than the
comparable figure of 12 per cent in 1964; the annual average rate of growth
of exports to the market has been about 6 per cent over the past ten years.
In 1965, 33 per cent of total imports came from Western Europe, with increases
from both the EEC and EFTA.

Relatively, trade with other members of the Commonwealth and with the
sterling area as a whole has tended to decline. Exports to the sterling area rose
in the early 1950s, but there were some falls in later years and the 1957 total
was not regained until 1963; since then exports to the area have increased as
fast as exports as a whole. In 1965, 35 per cent of Britain’s exports went to
the sterling area, compared with 48 per cent in 1954. There has been a similar
relative fall in respect of imports. Canada, Australia, India and New Zealand,
however, are among Britain’s most important trading partners. The United
States has been both Britain’s largest single market and source of supply since
1957. The proportion of total exports going to North America in 1959 has
not yet been surpassed, but in 1965 the principal element in Britain’s export
growth was the sharp rise of 18 per cent in exports to North America.
Expanding oil consumption in Britain has given rise to a substantial expansion
of imports from the non-sterling Middle East. There was a recovery in exports
in both 1964 and 1965 after the heavy fall in 1963. Imports from Latin
America have fallen slightly since 1963. This trade accounts for 3 per cent of
exports and 5 per cent of imports. Britain’s trade with the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe has been growing rapidly over the past decade but is still
small in relation to trade with other parts of the world.

Re-exports are goods which are exported (1) in the condition in which they
are imported or (2) after having undergone minor operations—such as simple
blending, husking, repacking—which leaves them essentially unchanged.
Traditionally, the greater part of United Kingdom re-export trade is in raw
materials and foodstuffs, for example, wool, rubber, tea, non-ferrous metals
and fur-skins. Commodities imported from Commonwealth countries and sent
on to countries in Europe, particularly traditional re-exports such as tea and
wool, account for a considerable proportion of the total value. In recent
years a considerable re-export trade has developed in manufactured goods,
part of which is accounted for by machinery, for example, aircraft and aero¬
engines, which have been repaired or overhauled in the United Kingdom.
In 1965 the value of re-exports reached a peak total of XI73 million. The
principal items were: fur-skins, rubber, raw wool, tea, non-ferrous metals
and beverages. About half of the re-exports went to countries in Western
Europe.

Invisible
Transactions
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
As previously mentioned, the United Kingdom has usually imported more goods
than it exports; until a few years ago the gap was normally covered by net earn¬
ings from invisible transactions, but between 1958 and 1960 this source of foreign
earnings declined sharply from £298 million to £131 million. The balance im¬
proved in 1962, deteriorated slightly in 1963 and rather more in 1964 when it
showed a net credit of ^129 million. There was no change in this figure in 1965:
total credits were valued at £2,792 million and total debits at £2,663 million.
Invisible transactions are divided for statistical purposes into six main
groups: government; transport (mainly shipping); interest, profits and
dividends; travel; other services; and private transfers. Some of these figures
are precise (for instance, for government transactions), others are estimates.
The diagram below shows the breakdown of the figures from 1962 to 1965.

Under the heading of Government current transactions, the main items
on the debit side are military expenditure overseas and grants to less-developed
countries. Shipping receipts come mostly from export freights and cross
trades between other countries and also from passenger traffic. Shipping
payments, on the other hand, arise mainly on account of foreign tramp
shipping services. Shipping transactions produced a net credit until 1959
but have registered net deficits since then, ranging from £32 million in i960
to ^11 million in 1965. Net earnings from civil aviation since 1962 have been
enough to offset the shipping debits and produce a small favourable balance
on the transport account.
About three-fifths of Britain’s receipts under the heading interest, profits
and dividends come from investments in the sterling area. The recovery
in net earnings under this heading, which started in 1961, has been an out¬
standing feature of the invisibles account since then, benefiting in 1964 and
J9^5 frorn the postponement of interest due on long-term loans from Canada
and the United States. On the debit side, major items include the earnings
of foreign investment in Britain, interest paid on sterling held by other
countries (which fluctuates with changes in short-term interest rates in
Britain) and interest payments on the North American loans. Receipts from
travel have increased greatly since 1950, reflecting the growing importance
of the British tourist industry (see below), but expenditure on travel and
tourism overseas has also expanded, and the net debit has risen in each year
since i960 from ^17 million to ^92 million in 1965. Major components of
other services include payments and receipts in respect of insurance and
films; expenditure of United States and Canadian forces in Britain; net
earnings of merchants; and royalties, commissions, banking and other services.
Tourism continues to yield a substantial income from overseas. In the ten
years 1956-65, overseas visitors spent over £1,600 million in this country.
For 1965 alone these tourist receipts were estimated at about £188 million.
United Kingdom residents on holiday, or travelling for business or other
purposes overseas, spent about £280 million in the same year. The United
Kingdom usually has a large net surplus on earnings from tourism with
North America and the overseas sterling area, but a substantial net deficit
with Western Europe. The total number of visitors to the United Kingdom
in 1965, excluding visitors from the Irish Republic, was estimated at about
2f million—an increase of some 13 per cent over the 1964 figure, and more
than twice the number of visitors in 1956.
Britain s national tourist office is the British Travel Association, which
derives the major part of its income from a government grant-in-aid.
The Association undertakes publicity overseas aimed at attracting visitors to
Britain and works towards the improvement of hotel accommodation, catering,
transport, entertainment and other amenities for the tourist in Britain. It
maintains offices (see Appendix, p. 484) or agencies in 16 overseas countries.
The Association works in close collaboration with the Scottish Tourist Board
and the Wales Tourist and Holidays Association (contributing to their informa¬
tion and publicity services), as well as the Northern Ireland Tourist Board,
which is a statutory body receiving a grant from the Government of Northern
Ireland. In Northern Ireland the Ministry of Commerce can assist, by way of
grant, schemes submitted by local authorities for the promotion of tourist traffic.
Britain’s prosperity depends on the prosperity of those who buy her exports
and theirs will depend on how they sell their exports elsewhere. Thus Britain
400
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
is a strong advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade and to this end
has taken a leading part in setting up such organisations as the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) (formerly the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation)
and the European Monetary Agreement (formerly the European Payments
Union). Britain has had a large share in these organisations’ activities,
especially those to free trade from the restrictions which grew up in the
second world war and post-war periods. It also played a full part at the first
session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development held
in 1964 and is a member of the Trade and Development Board that acts on
behalf of the Conference between sessions. The Conference’s second session
is due to take place in 1967.
Customs duties on imports into Britain are divided into two broad
categories: revenue duties (to which there correspond excise revenue duties
on comparable British-produced goods) and protective duties. Purchase tax
is chargeable on imported as well as home produced goods but in the main the
charge on imports is deferred until the goods are sold by a registered to a
non-registered trader. In the financial year 1965-66 revenue duties charged
on imported goods yielded about £1,850 million, by far the greatest part of
which came from tobacco and hydrocarbon oils (petroleum products). The
yield from protective duties in the financial year 1965-66 was £186 million,
or about 3 per cent of the value of all imports.
At the beginning of the twentieth century the only customs duties were
those imposed for revenue purposes on a small range of products. Certain
duties were imposed during the first world war (the McKenna Duties), in
1921 (for strategic reasons) and in 1925 (initially for revenue purposes) but it
was not until the Import Duties Act 1932 that any serious departure was made
from the principle of free trade. This measure provided a degree of protection
for British industry and, at the same time, a basis for negotiations with
foreign countries already in possession of a tariff structure. A series of bilateral
trade negotiations between 1932 and 1939 led to some modification in the
level of protection but in the next ten years, because of government purchase
and import controls introduced during and immediately after the second world
war, the tariff lost much of its importance. The substantial relaxation of
quantitative import controls from 1949 onwards re-established the tariff as the
main instrument of protection.
The Import Duties Act 1958 replaced the existing legislation relating to
the protective tariff (that is, four main Acts and some 70 Finance Act provisions)
and brought it up to date in a single measure. Following the passing of the
Act, the tariff was recast into an internationally agreed form (the Brussels
Nomenclature), which came into use from 1st January i959> By the Customs
Duties (Dumping and Subsidies) Act 1957, the Board of Trade is empowered
to impose duties on imported goods of any description which have been
dumped or subsidised and which are causing or threatening material injury to a
particular industry.
In October 1964, as part of its immediate measures to deal with the balance
of payments situation, the Government imposed a temporary charge on
imports at 15 per cent ad valorem. In broad terms it applied to all imports
except food and feedingstuffs, fuel, unmanufactured tobacco and raw
materials. Its purpose was different from that of the protective tariff in that
it was designed to curb imports of manufactures and semi-manufactures,
which had been rising rapidly, while other measures to improve the balance

of payments position took effect. The Government’s Statement on the
Economic Situation, issued at the time, made it clear that the charge was
essentially temporary and would be reduced as soon as the balance of payments
position permitted and abolished at the earliest opportunity. The rate was
reduced to 10 per cent in April 1965 and in May 1966 the Chancellor of the
Exchequer announced that the charge would be allowed to lapse at the end of
November 1966. Receipts from the charge in the financial year 1965-66
amounted to £156 million.
The United Kingdom’s protective tariff has been considerably modified in
recent years as a result of a series of multilateral tariff negotiations held under
the auspices of the GATT, which seeks to increase the volume of world trade
by reducing tariffs and other barriers to trade, and by eliminating discrimina¬
tion in international commerce. Tariff reductions, and bindings against
increase, negotiated between countries under the GATT are applied equally
to all other GATT countries under the ‘most favoured nation’ clause.
Customs duties and preferences have been reduced, or bound against increase,
on goods which account for about half of Britain’s normal imports from other
countries which are parties to the GATT, in return for concessions by those
countries. In May 1964 GATT Ministers formally launched the new round
of tariff negotiations (the ‘Kennedy Round’) to which Britain has attached the
greatest importance. It is hoped that these negotiations will lead to a
substantial linear cut in tariffs (50 per cent has been adopted as a ‘working
hypothesis’) together with a reduction of non-tariff barriers and suitable
arrangements for agriculture. It is hoped to complete the negotiations by
early 1967.
The principle of Imperial Preference had been introduced into the United
Kingdom customs duties in 1919 and at the Ottawa Conference in 1932
agreements were concluded with independent Commonwealth countries,
providing for reciprocal preferential tariff treatment over a wide range of
goods. The Import Duties Act 1932 had already provided for the duty-free
entry of goods from the United Kingdom dependencies.
Broadly speaking, goods from Commonwealth countries can enter Britain
free of duty or at preferential rates of duty. A few foodstuffs, whatever the
country of origin, come in free of duty, but for most others imported from
non-Commonwealth sources there are duties, which are quite low except for
certain horticultural products.
Imports of most raw materials from all sources are free from protective
duties; the only exceptions are where duties are charged on foreign products
to give a margin of preference to Commonwealth suppliers. The full rates of
duty on semi-manufactures are mainly 15 per cent or less. The range of duties
on manufactured goods is much wider, ranging from 10 to 33 per cent
ad valorem, or higher on a few items. The preferential tariff arrangements
have encouraged some of the developing countries in the Commonwealth
to build up valuable outlets in Britain for the less complex types of
manufacture.
In May 1964 at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
in Geneva, Britain declared itself prepared to extend tariff preferences to all
the developing countries if other major industrialised countries would do the
same, if the Commonwealth countries concerned would agree and provided
that preferences were not created by introducing new, or increasing existing,
general tariff rates.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The European Free Trade Association (BETA) was set up under the
Stockholm Convention of January i960 by Austria, Denmark, Norway,
Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain, with the object of promoting the
harmonious development of trade and reducing trade barriers. Under the
Convention, customs tariffs on trade in industrial products between members
of EFT A were to be eliminated by 1st January 1970; but the reductions
have been greatly accelerated and the Association will be free of tariffs and
quotas on industrial goods by the end of 1966, except for tariffs on a wide
range of imports into Portugal, for which special provisions provide for final
elimination by 1st January 1980. An Agreement of Association between Finland
and EFTA provides for the extension of BETA tariff concessions to Finland
and for the elimination of Finland’s import duties on most EFTA manu¬
factures on 31st December 1967.
The moves made by the European Economic Community (EEC) and
EFTA towards establishing closer economic unity in Europe have a direct
and far-reaching influence on tariff policy and trade patterns (see p. 400).
In August 1961 the British Government applied formally to join the EEC
but negotiations were suspended in January 1963.
The export trade and virtually all the import trade of the United Kingdom are
conducted by private firms.
Methods of export trading vary considerably, according to the firm, the
industry, the product and the market. A good deal of United Kingdom export
trade, especially of the smaller manufacturing firms, is conducted through
exports merchants in the United Kingdom; many firms, however, sell to
importers and consumers abroad through their own agents or resident
representatives in the countries concerned; in other cases, sales are made
through a firm’s own branch offices, distributing organisations or subsidiary
sales companies established in overseas markets.
Similarly, in import trade, many large firms engaged in manufacture or
domestic trade buy directly from overseas suppliers, while smaller firms may
find it more convenient to buy through intermediaries such as import/export
houses, commission agents, and the representatives of overseas firms. Since
January 1957 overseas trading undertaken directly by the Government has
been confined to jute goods; the purpose of this is to protect employment
in Dundee, where the jute industry is concentrated and forms the mainstay
of employment.
Most of the restrictions imposed on the movement of goods and services
during and immediately after the second world war have been progressively
abolished. Because of the heavy balance of payments deficit in 1964 exchange
control requirements for investments outside the sterling area have been
revised and made more stringent.
Exchange control is confined mainly to transactions between residents
of the United Kingdom and residents of countries outside the sterling area
and, for current payments, has been greatly relaxed in the past few years.
Since the end of 1958 residents of all countries outside the sterling area have
been able to settle transactions between themselves in sterling. Sterling
held by non-residents of the sterling area on an external account is freely
convertible into other currencies, including dollars.
The only remaining important restrictions relate to the movement of capital
from the United Kingdom to non-sterling countries. Exports of goods to

destinations outside the sterling area are subject to exchange control and, in
general, have to be paid for within six months in an acceptable currency or
by sterling from an external account. Control is also exercised over imports
to ensure that currency authorised for their payment is, in fact, used for
that purpose.
Since April 1966 certain restrictions have been placed on the release of gold
for manufacturing purposes and on the buying, selling and holding of gold coins.
Exchange control policy is the responsibility of the Treasury, but most of
the administration is, in practice, carried out by the Bank of England as agent
of the Treasury; and, in turn, the Bank of England has delegated to the
commercial banks a wide variety of powers to deal with applications.
Following its illegal declaration of independence in November 1965,
Rhodesia was removed from the sterling area and all transactions between
residents of the United Kingdom and residents of Rhodesia became subject
to exchange control.
Among the measures introduced by the Government in July 1966 to
strengthen the balance of payments was the restriction of expenditure on foreign
travel. Since November 1959 there had been no limit on the amount of foreign
currency that United Kingdom travellers could take abroad although closer
supervision over the use of foreign exchange for travel purposes was introduced
in the 1965 Budget and the amount of sterling notes that British travellers
could take out of the country was at the same time reduced from £50 to £25
a journey. In July 1966 this amount was further reduced to £15. The new
arrangements also imposed a basic allowance of £50 per person for private
travel to countries outside the sterling area during the year beginning ist
November 1966. This allowance covers all foreign exchange expenditure,
taken in the form of cash or travellers’ cheques and also the cost of hotel and
other travel services, except fares paid in sterling to travel agents in the United
Kingdom. There are special allowances for cars and motor cycles taken abroad.
The Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 empowers the
Board of Trade to make statutory orders prohibiting or regulating the import
or export of goods. The powers of both import and export control derive
from the same legislation, but the purpose and mechanism are quite distinct.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT and the
IMF, the United Kingdom Government has progressively removed quanti¬
tative restrictions from almost all imports from the countries of the free world.
The very short list of goods on which controls remain includes some items
of special difficulty and a few where restrictions are recognised internationally,
such as arms, ammunition and radioactive materials. They require a specific
import licence and quotas have been set up for most of them. Some quotas
refer specifically to individual countries and are usually shared out among
exporters by the authorities of the countries concerned. Others are accorded
on an overall or global basis; these are generally allocated by the United
Kingdom authorities to United Kingdom importers, usually on the basis of
their share of the trade in the commodity in the past. Apart from these
quantitative controls, some further restrictions or prohibitions are applied
on health grounds (for example, on animals, plants and drugs).
Except for the control necessary to ensure that exports to destinations
outside the sterling area are paid for in the proper manner, United Kingdom
exports are not, except in a very minor way, subject to any government
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
control or direction. The few controls that are in operation are imposed to
supervise exports of military and strategic importance, to conserve materials,
such as metal scrap, which may be in inadequate supply, to assist exchange
control operations in preventing the export of capital in the form of valuable
goods, and to prevent the export of works of art classed as national treasures,
such as paintings, manuscripts and antiques. Normally, individual licences
are required for specific consignments of goods subject to export licensing
control. Goods controlled for strategic reasons, not included in the category
of atomic energy materials and appliances, arms and ammunition, may, with
certain exceptions, be exported to the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic,
the Republic of South Africa and the United States of America without licence.

ASSISTANCE
TO OVERSEAS
TRADE
The British Government assists exporters1 by its efforts to create conditions
favourable to the export trade and by providing credit insurance facilities and
information and advice about opportunities for trade in other countries.
Its general economic policy includes the use of fiscal, credit and other measures
to maintain a stable economy and to control excessive demand for goods and
services by the home market, and action through international negotiation
to reduce barriers to the free flow of trade and payments.
Facilities exist for the repayment of protective duties paid on goods which
have been imported for export trade purposes. Since October 1964 a scheme
has been in operation designed to relieve exported goods of the burden of
certain indirect taxes which enter into their production costs.
Information Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the Board of Trade or
and Advice to the commercial posts overseas. There are posts in all the principal cities and
Exporters trade centres abroad and they supply the Board of Trade with information
of every kind affecting trade with their territories.
Overseas officers regularly report on local economic and commercial
conditions, pay special attention to local demand for particular commodities,
and generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of
governmental regulations. These officers investigate potential markets for
British products, advise about methods of trading with particular areas, and
seek out and pass on opportunities for export business and inquiries for
British goods. Assistance is also given to United Kingdom exporters in
appointing agents and locating potential importers. From records kept in
London, brought up to date by reports from its overseas officers, the Export
Services Branch of the Board of Trade can provide information concerning
any country on:
1. prospects for United Kingdom exports and requirements of particular
markets;
2. governmental regulations affecting trade, including import restrictions
and tariffs and duties on particular commodities;
3. methods of trading;
4. local tastes and preferences in design; and
5. the commercial standing of firms with which an exporter contemplates
business relations.
1 Export promotion is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry)
and the Development Corporation for Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Ministry
of Commerce provides a liaison service with the Board of Trade Export Services Branch
and the overseas posts.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
Export Credit
Insurance

The Government’s official information services overseas help to promote
trade by publicising British industrial achievements and providing informa¬
tion on new developments in British industry.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department is an autonomous government
department responsible to the President of the Board of Trade. ECGD carries
on a commercial business, providing insurance for exporters against the main
risks in selling overseas. These facilities have been progressively developed
since the Department was first formed in 1919. From very small beginnings
the amount of business covered by ECGD has grown to reach 27 per cent of
the country s export trade. ECGD is obliged to carry on its business on a
self-supporting basis, and in no way does it provide subsidies to exporters,
nor is it a charge on the taxpayer.
The risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the buyer,
governmental action which blocks or delays transfer of payment to the
United Kingdom exporter, imposition of new import licensing restrictions
in the buyer’s country, war between the buyer’s country and the United
Kingdom, cancellation or non-renewal of a United Kingdom export licence,
or any other cause of loss occurring outside the United Kingdom and not
within the control of the exporter or the buyer, and not normally insurable
with commercial insurers’. Cover may commence from the date of contract
or (at lower premiums) from the date of shipment.
The main types of export insurance policy are:
1. Comprehensive policies normally covering goods sold on terms of up to
six months credit. The exporter insures the whole of his trade, or the
whole of his trade with an agreed group of markets, for the twelve
months (or, in some cases, three years) covered by his policy. For certain
engineering goods this type of cover is extended to goods sold on credit
terms of up to five years.
2. Specific policies which cover capital goods sold on credit terms normally
not exceeding five years. Specific policies are negotiated for each
individual contract.
In April 1961 ECGD introduced financial guarantees for United Kingdom
banks providing finance on a long-term basis for overseas purchasers of large
capital goods and works, and in January 1962 the London Clearing Banks, the
Scottish Banks and a number of insurance companies agreed to provide finance
at fixed rates of interest for such loans, and also in respect of other export
financing on longer than three years’ credit which was secured by an ECGD
guarantee to the bank concerned. In April 1965 bank guarantees covering
100 per cent of the credit, instead of the previous 90 per cent, were made
available for two or more years’ credit and at the same time the premium
was halved. In March 1966 a similar scheme was introduced to include the
financing of exports for credit between 30 days and two years. Cover is also
available for British concerns carrying out services (including construction
projects) for overseas firms or, under certain conditions, entering into an
international consortium.
The exporter or merchant is normally required to retain an interest in the
debt or risk involved and, consequently, guarantees are given up to a maximum
of between 90 and 95 per cent of loss; 100 per cent cover is now available
for transactions involving over three years’ credit which have already operated
satisfactorily for one year. Premium rates are assessed separately for each
country and vary according to the risks and the terms of payment.

INTERNATIONAL
TRADE
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Some 300 exhibitions, of which about 200 were trade fairs, were held in
Britain in 1966, compared with 154 in 1954. The number of trade fairs has
more than trebled in the last ten years. Some of the specialised fairs, such as
the Motor Show and the Royal Agricultural Show, attract large numbers of
the public as well as many trade buyers from home and overseas and provide
an important means of advertising and selling British goods.
United Kingdom products are shown at most of the large international
trade fairs throughout the world. For example, the United Kingdom is
usually well represented at the Milan, Hanover and Poznan Fairs. In addition,
since 1954 through a subsidiary company, British Overseas Fairs, Ltd., the
CBI has organised British Trade Fairs in 12 major cities abroad, including
the British Trade Fair in Oslo in May 1966 and the British Industrial
Exhibition in Mexico City in October 1966. British Trade Fairs were also
organised by Industrial and Trade Fairs Ltd., in Moscow in 1961 and
Peking in 1964 and again in Moscow in 1966. United Kingdom manufacturers
have been prominent at the many important specialised international fairs
which are held in North America and Europe, and will also contribute to
Britain’s participation in the world exhibition to be held in Montreal in 1967.
Participation in trade fairs, ‘British Weeks’ and store promotions overseas is
a form of export promotion for which the Government provides information,
advice and, in certain cases, free facilities. The amount allocated to the Board
of Trade for these purposes has risen from ^60,000 in I955_5^ to about -9
million in 1966-67. British weeks differ from trade fairs and exhibitions in
that they are primarily designed to promote consumer goods in shops and
other retail outlets in chosen commercial centres overseas.
The British National Export Council (BNEC), sponsored by representatives
of industry, trade, finance and organised labour in Britain, was established in
July 1964. The Council is an independent body but has the support of the
Government. A Commonwealth Export Council was set up in October 1964
to assist the BNEC in achieving its aims with respect to British exports
to the other members of the Commonwealth. Associated with both these
councils are ten Area Councils or Committees with the primary responsibility
for developing British exports to a particular market or group of markets:
Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, the United States, Canada,
Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Asia and the Caribbean.
The tasks of the BNEC are to keep all British export activity under review;
to initiate, guide and inspire export efforts of British industry; to co-ordinate
the work of the associated Area Committees; and to provide the necessary
finance and services for this purpose such as the sending overseas of export
missions. The first 115 awards under a scheme for Royal recognition of export
and technological achievement by industry, namely, the Queen’s Award to
Industry, were made in 1966.
In the nineteenth century, the rapid growth of British industry, commerce
and shipping under the stimulus of the industrial revolution made Britain
the market as well as the workshop of the world. It became the site for
the chief world markets in raw materials (see p. 407), freight, insurance, and
precious metals. A sound commercial banking system and a flexible system
of central bank control have been built up, while specialised institutions such
as discount houses, merchant banks, accepting houses, the stock exchanges,
investment trusts and finance corporations have evolved to satisfy particular
needs for short-term or long-term finance. The facilities provided by merchant
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
Commodity
Markets
407
banks and accepting houses, for example, have long been used to finance
shipments of goods not only to and from Britain, but also between overseas
countries themselves.
At the same time, the banks which were already engaged in financing trade
naturally developed to become channels for finance for longer-term ventures.
British capital invested in overseas countries has assisted their development,
increased their output and exports, and provided markets for manufactured
goods. Since the end of the war there has been a substantial volume of loans
floated in the London capital market by Commonwealth Governments (see
p. 411). A number of specialised institutions have also been established in
recent years to assist the provision of financial services for overseas countries
(see p. 412).
Britain is the traditional centre for marketing many of the world’s basic
commodities. Most of these markets were closed during the war but most,
if not all, have now reopened and many have fully regained—some even
surpassed—their previous position. Among the more important are the Baltic
Exchange (the market for shipping and air transport, grain, seeds and
vegetable oils), the London Commodity Exchange (cocoa, coffee, copra,
hides and skins, rubber and sugar), the London Wool Exchange, the London
Metal Exchange, the Liverpool Cotton Exchange and the Liverpool Corn
Exchange. These markets not only cater for the import of goods for home
consumption but do much business in effecting transactions between buyers
and sellers in other countries. In addition to these formal markets, there is
scarcely any product which cannot be traded through an intermediary in the
United Kingdom. For example, London is the world’s most important
philatelic market and also the leading international centre for the sale of works
of art.
The Foreign
Exchange
Market
The Foreign Exchange Market is subject to United Kingdom exchange
control regulations governing the purchase and sale of foreign currencies in
the sterling area, but these regulations have been progressively relaxed in
recent years. The turnover of the market has increased materially since the
introduction in December 1958 of external convertibility for the principal
European currencies.
The market consists of about 130 authorised banks and nine firms of
brokers, all linked together by telephone in the United Kingdom, and by
telephone, telex and cable with overseas centres.
The London
Gold Market
The London Gold Market, which had remained closed from the outbreak
of war in 1939, was reopened in March 1954, under the general supervision
of the Bank of England. It has regained its pre-war position as the leading
centre for dealings in gold, handling the major part of the gold coming on to
the free markets of the world. All authorised banks may deal in gold but,
in practice, dealings are largely concentrated in the hands of the five members
of the gold market plus one or two others. Membership of the market confers
the right to be present at the daily price-fixing when the official London gold
price is settled.
An important development was the setting up of a gold pool, initiated
in i960 to co-ordinate the gold operations in London of certain European
central banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The pool consists of
a selling consortium, which is not in operation all the time but may be invoked,
to stabilise the market, when conditions demand, and a buying syndicate,

The Sterling
System
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
As a result of Britain’s early lead in international trade and finance, several
countries tended not only to use sterling as their natural currency for inter¬
national transactions, but also to maintain central currency reserves in
Britain. When Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931 these countries,
which came to be known as the ‘sterling bloc’ and later as the ‘sterling area’,
did likewise, and pegged their currency exchange rates to the pound sterling.
In 1939, after the outbreak of war, the pound sterling was no longer freely
convertible into other currencies and the sterling area became more formally
defined as a currency area for exchange control purposes. The United
Kingdom imposes no exchange control on transactions with residents of
other sterling area countries.
All the Commonwealth countries (except Canada and Rhodesia), together
with Burma, Iceland, the Irish Republic, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, the Republic
of South Africa, South West Africa, the British protected States in the Persian
Gulf, and Western Samoa are members of the sterling area. These countries
contain one-quarter of the world’s population and account for one-quarter of
the world’s trade. The main feature of the sterling area is that the greater part
of the overseas trade of member countries is financed in sterling; they keep
their foreign reserves largely in the form of sterling and generally maintain
a fixed relationship between their currencies and sterling. Member countries
for the most part sell their foreign currency earnings in London in exchange
for sterling and can purchase for sterling the foreign currency they require.
They generally also sell gold in the London market for sterling. The United
Kingdom reserves of gold and foreign currencies are held in the Exchange
Equalisation Account, which buys and sells exchange in the market as appro¬
priate. All these currency arrangements are voluntary; there are no strict or
centralised rules of conduct.
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Estimates of the United Kingdom’s balance of payments are published
quarterly and provide a summary of the most important transactions with
other countries, classified by type of transaction and by area.
The transactions fall into three main groups^-current account, long-term
capital account and monetary movements. The balance on current account is
composed of the balance of visible trade (that is, the difference between mer¬
chandise imports and exports and re-exports) and the balance of invisibles.
On long-term capital account, the main groups of items are intergovernmental
loans (including amortisation) and other identified net long-term investment
abroad by United Kingdom residents, or in the United Kingdom by non¬
residents. The third heading, monetary movements, reflects in part the
United Kingdom’s position as an international banker. It includes identified
capital transactions not of a long-term character (for example, changes in
acceptances); changes in overseas sterling holdings and changes in the United
Kingdom reserves of gold and convertible currencies.
Britain has for long been a net exporter of capital. To support this outflow
and, in particular, to give financial assistance to developing countries, it needs
a surplus on current account. The country tends to import more than it exports
but its trade deficit has usually been more than offset by the surplus earned
on invisible transactions. Britain’s invisible earnings are now running at a lower
level than some ten years ago, so that expanding its exports and narrowing
the gap between imports and exports are aims of ever-increasing importance.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
409
Between 1945 and 1951 the balance of payments on current account
fluctuated widely. From 1952 to 1963 there were surpluses in each year
except in 1955, i960 and 1961. In 1964 there was a substantial deficit of
^406 million and a deficit of £136 million in 1965, made up of a greatly
increased surplus of £289 million in the current balance with the overseas
sterling area and a reduced deficit of £425 million in the balance with non¬
sterling area countries.
Private investment abroad (net of disinvestment) in 1965, at ^312 million,
was close to the average annual figure of the past decade and less than the
exceptionally high figure for 1964. Overseas private investment in Britain
(also net of disinvestment) has averaged around £200 million a year, so that
the net outflow of long-term capital on private account has averaged about
£100 million a year but with considerable fluctuations. In 1965 it was
£137 million. The net outflow of official capital has risen, reflecting mainly
expansion of the economic aid programme: in 1965 it was £81 million. The
net outflow of long-term capital in all forms, official and private, was £218
million in 1965, substantially less than in 1964; most of the reduction was
in private investment and this was greatly due to the tightening of exchange
controls by the Government.
Movements of capital, both short-term and long, may mean that changes
in the balance on current account are not necessarily reflected in the reserves
of gold and convertible currencies.
The general level of the reserves has not changed greatly since the early
1950s and has usually been in the region of £1,000 million. In 1964, when
there was a very large deficit in the balance of payments, they fell by £122
million. In 1965, however, they rose by £246 million because of official
external borrowing of £494 million, mostly from the IMF (see below). At
the end of the year the reserves amounted to £1,073 million of which
£809 million was in gold. Britain’s net external liabilities in sterling (excluding
liabilities to the IMF) amounted to £3,171 million at the end of 1965. Over
two-thirds of these were towards countries in the overseas sterling area.
Net external liabilities in non-sterling currencies amounted to £128 million.
Table 27 summarises Britain’s balance of payments from i960 to 1965.
In addition to its reserves of gold and convertible currencies, Britain has
drawing rights on the IMF based on its quota, which was raised to £696
million in 1959 and to £871 million in March 1966. Under its stand-by
arrangement with the IMF, made in August 1962 and renewed annually
since then, Britain drew $1,000 million (£357 million) in n different
currencies in December 1964. At the end of May 1965 $1,400 million
(^5°° million) was drawn and in March 1966 a further $123 million (£44
million). Britain has had recourse to the IMF on three previous occasions,
of which the most recent was in 1961 when $1,500 million was drawn. The
final instalment in repayment of this drawing was made at the end of July 1962.
Informal arrangements between the central banks of certain European
countries to hold each other’s currencies, together with the gold pool (see
P- 4°7)> provide further means of safeguarding the position of sterling.
In November 1964 the Bank of England arranged for $3,000 million to be
made available for the support of sterling from eleven central banks, including
those of the United States, Canada and Japan, as well as the Bank for
International Settlements and the US Export-Import Bank. The short-term
assistance of £392 million outstanding under this facility was repaid in
May 1965, but the swap facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York was reconstituted at the figure of $750 million, to which it had been

raised in November, and the Export-Import Bank facility remained available
at the level of $250 million.
An additional line of reserves is provided by the dollar securities held by
the Exchange Equalisation Account. Their value had risen to around $1,400
million (£500 million) by February 1966 when part of the portfolio (£316
million) was transferred to the gold and convertible currency reserves.
In December 1965 the Bank of England published estimates1 of Britain’s
external capital assets and liabilities at the end of 1964, but it was emphasised
that the various elements were fundamentally different in kind and were
subject to different methods of valuation. But two main features of Britain s
international capital position continued to stand out. One was the heavy net
long-term indebtedness of the United Kingdom Government to overseas
Governments, which amounted to £1,334 million, although this figure
represents a reduction of £199 million compared with the 1962 estimate.
In marked contrast to this heavy official long-term debt stood the much
larger net long-term overseas assets of the private sector, which amounted in
aggregate to about £6,000 million representing an improvement over 1962 of
about £1,000 million. It is estimated that by the end of 1964 the gross long¬
term assets of the private sector were approaching £10,000 million, of which
direct investment, including oil, accounted for some £6,000 million (at book
value) and portfolio investment for under £4,000 million (at current market
prices).

Investment
in Britain:
Incoming
411
Britain’s official long-term liabilities have mostly arisen from the second world
war and its aftermath. At the end of 1964 about ^2,500 million was still out¬
standing, of which ^1,849 million was owed to other Governments, the greater
part to the United States and Canada.
The largest item among official external long-term claims is British
Government aid in the form of loans (see p. 413).
Overseas investors in Britain are allowed to repatriate the proceeds of the
sale of their direct investments, including any capital gains that may have
accrued, provided that the investment was made after 1st January 1950.
Earned profits and dividends can be transferred, irrespective of the amount;
transfers of this kind have never been restricted.
Overseas long-term investment in the private sector of the British economy
has increased substantially since the war. According to the Bank of England
estimates the market value of overseas portfolio holdings of British company
securities at the end of 1964 was of the order of £760 million. The book
value of net assets held in Britain (that is, overseas direct investment) by
companies incorporated abroad (except banks, oil and insurance companies)
was about ,£1,850 million, and the approximate book value of the net assets
of United States and European oil companies was some £750 million.
By far the largest proportion of private investment by overseas countries
in Britain is made by United States firms. It has been provisionally estimated1
that the total value of United States direct investments in Britain amounted to
$4.55° million (£1,625 million) at the end of 1964, compared with $847
million (£303 million) in 1951. Just under two-thirds of these investments
were in manufacturing and rather less than a quarter in petroleum; most of the
remainder were in trade and other enterprises.
Private
Investment:
Outgoing
Private investment abroad may take several forms: portfolio investment,
including the raising of loans on the London capital market; or direct invest¬
ment by the establishment of subsidiary companies, by the ploughing back of
profits earned overseas and participation, jointly with domestic capital, in
enterprises overseas.
Apart from the voluntary programme introduced early in 1966 aimed at
curtailing British investment in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and
the Irish Republic, the United Kingdom imposes no restriction on investment
in the sterling area by United Kingdom residents and about 50 per cent of
Britain’s total supply of private long-term capital abroad and 60 per cent of
its direct investment goes to sterling area countries. Direct investment is
frequently made from a firm’s existing resources. However, borrowers outside
the United Kingdom must normally obtain the consent of the Treasury (which
is advised by the Capital Issues Committee) if the amount borrowed exceeds
£50,000 in any one year. Borrowing by Commonwealth and Colonial
Governments in the London capital market has fallen in recent years, but
averaged about £50 million a year in the 1950s. The market’s facilities have
been made available to the member governments of EFT A. Finance is also made
available by the Commonwealth Development Finance Company (see p. 389).
Investment outside the sterling area is subject to Exchange Control
regulations. Broadly speaking, direct investment is not permitted unless it
promises benefit to the United Kingdom balance of payments in the short-term.
1 United States Department of Commerce’s Survey of Current Business, September
1965.
412
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain’s private long-term capital assets abroad include portfolio invest¬
ments which, at the end of 1964, had a total estimated market value of some
^3,600 million.
In addition, there are direct British investments abroad. Bank of England
estimates indicate that their book value, relating to all companies except oil,
insurance and banking, was worth about ^4,100 million at the end of 1964.
The approximate book value of oil companies’ assets at the end of 1964 was
some ^1,300 million. The total value of the overseas interest of British
insurance companies is not known but again according to estimates, the value
of direct investments by these companies at the end of i960 in the United
States alone amounted to about 3^420 million. The British insurance industry
also operates extensively in other foreign countries and throughout the
Commonwealth. The annual survey by the Board of Trade estimated that the
flow of private direct investment abroad by United Kingdom companies
(excluding oil) was about ^272 million in 1965; in 1964, 58 per cent was
directed to the sterling area, some 16 per cent to North America and about
17 per cent to Western Europe. The figures include long-term and short-term
investment and reinvested profits.
Official
External
Assets
Owing to the increase in recent years in British Government aid to developing
countries, inter-governmental loans form the largest item among official
external long-term claims. The total of such loans outstanding at the end of
1964 was 3^515 million and included ^380 million in loans to governments of
overseas sterling area countries. New Government loans (less repayments)
totalled j£n8 million in 1963-64. Amounts owed by countries outside the
sterling area are mostly in respect of advances by the British Government in
the second world war. Other official lending, which amounted to ^149 million
at the end of 1964, includes investments of the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (see below) and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
In addition, there are the official subscriptions to, and shareholdings in,
international financial organisations (see below) and the British Government’s
holdings of non-sterling securities. The Government also owns real estate
overseas, such as embassy buildings and military installations.
UNITED
KINGDOM
GOVERNMENT
AID FOR
DEVELOPMENT
Loans and grants to the less-developed countries for economic development,
technical assistance, budget support and emergency relief from the United
Kingdom since 1951 have amounted to ,£1,636 million and in the four years
1962-65 averaged ,£179 million a year (see Table 28). Since the end of the
1950s Britain’s aid programme, which initially was directed mainly to
dependent territories in the Commonwealth, has become world-wide in scope.
In 1965 its cost amounted to nearly ,£200 million. The department responsible
is the Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM, see p. 55).
This assistance takes two forms: financial aid (both grants and loans) and
technical assistance arranged directly with the country receiving help (bilateral
assistance); and contributions to international bodies (multilateral assistance).
In 1965 bilateral assistance totalled ,£ 177-1 million and multilateral assistance
was ,£18-6 million. Bilateral technical assistance accounted for j£3i-7 million,
being nearly twice as much as it was in 1961. The target figure for Britain’s
total expenditure on aid in the financial year 1966-67 is ,£225 million. Most
of Britain’s bilateral financial aid goes to Commonwealth countries.
The terms of aid have been progressively softened over the last few years.
A substantial amount has always been provided in the form of grants. Since
1958 the maturity period of development loans has lengthened from a norm

of 15 years to one of 25 years. Grace periods on the repayment of capital
during periods extending up to the first seven years of the life of the loan have
been granted on a widening scale. In 1963 the Government announced its
readiness to grant waivers for periods of up to seven years of the interest
payable on loans by countries whose position justified such a concession. In
some cases this has reduced the effective rate of interest payable over the life
of the loan by nearly half, compared with the normal rate (which is based on
that at which the Government can itself borrow plus a small management
charge). In June 1965 the Minister of Overseas Development announced that
development loans would be made free of interest to certain developing
countries. By June 1966 interest free loan agreements had been signed with
nine countries to a total value of over £70 million.
Until the formation of the Ministry of Overseas Development in 1964,
development loans to independent Commonwealth and foreign countries
were made mainly under the Export Guarantees Acts 1949-1964. New
development loans are now being made by the ODM which also administers
loans to dependent territories under the Colonial Development and Welfare
Acts.

Loans under
Export
Guarantees
Acts
Loans under the Export Guarantees Acts are used for the purchase of goods,
equipment and services from Britain and are administered by the Export
Credits Guarantee Department. They usually have borne a rate of interest
equal to the British Government’s borrowing rate plus -25 per cent. (In 1965
this was reduced on new loans to -125 per cent.)
From 1949 to June 1966 agreements with a total value of over £446 million
had been made, of which all but eight had been made since mid-1958.
The total includes 30 loans to India amounting to ^240-5 million, 12 to
Pakistan to a value of ^64-1 million, seven to Yugoslavia totalling £24-6
million, eight to Turkey amounting to £16-9 million and six to Nigeria

valued at £32-8 million. For the more recent loans, repayment periods are
up to 25 years. In most cases there is a grace period before repayments begin,
and in some a waiver of interest for up to the first seven years. During
1965 agreements to the value of £24-9 million were concluded. These loans
are a declining sector of the aid programme, as a greater proportion of loans
are being negotiated by the ODM, including all those on interest-free terms
and financed from departmental Votes.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) (formerly the Colonial
Development Corporation), which is financed from Exchequer funds,
provides capital for development projects in Commonwealth countries. Up
to the end of 1965, the CDC had capital commitments totalling ^133 million,
of which two-thirds were in Africa.
The CDC is empowered to undertake schemes in British dependent
territories and in independent Commonwealth countries in which it operated
before independence.
The Colonial Development and Welfare Acts and the Commonwealth
Development Act are the principal machinery for providing assistance for
development in Britain’s dependent territories: £390 million in grants and
.£125 million in loans have been made available for the period 1946-70. By the
end of the 1965-66 financial year £85 million had been disbursed.
About one-fifth of Britain’s governmental aid contribution is directed to
technical co-operation efforts. Under the Colombo Plan for Co-operative
Economic Development in South and South-East Asia it provided nearly
£7 million in the three years to the end of 1965 for technical assistance, and
about 6,450 people have come to Britain for training under the plan since 1959.
(The United Kingdom’s total economic aid to the area from the beginning of
the Colombo Plan in 1951 to the end of December 1965 amounted to £336-4
million.)
Technical assistance is an important element in the Special Commonwealth
African Assistance Plan (SCAAP); the largest item in the estimated expendi¬
ture for 1965-66 of the ODM on grants and services connected with bilateral
overseas aid was £34 million to the SCAAP. British technical assistance
contributions include technical services, educational and training facilities in
Britain, the provision of specialist advisers, equipment and surveys. In
addition there are contributions for teachers sent to the region under the
Commonwealth Educational Co-operation Scheme. During the academic
year 1964-65 some 68,500 students and trainees from overseas were studying
in Britain, about 52,000 from developing countries. Under the Overseas
Service Aid Scheme overseas Governments can retain the services of trained
and experienced staff (numbering over 10,000 at the end of 1965) until they
can be replaced by local people.
Arrangements are also made for supplying technical assistance under the
Central Treaty Organisation and the South East Asia Treaty Organisation.
Britain’s subscription to the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and its two affiliated organisations, the International
Finance Corporation and the International Development Association (IDA)
is the second largest of any country. Britain’s contribution of £47 million to
IDA is being increased by a further £35 million over the three years 1965-67.
Britain’s contribution in 1966 to the United Nations Development Programme
amounted to £4-5 million.
TRADE AND PAYMENTS
415
WHOLESALE
TRADES
INTERNAL TRADE
The internal trade of the United Kingdom can be divided into two broad
categories: trade in raw materials, capital goods and intermediate products
(for example, vehicle components) and trade in consumer goods, involving
the network of distributive trades by which home produced or imported
goods reach the consumer. (The pattern of consumers’ expenditure is outlined
in Chapter 10, The National Economy.)
There have been a number of official statistical inquiries into the distributive
trades. Most recently, during 1963 and 1964, the results of a full Census
of Distribution for 1961 were published by the Board of Trade, covering the
retail and (related) service trades in Great Britain. This census was only the
second of its kind undertaken in Britain; the first, covering also the wholesale
trades, related to I950, A sample inquiry, however, was conducted by the
Board of Trade into the retail and service trades in 1957 and a full-scale
inquiry into the wholesale trade for 1959. Sample monthly and annual
inquiries are also undertaken, covering a few aspects of the distributive
trades; for instance, turnover, stocks and capital expenditure. The first
census of retail distribution and other services to be taken in Northern
Ireland relates to 1965.
Only a proportion of the trade in consumer goods passes through whole¬
salers . sales are also made to consumers through producers’ own selling
organisations (including their own retail outlets and mail order business);
and other sales are made directly by producers to retailers. Wholesale channels
are particularly in evidence in the distribution of textiles, agricultural produce
and foodstuffs. The inquiry made by the Board of Trade in respect of 1959
showed that out of a total of 19,000 business units engaged in wholesale
distribution in Great Britain, over 3,000 dealt in clothing, footwear and
textiles, 2,000 in grocery and provisions, 2,000 in vegetables and fruit, and
over 3,000 in other food and in drink. In addition, there were 8,000 dealers
(wholesale or retail) in coal, builders’ materials, grain or agricultural supplies,
and 7,000 dealers in other industrial materials and machinery. The value of
stocks held by wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1965 is estimated at £2,000
million; expenditure on capital assets during the year was about £165 million.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchan¬
dise handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers
(who sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or, in some
cases, direct to retailers, but fruit and vegetables may be sold by growers to
commission agents (who dispose of the produce either to wholesalers or
direct to retailers) or the grower may deal only with wholesale firms. The sale
of some agricultural products is regulated by statutory marketing boards
(see p. 322).
London’s wholesale markets are of outstanding importance in the
distribution of foodstuffs, particularly imported supplies. Covent Garden
handles about i-2 million tons of fruit and vegetables each year; nearly
8,000 tons of meat pass through Smithfield market each week; Billingsgate
is the principal distributing centre in Britain for fish. Other markets in
London include those at Leadenhall (poultry) and Spitalfields (fruit and
vegetables).
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
societies, the two largest being the Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd.
(CWS) and the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd. (SCWS) to serve

the needs of retail societies, membership being restricted to incorporated
co-operative organisations. The CWS had sales of ^488 million in 1964 and
the SCWS had sales of £92 million.
Two kinds of voluntary wholesale chains have developed in recent years
particularly in the food trades. Firstly, local retailers’ buying groups were
formed and later (since 1954) wholesaler-sponsored voluntary chains (groups of
independent traders linked to a wholesaler or a group of wholesalers). Both
kinds benefit from the lower operating costs of large-scale trading without
losing their independence and both are numerically of roughly equal impor¬
tance. The 1961 Census of Distribution showed that about 27 per cent (or
40 per cent in terms of turnover) of smaller grocers—mostly medium-sized
independents and small multiples with not more than nine branches—belonged
to these chains.
Retail businesses in Britain may be classified under three main headings:
(1) multiple traders, that is, organisations other than co-operative societies
with ten or more branches; (2) retail co-operative societies (see p. 417); and
(3) independent retail businesses, including for this purpose the small multiple
stores (that is, chains of stores with nine or fewer branches). Businesses in each
of these categories may own department stores. Other retail outlets include
gas and electricity showrooms owned by the area gas and electricity boards
and mail order businesses (see p. 420). Table 29 shows the number of estab¬
lishments and turnover for some of the main groups of retail business between
1957 and 1965.

A very wide range is covered in the size of retailing establishments. On
the one hand there were ten shops (nine of them department stores) with
sales in 1961 exceeding £$ million or having takings of more than £2,000 an
hour; at the other extreme there were more than 70,000 establishments taking
less than £2,000 in a year. Some of these are market and street traders, whose
volume of business may be very small.
The 1961 census showed that, in comparison with 1957, a larger volume of
trade had been handled by almost exactly the same number of shops and by
much the same number of people. A notable feature was the continued
expansion of the large multiple firms; these showed a further increase between

1961 and 1964 relative to other types of shops. Independent shops, however,
still account for half of Britain’s retail trade.
According to the Census of Distribution there were nearly 70,000 shops
owned by multiples (including multiple departmental stores) in 1961, having
a total turnover of £2,580 million. This form of organisation showed the
largest rise in numbers between 1957 and 1961 and their share in total sales
went up from 25 per cent to 29 per cent. In the food trades their turnover
increased by 42 per cent, compared with 11 per cent for independent retailers
and only 3 per cent for co-operative societies. Large traders of all kinds
(including co-operative societies) accounted for nearly 50 per cent of sales
in food shops as a whole and for 64 per cent of the sales of all clothing shops.
The number of co-operative stores increased slightly between 1957 and 1961
but their share in total retail trade dropped from 12 to n per cent. They
account for a fifth of the turnover of all grocers and a third of the turnover of
all dairymen.
The retail co-operative societies are voluntary non-profit-making organisations
engaged in retail trade and controlled by their members, who are also their
customers. Any operating surplus is returned periodically to members as a
dividend; the amount distributed is proportionate to the value of the member’s
purchases.
Retail co-operatives also sell to the general public, but membership is open
to anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum share, which entitles the
member to an equal voice with other members in determining the policy of
the society. Investment by individual members is limited to £1,000 (less in
some societies). Only a low rate of interest is paid on the shares.
At the end of 1965 there were 804 retail co-operative societies registered
under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act. Amalgamations are slowly
diminishing the number of societies (the total in 1958 was 1,015). By far the
largest single society in Britain is the London Co-operative Society with just
under 1-3 million members and a turnover of over £50 million a year. Total
sales of the retail co-operative societies in 1964 reached nearly £1,070 million
(this figure includes certain activities not covered by the Census of Distribution
figure in Table 29). The approximate average rate of dividend paid to members
in 1964 was 9d. in the £.
Smaller independent shops have been giving ground only slowly in the face
of increased competition from the larger undertakings. The proprietors of
many of the smaller shops often have other means of livelihood. Average
turnover per shop has continued to increase, though by less than for the retail
trade as a whole. None the less, allowing for a 4 per cent increase in prices,
the average small independent shop sold more goods in 1961 than in 1957!
There were nearly 800 department stores in Britain in 1961, having a turnover
of nearly £550 million—about 6 per cent of the total turnover of all retail
establishments. Department stores were defined for the purposes of the 1961
census as having 25 or more persons engaged in selling clothing and at least
four other major commodity groups. Women’s, girls’ and infants’ wear,
haberdashery and other drapery were the most important categories of goods
sold, accounting for over a third of turnover. A firm or a group of firms
frequently owns several department stores. Three groups of this kind owned
145 stores in 1961 and co-operative societies owned a further 210 stores. In
1961 there were 53 stores each with a turnover above £2 million, accounting
for nearly 40 per cent of the turnover in this kind of business.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Out of a total of over 580,000 establishments recorded by the 1961 Census
of Distribution, and shown in Table 30, grocery and other food retailing
groups numbered over 278,000 establishments, and the clothing and foot¬
wear group over 92,000.
Though the total value of retail trade in Great Britain (exclusive of elec¬
tricity and gas showrooms and mail order business) rose by 18 per cent between
1957 and 1961, rates of growth varied appreciably between different types of
trade. The slowest growth between 1957 and 1961 was in the food, drink and
tobacco sector and in clothing and footwear, and in the category including
booksellers and stationers; this trend seems to be continuing. The fastest
growth in specialised shops between 1957 and 1961 was in furniture, general
household goods (other than furniture) and chemists’ and photographic
goods, but the pace has apparently slackened since 1961. Gas and electricity
showrooms’ business has been buoyant since 1957* their combined turnover,
however, is relatively small, amounting in 1961 to slightly more than j£ioo
million.
The aggregate number of shops in Great Britain decreased slightly between
1957 and 1961. There were modest decreases in shops selling groceries,
clothing and footwear, and in the booksellers and stationers group, and a
noticeable fall in the number of confectioners, tobacconists and newsagents.
The highest proportionate increase was in the number of general household
goods shops.

In Northern Ireland, it is estimated that the value of retail sales increased
by 6 per cent in 1965, as they did in 1964, after rising 4 per cent in 1963.
Retail prices, which had previously been rising for some years until 1958, were
relatively stable in 1959 and i960, but again moved upwards between 1961
and 1965" The rise was relatively large in 1964 on account of higher import
prices and increased taxes.
The development of self-service in retail establishments since 1950 has
probably contributed to the notable expansion in sales achieved by the
multiple stores. According to the 1961 Census of Distribution, self-service
sales exceeded ^525 million, two and a half times the level of 1957, and the
average turnover in fully self-service grocery shops was over £,55,000
compared with £13,000 in other grocery shops. About 9,500 stores, of which
9,100 were grocers, were operated wholly or partly on self-service lines
towards the end of 1961, compared with 4,000 in 1957, less than 500 in
1950 and 10 in 1947. By the end of 1964 it is estimated that there were
probably over 16,000 and the number was growing at a rate exceeding 100 a
month.
Supermarkets may be defined as self-service shops with a minimum selling
area of 2,000 square feet and having three or more check-out points. There
were about 750 supermarkets in 1961, according to the Census of Distribution,
of which 506 were owned by multiples, 203 by co-operative societies and
40 to 50 independents. It has been estimated that by the end of 1965 about
2,200 had been opened.
New forms of automatic vending machines have come to the fore since
and an increasing number of coin-operated machines are being installed
in factories and commercial premises as well as in normal retail outlets. The
range of goods sold is widening; in addition to the traditional cigarettes,
sweets and stamps there are now machines selling hot and cold beverages |
prepared foodstuffs, stockings, paper-back books and other commodities
including coal and various solid fuels. Various estimates have been made of
the trade done through automatic machines; about 300,000 machines are in
use, and total sales may be of the order of £20 million to £25 million a
year. Traders who owned and operated automatic vending machines, but were
not otherwise engaged in retail trade, had sales of over £4 million in 1961.
Some 11,700 mobile shops1 were reported in the Census of Distribution for
1961, with sales amounting to £93 million. Nearly a quarter of this turnover
was concentrated in Scotland (where the density of population is lower than
in England) compared with a tenth of all retail sales. Co-operative societies
accounted for 39 per cent of sales through mobile food shops, against 17 per
cent in ordinary food shops. For the most part, mobile shops were concerned
with food sales; about 42 per cent were travelling grocers, and over 28 per
cent and 21 per cent respectively were greengrocers and butchers. Only a
very small proportion (about 6 per cent) were non-food shops, and these
specialised mainly in paraffin supplies and hardware.
Stamp trading—the practice of giving stamps in proportion to the value of
goods sold, which may be exchanged later for a ‘free gift’—has expanded
rapidly in recent years. There are, however, signs that the rate of growth is
levelling off. According to an unofficial estimate made in 1964 they are saved,
on average, by about 36 in every 100 women in Britain, with a possibly
1 Excluding roundsmen and vans selling ice-cream.

higher proportion in the London area, and are given by some 50,000 retail
outlets, the majority of which are food shops and petrol stations. The two
largest stamp companies in Britain claim about 90 per cent of the business,
the rest being shared among a number of small companies. Issuers of stamps
are required by law to mark them with their cash value and redeem them in
cash if so requested. Gifts distributed by the companies had a retail value of
about £8 million in 1965.
A facility which is being extended in Britain is the ‘credit card’. Users are
issued with a card on production of which their signature is accepted on
bills in participating shops, hotels and restaurants. The issuers then meet
the bills and recover from the card-holder through a single account presented
periodically. Normally users are required to pay a regular subscription as
well.
Mail order trading has been one of the most rapidly growing forms of selling
in Britain in recent years, especially in the north of England. Mail order
sales through all channels reached £276 million in 1961. The 1961 Census of
Distribution showed that the sales of specialist retail mail order businesses
had risen from £126 million in 1957 to £227 million in 1961, a rise of 80 per
cent; they showed a further increase of 65 per cent between 1961 and 1965.
Mail order sales in 1961 by large retailers amounted to £12 million, by
manufacturers to £34 million and by wholesalers to £4 million.
An inquiry conducted by the Board of Trade showed that sales by manu¬
facturers direct to the public totalled ^144 million in 1961, compared with
£70 million in 1950. Mail order sales accounted for 24 per cent of the former
total, sales to employees for 11 per cent, and charges for work done for 9 per
cent. Other direct sales, including sales by door-to-door salesmen, accounted
for the balance. Included in these sales were items as various as carpets,
washing machines, brushes, books and soft drinks.
Closely connected with the distributive trades are those trades which offer a
service directly to the public, notably the catering and hotel trades, laundries
and dry cleaners, the garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and boot
and shoe repairers.
An inquiry undertaken by the Board of Trade relating to 1964 showed
that there were 151,000 establishments primarily concerned with catering
(defined to cover public houses, canteens, and fish and chip shops, as well as
licensed hotels and restaurants, etc.) with a total turnover in that year of
£2,036 million. Hotels and holiday camps (excluding boarding houses and
unlicensed hotels) had receipts of about £286 million, of which £124 million
was from residential accommodation. Nearly half the total turnover of the
catering trades was from the sale of alcoholic drinks.
There were about 1,400 commercial laundry businesses with an annual
turnover of about £67 million in 1961. Between 1961 and 1965 turnover
increased by 19 per cent. Dry cleaning firms in 1961 had a turnover of £40
million which increased by 23 per cent between 1961 and 1965.
An inquiry undertaken by the Board of Trade for 1962 showed that there were
nearly 47,000 businesses in the motor trades in Britain, with nearly 58,000
establishments. Their total turnover amounted to £2,962 million, including
transactions between traders amounting to roughly £6oo-£8oo million.
Traders classified as new vehicle dealers had nearly 14,700 establishments

and accounted for two-thirds of the total turnover. Over 14,000 establishments
were classified as being primarily petrol stations, and 12,600 were also general
repairers.
Takings in hairdressing establishments increased very rapidly between 1950
(^3^ million) and 1961 (£97 million). They rose again between 1961 and 1965
by another 12 per cent. There are about 40,000 hairdressing establishments.
There are some 10,000 establishments specialising in boot and shoe repairs
(excluding repairs handled through footwear shops); they had takings of £25
million in 1961, representing a steady increase since 1950.
Other establishments found in shopping areas and offering a service to the
public include launderettes (over 1,000 businesses were running launderettes
in 1961), licensed betting offices (over 15,000 in 1964) and over 3,500 funeral
director businesses.
The annual expenditure of British industry on packaging was estimated in
I9^5 by the Institute of Packaging at over ^650 million. The expansion of
self-service shops, the growth of sales in the form of branded and standardised
products, and developments in partly prepared foods, for example, ready-
washed vegetables and ready-made cake mixes, have been major factors in
the great changes which have taken place in packaging methods. Paper
packaging, including cartons and boxes, remains the most extensively used
with a turnover of £275 million a year. New uses are being found for tinplate
(output, £110 million a year), especially in sales of soft drinks and beer.
Sales of glass containers reached a new peak in 1964 at 5,000 million units.
The turnover of plastic packaging has shown the greatest rate of growth,
rising from an insignificant level to over ^30 million a year in the last decade;
new uses include crates for milk, sachets for liquids and bottles for detergents'.
Aerosol dispensers, almost unknown ten years ago, were being produced at a
rate of over 128 million a year in 1965, compared with 28 million in 1959.
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such
as cars, furniture, washing machines, television sets, refrigerators and cookers,
has been greatly helped by instalment purchase. Hire-purchase debt out¬
standing amounted to ^1,189 million at the end of April 1966.1 Of this, about
two-thirds was owed to finance companies and the remainder to durable goods
shops and department stores. There are a large number of hire-purchase
finance companies but a high proportion of the business is done by a small
number which operate on a national scale.
The Board of Trade has powers to regulate the terms of hire-purchase and
credit sales agreements in order to restrain the expansion of consumer credit.
The current terms are: a minimum deposit of 33J per cent on most durable
consumer goods except cars and motor cycles (40 per cent), mattresses and
furniture (20 per cent) and cookers and water-heaters (10 per cent). There is
usually a maximum repayment period of 24 months for most goods except
cookers and water-heaters (48 months).
Hire-purchase in Northern Ireland directly financed by the major finance
houses operating from offices in Northern Ireland amounted in 1965 to over
£i5 million and at the end of 1965 the hire-purchase debt owed to them
amounted to £15^ million.
1 Not included in this total is the debt of £171 million outstanding to certain other
instalment credit retailers.

Public Relations
About £590 million is estimated to have been spent on all forms of advertising
in 1965. About £281 million was expended on press advertising and £107
million (including tax) was spent on television advertising. The remainder
was divided between other media, such as posters, films, catalogues, window
displays, exhibitions, and free samples and gift schemes. Most of the advertis¬
ing is carried out by advertising agencies, which, in some cases, also provide
marketing, consumer research and other services; their representative
organisation is the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. The trade associa¬
tion for the industry as a whole, including agencies, advertisers and owners of
advertising media, is the Advertising Association. It was responsible for the
setting up of the Advertising Standards Authority, an independent body whose
objective is the promotion and enforcement of the highest standards of
advertising, in particular through the British Code of Advertising Practice.
Industry and commerce have in recent years paid increasing attention to
improving public understanding of their work and objectives. Public relations
consultancy firms and the public relations departments of advertising agencies
provide general services, apart from the increasing employment by industrial
organisations and trade associations of staff specialists in public relations.
Their professional body, founded in 1948, is the Institute of Public Relations:
not only commerce and industry, but the professions, national associations,
central and local government are represented within the Institute.
Consumer
Protection
The Consumer
Council
Various legislative measures exist in the United Kingdom to protect the
consumer against specific abuses. Non-statutory organisations also exist to
further the consumer’s interest. Weights and measures legislation, one of
the earliest forms of consumer protection, was brought up to date and
extended in scope by the Weights and Measures Act 1963; it is strictly
enforced by qualified inspectors of local weights and measures authorities.
The Merchandise Marks Acts 1887-1953 are designed to ensure that the
marking of goods is both accurate and honest. The purity, hygiene and
description of food are controlled by the Food and Drugs Acts 1955, 1956
and 1958. The Consumer Protection Act 1961 gives the Home Office power
to make regulations to ensure the safety of any class of goods.
The Hire-Purchase Act 1965 and the Hire-Purchase (Scotland) Act 1965
provide safeguards to the consumer who buys goods on hire-purchase or
credit sale terms. The protection extends to agreements up to ,£2,000
although most of the safeguards do not apply to credit sale agreements for
less than ^30. Similar legislation has been in operation in Northern Ireland
since 1st July 1966. As a precaution against fraud, virtually every hire-
purchase agreement on a car is registered with H.P. Information Ltd., a
non-profit-making company whose members are car dealers or finance
companies concerned with car sales; dealers and finance houses can check
with it in confidence.
The British Standards Institution (see p. 261) has established a number of
standards for consumer goods, and the Council of Industrial Design (see
p. 218) helps to foster improvements in the design of consumer goods.
The Consumer Council, financed by a grant-in-aid from the Board of Trade,
was set up in 1963 to concern itself with and promote the consumer’s interests.
Within the limits of its finance and terms of reference it is fully independent
and so is free to criticise government departments and to bring pressure to
bear on other bodies. It is specifically debarred from engaging in comparative
testing of products, from law enforcement action and from taking up

complaints on behalf of individual consumers. It works in close touch with
the Citizens’ Advice Bureaux (see p. 126).
Advice to its members on the merits of consumer goods is provided by the
Consumers Association (CA), a private body financed by the subscriptions of
members. It arranges tests and makes reports on the quality of goods bought
on the open market and its findings are published in its monthly bulletin
Which ?, issued to subscribers. The Research Institute for Consumer Affairs,
established with a grant from the CA, undertakes research into consumer
goods and services, and publishes reports. There are also a number of local
independent consumer groups, which in 1963 formed themselves into a
national Federation of Consumer Groups. Assistance with certain aspects
of consumer guidance is also given by a number of other private bodies and by
certain government departments. Individual trades and industries have also
taken measures to raise standards of quality.
The practice of resale price maintenance and its enforcement by the cutting
off of supplies was made unlawful under the Resale Prices Act 1964, though
exemptions may be granted on certain grounds by the Restrictive Practices
Court (see p. 262).

Associations
Formation of
Ministry of
Labour
Less than 200 years ago, government concern with all aspects of employment
was at a minimum. It was generally considered that it was not a function
of government to ‘interfere’ between employers and employed, and that the
unregulated pursuit of self-interest would of itself produce the best results
for both parties and for the community. The statutes passed in medieval
and Tudor times to regulate the level of wages and the training of craftsmen
were no longer applied, and it was a matter of principle that the new industrial
development based on the introduction of power-driven machinery and the
factory system should proceed without hindrance from any restriction on
the conditions under which workers were employed in the mills and mines.
Even associations of workmen seeking by joint action to improve their situation
were forbidden as a threat to civil peace and individual liberty.
State intervention came first in the sphere of safety, health and welfare. By
the end of the eighteenth century, a reaction had begun in favour of legislation
to protect the workers, especially little children, from excessive toil and
hardship, and the reformers became strong enough to secure the passage of
the first factory legislation in 1802. The first effective Factory Act was that
of 1833 which not only limited the hours of work for children but set up a
national system of inspection to enforce its provisions. Since that date,
legislation extending, strengthening, adapting and consolidating the statutory
protection for employees had been passed at an accelerating rate. (The record
of legislation providing for monetary recompense for industrial injury or
death is part of the history of social security.)
Trade unions ceased in 1824 to be ‘actionable conspiracies in restraint of
trade’, but their activities were still closely circumscribed and they had no
proper legal status, while their development met strong opposition. However,
during the nineteenth century new unions of skilled and semi-skilled workers
grew up, more soundly organised and more acceptable to the public because
their ambitions were more restricted. A number of employers’ associations,
mainly local, were formed during this time, unions and employers learned to
bargain together, and procedures for conciliation and arbitration began to
be agreed. Following the recommendations of a Royal Commission, legisla¬
tion was passed in the 1870s clarifying and regularising the legal status of
trade unions. Today it is customary for employers’ associations and trade
unions to be statutorily provided with representation on advisory committees
and administrative tribunals concerned with labour questions. For workers
in trades with weak organisation, which were unable to secure and enforce
minimum standards of remuneration, the Trade Boards Act 1909 introduced
for the first time in the modern era a state-sponsored machinery to determine
and enforce minimum rates of wages.
In the following year, 1910, the first employment exchanges were introduced.
This move represented the defeat of the concept that unemployed people
were so through unwillingness rather than inability to find work. The
LABOUR
425
employment exchanges provided a nation-wide service for putting employers
in touch with workers and vice versa. In 1917 the exchanges were transferred
to the newly created Ministry of Labour. (The factory inspectorate was
added to its responsibilities in 1940.) This department is today the principal
instrument of the government’s labour policies in Great Britain; in Northern
Ireland employment matters are among the responsibilities of the Ministry
of Health and Social Services. The range of services has extended to take in
special help to particular groups, such as disabled and young people, the
provision and promotion of training, measures to foster good industrial
relations and good personnel management practices, and the administration
or supervision of schemes to give financial benefits to the unemployed, the
migrant worker, the redundant and those in training.
The experience of mass unemployment between the two world wars led
to a new appreciation of the role the government could and should play in
securing for the people the opportunity to work; the first legislation in Great
Britain dealing with structural unemployment was passed in 1934 and provided
inducements to industry to settle in areas of heavy unemployment; in 1944,
in Employment Policy, one of the policy statements issued about reconstruction
after the return of peace, the government committed itself to the aim of
maintaining full employment. Since then, governments in Britain have
accepted an even wider responsibility for securing, without interference
with individual liberty and freedom of choice, an adequate supply of manpower,
in the right numbers, with the right skills, in the right places, as part of its
total concern, in association and consultation with the representatives of
employers and employees, for the development of the whole economy,
nationally and regionally, through the best use of all resources natural and
human.
Growth in
Working
Population
MANPOWER
The total working population of Great Britain at the middle of June 1965
was about 25 million, some 48 per cent of the total population, and included
about 73 Per cent of persons of normal working age (15 years to 59 years for
women, 15 to 64 years for men). About 93 per cent of the men of working
age are today in or seeking gainful work. The remaining 7 per cent consist
mainly of those continuing their education, of the severely disabled and of
some persons of private means. The proportion of women of working age
in or seeking gainful work is much lower, about 50 per cent, as many
housewives either do not wish or cannot manage to take employment outside
the home. Besides those of normal working age, there are probably over a
million older men and women still at work. The great majority of the working
population work for a wage or salary, but 1-7 million are employers or self-
employed.
Northern Ireland, which has 27 per cent of the total population of the
United Kingdom, has 2-2 per cent of its working population. The ratio of
working to total population in Northern Ireland is about 40 per cent, and
farmers and small-holders working their own holdings account for about
one-tenth of the working population.
The rate of increase in the working population has been slackening in recent
years. The reasons include the tendency of more young people to spend
longer in full-time education, and the higher proportion of women who are
marrying, which increases the number who leave employment even if they

return later (generally after their children have grown up). About 54 per cent
of the women at work are married.
The growth of the working population in Great Britain over the last decade
is shown in Table 31. The raising of the minimum school-leaving age from
15 to 16 in 1970-71 is expected to cause a drop in the working population
in 1971-72. Among the requirements of the National Plan (see p. 242) is an
increase in manpower of 800,000 over the period 1964-70. The working
population is not expected to increase by as much as this during the period
even though successful development policies in the less-prosperous regions
will result in larger increases than might otherwise be expected. The ‘gap’
between demand and supply will have to be met by better deployment of
manpower and improved productivity. Married women form the only
substantial reserve and the Government is studying what are the obstacles
to employing those who are willing to work and how these may be overcome.

in manufacturing are in the metal, engineering and chemicals groups of
industries.
Most industries employ women as well as men though not always for the
same types of work, for example, few women are managers and few personal
secretaries are men. It is illegal to employ women in certain jobs, such as
underground work in coal mines. The industrial groups in which women are
chiefly employed are: the metal-using industries; the manufacture of textiles
and clothing; the food, drink and tobacco industries; the distributive trades;
and professional and miscellaneous services.

Ministry of Labour into the occupations of employees in manufacturing
industries in Great Britain (in firms with 11 or more employees) 24 per cent
were administrative, technical and clerical workers (the ratio ranged according
to industry from over 37 per cent in chemicals and allied industries to 13 per
cent in clothing and footwear) and the proportion of apprentices was nearly
3 per cent.
A manpower research unit was set up in the Ministry of Labour in 1963 to
assess future manpower resources and requirements over the economy as a
whole and in particular industries and occupational groups. It has already
reported on the national manpower needs and resources up to 1970, the
period covered by the National Plan, and on those in several industries in
more detail. It is also studying specific occupations. This work is particularly
important to the Industrial Training Boards (see p. 43^) atid all concerned
with training to meet future requirements in industry.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The general unemployment rate in Britain as a whole has been among the
lowest in the world in the last 20 years—usually between 1 and 2 per cent.
It has been particularly low in the south-east and Midlands of England, and
consistently higher in those parts of the country which have the greatest
dependence on shipbuilding, coalmining, and certain branches of the heavy
engineering and metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scotland
and Wales, and north-east England and Merseyside. These areas have been
the subject of a series of measures of selective assistance to stimulate industrial
expansion; and more recently, counter measures have been taken to limit
expansion in areas of manpower shortage (see p. 255). The general unemploy¬
ment rate in Great Britain at June 1966 was 11 per cent; the area with the
highest rate was Scotland (2-4 per cent).
The total working population of Northern Ireland—including employers and
self-employed but excluding certain unpaid helpers—was about 586,000 in
June 1965 (392,000 males and 194,000 females). The number of insured
employees was about 503,000. The largest productive industries are agricul¬
ture, engineering, textiles and clothing. Most of the agricultural work in
Northern Ireland is done without hired help.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In June 1966 it was 6-i per cent of the
insured employees. The Ministry of Commerce of the Northern Ireland
Government has wide powers (similar to those in Great Britain) to assist the
development and diversification of industry. It is using these powers
vigorously in an attempt to improve the situation.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES
The main Government employment services are provided in Great Britain
through the Ministry of Labour’s country-wide network of some 1,000
offices, which act as employment exchanges. The services in Northern
Ireland are run on similar lines by the Ministry of Health and Social Services
but there are some variations related to the much smaller area of administra¬
tion and the higher rate of unemployment.
The primary function of the employment exchanges is to introduce, free of
charge and without obligation, suitable persons seeking employment to
employers requiring employees, thus providing an efficient service to employers
and job-seekers and meeting the needs of the national economy. Employers
and employees alike remain free to use general or specialised fee-charging
private employment agencies and direct recruitment by advertisement or
personal introduction. The employment exchanges accept on their registers
both those seeking employment (full or part time) and those in work who
desire a change, and every exchange receives particulars of posts vacant and
applicants available in other areas. Local employment committees, on which
employers, workers and other local interests are represented, are attached to
certain employment exchanges as advisory bodies to secure the full benefit of
local knowledge and the close co-operation of employers and workers.
The employment exchanges offer a selective service to certain groups of
employers and employees through specialised registers. All exchanges hold
a Commercial Register of situations vacant and wanted in the distributive
trades, clerical and typing posts and catering and other services. Nearly

40 of the larger exchanges hold a Professional and Executive Register concerned
with posts in the professions, management, science, business and technical
employment at home and overseas. There are nearly 30 offices, in places
where there are large groups of hospitals, which have officers specially
trained to deal with the employment problems of nurses, midwives and those
in related occupations. Elsewhere nurses and their employers are dealt with
at the local employment exchange. In view of the increasing number of
older persons in the population, employment exchanges have instructions to
make special efforts to find them employment and to encourage employers
to consider older workers on their merits.
The Ministry of Labour has also started an experimental Occupational
Guidance Service for adults. Specially trained officers at 11 of the largest
employment exchanges give guidance and advice to those in doubt about their
future employment. Vocational guidance services for young people in
co-operation with local authorities (see below) and for the disabled as part of
the Disablement Resettlement Service (see below) are well established as is
the selection of candidates for the government vocational training scheme
(see p. 432). Employment exchanges holding the Professional and Executive
Register are also ready to give information about the professions and allied
occupations to young men and women considering a career and to older
people seeking a new one, such as ex-regular officers in the armed forces.
The Youth Employment Service in Great Britain is the responsibility of
the Minister of Labour, under the general direction of the Central Youth
Employment Executive (composed of senior officers of the Ministry of
Labour and the education departments) appointed by him. It is operated in
most areas through Youth Employment Officers established by local education
authorities in accordance with schemes approved by the Minister of Labour.
In the remainder it is operated by the Ministry’s local offices.
The main functions of the service are to collect and disseminate information
on careers, give vocational guidance, find suitable employment and keep
contact with young workers to help them settle down; a further function is
to help employers to fill vacancies for young people. Local youth employment
committees, made up of teachers, employers, workers and other appropriate
interests, assist the service in an advisory capacity.
In Northern Ireland the functions of the Youth Employment Service are
similar to those in Great Britain but its organisation is different in that
Parliamentary responsibility rests with the Minister of Education and the
service is operated by a statutory board composed of representatives of local
education authorities and other educational and industrial interests. Of the
board’s expenditure, 80 per cent is met by the Ministry of Education and
20 per cent by local education authorities.
The Disablement Resettlement Service is designed to help disabled persons
to get and keep suitable work. It is available to anyone over school-leaving
age who is substantially handicapped as a result of injury, disease or congenital
deformity in obtaining or keeping employment. The Ministry of Labour is
responsible for the administration of the Service and is assisted by the
National Advisory Council on the Employment of the Disabled.
The help given falls under five main headings:
Vocational guidance is given at local offices by specialised disablement
resettlement officers (DROs) in consultation, as necessary, with the local
disablement advisory committees, hospital resettlement clinics and medical

interviewing committees, and also in the industrial rehabilitation units (see
below).
Having regard to a disabled person’s qualifications and aptitude and to medical
guidance, and concentrating on what the person can do rather than on what
he or she cannot do, the DRO endeavours to find the work most suited to
each, with or without an intervening period of industrial rehabilitation or
vocational training. A Register of Disabled Persons is maintained, and in
mid-April 1965 the number registered was nearly 659,000; registration is
voluntary. All employers of 20 or more persons are required to employ a
quota (at present 3 per cent for all industries, except shipping, in respect
of the manning of ships) of registered disabled persons. The number
of registered disabled persons unemployed in mid-April 1966 was over
45,oo°.
There are 30 Blind Persons Resettlement Officers (BPROs) attached to
offices of the Ministry of Labour whose particular responsibility is to place
blind persons in suitable work and assist them to settle or become resettled
in the working community.
Industrial rehabilitation1 is provided at 17 units run by the Ministry of
Labour. The aim of these units is to provide the final link between sickness
and employment by enabling men and women to adjust themselves gradually
to normal working conditions and to give vocational guidance based on
skilled assessment of their aptitudes. Attendance at the unit is voluntary and
maintenance allowances are paid. The staff includes a doctor, industrial
psychologist, social worker, DRO, remedial gymnast and industrially
experienced workshop supervisors, under the general leadership of a rehabili¬
tation officer.
The Ministry gives financial assistance to two centres conducted by
voluntary organisations which provide similar facilities for the blind. It has
also approved, on an experimental basis, two schemes by voluntary organisa¬
tions for the rehabilitation of patients from mental hospitals.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at Government Training
Centres (see p. 432), educational institutions and employers’ establishments.
For the more seriously disabled there are special residential training colleges
run by voluntary organisations with the financial assistance and technical
help of the Ministry of Labour. There are also arrangements for the training
of special categories of disabled persons such as the blind, and for providing
grants to disabled persons who are of the appropriate educational standard
to undertake study or training for professional or comparable employment.
Remploy Ltd., a non-profit-making public company with no share capital,
provides sheltered employment for registered severely disabled people who
are unlikely to obtain work except under special conditions. At the end of
1965 it employed nearly 7,000 severely disabled men and women in 87
factories. Some 150 home workers were supplied with work from six centres.
The directors are appointed by the Minister of Labour; funds for capital
development and to meet operational costs are provided by loans and grants
from public funds.
The Ministry also gives financial assistance to local authorities and voluntary
organisations towards the cost of providing facilities for sheltered employment
for 2,000 severely disabled sighted workers and for 3>70° blind workers.

As part of the policy of encouraging geographical mobility of labour within
Britain to balance resources and demands, the Ministry of Labour makes
grants and allowances to help with costs of fares, temporary lodging and
acquisition of and removal to the new home, in specified instances. They are
available to unemployed workers moving to new employment, and therefore
settling, in another area, to key workers transferred by a firm into a develop¬
ment area to inaugurate a new plant, and unemployed workers recruited to
new plants in development areas and sent to the parent works for preliminary
training.
Commonwealth citizens from overseas are subject to control under the Com¬
monwealth Immigrants Act 1962, which came into force on 1st July 1962
and applies, broadly, to all Commonwealth citizens1 (except for those who
were born in the United Kingdom or hold passports issued by the United
Kingdom Government). If they wish to come to Britain for full-time employ¬
ment, they must first obtain a voucher issued by the Ministry of Labour.
Vouchers are issued to Commonwealth citizens (subject to a numerical
limit laid down from time to time by the Government) on the application of
an employer who has a vacancy for a particular individual, or on their own
application if they have certain special qualifications or skills. (Commonwealth
citizens who wish to work in Northern Ireland, and who are not ‘Northern
Ireland workers’,2 need special Northern Ireland employment permits,
which are issued only in respect of definite jobs.)
Individual foreigners are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up
employment with a particular employer, provided they hold a permit issued to
the prospective employer by the Ministry of Labour (the Ministry of Health
and Social Services for Northern Ireland if the proposed employment is in
Northern Ireland): about 66,000 such permits were granted in 1965. Of these,
about 14,000 were for domestic workers in hospitals, schools, other institutions
and private households, and about 9,000 for student employees. Employment
is limited to a maximum of one year in the first instance but may be extended
on the employer’s application.
Before a permit is issued, the Ministry of Labour must be satisfied that
there is a bona fide job, that no suitable British or foreign worker already
resident in Britain for a long period is available, and that the wages and con¬
ditions of employment are not less favourable than those enjoyed by British
workers. These conditions are waived for student employees who are admitted
for limited periods in order to improve their English and to gain a wider
knowledge of their occupations. A foreigner permitted to take employment
in the United Kingdom may not change his employment, unless his pros¬
pective employer has obtained prior approval from the Ministry.
Britain, as a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, participates with 13 European countries in the arrangements
for assisting nationals of the countries concerned to obtain employment in
other member countries.
As part of its plans for increasing productivity in industry the Government is
fostering the expansion and improvement of industrial training. The whole
framework of training in industry was strengthened by the Industrial

Government
Vocational
Training
Training Act 1964. Under this Act the Minister of Labour is setting up
industrial training boards to be responsible for the quantity and quality of
industrial training in the industry concerned; up to June 1966 13 boards
had been set up. Each board can provide its own training courses or arrange
for other organisations to provide training. It raises a levy from employers
and makes grants to those whose training courses it approves. The Minister
meets the initial administrative costs of each board and is making grants
towards certain other expenditure: for example, training courses for trainers
and research projects. To advise the Minister of Labour on the administration
of the Act and on industrial training questions generally, a Central Training
Council (CTC) consisting of employer and trade union members, representa¬
tives of nationalised industries, educationists, selected chairmen of training
boards and others with a special interest in industrial training has been set
up. It also advises the Minister on the running of the Industrial Training
Service (ITS), which is grant-aided by the Ministry of Labour. The work of
the ITS includes assessing training needs both for industries and individual
companies, developing training schemes, and promoting group training
schemes.
In some of the industries for which training boards have not yet been set
up, apprenticeship training is governed by agreements between employers’
associations and trade unions. Practical training is provided mainly within
the individual firm, and associated technical education is obtained by attending
a technical college. Training of operatives is usually arranged by the individual
firm but in a few industries there are agreed national or regional schemes.
Other government measures to stimulate training activity include grants
for the training of training officers on approved courses, for the appointment
of training development officers and for the promotion of group training
schemes. The number of the Government’s own training centres is also being
substantially increased (see below).
The Government Vocational Training Scheme, administered by the Ministry
of Labour, is intended to augment what industry is doing to overcome
shortages of skilled workers in industries of importance to the national
economy, as well as helping persons in special need, such as the disabled
(see p. 429) and ex-Regular Service men and women, to fit themselves for
suitable employment. Training is provided for suitable persons over 18 years
of age who are unskilled or whose prospects of employment in their existing
trade are poor. Employed persons as well as the unemployed are accepted for
training in trades of importance to the national economy. Most of the training
is provided at the 30 (being increased to 38) Government Training Centres
(GTCs), which are situated within easy reach of the main industrial centres
of the country, and between them offer courses in about 40 different trades,
with emphasis on those in which there is a shortage of skilled labour. Schemes
of training for particular trades are agreed with representatives of the employers
and workers concerned.
For the disabled and for ex-Regular Service men and women and the un¬
employed with special resettlement problems, training in other trades is also
available under the scheme at technical and commercial colleges and private
training establishments or by means of individual courses at employers’
establishments. For severely disabled persons training is provided at four
residential training colleges run by voluntary organisations with government
financial assistance.
During training, trainees are paid good allowances to maintain themselves
and their dependants. During 1965, 8,514 people were trained under the
LABOUR
Special Ministry
Services
Legislation
and
Conventions
433
scheme and about 90 per cent of them were subsequently employed in the
trade for which they had been trained.
Training can also be given in GTCs to men sponsored by their employers
where it can be fitted in with the Ministry’s other training commitments.
The employer continues to pay the trainee’s wages and is charged a fee for
the training provided.
The Ministry of Labour’s Regular Forces Resettlement Service helps
Regular officers and other ranks returning to civilian life to find suitable
employment. Nearly all those leaving the Services are successful in securing
satisfactory resettlement. The Ministry arranges special six-week business
training courses for Regulars and ex-Regulars (mainly ex-officers) at com¬
mercial and technical colleges; four-week courses in industrial supervision
are provided at the Ministry of Labour, Ebury Bridge House, London, for
non-technical warrant officers and senior NCOs (or other Service equivalent
ranks). In addition to full courses for a civilian trade, refresher courses and
conversion courses required for ex-Service men and women can be arranged
under the Vocational Training Scheme.
The Ministry is providing full-time training for a limited number of
apprentices. Instruction is given in four trades: engineering; radio and
electronics servicing; basic electrical work; and sheet and plate metal work.
The apprentices are sponsored by their employers, who pay their wages
during the course. A charge is made wffiere the appropriate Industrial
Training Board has approved the training and has instituted a system of
‘off the job’ training grants.
The Ministry also provides assistance with training for firms on first
moving into a development area or expanding an existing business there.
The assistance includes grants for training carried out by the employer and
direct training of employees on the firm’s premises by staff loaned by the
Ministry.
A special service to industry is the Ministry of Labour’s Training Within
Industry for Supervisors (TWI) scheme. Its object is to develop the skill of
supervisors in instructing others, in human relations, in improving methods
and in preventing accidents (there are separate programmes for each of
these). There are special versions of TWI, usually in courses of a week’s
duration, for supervisors employed in offices, retail distribution and hospitals.
Ministry Training Officers either give these courses or train employers’
nominees to enable them to run TWI courses in their own concerns.
In addition, courses in industrial teaching techniques for the training of
apprentices and trade instructors are available to outside firms as well as
GTC staff at the Ministry’s two Instructor Training Colleges (one in England
and one in Scotland).
Vocational training services at GTCs, TWT courses, and courses at
Instructor Training Colleges are available to trainees from overseas under
approved schemes (for instance, those of the ILO or the Colombo Plan).
TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND WORKING CONDITIONS
There are few restrictions in Britain on the freedom of an employer to hire
an employee on any terms which the employee will accept. Recent legislation,
however, embodies certain safeguards for the employee. The Terms and
Conditions of Employment Act 1959 provides machinery for enforcing on
an employer the observance of terms or conditions established by collective
434
Earnings
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
agreement in his industry; under the Contracts of Employment Act 1963
employers are now required to give their employees written particulars of
the main terms of employment, and employees are given rights to minimum
periods of notice when their employment is to be terminated; and under the
Redundancy Payments Act 1965 employees with a minimum period of
service of two years are entitled to lump sum payments if their jobs cease
to exist (for example, because of technological improvements or because
of a fall in demand) and their employers cannot offer suitable alternative work,
the cost being partly met from a fund subscribed to by industry as a whole.
Employers are under no legal obligation to recognise a trade union, or
to refrain from refusing to employ trade unionists; nor is a collective agree¬
ment with a trade union held to be in itself a legal contract of employment,
though the terms of a collective agreement may be expressly or by implication
incorporated in an individual contract of employment. However, it is by
collective agreements that in the majority of trades and industries minimum
or standard wages, normal working hours and other terms of employment are
effectively settled. The negotiation and observance of settlements continue
to depend primarily on the strength, integrity and representative character
of the signatory organisations rather than on any legal sanction. The deter¬
mination by statute of minimum wages, holidays and holiday pay is in
principle confined to those trades and industries where the organisation of
employers or workers, or both, is inadequate to negotiate collective agree¬
ments and to ensure their observance.
The conditions of work of employees—their safety, health and welfare—
depend to a far greater extent on minimum standards established by statute
and enforced by official inspectorates. Voluntary action is, however, still
important in these matters, whether additional health, safety or welfare
requirements are the subject of collective agreements, or employers provide
higher standards on their own initiative, as many do.
The further considerations which affect workers’ satisfaction with their
jobs and promote harmony between employers and employed, which can be
summed up as ‘good human relations’ between management and individual
employees, are hardly susceptible of codification; they have been recognised
for some time and are receiving increasing attention from managements and
from voluntary and official organisations.
Minimum or standard time rates for most British manual workers, as deter¬
mined by agreements or by statutory orders, vary between 4s. 3d. and
5s. qd. an hour for men and between 3s. od. and 4s. 6d. for women. Actual
earnings are usually higher. Higher rates are sometimes paid, and piece rates,1
shift rates and overtime rates raise the level of average earnings.
On the basis of the latest survey in a series conducted half-yearly by the
Ministry of Labour into earnings and hours of work in manufacturing
industries and some leading non-manufacturing industries in Great Britain,
the average earnings of full-time male adult manual workers in October 1965
were 8s. 4d. an hour and £19 ns. qd. a week. Full-time women manual
workers at the same date earned an average of 4s. 1 id. an hour and .£9 1 is. 1 id.
a week.
Minimum time rates for women manual workers tend to be set at around
70-90 per cent of the corresponding male rate, though the gap is gradually

of production tend to dictate the output of a worker, not his or her own skill or energy.

closing. Women’s earnings are markedly lower than those of men, partly
because on average they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at
premium rates, but also because a smaller proportion of women do skilled
work. The Government has announced its intention of implementing the
principle of equal pay and is having talks with the Trades Union Congress
and the Confederation of British Industry about the problems involved.
Earnings in coal mining and dock work, not covered by the Ministry of
Labour survey, are somewhat above the average; earnings are below the
average in railway work and agriculture.
Between April 1955 and October 1965 average weekly wage rates increased
by about 53 per cent and average weekly earnings by about 78 per cent. Part

of the increase has been offset by a rise in prices. The trends of manual
workers’ wage rates and earnings and retail prices from 1955 to 1965 (and
salary earnings from 1955 to 1964) are shown in the diagram on p. 435.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally
by annual salary, often on a scale carrying annual increases, and such careers
generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher remunera¬
tion. Starting salaries may be in the range of £600-^800 (lower for trainees
in their teens and higher for some graduates entering industry). The average
weekly earnings of male administrative, technical and clerical employees in
October 1965 were found by a Ministry of Labour survey to be £25 10s. 8d.
The average weekly figure for females was £13 15s. id.
Most of the senior posts in business, the professions and the Civil Service
are in the range of £2,750 to £7,000 a year. The posts with salaries in the
range of .£8,000 to £15,000 a year include those of Cabinet Ministers, top-
ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions in government depart¬
ments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of daily newspapers,
some persons outstanding in their professions and in the higher managerial
posts in industry, commerce and banking. A few persons in business draw
still higher salaries, while the earnings of star entertainers and certain other
very successful people exceed £25,000 a year.
Women have the same right of entry as men to nearly all public offices,
administrative posts and professions. They are paid the same salary for
doing the same work in journalism, broadcasting and architecture, and as
Ministers of the Crown, members of Parliament, salaried magistrates and
solicitors. Women in independent professions are not expected to charge
lower fees than men. The principle of equal pay applies to non-manual work
in the public sector but remains the exception in private non-manual
employment.
The average earnings of all salaried employees increased by 65 per cent
between 1955 and 1965^5 illustrated in the diagram on p. 435.
In October 1965 the number of hours actually worked by manual workers
averaged 47 for full-time men and 38-7 for women on full-time work. Agreed
weekly hours are mainly in the range 40 to 42 and may be worked as either a
five-day or a five-and-a-half-day wreek according to the industry and the rule
of the particular establishment. Hours actually worked by men are somewhat
longer owing to overtime working. While the hours of work of adult men are
not, in general, restricted by statute, normal hours of work for both sexes and
those of all ages are usually within the legal limits on the hours of women and
young persons.
National legislation in the United Kingdom limits and defines permissible
hours of work for women and young persons in a number of industries or
trades, the most permitted (with limited exceptions) being 48 hours a week
and nine a day in premises covered by the Factories Act (see p. 437) for adult
women and young people approaching 18 years. In continuous processes,
with limited exceptions, the employment of women and young persons at
night is prohibited.
With a few exceptions, manual workers (including shop assistants) in indus¬
tries covered by agreements or statutory orders are entitled to paid holidays
of at least 12 days or two weeks. Moreover, payment is made for bank or
statutory public holidays, which are as follows: in addition to Good Friday

and Christmas Day, there are Bank Holidays in most parts of England, Wales
and the Channel Islands on Easter Monday, the last Monday in May or first
in June, the last Monday in August or first in September and the first
weekday after Christmas (Boxing Day), and in Scotland on New Year’s Day
the last Monday in May or first in June and the last Monday in August or
first in September. Northern Ireland observes all the English holidays and
in addition, has a holiday on St. Patrick’s Day, 17th March, and on 12th July
(commemorating the Battle of the Boyne, 1690); Easter Tuesday is also a
customary holiday for industry and trade. Many agreements provide that
payments should also be made for specially proclaimed holidays.
In some industries agreements provide for extended holidays related to
length of service, work status, or both.
Where statutory wage-regulating machinery exists, it consists of bodies
known as Wages Councils. These are composed of equal numbers of
representatives of employers and workers in the respective sectors of industry,
with additional independent members. Wages Councils may submit proposals
for fixing minimum remuneration and holidays with pay to the Minister of
Labour, who must then make orders giving statutory force to such proposals
subject only to his right to return them as a whole for further consideration.’
The Ministry’s Wages Inspectorate helps employers and workers to interpret
the provisions of wage regulation orders and sees that they are complied
with. r
Agricultural Wages Boards (there are separate boards for England and
Wales and for Scotland) perform similar functions in relation to employment
in agriculture.
A variety of additional benefits in monetary form exist in varying degree. It
has been estimated that 13 million employees are covered by occupational
sick pay schemes and 12 million by occupational pension schemes (additional
or complementary to the state schemes, see p. 130). A smaller number are
covered by schemes for redundancy payments above the statutory minimum
(see p. 434). Such ‘fringe’ benefits are rather more usual among clerical and
professional employees receiving a standard salary than among manual
workers with a chance to earn overtime and other additions to their pay. The
former also tend to get longer holidays.
Employers have a duty at common law to take reasonable care of their
employees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a
duty of care towards each other. In addition, minimum required standards
of safety in certain kinds of workplaces or work are laid down under a number
of statutes; some of these also deal with health and welfare.
About 220,000 industrial premises (factories, workshops, slaughterhouses,
shipyards and docks) and about 30,000 building and civil engineering sites
come under the Factories Act 1961 (consolidating earlier legislation), which
is administered by the Ministry of Labour and enforced by H.M. Inspectorate
of Factories, which forms part of the Ministry. Over a million premises come
under the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, which is also administered
by the Ministry of Labour; enforcement is shared by H.M. Inspectorate of
Factories and local authorities. Under these Acts, anyone intending to employ
other people in industrial or commercial premises to which they apply has
to notify the enforcing authority of his intention before he begins to employ
438

Other Work
Premises
Prevention
people and every fatal accident and every accident causing more than three
days’ incapacity must be reported; under the Factories Act provision is also
made for compulsory notification and for investigation of certain dangerous
occurrences.
The Acts are designed to secure the health, safety and welfare of employed
persons, and a wide range of provisions in the Acts and in regulations,
according to the nature of the premises, deal with such matters as: the
fencing of machinery; precautions against fire, dangerous substances and
special risks; the safe condition of the premises, cleanliness, lighting, tempera¬
ture and ventilation; and the employment of women and young persons.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and
quarries under the Mines and Quarries Act 1954 > ^wo statutes are concerned
with agriculture—the Agriculture (Poisonous Substances) Act 1952 and the
Agriculture (Safety, Health and Welfare Provisions) Act 1956 j and specialised
statutes and delegated legislation are concerned with transport—the Railway
Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act 1900, the Merchant Shipping
Acts, the Road Traffic Acts and the Air Navigation Order and Regulations.
As with the Factories Act these other provisions are, with some exceptions,
enforced through inspectorates—the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate (part
of the Ministry of Power which is responsible for safety in mines and quarries),
the Agricultural Inspectorate of the agricultural departments, and, as regards
railways, the Railway Employment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Transport.
The Board of Trade is responsible for administering the Merchant Shipping
Acts and for safety in air transport (most of the powers in respect of air
worthiness are delegated to the Air Registration Board, see p. 3^4)> and
the Minister of Transport is responsible for road and rail transport safety
matters.
There are at present no specific statutory safety requirements in hotels,
places of entertainment or educational establishments, except in so far as
they are covered by fire regulations applicable under local authority by-laws
to all large buildings or (in respect of their offices and shops) by the Offices,
Shops and Railway Premises Act. The Ministry of Labour has no statutory
responsibility in regard to safety in workshops or laboratories in educational
establishments, though it keeps in touch with university authorities and
the education departments. Employers, however, are bound by their common
law obligation to provide a safe system of work, and employers and educational
authorities may voluntarily seek the advice and help of the Factory
Inspectorate, which is given freely on request.
Safety depends, in fact, at least as much on the education and voluntary
efforts of the employers and of the workers as upon safety regulations. The
concern of both trade unions and employers’ associations with safety helps
to maintain safety standards; and the requirements about accident notification
help inspectors to examine the means of prevention with employers, machinery
manufacturers and interested organisations. Many firms have works safety
committees and, in many areas, safety groups have been organised, whose
members meet monthly for the exchange of information, discussions, lectures
and films on safety measures.
The voluntary accident prevention movement is strongly supported by
the Factory Inspectorate. Inspectors inquire into safety aspects of machine
design and specification, circulate expert advice by personal exhortation,
lectures and literature, and encourage the appointment of safety officers
LABOUR

and the formation of works safety committees. The Factory Inspectorate
maintains an industrial health and safety centre in London, at which various
types of machinery demonstrating the effectiveness of guards are displayed,
as well as a wide range of protective clothing and equipment. The Ministry
also actively encourages the development of voluntary central organisation
within each industry at national level for the consideration of safety matters
and the formulation of policy on accident prevention.
The National Coal Board has its own safety organisation—a Standing
Committee on Safety, a chief safety engineer, and safety engineers at
divisions, areas and the largest collieries. It conducts courses of safety
training for workmen and officials and is constantly on the alert for new
methods of reducing risks. Its research programme includes a number of
projects with a direct bearing on safety.
The Minister of Power has a statutory responsibility for research concerning
the safety and health of coal miners. This responsibility is largely exercised
through its Safety in Mines Research Establishment with laboratories at
Sheffield and Buxton.
To safeguard the many interests which might be adversely affected by the
use of chemicals in agriculture and food storage, a voluntary scheme is operated
by the Government with the help of an advisory committee and with the full
co-operation of the chemical industry.
Both transport operators and the Ministries of Transport and of Aviation
give high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every
endeavour is made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic
densities, by improving the design of vehicles, transport plant and equipment,
by traffic regulation and control of standards of maintenance and by training
crews in competency and safety awareness.
Training for safety is an important facet of the accident prevention effort and,
to help in this work, the Ministry of Labour provides a safety course in its
TWI scheme (see p. 433).
In 1965 the Central Training Council, which advises the Minister of
Labour under the Industrial Training Act 1964 (see p. 432), drew the
attention of Industrial Training Boards to the need to include specific
provisions for safety training in their general training recommendations.
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) provides a
variety of safety courses for special needs at its Industrial Safety Training
Centre in Birmingham and elsewhere. Other courses are organised by bodies
such as local accident prevention groups and organisations such as the
Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
RoSPA also helps the accident prevention movement by providing publicity
and organising conferences; during 1965-66 it appointed a number of
Regional Industrial Safety Officers, primarily to promote safety activity among
top-level managers. The British Safety Council also provides safety publicity
and offers safety training courses.
Organisations in industry are now concerning themselves to an increasing
extent with the promotion of safety at work and the provision of information
and advisory services to their members. They participate also in joint standing
and advisory committees appointed by the Minister of Labour. Representatives
of the Trades Union Congress, the Confederation of British Industry, the
nationalised industries and the Ministry of Labour meet on the Industrial
Safety Sub-committee of the National Joint Advisory Council. Industrial
research associations include amongst their more purely economic research

projects the investigation into the improvement of working conditions and the
reduction of hazards.
Local authorities, under the Public Health Acts, have power to regulate the
provision of suitable sanitary accommodation in houses and at places of work
and to treat workplaces which are dirty or badly ventilated or overcrowded
as nuisances the abatement of which can be enforced. Factories, other
industrial premises, offices, shops and railway premises must comply with the
health and welfare requirements of the Factories Act or the Offices, Shops and
Railway Premises Act. These include: the cleanliness of workrooms, adequate
ventilation and suitable temperature and lighting, the avoidance of over¬
crowding and the provision of sanitary accommodation, and the protection
of workers against inhaling harmful dust or fumes; the provision of washing
facilities, lockers or other accommodation for outdoor clothing, drinking
water, first aid, and seats. Legislation concerning safety in other types of work,
for example, agriculture, also prescribes appropriate measures to promote
health and welfare.
The laws restricting the employment of children, young persons and women
form an important part of protective legislation. National legislation, besides
forbidding any employment of children under 13 years of age, forbids the
employment of children who have not reached the statutory minimum school¬
leaving age (see p. 151) in any industrial undertaking; of women and young
persons underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations
(for example, certain processes connected with lead manufacture); and of
women in factories and workshops within one month of childbirth. It also
limits and defines the permissible hours of employment for women and young
persons in factories, and for young persons in certain other occupations. Local
authorities, moreover, have wide powers under the Children and Young
Persons Acts 1933-63 as well as the Education Acts 1944-48, which regulate
hours and conditions of employment of children under 15 years within their
areas within the limits of national legislation.
These are the main legislative provisions relating to health and welfare
at work, but it is essential to note that employers frequently achieve health and
welfare standards considerably higher than those prescribed by law. They are
helped to do this by the inspectorates, by government departments and
agencies, by employers’ associations and trade unions and by expert voluntary
bodies.
A number of employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their
employees over and above the statutory requirements. It is estimated that there
are about 340 factories with full-time and about 4,700 factories with part-time
doctors employed. In addition several thousand nurses are employed in
industry. Compulsory medical examinations under the Factories Act and
regulations are carried out by 2,300 part-time Appointed Factory Doctors.
The big employers, including the state and the boards of nationalised
industries, have naturally taken the lead but a number of smaller factories
also provide medical services and in a few cases have joined together in group
medical services. The Minister of Labour is advised on measures to further
the development of industrial health services by the Industrial Health Advisory
Committee which includes members nominated by the Confederation of
British Industry, the Trades Union Congress, the nationalised industries,
the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Nursing and other
organisations closely concerned with the promotion of industrial health.

give advice on occupational hygiene problems as part of their normal duties
In addition there are at present two centres in Great Britain which undertake
studies of particular problems or health risks and also carry out routine
physical, chemical and biological tests for industry.
Prompt and effective action in industrial health depends, among other
things, on adequate and properly co-ordinated arrangements for investigation
and research. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory Inspectorate
which has specialised medical and technical branches. Research facilities are
provided by government agencies such as the Medical Research Council-
by university faculties of industrial health and social medicine; and by the
research departments of various industries and large industrial concerns.
Other types of amenity vary considerably from one firm to another. The
requirements of a factory, or office or shop where the work is light, and where
many employees are women or young persons, are different from those of an
iron foundry or steelworks, where much of the work is arduous and is under¬
taken by men. Progressive firms are careful to find out what their employees
want, and welfare policy is often decided in consultation with the workers
through regular consultative machinery or by other means. An increasing
number of firms in Britain pay part or all of recreational facilities. Some have
their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes. The provision
of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become usual in large
undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Colliery canteens provide
meals for about 98 per cent of coalminers. Many offices and shops which are
unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff have adopted luncheon
voucher schemes. There are now over 15,500 firms using this service.
Practically all large industrial firms and many small ones now have a personnel
department staffed by one or more specialist officers. While the form of
organisation of personnel departments varies, personnel officers are generally
responsible for advising all levels of management on every aspect of labour
relations. They also have particular duties with regard to recruitment
selection, education and training, transfer of labour, the application of wage
agreements, the promotion of good communication and consultation and the
supervision of working conditions and employees’ amenities.
Recruitment and promotion policies are matters which each undertaking
decides for itself, although in some industries the decisions may be limited
by collective agreements or by trade practices. Great importance has recently
been attached to selection; and courses for training personnel officers in
modern interviewing techniques, including the use of test procedures are
now well attended.
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting
better human relationships in industry. The Government has sought to
extend by research the available knowledge of the factors influencing human
relations in industry and human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or
conducted by the Social Science Research Council (see p. 210) and the Medical
Research Council (see p. 204). Voluntary organisations include bodies which
deal with management problems and provide a service to subscribing firms
professional associations, linking individuals with a common interest in
particular functions of management, and bodies providing specialist services
usually on a fee-paying basis.

In addition to the assistance the Ministry of Labour can give where
employees are recruited through employment exchanges, members of the
Ministry’s industrial relations service are available to give advice on personnel
policies, personnel management techniques and problems of human relations
at the workplace, as well as assisting in the formation and support of machinery
for negotiation and settlement of disputes (see below).
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been
the subject of legislation which, with certain exceptions, is similar to that in
Great Britain and is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland) 1965.
Many firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and an Industrial Safety Group
for the area, supported by representatives of industry, trade unions, insurance
companies and public authorities, is very active and makes a valuable contri¬
bution in the field of industrial accident prevention on similar lines to what
is done in Great Britain.
The structure of labour relations in Britain is established mainly on a voluntary
basis, and rests on the organisation of employers and workers into employers’
associations and trade unions. These organisations1 discuss and negotiate
terms and conditions of employment and other matters affecting the work¬
people at their work. In some industries these negotiations are conducted
simply by ad hoc meetings, which are held when necessary; in others, voluntary
joint machinery has been established on a permanent basis. Normally these
arrangements for collective bargaining suffice to settle all questions which
are raised, but provision is often made for matters not so settled to be referred
for settlement to independent arbitration. The machinery for settlement in
certain trades where wages cannot be effectively controlled by voluntary
agreement has already been described (see p. 437).
The existence of these employers’ and employees’ bodies facilitates liaison
between the Government and industry on labour matters in which they have
a common interest (though it does not preclude individual contact). Standing
arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the Government,
the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Trades Union Congress
(TUC) (see pp. 443 and 444) through the National Joint Advisory Council,
which was set up in 1939 to advise the Government on matters in which
employers and workers have a common interest. It meets quarterly under the
chairmanship of the Minister of Labour. Its membership consists of represen¬
tatives of the CBI and the TUC, together with representatives of the
managements of nationalised industries. Subjects of importance to relations
between management and workers generally throughout industry which it has
recently studied include the training of supervisors and shop stewards and the
transferability of occupational pensions.
The whole range and scope of employers’ and employees’ organisations,
and the legal framework in which they operate, are currently being investigated
by a Royal Commission.
Many employers in Great Britain are members of employers’ organisations
wholly or partly concerned with labour questions. The primary aims of
such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and conditions
of employment, including a sound wage structure and proper standards of

safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees and
the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes
which may arise. Different employers’ organisations vary in the emphasis
which they put upon these different aims and in the means by which they
try to achieve them. Some concentrate on defensive action, trying by
negotiation and representations to modify proposals of trade unions and
Government in their members’ interests. Others also try to give their
members practical help and advice in developing positive employment
policies and assistance on recruitment, training and further education.
There is diversity of structure as well as function. Generally, however,
employers’ organisations are organised on an industry basis rather than a
product basis. Some are purely local in character and deal with a section
of an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole
of a particular industry. In some of the chief industries there are local or
regional organisations combined into national federations, while in others,
within which different firms are engaged on making different principal
products, there is a very complex structure with national and regional
federations for these different sections of the industry as well as for the
industry as a whole. Altogether there are some i ,400 employers’ organisations
dealing with labour matters and about 80 are national employers’ federations.
The final authority of a local or small national organisation may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local
organisations or through the regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council, central committee or general committee, which meets
perhaps once a quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect com¬
mittees and to ratify their work. A small paid staff under a director or
secretary carries out the day-to-day work of the organisation. There is
usually a small working group, consisting of senior officials and committee
chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent questions and co-ordinate the
work of the committees.
The central body of employers’ organisations is the CBI which deals with
all matters (not only labour relations) affecting the interests of organised
employers and represents them nationally to the Government and the public
and also internationally, for instance, in the International Labour Organisation.
CBI representatives sit on various government advisory committees, on
other statutory bodies and on a number of voluntary bodies concerned with
labour matters.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers—and in some industries
nearly all workers—are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over a great many years, and consequently, their
form and organisation vary considerably as to their traditions and attitudes,
for example, their degree of concern with political movements. Trade unions
started more than two hundred years ago among the skilled craftsmen and
spread later to the general labouring and unskilled classes. More recently
trade unionism has increased among clerical, supervisory, technical and
administrative workers. A number of associations of professional workers,
formed primarily for the preservation and improvement of professional
standards, have also come to exercise many of the functions of trade unions,
including negotiations on salary and fee scales, and are legally trade unions.
The qualification for membership of some unions is occupational: for
444
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Trades Union
Congress
instance, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed; while in
others the qualification is industrial, that is, they seek to recruit all persons in
an industry, whatever their occupation. In a number of unions recruitment is
based on a combination of these principles. A few large unions recruit members
in a number of different occupations and industries.
During its long history the British trade union movement has passed
through many changes, and is currently undergoing re-examination within
and without.
At the end of 1964 the total membership of British trade unions was about
10,065,000. There were 591 unions but about two-thirds of all trade unionists
were in the 18 largest unions, while just over a half were in the eight unions
with a membership of over 250,000. The number of trade unionists is
increasing but the number of unions has gone down owing to amalgamations.
The basic unit of organisation in most British trade unions is the local
branch (called a lodge in some trade unions). Every member of the union
belongs to a branch. He may attend its meetings, put forward suggestions
about terms and conditions of employment, discuss the work and policy
of the union, and take part in the election of the union’s officers. The branch
takes action on certain matters considered to be entirely, or mainly, of local
interest and forwards its views on wider issues for action by the union’s
national or regional bodies. Many unions also have shop stewards or other
representatives at the place of wrork to enrol members and collect dues, to
ensure that local and national agreements operate satisfactorily, to take up
with management the individual problems and grievances that arise and to
keep the union informed of developments in the workplace. Only in a few
trade unions is organisation based primarily on the place of work.
In most large unions the central organisation is along the following lines:
elected officials, including a general secretary assisted by clerical and specialist
staff, are in charge of the work of the head office and are responsible to a
national executive council or committee which may be part-time or full-time,
and which is usually elected by, and responsible to, annual or biennial con¬
ferences of delegates from the branches. Executive committees or councils
play an important part in the government of the unions; between conferences
they are the highest authorities and carry out policy decisions made by
delegates. Most unions also have some regional, district or area organisation.
Trade unions may affiliate to one or more federations or confederations
whose main purpose in most cases is to represent all or most of the trade
unions in an industry in negotiations with employers. The scope and authority
of these federations and confederations vary greatly.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the TUC, to
which most trade unions of any size and importance are affiliated. The TUC’s
objects are to promote the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve
the economic and social conditions of the workers. Its membership comprises
172 organisations, of which about a dozen are federations of some 150 separate
unions; approximately 320 unions in all are affiliated directly or indirectly.
These represent about 8-7 million workpeople. The TUC deals with ail
general questions which concern trade unions both nationally and inter¬
nationally and gives assistance on questions relating to particular trades or
industries at the request of the trade union concerned.
The congress of delegates, which constitutes the TUC proper, meets for a
week every year to discuss matters of general interest to trade unionists and
to employees generally. It elects annually a General Council which represents
it during the remaining 51 weeks of the year. This is responsible for carrying

out congress decisions, for watching economic and social developments, and
for providing educational and advisory services. It is also empowered to
mediate in inter-union disputes in certain circumstances.
The TUC is a non-political body but under the Trade Union Act 1913
individual trade unions can, by a ballot vote of members, decide to set up a
political fund, financed by a separate levy, which any member can refuse to
pay without loss of his normal union rights and benefits. About 100 separate
trade union organisations, including most of the largest trade unions, have
such a fund and, in most cases, it is used to support the Labour Party (or
the Co-operative Party, which is associated with the Labour Party and has
substantially the same platform).
Both the TUC and many unions conduct extensive educational services for
members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade unionism and
industrial relations principles and practice.
Branches of various trade unions in a locality generally affiliate to a local
trades council, which acts as a forum for the discussion of matters of common
interest and as a local agent of the TUC, by which it is registered each year.
There are 500 trades councils in England and Wales alone, grouped together
in 22 federations.
Affiliation to the TUC is open to all trade unions anywhere in the United
Kingdom, but Scottish trade unionists have their own national centre, the
Scottish Trades Union Congress, similar within its objects to the TUC, though
there are some differences of organisation. The Scottish TUC, to which trade
unions may affiliate in respect of their membership in Scotland (a number of
unions are affiliated to both bodies), also accepts affiliation from trade councils
and has an affiliated membership of over three-quarters of a million. It holds
an annual congress and has consultations with the Government on issues
affecting Scottish trade unionists.
In most of the main industries there are, at national level, joint committees
(sometimes referred to as joint negotiating machinery) composed of represen¬
tatives of employers and trade unions, often with an independent chairman.
There are some 200 in all; about 130 of them are known as Joint Industrial
Councils. Their functions vary considerably, some being simply negotiating
bodies, while others deal with a wide range of subjects affecting the interests
of the industry concerned. Provision is sometimes made in their constitution
that a dispute on which it is not found possible to reach agreement should be
referred to some form of conciliation or arbitration by independent persons,
including the means provided under the Conciliation Act 1896, or the
Industrial Courts Act 1919.
Collective agreements between employers’ associations and trade unions
are not civil contracts between particular employers and employees, and are
not, therefore, in themselves enforceable at law. Observance of agreed terms
and conditions is based mainly on the good faith of employers and the mutual
respect and vigilance of trade unions and employers’ organisations, but can
be secured in particular instances through reference to the Industrial Court
(see p. 446).
Arrangements for negotiation and joint consultation also exist at district
and factory level in many industries, where matters are discussed either
between the appropriate representatives of the two sides on an ad hoc basis,
or through regular machinery provided by District Joint Industrial Councils
or similar bodies and Works Councils. Such bodies discuss how agreements
446
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
State Provision

Investigation

reached at a national level may be applied to their district or factory, but as a
rule have no power to alter the terms of such national agreements. They also
discuss new problems which may arise, and if no solution can be found at
factory or district level, refer them to the national body.
Matters which prove difficult to settle by negotiation are sometimes referred
by agreement to independent conciliators or arbitrators, and one way in which
the parties can find such persons is by invoking the help of the Minister of
Labour. Under authority derived from the Conciliation Act 1896, and the
Industrial Courts Act 1919, the Minister has certain powers to assist industry
to settle disputes which it is not found possible to resolve through an industry’s
own machinery and procedure. These powers are all intended to supplement
and not to supersede the industry’s own machinery. There is no legal obliga¬
tion on the parties to a dispute to notify the dispute to the Minister, nor to
place the question before a conciliator.
To assist conciliation in industry the Ministry of Labour has an industrial
relations service, staffed by specially trained officers who keep in touch with
the course of relations between employers and workers at national, district and,
in some cases, factory level and assist them, if requested, to settle their prob¬
lems by joint discussion and negotiation. Conciliators have no legal powers.
Disputes which cannot be settled in this way may, at the request of both
parties, be referred to voluntary arbitration, either by a single arbitrator, or
an ad hoc Board of Arbitration, or by the Industrial Court, a permanent
tribunal established under the Industrial Courts Act. The court normally
consists of three members—the president, one member experienced in
representing employers and one in representing workpeople.
Like collective agreements, arbitration awards are not in themselves
enforceable at law, but under the Terms and Conditions of Employment
Act 1959, reports that a particular employer is not observing the recognised
terms or conditions of employment in his trade or industry may be made to
the Minister of Labour by organisations which are parties to the relevant
agreement or award. If the matter is not otherwise settled, the Minister must
refer it to the Industrial Court which, after hearing the case, may issue an
award requiring the employer to observe the recognised terms or conditions.
Such an award becomes an implied term of the contract of employment.
The Minister of Labour is also empowered to appoint a Court of Inquiry
or Committee of Investigation into a dispute, whether existing or apprehended.
These procedures are primarily means of informing public opinion of the
facts of a dispute (the report of a Court of Inquiry has to be laid before
Parliament). Although the recommendations contained in the reports of such
bodies are not binding on the parties, they often provide the basis for further
negotiations leading to a settlement.
Over the past 30 years the number of working days lost each year through
stoppages of work arising from industrial disputes, that is through strikes and
lockouts, has been on an average about 2% million which, taking the working
population as a whole, works out at approximately one hour per worker per
year. These figures, however, only record the time lost at establishments
where strikes actually take place; they take no account of the effect in other
establishments or industries. Nevertheless, the time lost through strikes is very
much less than that lost on account of sickness, accidents and absenteeism
and the United Kingdom’s record over the past 10 years or so compares
favourably with that of most other industrial countries.

Strikes in Britain are not in general caused by a breakdown in the collective
bargaining machinery. This on the whole works smoothly and well. In fact
it is estimated that over 90 per cent of all strikes and about 70 per cent of the
time lost through strikes are the result of the unofficial and usually uncon¬
stitutional action of comparatively small groups of workers in single firms.
These unofficial strikes are therefore symptoms of a breakdown in relations
between management and workers at the place of work itself. The problem of
securing a fundamental improvement in relations between employers and
workers and the loyal observance of agreements and constitutional procedures
freely negotiated is currently the subject of public discussion as well as in
industry generally, but it seems likely that there is no single solution.
The concept that workpeople need to have a proper understanding of
management’s aims and plans if they are to co-operate with them has focused
attention on the quality of communication down the chain of responsibility
to workshop level (a matter which depends on personal relations and on the
adequacy of supervisor training) and prompted the establishment, in many
undertakings, of means for joint consultation, such as those provided by a
works council.
A wide range of subjects can be fruitfully discussed by works councils,
including hours of work (within the framework of agreements), safety and
health, productivity, absenteeism, labour turnover, training and education,
and amenities generally. Works councils are usually kept informed about the
state of the firm s business, and frequently consider problems resulting from
decisions to change production methods. It is, however, usual to exclude
all questions relating to wages and conditions of employment, and other
matters covered by negotiation between organisations of employers and
workers.
Other means of communication in use include posters, wall information
sheets, production charts, house journals, film shows and exhibitions.
The Ministry of Labour’s industrial relations service is ready to assist
these developments by advice on techniques, by the supply of publicity
material and by encouraging and promoting joint consultation.
While labour relations in government service and in the nationalised industries
are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry, there
are some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central government service, where salaries and
conditions of service are under the direct control of the Treasury, are per¬
mitted and encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service staff associations
(trade unions) and there is a highly developed system of negotiation and
joint consultation by means of the National and Departmental Whitley
Councils (see p. 66), corresponding to the Joint Industrial Councils in industry.
If there is failure to reach agreement by negotiation a department or associa¬
tion may, subject to certain limitations, report the dispute to the Minister of
Labour for reference to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an independent
body appointed by the Minister by virtue of his powers under the Industrial
Courts Act 1919.
Industrial employees of the central Government are organised by trades
and not by departments; negotiations regarding their wages and conditions of
employment take place on Trade Joint Councils and unresolved matters are
referred to the Industrial Court for arbitration. In the major employing
448

Ireland
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
departments, Departmental Joint Councils also exist for the discussion of
matters other than trade questions which are of mutual concern to the
department and its industrial employees (and which are domestic to the
department).
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils
for the main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical
employees) which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other
matters. There are corresponding regional and district councils.
In the nationalised industries, the main corporations, though not subject to
detailed governmental control, have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining in their industries and for joint con¬
sultation with their employees; but in carrying out these duties they are free
to choose the arrangements that suit them. The main difference from private
industry is that the corporations are not usually members of employers’
associations although they are eligible to apply for a form of association with
the CBI (see p. 443). In some industries they are sole or main employers, but
even where part of the industry is in private hands, as for example in road
transport, the corporations are separately and directly represented on wage¬
negotiating bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of managements and trade
unions at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local
bodies, similarly representative, to deal with local implications. Most of the
industries use the facilities for arbitration offered to industry generally by the
Ministry of Labour, but coalmining and rail transport have their own special
arrangements. Consultations at all levels, including the workplace level, have
been arranged in all the nationalised industries according to the traditions and
needs of each industry.
Some of the nationalised industries have felt that joint consultation was
best carried out by their negotiating bodies; others have established separate
and specially constituted joint committees at all levels.
The system of labour relations in Northern Ireland is based on the same
principles as that of Great Britain and, in these matters, the Minister of
Health and Social Services has powers and duties broadly similar to those
of the Minister of Labour in Great Britain. About 90 per cent of trade
unionists in Northern Ireland are members of trade unions with head¬
quarters in Great Britain.
SOUND AND TELEVISION
BROADCASTING
Broadcasting of sound and of television in the United Kingdom is regulated
under powers conferred on the Postmaster General by the Wireless Tele¬
graphy Acts 1949-1955, which prohibit the sending or receiving of radio
communications, except under licence.
Sound broadcasting services are provided solely by the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC), which was established as a public corporation by Royal
Charter in 1927. Two television services are provided by the British Broad¬
casting Corporation (BBC 1 and BBC 2) and one by the Independent Tele¬
vision Authority (ITA), which was established by the Television Act 1954.
Users of sound and television receiving sets must obtain an annual licence,
which can be purchased from most post offices. There were 16,234,000
receiving licences current in the United Kingdom in June 1966, of which
13,64!,ooo were for sound and television combined and 2,593,000 (including
677>500 f°r sets fitted in cars) for sound only. A combined sound and television
licence costs £5; a licence for sound only costs j£i 5s. Registered blind people
are entitled to free sound licences or to combined licences for £3 15s. One
licence covers all receiving sets in a household, but a separate licence is
required for a set fitted in a car.
The Pilkington The services provided by both broadcasting authorities were reviewed by
Report and later the Committee on Broadcasting i960, and subsequently the powers of the
eveiopments ITA were renewed by the Television Act 1963 (which was incorporated in the
Television Act 1964). This Act also strengthened the Authority’s controlling
and regulatory powers in relation to the independent programme companies
under contract to it to produce the actual programmes. The BBC was confirmed
as the sole provider of sound broadcasting services and authorised to introduce
a second television service (BBC 2); this opened in 1964. Colour television is
to be introduced on BBC 2 by the end of 1967.
Wire
Broadcasting
Wire broadcasting is a system whereby programmes are received at a central
point, whence they are distributed by wire to listeners and viewers. Wire
broadcasting companies are not allowed to originate programmes of their own;
theii function is to distribute programmes put out by general broadcasting
stations. A specified minimum of their programme material must be taken
from BBC sources. At the beginning of 1966 there were some 760 wire
broadcasting services, of which nearly 580 provided both sound and television.
The number of subscribers at that date was over 1,250,000 about 980,000
of whom were receiving television services.
Pay 1 elevision An experiment in pay television is being undertaken by a company, Pay-TV
Ltd., in two areas of Britain. The service is operated over wire broadcasting
networks as an additional programme; subscribers pay for the programmes
they choose to view. The service is subject to the same code of conduct as
applies to existing television services.

The constitution and finances of the BBC are currently governed by the Royal
Charter of 1964 and the Licence and Agreement with the Postmaster General
of 1963, and those of the ITA by the provisions of the Television Act 1964 and
the Licence issued to it by the Postmaster General in 1964. Both the Royal
Charter and the 1964 Act specifically define the services of the BBC and ITA
as a ‘public service’ with the purpose of disseminating information, education
and entertainment.
The BBC and the ITA are independent authorities in the day-to-day
operations of broadcasting, including programmes and administration. The
Government, however, retains ultimate control, and the Postmaster General,
as the responsible minister, is answerable to Parliament on broad questions
of policy and may issue directions to the BBC and the ITA on a number
of technical and other subjects. The Postmaster General also has powers to
prohibit the broadcasting of any particular matter or class of matter, or to
revoke the licences of the BBC or ITA at any time; these powers, however,
are treated as major reserve powers, and no formal veto has ever been placed
on the broadcasting of a particular item. Both the BBC and the ITA are
required to prepare annual reports and accounts, which are presented by
the Postmaster General to Parliament.
The number of hours of television broadcasting are regulated by the
Postmaster General; he has approved an arrangement which permits any one
service a maximum of 50 hours a week (30 hours a week for BBC 2), together
with extensions (averaging ten hours a week) for certain stated purposes, such
as religious and educational programmes, ministerial and party political
broadcasts, schools broadcasts, and outside broadcasts. In 1966 the BBC was
broadcasting about 53 hours of programmes from London in its domestic
sound services during a normal weekday.
The Corporation consists of nine governors (including a chairman, a vice-
chairman and separate national governors for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland), each appointed for a period of not more than five years by the
Queen on the advice of the Government. As a corporate body, the governors
are responsible for the conduct of the whole broadcasting operation, including
the content and presentation of the programmes in sound and television,
and the provision and working of the necessary installations and equipment.
The BBC must refrain from expressing editorial opinion on current affairs
and on matters of public policy and is relied on to treat controversial subjects
with impartiality.
The governors are advised on all aspects of their work by a number of
councils, established in accordance with the terms of the Charter: for example,
the General Advisory Council; the National Broadcasting Councils for
Scotland and Wales, which are responsible for domestic services in those
countries; and the regional advisory councils for the English regions and for
Northern Ireland. There are also a number of other councils and committees,
not specifically required by the Charter, but established by the BBC to advise
on such matters as religious broadcasting, schools broadcasting, further
education, science and engineering, music and agriculture.
The chief executive officer of the BBC—the Director-General—is appointed
by the governors and with him they discuss all major matters of policy and
finance. Under the Director-General are six directors (the chief assistant to the
Director-General, and the directors of sound broadcasting, television, external
broadcasting, engineering, and administration) who, between them, cover the
whole work of the BBC, and who, with the Director-General, constitute
its Board of Management. The number of staff employed is about 22,000.

The services of the BBC are financed from (1) an annual sum, voted by
Parliament, for the domestic services, which is related to revenue derived
from the sale by the Post Office of broadcast receiving licences; (2) an annual
grant-in-aid, voted by Parliament, for the external services; and (3) profits
from BBC publications, mainly the Radio Times, which has a weekly sale of
over 4 million copies and attracts a large advertising revenue. The net
revenue from the sale of licences for the year which ended on 31st March 1966
amounted to ^64,314,800. In the same year the surplus on trading, mainly
from publications, amounted to £976,700 and grant-in-aid receipts for the
external services amounted to £10,555,000.
The Independent Television Authority consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and, at present, eleven other members (three of whom have special
responsibility for Scotland, Wales and Monmouthshire, and Northern Ireland
severally) appointed by the Postmaster General. The ITA owns and operates
the transmitting stations, but the production studios and equipment are
owned, and the actual programmes are provided, by programme companies
under contract to the ITA. Fourteen programme companies are at present
under contract: ABC Television Limited; Anglia Television Limited;
ATV Network Limited; Border Television Limited; Channel Television
Limited, Grampian Television Limited; Granada TV Network Limited;
Rediffusion Limited; Scottish Television Limited; Southern Television
Limited; TWW Limited (Independent Television for Wales and the West of
England), Tyne-Tees Television Limited; Ulster Television Limited; and
Westward Television Limited. A common news service is provided by
Independent Television News Limited.
The Authority has controlling and regulatory powers of a wide and
important character regarding the content and quality of programmes: for
example, it works to ensure that a ‘proper balance’ of views is expressed and
has drawn up a code on violence stating that special precautions are to be
taken when children are likely to be viewing. There are also safeguards in
the Television Act 1964 to prevent newspaper shareholdings in a programme
company leading to results contrary to the public interest.
In the discharge of its duties the ITA is advised by a General Advisory
Council and by three statutory committees on educational broadcasting,
religious broadcasting and advertising. A specialist panel advises on medical
and allied advertisements.
The chief executive officer of the ITA is the Director-General. There are
also two deputy directors-general, and a headquarters and regional office
staff covering all technical, administrative, clerical, typing and office services,
which numbered 295 in 1966. There were also 395 engineering staff serving
at the transmitting stations.
A standing committee, composed of four representatives of the ITA and a
representative of each of the programme companies, provides consultative
machinery between the ITA and the companies on matters, other than
programmes, affecting the companies as a whole. There is also an Independent
Television Companies Association, designed to further the collective interests
of the companies with such outside bodies as trade unions and sporting
organisations, and generally to ensure that they speak as far as possible with
one voice on public issues connected with television broadcasting policy.
The ITA receives no payments from licence revenue; the finance for its
operations is drawn from annual rental payments made to it by the programme
companies. In the year ended March 1965 the ITA received about £8 million
from this source. In return for the valuable public concession enjoyed, the

programme companies also paid to the ITA for transfer to the Exchequer, a
further sum (the levy) related to their advertising revenue; this amounted to
about £22 million in the year ended July 1965.
The BBC operates its domestic sound broadcasting services from 57 long¬
wave and medium-wave transmitters at 43 transmitting stations, and from
186 very high frequency (VHF) transmitters at 61 stations. The VHF service
is available to over 99 per cent of the population of the United Kingdom.
The external broadcasting services are at present transmitted from 50 high
power, high frequency transmitters: 40 in the United Kingdom and, for
relay purposes, two at Tebrau, near Singapore, and eight in Cyprus. A short¬
wave relay station on Ascension Island is under construction.
There are 128 studios for the domestic sound programmes, of which 57 /
are in London and 71 at various centres in the regional areas. The external
services use 38 London studios. There are also 34 semi-automatic studios
which can be operated by programme officials without engineering staff.
The domestic sound services consist of the Home Service, the Light
Programme and the Third Network. These separate, but inter-related,
services enable the BBC to provide a wide range of programmes.
Each of the services has its own characteristics: the Home Service is
planned as a general service providing the principal news and information
services of the BBC. In addition a wide range of music and drama is presented;
broadcasts for schools are an important feature. The various regions of
Britain have their own version of the Home Service. The main purpose of
the Light Programme is to provide a service of entertainment and relaxation
for the majority including, particularly, light and popular music. The Third
Network includes the Music Programme which provides a range of music
during the day, educational sessions, a sports service, and the Third Programme
which offers works of artistic and intellectual distinction each evening.
The external broadcasting services of the BBC are intended to provide a link
of culture, information and entertainment between the peoples of the United
Kingdom and those in other parts of the world; to present events of world¬
wide importance with speed and accuracy; and generally to reflect British
opinion and the British way of life. These services are broadcast in English
and in 40 other languages for over 660 hours a week, more than the combined
output of the BBC’s domestic sound and television services.
The services are divided into the European Services and the Overseas
Services:
The European Services broadcast over 250 programme hours a week and
are subdivided into four regional groupings: South European (Spain,
Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Israel), Central European (Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Poland, Finland), East European (Soviet Union, Rumania,
Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Albania), and German. A French language service
provides programmes for both European and African listeners and there is
also an English service directed to the whole of Europe.
The Overseas Services, which are directed to countries outside Europe,
broadcast over 400 programme hours a week. They comprise the BBC
World Service with its audience of English-speaking listeners, which broad¬
casts for nearly 23 hours every day and a number of regional services in
English and 22 other languages. These regional services consist of the African
Service with programmes in English and African vernaculars; the Arabic
Television

Service; the Eastern and Far Eastern Services with programmes in several
oriental languages; the Latin American Service with programmes in Spanish
and Portuguese; and other special programmes in Maltese for Malta, in
French for Canada and in French and English for Mauritius, as well as
in English for North America, Australia, New Zealand, the’ Caribbean
countries and the Falkland Islands.
The external broadcasting services include the Transcription, English by
Radio and Television, Topical Tapes, and Monitoring Services. The
Transcription Service records on disc 1,000 BBC sound programmes annually,
distributing them to broadcasting organisations in all parts of the world!
The English by Radio and Television service produces English lessons with
commentaries in 38 languages, reaching an audience of several millions by
direct transmission from London or by recorded broadcasts from local
stations. The English by Television series have been shown in 45 countries.
Two television courses designed for teachers of English are also available and
have been produced in collaboration with the British Council. BBC English
courses on gramophone records and tape, with companion textbooks, are on
sale in almost all parts of the world. The World Topical Tapes Services in
English serves some 500 stations in 42 countries; it provides tapes on current
affairs for early use. The Monitoring Service reports foreign broadcasts from
some 50 countries in 35 languages and works under a reciprocal agreement
with its American counterpart for monitored material from the Far East and
other areas inaudible in the United Kingdom.
In the external services the Corporation works in consultation with the
government departments concerned with overseas relations which prescribe
the languages and hours of broadcasting, but the day-to-day content of the
programmes remains the responsibility of the BBC.
The BBC maintains offices in New York, Ottawa, Toronto, Buenos Aires,
Sydney, New Delhi, Singapore, Beirut, Berlin and Paris to encourage local
interest in the BBC, to promote the use of BBC television and radio material
and to provide the BBC with advice and help concerning programmes.
The offices are also responsible for promoting good relations with the local
broadcasting organisations.
In 1936 the BBC launched the world’s first regular public service by high
definition television. Two programmes are now being transmitted: BBC 1,
which is available to over 99 per cent of the population of Britain from 73
transmitting stations, and BBC 2, at present from eight stations, which is
expected to reach 60 per cent of the population by the end of 1966. BBC 1 is
transmitted on 405 lines on very high frequency (VHF) and BBC 2 on 625
lines on ultra high frequency (UHF). In the course of a year, the BBC tele¬
vision service broadcasts on a national network for 7,450 hours.
BBC Television Enterprises undertakes the world-wide sale of BBC
television programmes; it also purchases material for the use of the BBC
television service and conducts business relations with other television
organisations throughout the world.
BBC studio productions in London come from six main studios. The BBC
also has fully equipped regional studio centres at Manchester, Birmingham,
Cardiff, Glasgow, Bristol and Belfast; these centres contribute programmes
to the national network as well as producing others of only local interest.
In addition a number of small interview studios (used mainly for short
insertions into news bulletins) have been established throughout the country.
Outside broadcasting covers most parts of Britain with its mobile units.

BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The first regular independent television (ITV) service was inaugurated in
I955 ^7 a programme transmission from the ITA London station at Croydon.
In 1966 programmes were being transmitted from 30 stations throughout
Britain reaching 97 per cent of the population.
Independent television is organised as a regional structure. Programmes
are produced at studio centres in Aberdeen, Belfast, Cardiff, Carlisle, Dover,
Glasgow, Leeds, London, Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Plymouth,
St. Helier, and Southampton; they are designed either for local or national
broadcasting.
Both the BBC and the ITV services include news, talks and documentary
programmes and programmes of music, drama, light entertainment, films,
sport and outside broadcasts. Religious broadcasts, broadcasts for schools
and educational programmes for adults are also features. There are programmes
designed to stimulate thought and widen people’s horizons, such as interviews
with outstanding personalities, investigations into matters of public interest,
and programmes on the arts; and there are programmes of specialised interest
such as children’s and family programmes, programmes for women, regional
programmes and programmes on agriculture. In addition, there are special
series of party political broadcasts under arrangements agreed between the
broadcasting authorities and the leading political parties. The addition of a
second BBC channel has made longer programmes possible, allowing subjects
to be examined in greater depth.
The BBC seeks to avoid giving publicity to any individual firm or organised
interest except when it is necessary to provide effective and informative
programmes under the terms of the Charter. It must not broadcast sponsored
programmes or any commercial advertisement. Advertisements are broadcast
on independent television subject to the relevant provisions in the Television
Act, namely, that there should be no sponsoring of programmes by adver¬
tisers, that all advertisements should be clearly distinguishable as such and
recognisably separate from the programme, and the amount of time given to
advertising should not be so great as to detract from the value of the pro¬
grammes as a medium of information, education and entertainment. The ITA
has drawn up a Code governing standards and practice in advertising, giving
guidance about the types and methods of advertisement that may not be used.
Certain types of advertising are prohibited, notably the advertising of
cigarettes (under a Government ruling of 1965), betting, and ‘cures’ for
alcoholism. Advertisements may not be inserted in certain types of programmes
including religious services and broadcasts to schools. The cost of inserting
advertisements in the ITA service is borne by the advertisers, who pay the
programme companies for advertising time.
Audience research is conducted both by the BBC and ITA. The BBC
measures the size of audiences by interviewing a representative sample of
the population each day about its listening and viewing on the previous day.
Panels of representative listeners and viewers regularly give their opinions
on programmes they have seen or heard. Special investigations are also made.
The ITA sponsors audience research by an independent research organisation
—Television Audience Measurement (TAM).
The Postmaster General is advised on the technical aspects of television
and VHP sound broadcasting by the Television Advisory Committee,
which consists of an independent chairman, the Director-General of the BBC,

Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and
engineering staffs of the BBC, the ITA, the Post Office and the radio industry.
Following a review of three systems of colour transmission, based on the
NTSC (National Television Systems Committee—US), SECAM {Sequential
Couleur avec Memoire—France) and PAL (Phase Alternation Line—Federal
Republic of Germany), the Government announced its acceptance of the
Television Advisory Committee’s recommendation that a colour service
should be introduced on 625 lines only using the PAL system (see p. 449).
Other recent studies include: investigations into various systems of stereo¬
phonic sound transmissions (stereophonic broadcasts on the BBC’s Music and
Third Programmes began in 1966); methods of improving studio acoustics,
microphones and loudspeakers; and the development of unattended relay
transmitters of low power for providing a television and VHF sound service
to small and isolated communities. The BBC has also developed equipment
for converting television programmes from European standards to those of
North America, and the world’s first electronic television standards converter
which operates unattended and gives converted pictures of far higher quality
than those of earlier converters.
The BBC and the ITA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The union
now has 28 full members among the broadcasting organisations in Western
Europe and 40 associate members (mostly from outside Europe, including
the United States of America and many of the nations of the Commonwealth).
It maintains a technical monitoring station, where frequency measurements
and other observations on broadcasting stations are carried out.
The range of inter-Commonwealth broadcasting co-operation is very
wide. The BBC provides a large amount of technical aid, particularly in staff
training to Commonwealth broadcasting organisations. The BBC, the
Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation,
the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation, the Rank Organisation and
Reuters have jointly set up Visnews Ltd., a Commonwealth and international
newsfilm agency which provides a reliable service of international news on
film for subscribers who operate television services, produce cinema news¬
reels or acquire newsfilm for any other purposes, including education,
anywhere in the world.
Both the BBC and the independent television companies are associated
with the Centre for Educational Television Overseas (CETO) which assists
the advancement of education in developing countries through television.
The centre receives a government grant totalling £100,000 over five years,
but most of its funds come from private sources, including the independent
television companies. The BBC provides free technical and other facilities.
Training in television work is also provided for overseas trainees at the
Thomson Centre, in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a charitable
trust.
The BBC and the ITA also participate in the work of the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU)—the United Nations specialised agency
responsible for the regulation and control of all international telecommuni¬
cation services (including sound and television), for the allocation and

registration of all radio frequencies and, through its international consultative

The BBC is a regular contributor to the network of European television
(Eurovision). This network now includes 23 organisations in Western Euro¬
pean member countries; the exchange of television programmes between them
is arranged by the EBU, which maintains an International Television
Co-ordination Centre (Eurovision) in Brussels. The range of Eurovision is
steadily increasing as countries expand their networks and facilities, and new
countries participate. Successful programme exchanges have also been made
between Moscow and London by both the BBC and the independent
television companies.
The first inter-continental television relay across the Atlantic by means of
Telstar, the communication satellite, was seen in Britain on nth July 1962.
The first live programme exchanges between America and Europe via Telstar
were televised on 23rd July 1962. Further exchanges have been achieved
by means of the subsequent satellites Relay, Telstar II and Early Bird;
successful direct live transmissions have been effected between Japan and
Europe. On 2nd May 1965 the Early Bird synchronous satellite marked a
further significant advance in inter-continental television by the first
transatlantic exchange of programmes; simultaneous two-way live television
was achieved for the first time between Europe and America. Early Bird is
stationary relative to the earth over the Atlantic, and thus permits continuous
contact between ground stations on opposite sides of the North Atlantic.

THE PRESS
The British press caters for all political views, different levels of education
and a wide range of interests. It is not subject to State control or censorship.
The British public buys more newspapers per person than any other in the
world. It has been estimated1 that for every 100 inhabitants of Britain 50
copies of daily papers are sold every day. (Next comes Sweden with 46 per
100 inhabitants.) Circulation figures of individual newspapers are proportion¬
ately high: five of the daily morning newspapers, one London evening paper
and five of the Sunday papers have circulations in the millions. These high
figures are largely explained by the fact that the London morning and Sunday
papers have national circulations, that is, they are distributed throughout the
United Kingdom, and are available almost everywhere on the day of publication.
Britain imports just over half its newsprint requirements, about 1^ million
tons annually, while the rest is made from imported raw materials. The average
size of national morning papers varies between 14 and 32 pages. Prices of daily
newspapers vary from 4d. to 6d. (for The Times). Sunday papers are consider¬
ably larger and prices run up to qd. In addition to their normal paging some
newspapers carry occasional supplements and a few provide regular weekly
colour supplements.
According to The Newspaper Press Directory2 there are about 120 daily and
Sunday newspapers and just over 1,200 weekly local papers (dealing mainly
with news of interest to the region where they are sold) published in Greater
London and almost every sizeable town in the rest of the country. There
are also certain specialised daily and weekly papers, the circulations of which
are limited not by region, but by interest; for instance, sporting papers,
papers in foreign languages for groups of nationals of other lands resident in
Britain, and religious papers.
Ownership of the newspaper press is varied: it includes individual owners,
two or more partner proprietors, local printing and publishing firms, news¬
paper companies owning between one and half a dozen papers, or press groups
controlling a chain of newspapers in different parts of the country and with
extensive diversified interests in the field of communications as a whole. The
largest press groups are: International Publishing Corporation Limited;
Associated Newspapers Limited; Beaverbrook Newspapers Limited; and
(for the provincial newspapers) the Thomson Organisation Limited; United
Newspapers Publications Limited; and Westminster Press Provincial News¬
papers Limited.
Some newspaper groups also have holdings in independent television
contracting companies3 and extensive interests in periodicals. The Inter-
1 World Communications, 1964, UNESCO.
2 Changes in the number of newspapers occur constantly; figures are based on the
1965 edition of The Newspaper Press Directory.
3 The Television Act 1963 stipulates that, if it appears to the Independent Television
Authority at any time that newspaper shareholdings in television programme companies
have led or are leading to results which are contrary to the public interest, the
Authority may, with the consent of the Postmaster General, notify the companies that
their programmes may cease to be transmitted.

national Publishing Corporation is the largest publisher of periodicals in

Although pronounced views may be expressed in newspapers and their
political leanings may be obvious, they are financially independent of any
political party and not obliged to follow any specific party line. In order to
preserve their character and traditions, certain newspapers and periodicals
(including The Guardian, The Observer and The Economist) are governed by
arrangements which vest ownership of the undertaking in trustees, or operate
it in accordance with a deed of trust, or provide that the transfer of shares be
in the hands of trustees. The trend towards concentration of newspaper
ownership, which began in the early nineteen hundreds and was accentuated
after the second world war, giving rise to some public concern, was studied
by two Royal Commissions on the Press, one of which reported in 1949 and
the other in 1962. Part of the formula for newspaper take-overs recommended
by the latter has been incorporated in the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965
which provides, in general terms, that the transfer of a newspaper or news¬
paper assets to a newspaper proprietor whose newspapers have an average
daily circulation amounting, with that of the newspaper to be taken over, to
500,000 or more copies, shall be subject to the approval of the Board of
Trade.
Technological advances in the newspaper industry include the introduction
of web-offset newspaper printing and photo-type setting and developments
in the use of computers and facsimile transmission.
Ten morning papers are ‘national’ in the sense of circulating throughout
the British Isles, and there are eight ‘national’ Sunday papers (see Table 33).
Most papers with big circulations have northern editions published in
Manchester which, after London, is the largest press centre in England.
The leading Scottish papers {The Scotsman and The Glasgow Herald) have a
considerable circulation outside Scotland. The two London evening papers
each have affiliations with a national daily, but draw their readership very
largely from people living within 50 miles of London.
The provincial newspapers of England and Wales, numbering over 80 morning
or evening dailies and Sundays and some 850 papers appearing once (a few
twice) a week, provide the general and local news expected by readers whose
daily life and interests are known to, and shared by, the newspaper staff. One
or two have national reputations and give full coverage to world news, but
apart from these, few pursue any strong political line. The total circulation of
the provincial morning and evening papers is about 7^ million. Of the morning
papers The Journal (Newcastle), the Yorkshire Post (Leeds), the Northern Echo
(Darlington) and the Western Mail (Cardiff) have circulations of over 100,000
and two provincial Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne)
and the Sunday Mercury (Birmingham)—-have circulations of over 200,000.
Individual circulation figures of provincial evening papers start at about
25,000; most are in the 50,000-60,000 range, but several reach over the
100,000 mark. Most weekly papers have circulations in the 8,000-35,000
range. The provincial newspaper, often read far more thoroughly
than the national daily, is a valuable medium for national and local
advertising.
The London local weeklies (145) include papers for every district in
Greater London.

Scotland has six morning, seven evening and two Sunday newspapers,
excluding the Scottish editions of the Daily Express, Daily Mail and Sunday
Express. The leading morning papers are The Glasgow Herald (circulation
83,937) and The Scotsman, published in Edinburgh (circulation 72,865).
Others are: the Daily Record and the Noon Record, published in Glasgow;
the Courier and Advertiser, published in Dundee; and the Press and Journal
of Aberdeen. Evening papers include the Edinburgh Evening News and
Dispatch, Glasgow’s Evening Times and Evening Citizen, Dundee’s Evening
Telegraph and Post, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express
and the Greenock Telegraph and Clyde Shipping Gazette. The Sunday papers
are the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Post.
Weekly newspapers published in Scotland number about 150. The most
widely known are the Weekly Scotsman and the People's Journal.
Northern Ireland has two morning papers, one evening paper and one
Sunday paper, all published in Belfast: they are The News-Letter (Unionist)
THE PRESS
461
and the Irish News (Nationalist), the evening Belfast Telegraph and the
Sunday News first published in March 1965. There are 43 weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland, with circulations ranging from about 2,600 to over
22,000. The majority are published by individual companies.
One daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in Cardiff, has a
circulation of 103,006 mainly in southern Wales. In North Wales the
Liverpool Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening
papers published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff, the South
Wales Argus, Newport, and the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea. North
Wales is served by the Liverpool Echo and to a smaller extent by the Manchester
Evening News and Chronicle.
The weekly press (61 papers) includes the English language papers (by
far the largest category), some of which carry the articles in Welsh; three
bilingual papers; and 11 papers in Welsh, of which five are denominational.
The Channel Islands have two daily (evening) papers (one in Guernsey and
one in Jersey), the Guernsey Star with morning and evening editions and
two weeklies which also circulate in Alderney and Sark. The Isle of Man Times
is issued from Mondays to Wednesdays with a special weekly edition which is
published on Friday: there are four other weeklies.
There are over 4,700 periodical publications classified as ‘general’, ‘specialised’,
trade and technical’ and ‘professional’. They include magazines of general
interest; women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals
for all denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport,
gardening, hobbies, and humour; journals specialising in various subjects
such as politics, finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and
the arts; trade and technical publications; professional periodicals; the
publications of learned societies, regiments, universities, colleges, schools,
and other associations; periodicals produced by trade unions for their members;
and ‘house journals’, produced by industrial organisations mainly for their
staffs.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Woman (3,007,279);
Woman's Own (2,208,176); Woman's Weekly (1,480,179); Woman's Realm
(1>335>921)i Weekend (1,183,695); Reveille (1,125,995); Woman's Mirror
(861,173); together with the Radio Times (4,330,540) and TV Times
(2,692,818). A large part of the periodical press, in particular the trade and
technical publications and the journals of opinion, have a considerable
circulation outside the United Kingdom and are an important export. Some
150 million copies are distributed annually throughout the world and earn
about fio million a year.
The publication of the trade and technical journals, now one of the more
important sections of the British publishing industry, ranges in frequency
from weekly to quarterly. Expert staff are employed on these journals, many
of which also offer an enquiry service of especial value to overseas readers.
The leading weekly journals of opinion are The Economist (circulation
84»338), a politically independent publication covering topics from a wider
angle than its title implies; the New Statesman (circulation 93,203), which
is a review of politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist
political tendency; the Spectator (36,647), which covers much the same
subjects from an independent conservative standpoint; and Tribune, which
has a strongly left-wing but anti-communist bias. The Statist, independent,
462

specialises in the financial and industrial aspects of world affairs. Punch
(116,766), traditionally the leading humorous periodical, has in recent years
devoted increasing attention to public affairs. New Society, which covers the
sociological aspects of current affairs, has rapidly established its reputation,
as has New Scientist, which reports on the progress of science and technology
in terms which the non-specialist can understand.
Monthly and quarterly journals, particularly the literary and political
journals and those specialising in international and Commonwealth affairs,
generally speaking appeal to the more serious type of reader.
In addition to the circulation of periodicals published in England, a farming
weekly, the Welsh Farm News, and several monthly and quarterly journals
in both Welsh and English are produced in Wales.
Four monthly illustrated periodicals are published in Scotland: Scottish
Field, Scotland's Magazine, the Scots Magazine and Scotland’, and two
weeklies devoted to farming interests, Farming News and the Scottish
Farmer. Among literary journals, probably the most famous is Blackwood's
published in Edinburgh. Numerous popular magazines are also published in
Scotland.
In Northern Ireland, weekly, monthly and quarterly publications cover
farming, the linen industry, building, motoring and politics.
News Agencies There are three principal British news agencies:
Reuters Ltd., which is a world news agency owned by the newspapers of
the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand and operated by them on
a non-profit-making basis under the terms of a deed of trust which guarantees
the independence and integrity of the news service and ensures that all profits
are used to develop it. Founded in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1850 and transferred
to London in 1851, Reuters has offices in many countries and maintains
several hundred correspondents throughout the world, supplying a continuous
report of foreign news to the London newsroom. This is then distributed to
the national newspapers, to the radio and television news services and,
through an extensive private network of communications, to news media
in almost every part of the world.
Press Association Ltd., which is owned collectively by provincial newspapers
in the British Isles. The Association distributes home news within the
British Isles, supplies the same home news to Reuters and its associated
agencies for distribution abroad and distributes to British newspapers
outside London the overseas news of Reuters and the Associated Press. It
also provides wire photo coverage of the British Isles to the national and
provincial press and to overseas subscribers, and distributes by wire the
Associated Press world photo service to provincial newspapers. All profits
are used to develop the service.
Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd. (Extel), supplies financial and sporting
news to newspapers, the broadcasting organisations, overseas news agencies
and private subscribers; a comprehensive news service to clubs, hotels,
business houses, and similar companies; and, by means of its statistical card
service, the latest information about more than 5,000 companies whose
shares are quoted on the London Stock Exchange, and the principal European,
North American and Australian companies.
Two other agencies supply a general service of overseas news:
Associated Press, which is a branch of the Associated Press of America.
British United Press (Montreal and London), which is a subsidiary of
United Press International, an American agency.

A number of other United Kingdom, Commonwealth and foreign agencies
and news services have offices in London, and there are agencies in other
cities, specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical requirements.
Syndication of features is not as common in the United Kingdom as in some
countries, but a few agencies specialise in this type of work.
New entrants to journalism are trained under the national scheme run by
the National Council for the Training of Journalists, which represents the
principal press organisations. Training consists of ‘on-the-job’ experience,
supplemented by special courses in relevant subjects. Trainees are apprenticed
for three years after a six-month probationary period, and take a professional
examination at the end of their training. About 500 young reporters and
photographers enter the scheme each year.
The National Council also runs week-long practical courses for young
journalists to supplement experience gained on the job; training courses in
such subjects as science, financial and industrial reporting, and in sub-editing;
intensive courses for graduate entrants—between 40 and 50 graduates are
taken on by newspapers each year at present and the number is steadily
increasing; and a special course for trainees on periodicals.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Travelling Fellowship Scheme for
the training and education of young journalists throughout the Common¬
wealth, each year about ten journalists from overseas spend six months
in the United Kingdom: three months in the offices of newspapers or
periodicals and three months acquiring a general idea of life in Britain.
A limited number of travelling scholarships are also awarded to British
journalists to enable them to visit Commonwealth countries overseas.
The Thomson Foundation provides scholarships and organises training
courses at the Foundation’s Centre in Cardiff for journalists from all parts of
the world.
Both employers and employees in the industry are well organised. On the
employers’ side the most important organisations are the Newspaper
Proprietors Association, whose members are proprietors of the national
daily and Sunday newspapers; the Newspaper Society, which represents
the regional and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily Newspaper
Society which represents the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers in
Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors’ Association which represents
the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern Ireland
Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Proprietors Association, whose
membership embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical
publications and general magazines. On the employees’ side there are the
Institute of Journalists (loj), founded in 1884 as the National Association
of Journalists; and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), founded in
1907. The National Union of Journalists has a membership of some 19,500
(1966) working journalists and is the largest trade union confined to journalists
(including those working in radio and television and in public relations)
in the world; editors who have powers of dismissal are excluded from full
membership but may be associate members. The Institute of Journalists,
as it admits all qualified journalists on equal terms of membership, may
claim to be representative of the profession as a whole. Free-lance journalists
(who are not on the staff of any one paper or group of papers, but send
contributions to any journal) may belong to the NUJ or loj. An interim

arrangement has been accepted by the Councils of the NUJ and loj
providing that all members of each body should also become members of
the other body, without the payment of any additional subscription. Under
this arrangement the NUJ serves the trade union interests and the loj
the professional interests of the whole joint membership. The aims of these
organisations are the improvement of the economic status of journalists,
the promotion of their professional welfare, and the safeguarding of the status
of the press and its editorial staffs.
The main aims of the Guild of British Newspaper Editors are to sustain
the dignity of editorship, to raise and safeguard the professional status of
editors, to protect the rights and freedom of the press, and to improve the
education and training of journalists: the Guild has about 330 members. The
British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong.
The Printing and Kindred Trades Federation is the federation of the
printing trade unions which include the National Graphical Association;
the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades; and the Scottish Typographical
Association.
The Press Council, established in 1953 and reconstituted in 1963, has a lay
chairman and 25 members. Its aims are: to preserve the established freedom
of the British press; to maintain the character of the British press in
accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of
the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press; to
report on developments in the British press which may tend towards greater
concentration or monopoly; to make representation on appropriate occasions
to the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to press organisations
abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodical reports recording its work
and to review from time to time developments in the British press and the
factors affecting them. Reports, including statistics of the newspaper and
periodical press, are published annually.
The press in Britain has the same freedom as the individual to do and say
what it likes provided it does not transgress the law; in general, it is at
liberty to comment on matters of public interest. Apart from enactments
relating directly to such matters as the registration of newspapers, there are
no specific press laws but certain statutes include clauses which apply, in
particular or incidentally, to the press. These relate to such matters as
the extent of newspaper ownership in television companies; the transfer of
newspaper assets (see p. 459); the right of press representatives to be admitted
to meetings of local authorities; restrictions on the publication of (a) divorce
and domestic proceedings in courts of law, (b) advertisement and investment
circulars, which are governed by Acts dealing with fraud, and (c) advertise¬
ments of remedies for certain diseases, which are covered by public health
legislation; agreements between the Post Office and newspaper proprietors
on telegraphic communications, which must comply with telegraphs legis¬
lation; restrictions on certain types of prize competition; and copyrights,
which come under copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the work of the press are the lawTs on: libel and
defamation; contempt of court—a newspaper may not publish comments on
judges, magistrates or court proceedings which are likely to prejudice their

reputation for fairness, nor may it publish before or during a trial anything
which might tend to influence the result; and seditious libel, incitement to
disaffection and revealing official secrets.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the
majority of actions that do take place are libel actions brought by private
individuals. In such cases, the editor, proprietor, publisher, printer and
distributor of the newspaper, as well as the author of the article, may all be
held responsible.

Participation
Facilities for
Sport
In Britain, the word ‘sport’ is used generally to describe such activities as
organised outdoor games, athletics, field or country sports, indoor games,
aquatic sports, and such popular pursuits as horse-racing, dog-racing, show
jumping, riding, boxing, rock climbing, motor racing, cycling and rifle
shooting as well as those (for instance, archery, fencing, gliding and ice-skating)
which, although less popular judged by the number of participants and
spectators, all have their own devotees. Those who engage in sport may be
professionals (that is, paid players) or amateurs.1 Professionals keep up the
technical standards of the sports in which they take part and spectators make
a vital contribution by their enthusiasm and their financial support; but the
sporting life of Britain derives its character principally from the amateur
element—people who devote time and energy to organising sport and to
teaching and training, as well as the many thousands of all ages who engage
in sport for pleasure alone.
The Government is not directly concerned with the organisation or promotion
of sport in Britain but it has assumed responsibility for providing encourage¬
ment, guidance and help; it gives grant-aid to voluntary bodies towards
approved expenditure on playing fields, swimming baths and other facilities
for physical recreation, and to national voluntary organisations in Great
Britain for various purposes, including the holding of world championships
and events of similar importance in Britain. The Government is advised on
matters relating to the development of amateur sport and physical recreation
by the Sports Council, which also fosters co-operation between the Depart¬
ment of Education and Science and the Scottish Education Department and
the voluntary organisations concerned. The chairman of the Council is the
Joint Under-Secretary for Education and Science, who is the minister with
special responsibility for sport. Nine regional sports councils in England, one
council in Scotland and one in Wales, composed of representatives of local
authorities and sporting organisations, have also been set up. In Northern
Ireland the Ministry of Education is advised by the Youth and Sports Council.
The Council works in close co-operation with the Central Council of
Physical Recreation, the National Playing Fields Association, the Scottish
equivalents of these bodies, and the British Olympic Association.
Direct Exchequer assistance to sport and physical recreation (other than
in educational establishments) in Great Britain amounted to £1,224,000 in
1965-66. In Northern Ireland over £160,000 in grants was given to public
authorities and voluntary organisations for sports facilities and coaching
schemes.
The Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland require that
all publicly maintained schools shall provide for the physical education
1 Some sports, for example, athletics, Rugby Union football, hockey and rowing, are
entirely amateur, but in other sports the distinction between professional and amateur
status is becoming less strictly defined.

(gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swimming) of their pupils. Schools
in the national systems (excepting those solely for infants) must have their
own playing field, or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a
gymnasium; local authorities being encouraged to make these facilities
available also to public organisations. Facilities for, and instruction in, many
kinds of sport are likewise provided at the independent preparatory and public
schools and at the universities (some of which have departments of physical
education). Local authorities are empowered under the Public Health Acts
and the Physical Training and Recreation Acts to provide playing fields. They
also provide gymnasia, tennis courts, golf courses and swimming baths on an
increasing scale. Sports facilities for employees are provided by industrial and
commercial concerns.
The national voluntary organisations most closely concerned with the general
development of sport are the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the
Scottish Council of Physical Recreation, and the National Playing Fields
Association. The British Olympic Association, whose main functions are
connected with the participation of British teams and competitors in the
Olympic Games, is also interested in all matters likely to benefit sport or
physical recreation in Britain as a whole.
The Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR) is an association of all
national bodies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland concerned with the
development of post-school physical recreation. Its funds are partly raised by
voluntary contributions but it receives grants from the Department of Educa¬
tion and Science and from the Ministry of Education for Northern Ireland.
The Council consists of about 300 members. Of these over 200 are members
representing national bodies concerned wholly or in part with the development
of some branch of physical recreation—the governing bodies of games and
sport, the national outdoor activity and dance associations, the youth service
organisations, and many others concerned with education, physical education
and health. The Council’s headquarters are in London and it has nine
regional offices in other parts of England. Its activities in Wales are controlled
by a representative Welsh committee, and in Northern Ireland by a separate
section with its own executive committee.
Broadly, the Council’s function is to promote all forms of physical
recreation. Its activities include the organisation of courses for coaches and
instructors, courses in personal performance, lectures, displays and other
publicity events. In 1965-66 over 2,000 such courses, attended by nearly
63,000 people, were organised. Its staff give advisory, technical and adminis¬
trative help wherever required, but particularly to the headquarters, regional,
county and local branches of the constituent organisations and to local
educational authorities and industrial concerns. Its regional officers have been
appointed as secretaries to the newly formed Regional Sports Councils which
aim to promote co-operation and co-ordination in the provision of sports
facilities within their regions.
The Scottish Council of Physical Recreation (SCPR) is the counterpart in
Scotland of the CCPR, and has 140 affiliated organisations, including the
governing bodies of all the Scottish sports; it receives a grant-in-aid from
the Scottish Education Department.
The main aim of the National Playing Fields Association (NPFA) is to
stimulate the provision of playing fields and playgrounds, especially for
children, by publicity and financial assistance. Since its inception in 1925

it has distributed over ^1-7 million in the form of grants for playing field
and playground schemes and about £208,000 in the form of loans. It assists
more than 400 schemes a year.
The NPFA council is composed of representatives of the governing bodies
of various sports organisations, of the British Olympic Association and the
CCPR, and of a number of educational bodies, voluntary youth organisations,
physical education associations and local authorities. The national headquarters
in London employs a small full-time staff, including a technical and
research department which gives advice on all aspects of recreational
planning including the provision and layout of indoor and outdoor sports
facilities. It also advises on matters relating to children’s playgrounds, play
leadership schemes, and the play and recreational needs of children from
their earliest years. The Association derives its funds mainly from voluntary
contributions but it has recently been in receipt of a small contribution
towards administrative costs from the Department of Education and
Science.
The NPFA has branches in Scotland and Northern Ireland; there are also
branches in nearly every English and Welsh county; administration is carried
out, in the main, on a voluntary basis—in many cases in association with a
local authority or Rural Community Council.
There are five National Recreation Centres in Britain, outside London—two
in England, one in Wales and two in Scotland—administered by the CCPR
and the SCPR. The centres, all but one of which were established by voluntary
funds, provide a wide range of courses for coaches, instructors and per¬
formers in many games, sports and other physical activities. A programme of
improvements, the capital cost of which will be borne by the Department of
Education and Science, and for Scotland, by the Scottish Education Depart¬
ment, is being carried out and will continue over the next two or three years.
A sailing centre, likewise to be administered by the CCPR, is to be established
at Cowes, Isle of Wight, to provide courses on sailing, boat handling, cruising,
navigation, racing, boat maintenance and boat building, for school and youth
groups and adults.
The Crystal Palace National Recreation Centre in London covers 36 acres;
has a main stadium with seating for 12,000 spectators; a sports hall with
seating for 2,000 spectators; a swimming hall with pools of Olympic dimen¬
sions, a teaching pool and a gallery for 2,000 spectators; an indoor cricket
school; practice rooms suitable for all indoor activities; a hostel for 140
residents; and staff housing. The Centre, managed by the CCPR, is designed
for international competitions as well as to provide training facilities for
leaders, coaches and athletes.
Outdoor games played in Britain include team games such as football,
cricket, and hockey, and games such as lawn tennis and golf, in which
individuals or couples match their skill. Judged by the number of participants
and spectators, the most popular of the team games are football and cricket,
and the most popular of the individual games is lawn tennis.
Although football of a kind was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier,
as an organised game it dates from just over a century ago. One type of
football, in which only the feet are used, was adopted at Cambridge in 1848;
the other type, in which the ball is handled as well as kicked, was first played
at Rugby School, whence it derives its name, and was adopted by the
Blackheath football club in 1859.
SPORT
469
In England the controlling body of the non-handling game, Association
Football (‘soccer’), is the Football Association (FA) formed in 1863. Its chief
function is to promote the interests of the game and to prevent infringement
of the agreed rules; it also arranges for the instruction of promising young
players (some £20,000 is spent annually on coaching); organises various
matches and competitions, including the international matches played by
England, the Amateur Cup competition, two national youth competitions,
and the competition for its own leading trophy, the Football Association
Challenge Cup; and chooses and manages English international teams. Over
350 clubs are registered with the FA, more than 250 as full members and
between 120 and 130 as associate members. There are also some 25,000 clubs
affiliated to county (that is, district or regional) associations.The FA derives its
main income from subscriptions and admission charges to international and
cup matches, and ploughs back a large portion of the money into the game.
Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have their own controlling bodies:
the Scottish Football Association, the Irish Football Association and the
Football Association of Wales.
The principal professional matches in England and Wales (played once or
twice weekly) are controlled by the Football League, which comprises over
90 professional clubs in these countries. The funds of the League are derived
largely from contributions paid by member clubs in the form of a levy of
4 per cent of the net gate receipts from league matches, after allowable
expenses have been deducted, and from annual payments from the leading
football pools promoters for the use of league fixture lists.
In Scotland the Scottish Football League comprises 37 clubs; Northern
Ireland has its own league. Clubs belonging to the English and Scottish
Leagues are organised in divisions, the members of which compete against
one another for the respective league championships. Their positions in
the divisional tables are decided at the end of the season by the number of
points gained for wins or draws. During the season about 30 million people
watch league football matches and gate receipts usually amount to between
£5 million and £6 million.
Several million people stake small weekly sums on the results of the league
matches by filling in what are known as ‘pools’ coupons. The odds against
winning anything in the pools are very great, but the prizes are high and
individual payments of £300,000 are occasionally made. The promoters
of the pools deduct varying amounts from the stakes for commission and
expenses.
The annual competition for the FA Cup is organised on a knock-out basis
and the Cup Final is one of the most important football matches of the year
in England; it is always played at Wembley Stadium, near London, which
can accommodate some 100,000 spectators. The Scottish Cup Final is played
at Hampden Park, Glasgow. The matches between England, Scotland, Wales
and Ireland also excite great interest, as do other international matches.
For the World Cup games in 1966 the Government made available
£500,000 to the Football Association towards the cost of facilities necessary
for the games to be suitably staged. Between 80 and 90 per cent was spent on
permanent improvements; four-fifths of the amount was paid as a grant and
the rest was provided as a loan. Sixteen countries sent teams to Britain to
take part in this competition—the cup being won by the English team.
There are many more amateur association football players than there are
professionals (the comparative figures are nearly 1 million amateurs, including
schoolboys and members of the armed forces, to 7,000 or 8,000 professionals)0,
470
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Cricket
but with one or two notable exceptions their teams cannot compete on equal
terms, since professional teams are more systematically and intensively
trained. Amateur teams compete against each other for the Football
Association Amateur Challenge Cup.
Rugby Football (‘rugger’) is played under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union, established in 1871. The rules of the game are completely
different from those that govern soccer, and there are 15 players, instead of 11,
in a side. International matches between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland,
and France are played regularly at the leading rugby football grounds of each
country, including Twickenham, London—the headquarters of the Rugby
Football Union—and there are tours by international teams to and from
New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Other important rugger matches
are the county championship competitions, the annual match between the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the Hospitals’ Cup final, and the
Inter-Services tournament.
Membership of the Rugby Union is strictly confined to amateur clubs. In
the north of England Rugby League Football is played. This is a thirteen-a-side
game played by professionals as well as amateurs. The Rugby Football League
(instituted in 1895) regularly sends touring teams to Australia and New
Zealand and has annual international games, professional and amateur, against
France. The major match of the season—the Rugby League Challenge Cup
Final—has attracted crowds of 95,000 at Wembley Stadium in recent
years.
Cricket is often called the English national game. The exact date of its origin
is not recorded, but it is known that the game was played at Guildford Grammar
School during the sixteenth century, and by the beginning of the eighteenth
century it was popular both in the villages of England and on the larger country
estates. The game has been played more or less as it is played today since the
adoption of a generally accepted set of laws in 1744. About 1750 a cricket
club was formed in the Hampshire village of Hambledon; within 20 years
it had made an outstanding name for itself and acquired a membership
representative of patrons of cricket from all over England. In 1787 the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), now the governing body of cricket, was
founded, with its headquarters in London on a site in Dorset Fields rented
by a Yorkshireman called Thomas Lord. In the year 1810—11 the MCC
moved its headquarters to a ground near Regent’s Park, keeping the name
Lord's] four years later Lord's transferred to a third ground, at St. John’s Wood
(in the same neighbourhood) where it has remained ever since. Other clubs
that sprang up all over England during the nineteenth century recognised the
MCC’s authority, and nowadays all cricket is played according to the ‘laws of
cricket’ as laid down by the MCC in consultation with cricketing organisations
in Britain and the overseas Commonwealth.
In England cricket is played in schools and universities, and almost all
towns and villages have their cricket teams which play at least one match a
week from May to September; in the London area a large number of pitches
are provided by the local authorities besides many leased or owned by clubs.
Apart from the university match between Oxford and Cambridge and
certain representative games, the greater part of first-class cricket is played
in a county championship between seventeen ‘first-class counties’. (The
other counties have a ‘minor counties championship’ of their own.) Famous
grounds besides Lord's are the Oval, Kennington, London, headquarters of
the Surrey Cricket Club; Old Trafford, Manchester; Headingley, Leeds; and
Trent Bridge, Nottingham.
Lawn Tennis
Golf
In the late nineteenth century more amateurs played cricket than economic
conditions in the twentieth century allow: with first-class matches lasting
three days and each county playing up to 30 matches in a season, the number
of cricketers who can afford to play as true amateurs declined and the
distinction between amateur and professional in the first-class game has
now been abolished. League cricket, which is a feature of the game in the
north of England, is played by teams mainly consisting of amateur Saturday
afternoon players with one or more professionals, many of whom are
distinguished players from other Commonwealth countries. The MCC is
an entirely amateur body, but a distinguished band of retired professional
cricketers 01 the highest merit have been elected to honorary membership.
In addition to county championships, matches known as ‘test matches’
are played regularly between a number of Commonwealth countries. The first
of these matches was played at Melbourne, Australia, in 1877, between
England and Australia. Present-day test matches last 30 hours (spread over
five or six days); they arouse great popular interest and are widely reported
in the press and on radio and television.
The forerunner of modern lawn tennis (the game known as^Vw de paume) was
introduced into England from France in the fifteenth century and a ‘tennis
court, built by Henry VIII, is still in use at Hampton Court. The modern
game, first played in England in 1873, quickly became very popular; in 1877
the words ‘and lawn tennis’ were added to the title of the All England Croquet
Club at Wimbledon, near London, and in the same year the first champion¬
ships were played. The Lawn Tennis Association, the controlling body of the
game in Britain, was founded in 1888. The governing body of the game in the
world (the International Lawn Tennis Federation, with headquarters in
London and Paris) was founded in 1913.
The number of people who play lawn tennis has greatly increased during
the present century, particularly since the game has spread to practically
every country in the world. In Britain the game is played in almost all girls’
schools and in very many boys’ schools where the pupils are of secondary
school age. It is also played on private courts, in parks and recreation grounds
and at several thousand tennis clubs.
The annual championships held at Wimbledon for two weeks at the end
of June and beginning of July are the main event of the lawn tennis season
in Britain and, in fact, in the world. These championships, in which men and
women of many nationalities compete, draw large crowds; there is accom¬
modation for over 30,000 spectators in the grounds of the All England Club
—14,000 can be accommodated round the centre court where the finals are
played. Other tournaments which attract a good deal of attention are: the
British Hardcourt Championships, the British Junior Championships, and
the County Championships. There are also competitions for boys’ and girls’
schools on a national basis, and the Foundation Cup (for women). The most
important international event is the Davis Cup (for men). Women players
from Britain and the United States of America also compete annually for the
Wightman Cup.
Golf originated in Scotland, where for centuries it has borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, but it did not become really well known in the other
countries of the United Kingdom until towards the end of the nineteenth
century. Since then, however, it has gained steadily in popularity and
nowadays there are golf courses in the vicinity of many towns and villages—
some owned by local authorities, but the majority owned by golf clubs.

The headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club is St. Andrews,
Scotland.
The main event of the golfing year is the British Open Golf Championship,
which was first played in i860; other important matches include the Walker
Cup (for amateurs) and the Ryder Cup (for professionals), both played
between Britain and America; the Amateur Championship; World Amateur
Team Championship; and the Ladies Championship.
Variants of hockey (as distinct from ice-hockey) have been played in Britain
for at least five centuries. Modern hockey, however, dates from the formation
(in 1886) of the Hockey Association, which standardised the rules relating
to men’s hockey. Nowadays there are some 1,100 men’s hockey clubs affiliated to
the Hockey Association and male hockey players include over 35,000 adults
and some 50,000 schoolboys. Although there are no professional county teams
and no cup ties, a county championship was instituted in 1957. In addition,
regular amateur international matches (inaugurated in 1894) are played.
In Britain hockey is more commonly played by women than by men.
About 70,000 adult and some 1,015,000 schoolgirl players are members of
women’s clubs in England. The controlling bodies are: the All England
Women’s Hockey Association (founded 1895), the Irish Ladies Hockey Union,
the Scottish Women’s Hockey Association, the Welsh Women’s Hockey
Association. The first international women’s hockey match took place in 1896.
Nowadays such a match is played annually at Wembley Stadium (in addition
to those played in other parts of the country), where it attracts some 56,000
spectators.
Lacrosse, adapted from the game played by the Iroquois Indians of North
America, is played mainly by women—in girls’ schools, at lacrosse clubs, and
at universities. International matches are played, as well as regional matches,
by women’s teams representing the East, West, South, North and Midlands
of England, under the auspices of the All England Women’s Lacrosse
Association.
The men’s game, of which the controlling body is the English Lacrosse
Union, is played in 10 universities, six teacher-training colleges, and by clubs
and schools, mainly in the London, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and
Nottingham areas. Matches played include county matches, an annual fixture
between the North of England and the South, and international matches
between Australia, America and England.
Netball is a popular game for girls and women. The controlling body is the
All England Netball Association to which are affiliated the English county
associations, the netball clubs of the three Women’s Services and sections of
the national youth organisations for girls and women. Inter-county and home
international matches are played regularly and inter-Commonwealth tours
are arranged.
Polo, of which the earliest records are Persian, was first played by the British
in India, and brought to England in 1869. The governing body of British
polo is the Hurlingham Polo Association to which all the Commonwealth
polo associations and that of South Africa are affiliated. Polo players are a
very small section of the community, for the cost of keeping polo ponies is
high. However, many of the clubs now own trained ponies which are hired
out to members at moderate cost. There are about 375 players handicapped
by the Hurlingham Polo Association, but many less expert players take part
in club games for which they may be locally handicapped.

Public interest in polo has increased in recent years and large numbers of
spectators attend inter-club tournaments and matches between high-handicap
teams composed of players from several countries.
The game of bowls has been played in Britain since the thirteenth century.
Nowadays the flat green game is regulated, as far as the English Bowling
Association is concerned, by the International Bowling Board (IBB), founded
in 1905. The Bowling Associations of Ireland, Scotland and Wales also come
under and play to the laws laid down by the IBB, but there are other bowling
associations in England—the English Bowling Federation, the Crown Green
Association and the English Women’s Bowling Association—which are not
under the IBB’s control.
During the summer bowls is played on bowling greens in the open; in
winter it is played on indoor greens, which are increasing in number. At one
time regarded as a pastime for the elderly, the game is now played by people
of all ages. Over 2,620 bowling clubs in England are affiliated to the English
Bowling Association alone. International, inter-county matches, and national
championship competitions of singles, pairs, triples and fours are played.
The popularity of mountaineering has greatly increased in recent years. The
number of clubs in the British Mountaineering Council (BMC) and the
Association of Scottish Climbing Clubs, the representative bodies of the sport,
has increased to over 160 in the last six years, mainly by the addition of smaller
town and district clubs and university and college clubs to the older larger
clubs such as the Alpine Club (founded in 1857, the oldest mountaineering
club in the world), the Climbers’ Club, the Scottish Mountaineering Club and
the Fell and Rock Climbing Club. A number of local education authorities,
as well as national bodies such as the YMCA, the Scouts and the Central
Council of Physical Recreation, have established mountaineering training
centres in the hills. Training courses are run jointly by the CCPR and BMC,
the Mountaineering Association, the Youth Hostels Association and other
bodies, and many schools have mountaineering sections. Membership of the
known clubs is about 15,000, but several times this number take part in
climbing and mountaineering.
British mountaineers have taken a leading part in exploring most of the
great ranges of the world and in climbing their peaks; for example, the first
ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865, of Everest in 1953, and of Kangchenjunga
in In recent years frequent expeditions have gone to far off mountains,
to Greenland, Alaska, the Andes, Patagonia, the Caucasus and the Pamirs,
as well as the Himalayas.
Ski-ing in Scotland has become very popular, especially at the winter sports
centres established in the Cairngorms, Deeside, Glencoe and Glenshee,
where ski-lifts, ski-tows and professional instruction are now available.
Amateur athletics, which include running (track, road and cross-country)
relay racing, jumping, hurdling, throwing and race-walking, are governed by
the Amateur Athletic Association (AAA), which was founded in 1880 to
encourage amateur athletics, to improve the management of amateur athletic
meetings by the establishment of uniform regulations, and to promote annual
championship meetings. The Association, whose membership increased
rapidly, is now organised from club to national level by honorary officers
and managed by representative members appointed by the Northern, Midland,
Southern and Welsh areas and by affiliated clubs and associations (amateur

athletic clubs, schools and youth organisations), of which there are hundreds
throughout England and Wales. The AAA administers a coaching scheme,
with a constant expenditure of about £20,000 a year, under which eight
full-time national coaches, working mainly in separate regions, lecture,
demonstrate and coach in schools, youth clubs, evening institutes, training
colleges and universities and at special courses organised by the national
associations, by regional associations or by the Central Council of Physical
Recreation. Some of the work of the national coaches is directly concerned
with coaching young athletes but their main duties are to instruct men who
wish to qualify as honorary coaches, over 2,000 of whom give voluntary
services in the counties and districts of England and Wales. Scotland and
Northern Ireland have their own amateur athletic associations, with similar
functions; there are also separate women’s AAAs for each country.
International athletics and the selection of teams representing the United
Kingdom are dealt with by the British Amateur Athletic Board, which is
composed of representatives of the three national associations for men and
of the Women’s Council, and is affiliated to the International Amateur
Athletic Federation.
Track meetings are held throughout Britain from April to October. The
main events in England and Wales are: the AAA championships for men
and international matches held at the White City, London; area and county
championships; and the universities, Services, business houses and schools
championship meetings. Clubs usually compete in cross-country running
from October to March, and international, county and area cross-country
championships are held.
Teams representing Britain compete in the Olympic Games (held every
four years), and separate teams representing England, Wales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games, held at four-yearly
intervals between the Olympic Games. The last Commonwealth Games (1966)
were held in Jamaica.
The Highland games are traditional gatherings of local people in the High¬
lands of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the
weight, and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions
take place. Among the better known Highland games are the Northern
Meeting at Inverness, the Braemar Gathering on Deeside (traditionally
attended by the royal family), the Argyllshire Gathering at Oban, and the
meeting at Aboyne. The Highland games attract large numbers of spectators
from all over the world.
The most popular country sports are hunting, shooting and fishing; these are
old-established sports with a long history, and they still play a considerable
part in the life of the countryside. The organisation which looks after their
interests is the British Field Sports Society.
In Britain hunting means primarily fox hunting on horseback with a pack of
hounds; but it also includes stag hunting, which preceded fox hunting and
still goes on, mainly in Devon and Somerset; hunting the hare, either on foot
with beagles or with harriers when the followers are mounted; and otter
hunting along the banks of rivers. Hunting depends not on right but on
permission. Most landowners and farmers allow followers of recognised hunts
to cross their property.
Fox hunting originated some 200 years ago. Originally a sport mainly for
the landed gentry and local farmers, it has gradually widened its appeal, in
SPORT
Shooting
475
spite of the fact that it is an expensive pastime for those who ride to hounds.
The sport is not without its critics, but a large number of people, including
many townsmen, take a keen interest in it and follow the hunt in cars, on
bicycles or on foot. The fox hunting season proper starts in early November
and lasts until April; it is preceded by cub hunting, that is, the hunting of
young foxes, when young hounds are trained. At the end of the season most
hunts organise steeplechases, known as point-to-points, which are patronised
by large crowds.
There are between 190 and 200 packs of hounds in England and Wales,
13 in Northern Ireland, and 10 in Scotland. The packs range in size from
the large establishments in the ‘shires’, that is, the Midlands of England (for
instance, the Belvoir, the Cottesmore, the Quorn, and the Fernie) where
mounted followers may be two hundred or more, to small kennels in the
west and north, where hunting is sometimes on foot.
Hunts are financed mainly by the subscriptions of their members and with
the aid of the farmers, whose support enables fox hunting to continue to
flourish; car-parking fees, at such events as point-to-points, also contribute
and sometimes the Master of Fox-hounds (MFH), who is in charge of the
hunt, bears a proportion of the cost.
Game shooting as an organised country sport may be said to date from the
early part of the nineteenth century; nowadays, game consists mainly of
grouse, partridge, pheasant, snipe and woodcock.
There is virtually no free shooting in any part of the United Kingdom. In
the first place, a gun licence or a game licence must be applied for and pur¬
chased annually, and secondly, nearly all game birds are to be found on
privately owned land, shot over either by the owner and his friends or by
syndicates which have leased the shooting. However, in some parts of the
more remote countryside, rough shooting may be enjoyed in a less formal
way. Much of the country’s wildfowling is controlled by the Wildfowling
Association of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, through its numerous clubs.
Grouse, partridge, pheasant and certain other birds are ‘preserved’: that
is to say, there is a ‘close season’ during which they are protected by law and
allowed to breed in security, often under the care of privately employed
gamekeepers on numerous estates. The grouse, partridge and pheasant
seasons open on 12th August, 1st September and 1st October, severally, and
last for between four and five months. Grouse shooting takes place mostly
in Scotland, northern England and North Wales; partridge and pheasant
shooting in nearly every county in England, Wales and Scotland, the former
mainly over farm land, and the latter in or near woodland; and wildfowling on
the marshes and fenlands of the coastal areas.
The Game Research Association, formed by landowners, farmers and others
interested in game conservation and research, collects and collates information
on a national scale and makes a detailed study of factors controlling game
population, including diseases to which game birds are subject, game ecology
and density, survival rates and movements of game in changing environments.
Deer stalking, which derives its name from the fact that, in order to get
an effective shot, a very cautious approach is needed (since red deer have a
keen scent, are far-sighted, and take alarm at the slightest sound), is mainly
a sport of the Highlands of Scotland. The deer are preserved in privately
owned ‘deer forests’, ranging in size from 9,000 to over 30,000 acres. The
close seasons in Scotland are October to June, inclusive, for stags and
February to October, inclusive, for hinds. In England and Wales, the close
seasons are May to July for stags, and March to October for hinds.

Fishing
Aquatic Sports
Rowing
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Fishing is the most popular of the country sports in that it is within the reach
of everyone in some form or another (from the small boy with his hook and
line to the experienced fly-fisherman), and that many more people fish in
their leisure hours than hunt or shoot.
The outstanding forms of the sport in Britain are salmon and trout fishing.
Trout streams are to be found in most parts of the country, and in Scotland
there are also many hundreds of lochs which provide good sport. Salmon
fishing may be enjoyed on many rivers in England, North Wales and Northern
Ireland, but the best salmon rivers are to be found in Scotland. In England
and Wales the most widely practised form of fishing is for coarse fish such
as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench, chub and bream, and the National
Federation of Anglers (NFA) has some 400,000 members. Match angling—
competitive fishing for coarse fish by weight—is a feature of the many angling
clubs affiliated to the NFA, particularly in the midlands and north of England.
A national angling championship, composed of 112 teams of 12 anglers, is
organised annually by the NFA, and the NFA enters a team in the Inter¬
national Angling Competition, which in 1966 was held in England, the NFA
acting as hosts to 20 continental associations.
Fishing around the coasts is another popular pastime, while deep-sea
fishing for tuna and shark has gained many adherents during the past 20 years.
Coastal and deep-sea fishing is free to all (except for salmon and sea trout
fishing in Scotland) but, as a rule, freshwater fishing has to be paid for and
local inquiries made about any permit or licence required. Most coarse
fishing is let to angling clubs; trout and salmon fishermen either rent a
stretch of river, join a club, stay at an hotel with its own fishing rights, or
pay for the right to fish by the day, week or month. The cost of salmon
fishing is often high.
Aquatic sports include rowing, sailing, swimming, canoeing, punting and
water ski-ing. The first three are the most commonly practised in Britain
and are included in the Olympic events and the Commonwealth Games.
Rowing as a pastime is enjoyed by people from all sections of the community,
and as a sport it arouses considerable public interest. The two most popular
annual rowing events are the University Boat Race, which originated in 1820
and has been rowed annually on the Thames in the early spring since 1836;
and Henley Regatta, founded in 1839, which takes place each July at Henley-
on-Thames in Oxfordshire. The University Boat Race is between eight-oared
crews from Oxford and Cambridge over a course of some 4J; miles between
Putney and Mortlake; it is watched by many thousands of rival supporters
gathered on both sides of the river. Considerable interest is also shown in
the Head of the River Race from Mortlake to Putney, in March, in which
more than 300 eights row in procession—the largest assembly of racing craft
in the world.
Crews from all over the world compete at Henley Regatta, where various
kinds of races are rowed over a straight course of 1 mile 550 yards; for
instance, for the Grand Challenge Cup, open to eight-oared crews from any
nation, the Silver Goblets for pair oars, the Diamond Sculls for single
scullers, the Ladies’ Challenge Plate open to crews from schools and colleges
in the United Kingdom and the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup for eights
open to schools from Britain and overseas. Many other riverside resorts
arrange regattas every summer.
The oldest annual event in the English racing calendar is Doggett’s Coat
and Badge, founded in 1716 and organised since by the Worshipful Company

of Fishmongers. Originally for professional watermen and limited to six
entrants, the race is now open to amateurs (who must, however, still be
apprentice watermen); if necessary, it may be rowed in heats. The course
is from London Bridge to Chelsea.
The art of oarsmanship is taught in many schools, universities and rowing
clubs, including women’s rowing clubs, throughout Britain; and women as
well as men compete in the European rowing championships. The Amateur
Rowing Association is the governing body of the sport.
Enthusiasts have always devoted much of their leisure to yachting on the
inland waters and round the coasts of Britain, but during the last 15 years
the sport, and in particular small boat sailing, has greatly widened its appeal.
There are about 13,800 dinghies registered with the Royal Yachting Associa¬
tion, of which the most popular classes are the National Enterprise and
National Firefly; but as by no means all classes attain national status, there
is an even greater number of boats not included in this register.
Most British yacht racing is administered by the Royal Yachting Associa¬
tion, subject to the rules of the International Yacht Racing Union, founded
in 1907. The main event of the inshore yachting season is the annual regatta
at Cowes in the Isle of Wight, the headquarters of the Royal Yacht Squadron,
founded in 1812. Other events include the Round the Isle of Wight race and
the races arranged during the special yachting weeks (or fortnights) held at
such sailing centres as Poole in Dorset, Bembridge in the Isle of Wight,
Lowestoft in Suffolk, Harwich and Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, Plymouth
in Devon, Falmouth in Cornwall, and on the Scottish river Clyde.
Off-shore, or ocean, racing is based on rating and measurement rules
drawn up by the Royal Ocean Racing Club, founded in 1925. Typical courses
are: Cowes to Jersey (Channel Islands), Plymouth to La Rochelle (Charente
Maritime, France) and Harwich to the Hook of Holland.
Many children in Britain learn to swim at school, or during holidays at the
seaside, and swimming as a summer pastime is enjoyed by millions of people.
The existence of indoor swimming baths makes all-the-year swimming
possible, and instruction and coaching is provided in some places by qualified
teachers who hold certificates for elementary or advanced teaching and coach¬
ing awarded by the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA). The objects of
the ASA are to promote the teaching and practice of swimming, diving and
water polo and to stimulate public opinion in favour of providing proper
accommodation and facilities for them; and to draw up, publish and enforce
uniform laws for the control and regulation of amateur swimming, diving and
water polo championships and competitions in England.
Racing is a term which, in Britain, is taken to mean, first and foremost,
horse-racing. Other forms of racing include greyhound racing, coursing,
pony-racing, trotting races, and pigeon flying.
The history of the English turf proper began with the formation of the
Jockey Club in 1750, although horse-racing was known in Tudor times and
even earlier. The Jockey Club and the National Hunt Committee (founded
in 1866) now exercise control over all horse-racing in England and indirectly in
many other countries, and their rules are the basis of universal turf procedure.
There are two forms of racing: flat racing carried on from late March till
November under the authority of the Jockey Club; and steeplechasing,
conducted under the rules of the National Hunt Committee.
478
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The classic flat races are: the Two Thousand Guineas for colts and fillies,
run on the Newmarket course, owned by the Jockey Club; the One Thousand
Guineas for fillies only, also run at Newmarket; the Derby for colts and
fillies, run at Epsom; the Oaks for fillies only, also run at Epsom; and the
St. Leger for colts and fillies, run at Doncaster. The Derby is the outstanding
event in the racing calendar; it takes place annually in late May or early June
and the scene on Epsom Downs on Derby Day is one of the most colourful and
exciting of the sporting year. The most fashionable race-meeting of the flat
racing season is held on the course at Ascot in Berkshire, in mid-June, and
is known as ‘Royal Ascot’, being traditionally attended by the Sovereign.
Steeplechase meetings are held in the period August to June, one of the
most important being the National Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham in
March. The best known steeplechase is the Grand National, run annually
since 1839.
In England and Wales there is racing on 63 racecourses (excluding
point-to-point courses), at which there are about 820 days’ racing annually;
Scotland has six racecourses, where racing takes place on some 60 days in
the year. There are approximately 9,000 horses in training in Great Britain,
at an average cost of about £12 a week each.
Horse racecourses must be licensed by the Jockey Club or the National
Hunt Committee. On-course facilities for both cash and credit betting are
provided by bookmakers who must have personal permits, and by totalisators
operated by the Horserace Totalisator Board, which is empowered to deduct
from money staked with the totalisator such percentage as it may determine.
The practice is to deduct 15 per cent from the losing stakes; this provides an
average yield of approximately 11 per cent of the total annual turnover.
Facilities for off-the-course betting are provided in licensed betting offices, of
which there are some 15,500 throughout Great Britain. People under 18 years
old are forbidden by law to place bets.
A levy from both bookmakers and the Horserace Totalisator Board is
collected by the Horserace Betting Levy Board, which distributes the revenue
for purposes conducive to the improvement of horse breeding and racing, and
for the advancement and encouragement of veterinary science and education.
Greyhound Racing The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare started in Britain in 1926,
when the first modern greyhound track was opened at Belle Vue, Manchester.
There are now about 130 licensed tracks in operation, nearly all of which are
situated near large towns, and meetings are held two or three times a week.
The licensing authorities for greyhound racing tracks are the county and
county borough councils. Some 12 million people a year attend greyhound
racing, which is Britain’s second largest spectator sport.
The main authority of the sport is the National Greyhound Racing Club,
founded in 1928; its functions include drawing up the rules of greyhound
racing and keeping strict discipline over the sport. The 56 greyhound race¬
courses which accept the rules of the Club are the largest in the country and
constitute approximately 92 per cent of the total attendance and totalisator
turnover. All are members of the National Greyhound Racing Society which
controls the general policies of greyhound racing, administers the affairs of,
and acts as spokesman for the sport.
Greyhound racing can be conducted only at a licensed greyhound racecourse
on 104 betting days in a licensed year (1st July-3 oth June)- There are approxi¬
mately 11,500 greyhounds in training under the National Greyhound Racing
Club Rules, and average cost for their upkeep including training is approxi¬
mately £2 2s. per week.
SPORT
Riding

Where a totalisator is operated at a greyhound racecourse, up to 6 per cent
of the money invested can be deducted for operational expenses, and 2J per
cent must be paid to the Government in respect of general betting duty.
Bookmakers are allowed to operate at a greyhound racecourse, but are not
permitted to bet on greyhound racing at totalisator odds unless the consent of
the occupiers of the tracks at which the totalisators are operated give their
consent.
The classic greyhound races are held at various racecourses in London, as
follows: the Gold Collar at Catford; the Greyhound National at the White
City; the Greyhound Derby at the White City; the Scurry Gold Cup at
Clapton; the Laurels and the St. Leger at Wembley; and the Cesarewitch
at West Ham.
Interest in the art of horsemanship continues to increase rapidly, and many
more people have learned to enjoy riding as a pastime since the end of the
second world war than at any time since the advent of the motor car. There
are between 2,000 and 3,000 riding schools in Britain, many of a high standard,
and about 50 new schools are opened each year; membership of the British
Horse Society has risen to over 12,000; there are over 200 riding clubs with
varied membership; and the Pony Club (open to young people up to the
age of 17 years) now has an overall membership of about 77,000 members.
There are over 900 branches of the Pony Club throughout the world, of
which 250 are attached to hunts in Britain, and the remainder are overseas.
The British Horse Society, as the national equestrian federation of Great
Britain, is the authority on all matters relating to horses and ponies, including
breeding, training, riding, show jumping and dressage, and is responsible for
preparing equestrian teams for the Olympic Games and all international
events. The Society, which has recently opened one of the world’s most
up-to-date training centres at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, is also the parent
body of the Pony Club and the riding clubs, and organises and provides tests,
lectures, demonstrations, courses and examinations to promote horsemanship
and horsemastership.
Horse trials of all kinds are held throughout Britain during the spring and
summer. The three-day trials held each year—in April at Badminton Park,
Gloucestershire, in May at Tidworth, Hampshire, and in September at
Burghley House, Lincolnshire—are among the outstanding equestrian events
of the year. These trials include dressage, cross-country riding, and show
jumping; some 25 one-day trials on similar lines are held annually.
Show jumping competitions are held each year at over 1,000 shows. The
main events take place during the Royal International Horse Show (held at
the White City, London, under the auspices of the British Horse Society
towards the end of July)—the outstanding contest being the individual
jumping championship for the King George V Gold Cup. Jumping competi¬
tions are also a feature of the Horse of the Year Show, which takes place in
October at Wembley and is acknowledged to be one of the finest indoor
horse shows in the world. The total membership of the British Show Jumping
Association has risen to over 7,000. The number of horses and ponies registered
is more than 6,000 and over £140,000 is distributed annually in prize
money.
The selection of British riders and horses taking part in international
competitions (whose successes have materially contributed to the increased
popularity of show jumping) is the responsibility of the executive committee
of the Association.

Boxing
Wrestling

Motor Racing
BRITAIN: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Boxing as an English sport probably originated in Saxon times. Its modern
form, and the one that has been adopted in many overseas countries, dates
from 1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules which
eliminated much of the brutality that had hitherto characterised prize fighting,
and made the basis of the sport a trial of strength and skill.
Nowadays, many boys learn to box at school and in boys’ clubs, and there
are various amateur boxing competitions carried out according to the rules
of the Amateur Boxing Association (ABA), which controls all amateur
boxing, including schoolboy boxing, club and association boxing, and boxing
in the three Services.
Professional boxing is covered by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The Board has strict medical regulations which provide
for the examination of boxers before each contest, and the appointment of
inspectors to ensure that the regulations are observed and that all contests
are ‘vetted’ to safeguard against over-matching and exploitation.
Championships at fixed weights have been the rule in boxing contests
since the presentation of the Championship Challenge Belts b\ the late
Lord Lonsdale in 1909. Competitions organised by the ABA are decided at
ten weights: flyweight, bantamweight, featherweight, lightweight, light welter¬
weight, welterweight, light middleweight, middleweight, light hea^v eight
and heavyweight. In professional boxing there are no light welterweight or
light middleweight classes.
Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in the world. The style most commonly
used in Britain is the ‘free’ style, which evolved from the Catch-as-Catch-Can
or Lancashire style, but Cumberland and W estmorland w restling is still
practised in the north of England and in Scotland, and Cornish sts le wrestling
(in which the contestants wear rough canvas jackets by which all holds
must be taken) takes place in Cornwall. Wrestling in the free and Graeco-
Roman styles are used at the Olympic Games; in the Commonwealth Games
only free style is wrestled.
Amateur wrestling in Britain is governed by the British Amateur M restling
Association, which is affiliated to the International Amateur Wrestling
Federation, under the rules of which all wrestling is conducted. Professional
wrestling is usually in the ‘all-in’ or ‘free’ style, which is not the same as the
free style used in amateur wrestling. Judo, a Japanese form of wrestling, has
a large following, and is governed by the British Judo Association which has
coaching schemes assisted by the Department of Education and Science.
Fencing, as a sport, has made considerable progress throughout Britain during
the past 20 years. The Amateur Fencing Association (founded 1902) has some
500 clubs, and many classes are organised and financed by local authorities.
Fencing is also practised in many schools and among the annual championships
held under the auspices of the Association are the National Schoolboys’ and
Schoolgirls’ Championships, organised on a regional basis and attracting a
large number of entrants.
Motor racing is one of the most popular spectator sports in Britain; more
racing and sports cars have been built in Britain than in any other countn ,
and British drivers (including women drivers) have an international reputation
second to none.
British cars and British drivers take part in the international rallies and
world classic races which are the main features of the sport. They include the

British classic races—the British Grand Prix and the Tourist Trophy for
sports cars. There are also British national race meetings and British national
rallies, as well as several thousand day and night rallies and trials, endurance
tests, hill climbs and other events, arranged by various driving clubs, of which
there are over 500 in Great Britain.
The best-known motor racing circuits are those at Silverstone, Northamp¬
tonshire; Crystal Palace, London; Brands Hatch, Kent; Snetterton, Norfolk;
Mallory Park, Leicestershire; Oulton Park, Cheshire; Aintree, near
Liverpool; and Charterhall, Berwickshire, in Scotland. The controlling
body of motor racing in Britain is the Royal Automobile Club (RAC),
founded in 1897; the RAC is represented on the Federation Internationale
de 1 Automobile, which draws up the regulations for international motor
racing.
In addition to motor car racing, there are motor cycle races—the most
important contest of the year is for the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy—and
motor cycle speedway racing, introduced into Britain in 1928, and governed
by the Speedway Control Board. There is also go-kart racing.
The internationally recognised body for cycle racing in the United Kingdom
is the British Cycling Federation. It controls track and massed start road
racing in Britain, and is concerned with the cycling events in the Olympic
and Commonwealth Games and the annual world championship. Time trials
are organised by the Road Time Trials Council.
Touring by bicycle is also a popular pastime, and both the British Cycling
Federation and the Cyclists’ Touring Club (CTC) cater for this. The CTC
is the oldest touring club in the world and has a membership of some 25,000.
Its representatives in all parts of the United Kingdom give advice and practical
help to touring cyclists; its 50 district associations arrange holiday and week¬
end tours and competitions, rallies and rides of all kinds; and its travel
department gives CTC members every facility, both at home and abroad,
including the provision of itineraries. Other benefits include a touring
magazine, legal aid and third party insurance.
Full-bore (-303) rifle shooting is organised by the National Rifle Association
(NRA), founded in i860. The Imperial Meeting held annually at Bisley Camp,
Surrey, is open to subjects of the Queen, and, for certain competitions, to
all-comers. The meeting, which is attended by some 2,500 competitors from
Britain and other Commonwealth countries, including cadets from schools,
lasts for just over a fortnight: the first week consists of team and individual
competitions for members of the armed forces, and there are two days for
schools only. The premier award of the meeting is the Queen’s Prize, which
attracts about 1,250 entries. The NRA also organises postal matches for
British and overseas teams, and periodically sends rifle teams to shoot in
overseas countries of the Commonwealth.
Small-bore (-22) rifle shooting—carried out either on indoor ranges of
to 25 yards in length or on open ranges up to 200 yards—is also widely
practised in Britain. Some 4,000 clubs throughout the country are affiliated to
county rifle associations and the National Small-bore Rifle Association
(NSRA), which arranges inter-club and inter-county competitions of various
kinds for teams and individuals. The NSRA also organises a National Bisley
Meeting (usually attended by about 1,800 competitors), a Scottish meeting
(some 600 competitors), and a pistol shooting competition (some 400 competi¬
tors) at Bisley. International small-bore rifle matches are fired against teams

from overseas countries, and British teams are entered for the world champion¬
ships and the competitions in the Olympic Games.
Indoor Games Indoor games played in Britain include billiards, table tennis, and badminton,
which are enjoyed by large numbers of people, and for which facilities are
provided in social clubs of every kind, including youth clubs; and games
such as real tennis (a game which originated in thirteenth-century France),
squash rackets, rackets and fives, which are less national games than games of
the schools, universities and specialised clubs. Annual championships are
held in all these games the controlling bodies of which are: the Billiards
Association and Control Council; the Badminton Association of England and
the Scottish Badminton Union; the Tennis, Rackets and Fives Association
and the Squash Rackets Association. Basket-ball, an indoor variant of
netball which originated in the United States of America, is also played in
Britain, primarily by men. Matches in the game are included among the
Olympic events. The controlling body in Britain is the Amateur Basket Ball
Association.

NOTES FOR VISITORS TO THE UNITED KINGDOM
The unit of currency is the pound sterling (£), which is divided into 20 shillings
(s.) . The shilling is divided into 12 pennies or pence (d.). Prices are sometimes
quoted in guineas, the guinea (an old coin no longer in circulation) being ^1 Is.
Coins in common use are: halfpenny, penny, threepenny piece, sixpence,
shilling, two shilling piece (florin) and half-crown (2s. 6d.). Silver and cupro¬
nickel coins (3d., 6d., Is., 2s., 2s. 6d., 5s.) are legal tender for payments up to
£2; nickel-brass threepenny pieces up to 2s.; and bronze (^d. and Id.) up to 12d.
Bank of England notes are issued in denominations of 10s., £1, £5 and £10
Scottish banks issue £1, £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100 notes which are generally
accepted in Scotland and in some other parts of the United Kingdom. Northern
Ireland banks issue £1, £5, £10, £50 and £100 notes.
Minimum postage rates for letters are: 4d. (inland) and 6d. (overseas). Details
of all postal rates are given in leaflets obtainable at any post office and are
summarised in the books of stamps sold there.
Persons coming to the United Kingdom may bring in notes in any currency,
travellers’ cheques, letters of credit, etc., without limit; and although visitors
leaving the United Kingdom may normally only take with them sterling notes
to the value of £25, they can make arrangements for up to £100 to be changed
into travellers’ cheques available in their own country. Currency can be ex¬
changed at banks and there are bureaux de change at all the main ports and at
London and Prestwick airports, the main London air terminals and Victoria
Station, London.
Regulations relating to exchange control in the United Kingdom are some¬
what complex and are subject to modification from time to time. Accordingly,
any person who is going to live in the United Kingdom or who desires informa¬
tion affecting his own particular circumstances is advised to consult his own
or a United Kingdom bank; banks in Britain are experienced in all aspects of
exchange control.
In general, persons visiting the country for a limited period are regarded as
non-resident; any sterling account which they open with a United Kingdom
bank will be designated an External Account and funds in it may be used
without formality to make payments anywhere in the world. Persons intending
to reside permanently in the United Kingdom are subject to the provisions of
the Exchange Control Act 1947, and will require permission to make payments
outside the Scheduled Territories.
The question of when a visitor to the United Kingdom ‘who is not domiciled
there’ is chargeable for income tax as a ‘resident’ is complicated. The main
qualifications are:
A visitor is resident in the United Kingdom for any income tax year
(beginning 6th April) in which he is in the United Kingdom for a period or
periods equal, in the whole, to six months.
2. Even if a visitor does not stay six months in any one year he is regarded
as being resident if he visits the United Kingdom regularly for substantial
periods of time.
XA decision to adopt a decimal currency based on the pound sterling as the major unit
and subdivided into 100 units to be named later was announced by the Government
in March 1966. It is proposed that the changeover should come in February 1971.

3. If a person maintains a place of abode in the United Kingdom available
for his use, he is regarded as resident for any year in which he pays a visit of
whatever length.
A visitor who is regarded for tax purposes as resident in the United Kingdom,
and who is liable to United Kingdom tax on income arising in another country
and taxed there, may be entitled to a reduction of liability to United Kingdom
income tax.
Information on specific questions relating to income tax may be obtained
from The Secretary, The Board of Inland Revenue, Somerset House, London,
W.C.2 (or, for residents in Great Britain, from local offices).
Information about travel to Britain can be obtained in the major cities of the
world from travel agents, airline, shipping line and railway offices, and British
Government offices abroad, or directly from the headquarters of the British
Travel Association (BTA), 64—65 St. James’s Street, London, S.W.l (Tele¬
phone: Mayfair 9191). The Association has overseas offices in Argentina
(Buenos Aires), Australia (Sydney), Belgium (Brussels), Canada (Toronto and
Vancouver), France (Paris), Germany (Frankfurt-am-Main), Italy (Rome),
the Netherlands (Amsterdam), Africa (Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban
and Salisbury), Sweden (Stockholm), the United States (Chicago, Los Angeles
and New York), Brazil (Sao Paulo) and New Zealand (Wellington). Information
available from the Association includes details of places of interest, lists of
exhibitions, fairs, festivals, concerts and special events of interest to overseas
visitors to Britain, with hours of opening, etc.; and advice on motoring
and touring itineraries. The Association publishes an annual guide, Hotels and
Restaurants in Britain, listing accommodation, services and charges, and
booklets giving particulars of youth hostels, holiday camps, and camping
and caravan sites.
For information about the principal events of the day in London, visitors
may use the Teletourist Service (operated by the General Post Office in con¬
junction with the BTA and the BBC). The information can be obtained in
four languages by dialling the following telephone numbers: ASK 9211
(English), ASK 9311 (French), ASK 9411 (German), and ASK 9511 (Spanish).
If using a call box, the caller should refer to the instructions notice. The weather
forecast for the London area is also given in the French, German, and Spanish
services; in English it can be obtained by calling WEA 2211. The London
Tourist Information Centre, 64-65 St. James’s Street, London, S.W.l (and
with information centres at Victoria Station and the West London Air Terminal),
gives publicity to London’s attractions for the holiday and business visitor.
Demand for hotel space in London is heavy, especially in the summer; the
London Hotels Information Service, 88 Brook Street, London, W.l (Mayfair
5414), gives information free of charge to overseas visitors as to where accom¬
modation is available.
Additional information on travel in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
is obtainable from: the Wales Tourist and Holidays Association, 7 Park Place,
Cardiff; the Scottish Tourist Board, 2 Rutland Place, West End, Edinburgh, 1;

Citizens of the Republic of Ireland do not require either passport or visa (but,
with residents of Commonwealth countries, are subject to immigration control
if seeking employment in Britain: see p. 431).
Nationals of the following countries who wish to visit the United Kingdom
for social or holiday visits of up to three months may use instead of a passport
their national identity card (in the Netherlands a toeristenkaart, obtainable
from town halls) in conjunction with a special Visitor’s Card (obtainable from
travel agents in the tourist’s own country): Belgium, France, Germany (Federal
Republic and West Berlin), Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands,
and Switzerland. A passport must, however, still be used where the purpose of the
visit is other than touristic, or where a stay of longer than three months is intended.
Foreign visitors who are 16 years of age or over must register with the police
three months after their arrival.
The personal baggage of persons entering the United Kingdom is subject to
Customs examination. Many articles are liable to customs duty and a number
to purchase tax. Failure to make a complete declaration may result in
penalties; but, although there is no legal entitlement to them, certain concessions
are given to travellers who properly declare their belongings.
Used personal effects, including tools of trade and articles of professional
use, which have been in the ownership and use of a traveller for a considerable
period and are not intended for other persons or for sale, may be admitted free
of duty and purchase tax, as may also used furniture and domestic articles
belonging to persons transferring residence to the United Kingdom. Small
quantities of dutiable goods, including tobacco, wine and spirits, and perfume,
carried by travellers for their personal use are allowed to pass free of duty
within fixed limits.
Inquiries on importing personal and household effects should be addressed
to the Secretary, H.M. Customs and Excise, King’s Beam House, London, E.C.3.
There are purchase tax concessions for overseas visitors shopping in Britain.
Many of the principal stores are able to send goods to an address abroad free
of purchase tax; and under the Personal Export scheme, if the tax-free value
of goods bought at one time is £5 or more, a visitor may have them delivered
free of tax to the seaport or airport by which he is leaving the country.
All cats and dogs brought into the United Kingdom have to undergo six
months’ quarantine; and the landing of the animals must be authorised by a
licence issued by the appropriate Agricultural Department for England and
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (see Chapter 12). The department will
provide a list of approved carrying agents and quarantine kennels. An annual
licence (costing 7s. 6d. and obtainable at any post office) is needed for a house¬
hold dog aged 6 months or more.
The import of birds of the parrot family, if they are personal pets, is allowed
under licence, subject to certain conditions, by the Agricultural Departments.
Imports of live poultry are permitted only from certain countries.
Regulations concerning the temporary import of motor vehicles by visitors to
Britain are best obtained from the national motoring organisations in the visitor’s
country of residence. If a visitor is given a Temporary Importation Permit by
the customs officer at the port of entry, exemption from the need to pay vehicle
excise licence duty will be granted for the same period as stated on the permit
(maximum, 365 days). Insurance against third party risks is compulsory; a
visitor must produce evidence in the form of either an International Motor
Insurance Card (green card) or a certificate of insurance issued by a British
insurer.
A visitor holding a current International Driving Permit or a current domestic
driving licence for his own country is entitled to drive without obtaining a
British driving licence during the currency of his own permit or licence, subject

to a maximum of 12 months. Any person taking up permanent residence must
take a driving test to secure a British licence which costs 15s. and is valid for
three years.
The rule of the road is to keep LEFT. Road signs are illustrated and explained
in The Highway Code (published by H.M. Stationery Office).
Eligibility for the main social security benefits is dependent on {a) sufficient
National Insurance contributions having been paid under the United Kingdom
schemes or {h) the existence of a reciprocal agreement between the United
Kingdom and the previous country of residence of the claimant (see p. 128).
Information on specific points may be obtained from the Ministry of Social
Security, 10 John Adam Street, London, W.C.2.
To qualify for family allowances, a residence qualification must be fulfilled,
varying in length according to the nationality and previous country of residence
of the applicant.
The services provided under the National Health Service are available to
everyone in Britain without regard to residence, nationality or insurance qualifica¬
tion. Immigration authorities have been instructed, however, to refuse admission
to the country to any person coming solely for the purpose of securing free
treatment under the Health Service.
Persons from countries other than members of the British Commonwealth and
the Irish Republic are admitted to the United Kingdom to take up employment
with a particular employer only if they have a permit issued by the Ministry of
Labour (see p. 431). Until 1st July 1962 citizens of the Commonwealth and of
the Irish Republic had free entry into the United Kingdom, but since that date
they have been subject to control under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act
1962 (see p. 431), and must obtain an employment voucher issued by the
Ministry of Labour before entering Britain for full-time employment.
Visitors of foreign nationality wishing to set up in any business or profession
in Britain must ask for permission from the Under-Secretary of State, Home
Office, Aliens Department, Princeton House, 271 High Holborn, London,
W.C.l.

INDEX
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter rather than
under Association of, British, National, Royal, etc. (that is, Accidents, Royal Society for
the Prevention of; Anglers, National Federation of). In cases where the first word is not
separable, however (for example, Royal Air Force, Royal Society), entries will be found
appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only where
they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed under the
relevant subject headings.
