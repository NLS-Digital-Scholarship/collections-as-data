Introduction
Britain 1980 is the thirty-first official handbook in the series
prepared and revised each year by Reference Division of the
Central Office of Information. The handbook is widely known as
an established work of reference and is the mainstay of the
reference facilities provided by the British Information Services
in many countries. It is distributed overseas in a limited free
edition and is on sale by Her Majesty's Stationery Office through¬
out the world.
Britain 1980 is primarily concerned to describe the machinery
of government and other institutions, together with the necessary
physical and social background, and to show the part played by
government in the life of the country. It does not attempt an
analytical approach to current events. The text, generally, is based
on information available up to September 1 979, but it has been
amended to include some major government decisions an¬
nounced in October and November.
Care should be taken when studying British statistics to note
whether they refer to England, to England and Wales (considered
together for many administrative and other purposes), to Great
Britain, which comprises England, Wales and Scotland, or to the
United Kindgom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) as a whole.
The factual and statistical information in Britain 1980 is com¬
piled with the co-operation of other government departments
and agencies, and of many other organisations. Sources of more
detailed and more topical information (including statistics) are
mentioned in the text and in the Bibliography towards the end of
the book.

THE PHYSICAL BACKGROUND
Britain, also known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, constitutes the greater part of the British Isles, a group of islands
lying off the north-west coast of mainland Europe. The largest islands are
Great Britain (comprising the mainlands of England, Wales and Scotland)
and Ireland (comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic). Off the
southern coast of England is the Isle of Wight and off the extreme south-west
are the Isles of Scilly; off north Wales is Anglesey. Western Scotland is
fringed by numerous islands and to the north-east are the Orkneys and Shet-
lands. All these have administrative ties with the mainland, but the Isle of Man
in the Irish Sea and the Channel Islands between Great Britain and France
have a large measure of administrative autonomy and are not part of England,
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.

1 Excludes the Isle of Man, 588 square km (227 square miles), and the Channel Islands,
194 square km (75 square miles).
The latitude of 50° North cuts across the southernmost part of the British
mainland (the Lizard Peninsula) and latitude 6o° North passes through the
Shetland Islands. The northernmost point of the Scottish mainland, Dunnet
Head, near John o’ Groats, is in latitude 58° 40'. The prime meridian of o°
passes through the old observatory at Greenwich (London), while the eastern¬
most point of England is nearly i° 45' East and the westernmost point of
Northern Ireland is 8° 10' West. It is just under 1,000 km (some 600 miles)
from the south coast to the extreme north of mainland Britain and just under
500 km (some 300 miles) across in the widest part. There are numerous bays
and inlets and no place is as much as 120 km (75 miles) from tidal water.
The seas surrounding the British Isles are shallow—usually less than 90
metres (50 fathoms or 300 feet)—because the islands lie on the continental
shelf. To the north-west along the edge of the shelf the sea floor plunges abruptly
from 180 metres (some 600 feet) to 900 metres (about 3,000 feet). These shallow
waters are important because they provide excellent fishing grounds as well as
Geology and
Topography

breeding grounds for fish. The North Atlantic current, the drift of warm water
which reaches the islands from across the Atlantic, spreads out over the shelf
and its ameliorating effect on the air is thus magnified. The effect of tidal
movement is also increased by the shallowness of the water.
Despite its small area, Britain contains rocks of all the main geological periods.
In general, the oldest rocks appear in the highland regions in the north and
west, and the youngest in the lowland areas in the south and east. This is mainly
the result of persistent slow sinking over many millions of years in the south and
east accompanying the formation of the deep North Sea and English Channel
sedimentary basins.
Beneath the lowland areas in the south and east of England lie the younger
rocks. The harder chalk and limestone formations stand out as ranges of low,
grass-covered hills (rarely reaching 300 metres, 1,000 feet, above sea level)
separated by clay vales of rich farm land. These younger formations rest on an
old volcanic foundation present at a depth of a few hundred metres under much
of central England. This volcanic foundation, containing the oldest British
fossils, comes to the surface as craggy hillocks in north-west Leicestershire. At
greater depths beneath southern England lies the continuation of the older rock
formations of Belgium and the Rhineland.
The south-western peninsula of England, mainly the counties of Devon and
Cornwall, is composed of very old slate and sandstone formations into which
has been forced a large mass of metal-bearing granite whose outcrops now form
most of the high ground such as Dartmoor.
Still older rocks form most of the mountainous and hilly terrain in Wales,
the English Lake District, the southern uplands of Scotland and the southern
border counties of Northern Ireland.1 These rocks were subjected to com¬
pressions 400 million years ago which folded the strata and turned muddy
sediment into slate. In Wales and the Lake District thick volcanic formations,
eroded by rivers and Ice-Age glaciers, form spectacular mountain scenery.
Carboniferous limestone formations form the Mendip Hills, south of Bristol,
and the Pennines in northern England. In Scotland similar strata of a partly
volcanic character underlie the midland valley. These and other carboniferous
strata contain the coal measures which were the foundation of British
industrial expansion. The outcrops and shallow seams of coal which have now
largely been exhausted were found on the edge of the plains and up the valleys
leading to the high land. Most of the present deep coal workings lie underneath
the fertile lowlands. The continental shelf under the North Sea contains large,
exploitable quantities of oil and natural gas.
The Scottish Highlands are built from very thick formations of crystalline
rock, now deeply eroded, which was deposited between 1,000 million and
500 million years ago. Far older rocks, including the oldest in Britain, emerge
from beneath the Highlands on the north-western seaboard of Scotland and in
the Outer Hebrides, forming barren and rocky land. On the mainland of Scotland
a cover of red sandstone between 800 million and 1,000 million years old has
been partly eroded, leaving imposing isolated peaks.
Extensive areas in Antrim in Northern Ireland and in the islands of the Inner
Hebrides are composed of volcanic lava flows which erupted 50 million to
60 million years ago when the North Atlantic Ocean was in the process of open-
1 The highest peaks are: in Scotland, Ben Nevis, 1,342 metres (4,406 feet); in Wales,
Snowdon, 1,085 metres (3,560 feet); and in England, Scafell Pike (in the Lake District,
Cumbria), 978 metres (3,210 feet). The highest peak in Northern Ireland is Slieve Donard,
852 metres (2,796 feet).

ing out. The lavas and the roots of the volcanoes which fed them are deeply
eroded into wild mountain scenery.
The landscape of Britain is mainly the result of cycles of uplift and erosion
in the past 25 million years, culminating in the last Ice Age. Around 750,000
years ago great glaciers built up in the mountainous areas of Britain and
Scandinavia and spread out as ice-sheets into the lowland areas. The mountains
and the valleys were formed by the glaciers while the ice sheets deposited a
thick blanket of boulder clay, gravel and sand over the lowlands north of a line
from Bristol to London. Large lakes of meltwater held back by the ice gradually
dried up, leaving deposits of sand and silt. Throughout much of the country the
blanket of glacial debris affords soils of great fertility.
Britain’s complex geology is one of the main reasons for its rich variety of
scenery and the stimulating contrasts found within short distances, particularly
on the coasts. The ancient rocks of the highland area often reach the coast in
towering cliffs; elsewhere the sea may penetrate in deep lochs, as along much of
the west coast of Scotland. Bold outstanding headlands are notable features in
other parts of the varied coastline: the granite cliffs of Land’s End; the limestone
masses and slates of the coast of south-west Wales; the red sandstone of St. Bees
Head on the coast of Cumbria; and the vertically jointed lavas of Skye and the
island of Staffa in the Inner Hebrides. Even around the lowlands there are
striking contrasts. In some parts the soft, white limestone—the chalk—forms
white cliffs as at Dover and in the Needles off the Isle of Wight; while other
parts of the south and south-east coastline have beaches of sand or shingle. The
eastern coast of England between the Humber and the Thames estuary is
mostly low-lying, and for centuries some stretches of it have been protected
against the sea by embankments.
The marked tidal movement around the shores of Britain sweeps away much
of the sand and mud brought down by the rivers and makes the estuaries of some
British rivers1 valuable as natural harbours.
Britain has a generally mild and temperate climate. The prevailing winds are
south-westerly and the weather from day to day is controlled mainly by a
succession of depressions from the Atlantic. The weather is subject to frequent
changes but to few extremes of temperature. Although the winds are largely
determined by those of the eastern Atlantic, occasionally during the winter
months easterly winds may bring cold, dry, weather which, once established,
may persist for many days or even weeks. During the summer months the
Azores high pressure system usually extends its influence north-eastwards
towards north-west Europe, and the depressions take a more northerly course,
often passing entirely to the north of the country.
South-westerly winds are the most frequent, and those from an easterly direction
the least; such winds occur about one-third as often as south-westerlies although
easterly winds are appreciably more frequent in the spring than at any other
time of the year. In hilly country, wind direction may differ markedly from the
general direction owing to local topography. Winds are generally stronger in the
north than in the south, stronger on the coasts than inland, and stronger in
the west than in the east. The strongest winds usually occur in the winter; the
average speed at Lerwick, Shetland Islands, varies from about 29 km/h (18 mph)
in January to about 19 km/h (12 mph) in August, while at Kew Observatory,
1 The longest rivers in England—the Severn and the Thames—are only about 354 and
338 km (220 and 210 miles) long respectively; those in Scotland (the Tay and the Clyde)
about 188 km and 170 km (117 and 106 miles) long.

on the western outskirts of London, the average speed varies from about 15 km/h
(9 mph) in January to about 12 km/h (7 mph) in August. The stormiest region
is along the north-west coast with over 40 gales a year; south-east England and
the east Midlands are the least stormy, with gales occurring on about two days
a year inland and on some 10 to 15 days on the Channel coast.
Near sea level in the west the mean annual temperature ranges from 8°C
(46°F) in the Hebrides to ii°C (52°F) in the extreme south-west of England;
latitude for latitude it is slightly lower in the east. The mean monthly tempera¬
ture in the extreme north, at Lerwick (Shetland), ranges from 3°C (37°F)
during the winter (December, January and February) to I2°C (54°F) during
the summer (June, July and August): the corresponding figures for the Isle
of Wight, in the extreme south, are 5°C (4i°F) and i6°C (6i°F). During a
normal summer, the temperature occasionally rises above 30°C (86°F) in the
south, but temperatures of 32°C (90°F) and above are infrequent. Minimum
temperatures depend largely on local conditions, but —io°C (i4°F) may
occur on a still, clear winter’s night in inland areas. Lower temperatures are
rare.
Britain has an annual rainfall of about 1,100 mm (over 40 inches), while England
alone has some 830 mm (about 33 inches). The geographical distribution of
annual rainfall is largely governed by topography and exposure to the Atlantic,
the mountainous areas of the west and north having far more rain than the
lowlands of the south and east. Between 3,800 and 5,000 mm (roughly 150-200
inches) of rain fall on the summits of Snowdon, the Lake District and north¬
west Scotland during the average year, whereas some places in the south-east
of England record less than 500 mm (about 20 inches). Rain is fairly well
distributed throughout the year, but, on the average, March to June are the
driest months and October to January the wettest. A period of as long as three
weeks without rain is exceptional, and is usually confined to limited areas.
The distribution of sunshine shows a general decrease from south to north,
a decrease from the coast inland, and a decrease with altitude. During May,
June and July (the months of longest daylight) the mean daily duration of
sunshine varies from five hours in northern Scotland to eight hours in the
Isle of Wight; during the months of shortest daylight—November, December
and January—sunshine is at a minimum, with an average of half an hour a day
in some parts of the Highlands of Scotland and two hours a day on the south
coast of England.
In fine, still weather there is occasionally haze in summer and mist and fog in
winter. Fogs have become less frequent and less severe as a result of changes in
fuel usage and the operation of clean air legislation. In London, for example,
the frequency of dense fogs in winter is about half what it was 20 years ago.
Many parts of the surface of highland Britain have only thin, poor soils. These
stretches of moorland are found over the Highlands of Scotland, the Pennines,
the Lake District, the mountains of Wales and in parts of north-east and
south-west England. In most areas the farmer has cultivated only the valleys
and the plains where soils are deeper and richer; villages and towns are often
separated by uplands with few if any habitations.
With the exception of a few patches of heath and forest, almost the whole
of lowland Britain has been cultivated, and farmland covers the area except
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
5
Fauna
where there are urban and industrial settlements. Elaborate land drainage has
been developed through the centuries to bring under cultivation the fertile soil
of the low-lying fenland of Lincolnshire and part of East Anglia.
With its mild climate and varied soils, Britain has a diverse pattern of
vegetation. When the islands were first settled, oak forest probably covered
the greater part of the lowland, giving place to extensive marshlands, forests
of Scots pine on higher or sandy ground and perhaps some open moorland.
In the course of the centuries the forest area was progressively diminished
and, in spite of planting by estate owners in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries and the establishment of large forests by the Forestry Commission
in the past 60 years, woodlands now occupy only about 9 per cent of the land
area. The greatest density of woodland occurs in northern Britain, in some
parts of south-east England and on the Welsh border. Yet much of Britain
appears to be wooded because of the numerous hedgerows and isolated trees.
The most common trees are oak, beech, ash and elm and, in Scotland, pine
and birch. The number of elms, especially in southern England, has been
severely reduced however since the late 1960s by ‘Dutch’ elm disease.
There are various types of wild vegetation, including the natural flora of
woods, fens and marshes, foreshores and cliffs, chalk downs and the higher
slopes of mountains; the most widespread is that of the hilly moorland country,
which consists mainly of heather, grasses, gorse and bracken, with cotton
grass in the wetter parts. Nearly 80 per cent of Britain however is used for agri¬
culture (including rough grazing land) with most of the prime farming land in
England. The amount of land in urban use is less than a tenth of the agricultural
land.
Farming land is divided into fields by hedges, stone walls or fences and,
especially in the mixed farms which cover most of the country, presents a
pattern of contrasting colour. The cool temperate climate and the even dis¬
tribution of rainfall ensure a long growing season; streams rarely dry up, grass¬
land is green throughout the year with many wild flowers from spring to
autumn; in most years there is scarcely a month without some flowers in
hedgerows and woodlands.
The fauna of the British Isles is, in general, similar to that of the rest of north¬
western Europe, though there are fewer species. Some of the larger mammals,
including the wolf, the bear, the boar and the reindeer, have become extinct;
but red deer, protected for sporting reasons, flourish in the Scottish Highlands
and on Exmoor in the counties of Devon and Somerset, roe deer are found in
Scotland and in the wooded areas of southern England, and fallow deer (which
are probably not indigenous) have been introduced into parks and are wild
in some districts. The badger, a nocturnal animal, is rarely seen; there are
foxes in most rural (and increasingly in urban) areas. Common and grey seals
may be seen on parts of the coast, though not usually in the same localities.
Smaller mammals include mice, rats, voles, shrews, hedgehogs, moles, squirrels
(the imported grey much more numerous than the native red), hares, rabbits,
weasels and stoats. Less common species include the otter, the pine marten and
the polecat. Species which have established themselves as wild populations after
escape from captivity include the muntjac, coypu and mink.
About 460 species of birds have been recorded in the British Isles. Some 200
species breed; the rest are regular migrants to, or pass through, the country, or
are casual stragglers. Visitors to Britain are often struck by the abundance,
variety and tameness of song birds in towns and villages. The pigeon, blackbird
and chaffinch are widely distributed but sparrows usually predominate near
6
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
houses. London and some other large towns have huge flocks of starlings which
congregate to roost on buildings, especially in winter. Most species of birds
have maintained their numbers over the last few decades, owing to their success
in adapting themselves to man-made surroundings, and in London there has
been an increase in the number of species breeding as a result of the improvement
in the environment brought about by anti-pollution measures. Some large birds,
on the other hand, have tended to decrease, but several species, such as the
osprey and the ruff, have re-established themselves after disappearing from
Britain in the nineteenth century.
Many species of gulls and other sea birds nest around the coast, and gulls
may regularly be seen feeding far inland; some nest in inland sites such as
gravel pits and sewage farms. The drainage and reclamation of marshlands
have diminished the natural habitat of ducks, geese and other aquatic birds,
but the survival of such species is largely assured on the nature reserves and
bird sanctuaries which have recently been established on an increasing scale.
Nearly all British wild birds are protected; the principal exceptions are those
considered injurious to agriculture and game birds shot for sport in the open
season (these are protected when breeding in the close season).
About 30 kinds of freshwater fish are found, salmon, trout, pike, roach, dace
and perch being widely distributed. Stocks of trout, rainbow trout (an introduced
species), carp, tench and roach are frequently supplemented by introductions
for angling purposes. In a number of rivers measures to control pollution have
resulted in fish becoming more numerous; in the Thames in London, where
pollution levels have been reduced to a quarter of those in the 1950s, nearly
100 kinds of fish have been found, compared with only one in 1958.
Reptiles and amphibians are few. The former are represented by three
species of snakes, of which only the adder is venomous, and three species of
lizards, including the snake-like slow-worm. The amphibians are represented
by three species of newts and five species of frogs and toads. Most British
reptiles and amphibians are indigenous but at least one, the marsh frog, has
been recently introduced from continental Europe. Ireland has no snakes.
There are more than 21,000 different kinds of insects. Among the largest
are the rare swallowtail butterfly (8-10 cm, 3-4 inches) and the stag beetle
(6 cm, 2| inches). The insect fauna is less varied than that of continental Europe
and lacks a number of common European species. With modern methods of
pest control, extensive insect damage to crops or timber and serious outbreaks
of diseases spread by insects are not common but there is some anxiety that
chemical protection against insects may be reducing the population of creatures
which feed on them, and of their predators in turn. These and other effects of
agricultural chemicals on wildlife are the subject of special government safeguards
supported by the agricultural chemicals industry.
THE DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The people who now inhabit Britain are descended mainly from the people
who inhabited the area nine centuries ago. The last of a long succession of
invaders and colonisers from Scandinavia and the continent of Europe were
the Normans, a branch of the Norsemen or Scandinavian Vikings who, after
settling in northern France, intermarrying with the French, and assimilating
their language and customs, crossed the Channel to England and conquered it
in 1066.
Obviously it is not possible to estimate the relative importance of various
early peoples—pre-Celts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons and the Norsemen,

including the Danes—in the ancestry of the present English, Scots, Welsh and
Irish. Over most of England and the lowlands of Scotland the language which
soon came to predominate was English, mainly a marriage of Anglo-Saxon and
Norman-French, while the use of Celtic languages persisted in Wales, Cornwall,
the Isle of Man, the highlands of Scotland and in Ireland.
The available records do not enable any precise estimates to be made of the
size of population or of the extent or direction of population movement until
the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is believed, however, that at the
end of the eleventh century the population of Great Britain was about 2 million,
while at the end of the seventeenth century reasonable contemporary estimates
put the population at about 6| million. The main factor in this gradual growth
of population was a slow natural increase, with high death rates and, in particular,
very high infant and maternal mortality. Immigration from the continent of
Europe has been an influence at certain times and immigration from Common¬
wealth countries more recently.
From the beginning of the nineteenth century there is relatively plentiful
and reliable information about the British people—their number, sex, age,
geographical distribution, births, marriages, deaths, occupations, language, and
family structure. Most of it comes from two main sources: the regular flow of
statistical information based on compulsory registration of births, marriages and
deaths, and the periodic censuses taken regularly every ten years since 1801
(because of war there was no census in 1941). The last census was in 1971; the
next will be held in 1981.
Britain’s estimated mid-1978 home population was 55,836,000 (see Table 2).
The populations of the Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey and associated islands
are about 60,500, 74,500 and 54,400 respectively. In the period 1975-78 for the
first years since records began (other than in war) the population fell slightly.
This trend, common to much of western Europe, is mainly the result of a sharp

fall in the birth rate (see below). Births in 1978 just out-numbered deaths but
the direction of net migration, as in other recent years, was outward.
The total population of New Commonwealth and Pakistani ethnic origin
(including children born in Britain and children with only one parent of such
ethnic origin) was 1-9 million in 1978, about 3-5 per cent of the total population
of Britain.
Now that population growth has, for the time being at least, stopped, many
official policies, such as those on housing, the planning of the new towns and
the supply of school teachers, have been re-examined in the light of the implica¬
tions, for the short term, of a static or declining population.
Projections for the future suggest that the traditional increase in population
will be resumed, though growth will take place at a much slower rate than was
expected a few years ago. Britain’s total population is expected, on 1978 estimates,
to be 56-3 million in 1986, 58 million in 2001 and 59-2 million in 2018.
The country as a whole has a population density of about 229 people to the
square kilometre (592 per square mile), but in England the figures are 355 people
to the square kilometre (920 per square mile), and in London 4,379 people per
square kilometre (11,344 per square mile).
Annual births have fallen by some 30 per cent since the mid-1960s. The birth
rate declined from 18 live births per 1,000 people in 1966 to n-8 in 1977, an
unprecedentedly low figure. The most recent information suggests that the fall

in the birth rate may be coming to an end, births in England and Wales rising
in 1978 for the first time since 1971. The number of births in 1978 was 687,000
(compared with 980,000 in 1966), of which about 10 per cent were illegitimate,
and the birth rate was 12-3.
Several factors may have contributed to the fall in the birth rate, family
planning, particularly the use by women of the contraceptive pill, has become

more widespread, and sterilisation of men and women has also become more
common. An appreciable proportion of pregnancies outside marriage and of
pregnancies to older women are ended by legal abortion.
There are indications that the proportion of childless marriages may be
increasing a little, and for marriages which do produce children there is a
continuing tendency for the interval between marriage and the first birth to
be longer. The numbers of third and later children born have fallen substantially.
The biggest falls have been in the births of third and later children to manual
workers, but the pattern is similar for all social classes. A rise in first and second
births to professional families appears to be an exception, but may be due to an
increase in the number of families in those groups.
The fertility of women born overseas, particularly those from the Irish
Republic, the West Indies and the Indian sub-continent, was higher on average
in 1971 than that of the indigenous population, but has since been falling. The
population of New Commonwealth and Pakistani ethnic origin contains a larger
proportion of young people than the indigenous population and so contributes
disproportionately to the number of births.
At birth the expectation of life for a man is just over 69 years and for a woman
it is nearly 76 years. The corresponding expectations in 1901 were 48 years
for men and 52 years for women. The improving health of the population has
had the effect of increasing young people’s chances of reaching the older age
groups. Life expectancy in the older age groups has increased relatively little.
The general death rate has remained about the same for the past 50 years, at
about 12 per 1,000 population, but this figure takes no account of the ageing
population, and at every age there has been a considerable decline in mortality—
particularly among children and young adults.
The causes of the decline in mortality include better nutrition, rising standards
of living, the advance of medical science, the growth of medical facilities,
improved health measures, better working conditions, education in personal
hygiene, and the smaller size of the family, which has reduced the strain on
mothers and enabled them to take greater care of their children.
Mortality from tuberculosis is a tiny fraction of what it was in the mid¬
nineteenth century, and mortality from acute infectious diseases in infancy has
virtually been eliminated. The infant mortality rate (deaths of infants under one
year old per 1,000 live births) was 14-1 in 1977; neonatal mortality (deaths of
infants under four weeks old per 1,000 live births) was 9-5; and maternal
mortality was 0-13 per 1,000 live births.
The mortality from each major cause often reflects factors directly linked
to occupation and the wide variations between the life patterns and living
standards of the different social classes.
Traditionally Britain has a net outflow of people to the rest of the world (net
loss by migration between 1871 and 1931 for instance was about 4 million)
though there have been exceptional periods—in the 1930s when there was a
considerable flow of refugees from continental Europe, and in the late 1950s and
early 1960s, mainly the result of a large influx of people from the West Indies
and the Indian sub-continent.
The traditional pattern of migration in Britain has been maintained in the
past few years.
Between 1968 and 1978 Britain lost about half a million people by migration:
2-8 million emigrants and 2-2 million immigrants; in both totals about a third
of the people were returning to their country of origin.

Age Structure
Distribution of
Population
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
There are about 6 per cent more male than female births every year. Because
of the higher mortality of men at all ages, however, there is a turning point,
at about 45 years of age, at which the number of women exceeds the number
of men. This imbalance increases with age so that there is a preponderance
of women among the elderly. In the population as a whole there are more than
105 females to every 100 men.
Marriage trends since the 1930s have been towards a higher proportion of
people marrying and an earlier age pattern. The proportion of the population
of Great Britain who were or had been married rose from about 52 per cent
in 1939 to 60 per cent in 1977, while the proportion of single persons in the
population aged 15 years or over fell from 33-3 per cent to 23-4 per cent. Wide-
ranging changes in family life appear to have occurred in the 1970s and include
a record decline since 1945 in rates of first marriage, particularly among teen¬
agers ; later starts to family building; and a continued rise in the proportions of
people divorcing, including those divorcing for a second or subsequent time, and
of people marrying for a second or subsequent time. In 1977 over 10 decrees
of divorce were made absolute for every 1,000 married people in England and
Wales, compared with 2 in 1961; some 85 per cent of divorces in England and
Wales in 1977 occurred among couples both of whom were in their first marriage.
The average age of people at the time of divorce in England and Wales is about
38 for men and 36 for women. Remarriage rates among younger divorced people
are high, and births in remarriage are likely to become a more important com¬
ponent of total births in the future.
The estimated age distribution of the British population in mid-1978 was
roughly as follows; under 15 years, about 22 per cent; 15-64, 63 per cent; and
65 and over, 15 per cent. Some 17 per cent of the population were over the
normal retirement ages (65 for men and 60 for women).
The changing age structure has for the time being produced a balance
between those who are primarily producers of resources and those who are
primarily consumers that is more unfavourable than at any time since the
early 1930s. This ‘dependency ratio’ of children and older people to the size of
the population of working age is, however, projected to fall from 67 per cent in
1976 to 58 per cent in 2001. This will be the result principally of the decreasing
proportion of children in the population.
Perhaps the main feature of the changing age structure is the increasing
number of elderly people, reflecting birth patterns in the early years of the
century and the final decades of the nineteenth. Between mid-1970 and mid-
1978 the number of people over the normal retirement ages rose by 8 per cent.
Proportionately there was a particularly large increase in the number of people
aged 85 and over, 22-3 per cent over the same period.
The population of England is, and has been for centuries, greater than that of all
other parts of Britain. The distribution of the British population by country
is shown in Table 2 on p 7.
The standard regions of England, sub-divisions of the country used for
most statistical and economic planning purposes, have the following populations
(provisional mid-1978 estimates): East Anglia 1,872,700; East Midlands
3,749,700; Northern 3,098,000; North-West 6,498,400; South-East 16,831,900;
South-West 4,295,700; West Midlands 5,154,100; and Yorkshire and Humber¬
side 4,878,200.
Table 3 gives figures of some of Britain’s largest urban areas. About half

the population lives in a belt across England with south Lancashire and West
Yorkshire at one end, and the London area at the other, having the industrialised
Midlands at its centre. Other areas with large populations are: the central
lowlands of Scotland; north-east England from north of the river Tyne down
to the river Tees; south-east Wales; the Bristol area; and the English Channel
coast from Poole, in Dorset, eastwards. Less densely populated areas are the
eastern fringes of England between the Wash and the Thames estuary, and
the far south-west. The seven major metropolitan areas which have been
denoted as ‘conurbations’ in successive population censuses accommodate a
third of Great Britain’s people while comprising less than three per cent of the
total land area. They are: Greater London, Central Clydeside, Merseyside,
South East Lancashire, Tyneside, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire.

Most of the mountainous parts including much of Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland and the central Pennines in northern England, are very sparsely
populated.
These differences in average density between different regions have been
widening. There has been a geographical redistribution of the population from
Scotland and the northern regions of England to East Anglia, the South-West
and the East Midlands. The proportion resident in Greater London and most
of the metropolitan counties of England has recently been falling. People,
particularly the young and skilled, have tended to leave city centres and conurba¬
tions, although such migration may not necessarily mean a change of job but
rather an increase in the distance of travel to and from work. In other cases it
has been a consequence of falling employment in city centres, a trend which has
led to special measures, worked out for each city, to attract small industries back
there.
In England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, English is the language
predominantly spoken. In Wales, however, Welsh, a form of British Celtic,
was spoken by 21 per cent of the population (some 542,000 people) aged three
years and over at the time of the 1971 census. The Welsh Language Council, an
official body, promotes the use of the language. The Welsh Language Act 1967
affirms the equal validity of Welsh with English in the administration of justice

and conduct of government business throughout Wales. The number of bilingual
schools is increasing. In Scotland some 88,000 persons in 1971, mainly in the
Highlands and western coastal regions, were able to speak the Scottish form of
Gaelic. A few families in Northern Ireland still speak the Irish form of Gaelic.
The Cornish variety of Celtic is no longer effectively a living language, although
there is a revival of cultural interest.
Some of the country’s ethnic minorities have their own languages, normally
as well as English. Among the Asian community, for example, the most usual
languages are Punjabi, Gujarati, Bengali or Urdu.
Immigration into Britain is controlled by the Immigration Act 1971. The Act
confers a right of abode—and exemption from control—on citizens of the
United Kingdom and Colonies who are connected with Britain by birth,
adoption, naturalisation or registration or are children or grandchildren of such
persons, on citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who
have been resident in Britain for a continuous period of five years, and on
Commonwealth citizens with a parent born in the United Kingdom. Those
having this right of abode are known as ‘patrials’. In general, others wishing to
enter Britain for employment must hold work permits. Exceptions are Common¬
wealth citizens with a grandparent born in Britain, certain permit-free categories,
and nationals of European Community countries. The dependants of work
permit holders and of those who may enter without work permits may also be
admitted.
Under the British Nationality Act 1948, people born in the United Kingdom,
the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, a ship or aircraft registered in the United
Kingdom, or a territory which is still a colony, are, with insignificant exceptions,
citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth. Citizenship may also
be acquired: by descent from a father who is himself a citizen otherwise than
by descent and, in certain specified circumstances, from a father who is a
citizen by descent only; by registration, for citizens of Commonwealth member
countries or of the Irish Republic, for minor children and for women married
to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies; in consequence of a United
Kingdom adoption order; and, for aliens, by naturalisation. The requirements
for naturalisation include five years’ residence in the United Kingdom or
Colonies, good character, a sufficient knowledge of English and the intention
to reside in the United Kingdom or a colony. The requirements for registration
are similar except that most Commonwealth and Irish citizens settled in Britain
by 1973 have the right to be registered after completing five years ordinary
residence without satisfying any other requirement. In 1978, 24,971 people
acquired citizenship by naturalisation and registration.
A citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies does not forfeit his citizenship
by acquiring or possessing the nationality or citizenship of another country
(although he can lose it automatically if the territory from which he derives it
becomes independent); nor does a woman who is a citizen of the United King¬
dom and Colonies lose her citizenship by marriage to a foreign national. Indeed,
a citizen cannot be deprived of his citizenship against his will except in very
exceptional circumstances (for example, if he has obtained naturalisation or
registration as a citizen by fraud). Any man or woman who is a citizen is,
however, at liberty to renounce citizenship if he or she possesses or acquires the
nationality or citizenship of another country.
Citizens of the other independent Commonwealth countries are, in United
Kingdom law, British subjects or Commonwealth citizens and, as such, enjoy
full political and civic rights if resident in Britain.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
!3
THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
This section gives some points of general interest about household structure and
social characteristics in Britain as a background to the information given in later
chapters. It deals with topics in very broad and informal terms and many
exceptions apply to the generalisations.
The way of life of the people of Britain has been changing rapidly throughout
the twentieth century. As in many other countries underlying causes include
two major wars, a lower birth rate, longer expectation of life, a higher divorce
rate, widening educational opportunities and technical progress, particularly
in communications and transport and a better standard of living. One of the
features of the change in social attitudes has been the development of a more
informed tolerance of others’ behaviour and an unwillingness to penalise
individuals with particular problems. Relationships between the generations,
too, are changing, and young people are more ready to criticise traditional
values and institutions and to seek greater influence in shaping society.
The following account applies primarily to Great Britain. Many of the
same factors are at work in Northern Ireland but their effect is modified by both
the Province’s history and the emergency of recent years.
Homes and the The majority of people (some 97 per cent) live in private households (in families
Environment or on their own). The remainder include residents in hotels, and people in the
armed services and in educational or other institutions. Of approximately
27-5 million married people at the time of the 1971 population census about
25 million were estimated to be married couples living together in some 12-5
million separate families containing some 46 million people, the remainder
living either on their own or with other persons or families, except for a small
number living in institutions. Nearly 8 million of the families, comprising
32 million people, contained a married couple and their children or grand¬
children. There were, in addition, 1-2 million families consisting of a parent
living with children or grandchildren. About half, mostly women, were bringing
up between them about 1 million dependent children; the rest were living with
adult children or grandchildren.
The average size of households has continued to fall progressively, from over
four persons in 1911 to 3-1 in 1961 and 2-7 in 1977, largely reflecting increases
in the numbers of people living alone and the trend towards smaller families.
It is estimated that in 1977 21 per cent of households consisted of one person
only, 33 per cent of two, 17 per cent of three, 18 per cent of four and 11 per cent
of five or more. The number of one-parent families has been increasing rapidly.
Three British households out of four live in houses rather than flats. Terraced
housing, most of it built in the early years of the present century, still provides
accommodation for over a quarter of all households. In inner urban areas,
which have increasing priority in the Government’s housing and planning
policies, slum clearance and redevelopment have been major features of post-
1945 public housing programmes, but, with help from public funds, the modern¬
isation and conversion of sub-standard housing has increasingly been encouraged
as an alternative to clearing and rebuilding. Emphasis in new building is on
low-rise, high density layouts, often incorporating gardens or patios. Nearly
half of Britain’s housing stock has been built since 1945.
The main housing development of the past 50 to 60 years, however, has been
suburban. Many British families now live in houses grouped in small terraces,
or semi-detached or detached, usually of two storeys with gardens, and providing
two main ground-floor living rooms, a kitchen, from two to four bedrooms, a
H
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
bathroom, and one or two lavatories. Many such houses, built in the 1920s and
1930s, are located in ‘ribbon development’ along main roads, but recent patterns
have involved housing estates set back from the main thoroughfares with
amenities such as health and community centres.
Housing standards are continually improving; some 93 per cent of house¬
holds in Great Britain have exclusive use of a bath or shower, and 97 per cent
sole use of a lavatory—high percentages by international standards. Most
housing built nowadays is centrally heated, and just over half of all households
now have central heating. About 57 per cent of British households have a tele¬
phone, 57 per cent one or more cars, 90 per cent a refrigerator, 75 per cent a
washing machine, 40 per cent a deep freeze and 3 per cent a dish washer.
Over half of all families now own their own homes, though more than half of
these home owners still have further repayments of mortgages to make. Most of
the other households rent an unfurnished house or flat either from a local
authority or housing association (an increasing trend) or from a private landlord
(a falling trend). People in unskilled manual jobs are more likely to live in rented
accommodation, particularly local authority housing, than people in non-manual
occupations. One-third of all families move house every five years.
An important influence on the planning of housing and services has been
the growth of car ownership. Greater access to motorised transport and the
construction of a network of modern trunk roads and motorways have resulted
in a considerable increase in personal mobility and changed leisure patterns, as
well as changes in the design of housing and shopping areas. Most detached
or semi-detached houses in new suburban estates have garages, and out-of-town
shopping centres, frequently including large supermarkets, are often specially
planned for the motorist and offer an alternative to shopping in the centres of
older towns. The 32 new towns and the ‘expanding towns’ (generally seen as
one of the most successful achievements of British planning since 1945) have set
high standards in accommodating people and traffic.
The growth in car ownership has brought very great benefits but also a
number of problems, notably, in many towns and cities, increased congestion,
noise and air pollution. Public transport, too, has been affected, and many
services have been reduced or eliminated, especially in rural areas. The people
without access to a car include those among the poorer sections of the community,
or the elderly or infirm; mobility allowances help the disabled. The Government
is proposing to relax restrictions on bus licensing in order to make it easier for
new services to develop, and is encouraging car-sharing.
In a densely populated modern industrial society there is much scope for
conflict between the need for communal facilities and the desire to preserve
existing beauty or places of historic interest, and between potential users of a
new service and people whose way of life is threatened by the need to accom¬
modate it. As a result the activities of the established amenity societies, such as
the National Trust and the Council for the Protection of Rural England, are
supplemented to a growing extent by those of groups formed expressly to safe¬
guard the amenities of a particular area and to publicise the views of the people
they represent.
Growing public concern about the dangers both to health and to the natural
environment which can be caused by the disposal of industrial and human
waste, by exhaust fumes and by the rising volume of noise is reflected in the
appointment by the Government of a standing Royal Commission on Environ¬
mental Pollution and an Advisory Council on Noise. Voluntary societies include
the National Society for Clean Air, the Noise Abatement Society, the Keep Britain
Tidy Group, Friends of the Earth, and the Council for Nature.
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
The Economic
and Social
Pattern
15
Marked improvements in the standard of living have taken place during the
twentieth century. Nonetheless considerable inequalities of income and wealth,
among them regional disparities, remain. The gap between social classes in
such matters as infant mortality rates, educational progress, working conditions
and ill-health remains wide. There has, however, been a long-term tendency
to a reduction in the proportion of semi-skilled and unskilled workers, and
an increasing number of people in professional or managerial occupations are
children of manual workers.
The working population comprises nearly half the total population. For a
long period an increase in real earnings was a principal factor in British working
and social life. Between 1950 and 1974 real personal disposable income1 more
than doubled to £75,051 million (1975 prices). It fell in 1975, steadied in 1976
and fell again in 1977 rose in 1978 with reduced personal taxation and a
faster rise in incomes than in prices.
The combined effect of the tax system and the receipt of transfer payments
and direct and indirect benefits in kind is to redistribute incomes on a more
equal basis. There has been an almost continuous decline in the share of the
top 5 per cent of income recipients from about 20 per cent of income before
tax in 1959 t° just over 16 per cent in 1976-77, accounted for largely by the drop
in the share of the top 1 per cent from about 8 per cent to 5-5 per cent over the
same period. (The fall in the share of the top 1 per cent since 1938-39 had been
about two-thirds.) The share of the bottom 20 per cent had increased between
1959 and 1976-77 from 5-3 to 6-2 per cent. However, more recently during a
period of inflation and wages restraint when the standards of living of all income
groups were falling, those of higher income groups tended to fall more, and
customary differentials between higher and lower employment incomes were
somewhat reduced.
There is very little knowledge about long-term trends in the distribution
of wealth, but such estimates as there are show a substantial fall in the share
owned by the richest people in the community. In 1977 about 24 per cent of
personal wealth was owned by the top 1 per cent of the adult population, and
nearly 85 per cent by the top 25 per cent. The value of State pension rights has
an especially marked effect on these figures; it lowers the share of the top 1 per
cent by a third while the share of the bottom 80 per cent of the adult population
is increased by two-thirds. The proportion of personal wealth held in the form
of physical assets rose from less than a third in i960 to just over 50 per cent in
1976, reflecting especially the increasing importance of dwellings. There has
been a marked decline in the relative importance of company securities in the
composition of personal wealth.
The volume of consumer spending in Britain, after allowing for inflation,
decreased in 1977 but rose in 1978 and showed some signs of growth in early
1:979. Over the period 1970-78 there were some significant changes in the
pattern of expenditure. The shares spent on food, clothing and footwear and
tobacco fell while those spent on housing and on alcoholic drink, particularly
wines and spirits, increased substantially. A large increase in spending on radio
and electrical goods was mainly due to people buying colour televisions (well
over half the television licences are issued for colour), and more recently, video
tape recorders. Expenditure on television rental, too, more than doubled, while
that on admission to cinemas, theatres, spectator sports and the like increased
by more than 29 per cent in real terms.

abroad (net) and taxes paid abroad, adjusted to take account of inflation.
The Role of
Women
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Some 12-6 million visitors to Britain in 1978, a record number, spent a total
of £2,502 million. More overseas visits than ever before were made by British
residents, 13-5 million or 12 per cent higher than the previous highest level in
I975* Visits for holidays were the main reason for this; visits for other reasons
also increased but not as substantially. Following the pattern of recent years,
overseas visitors to Britain spent at a higher average rate per visit than did
British residents visiting overseas.
The general level of nutrition is high. The movement towards a greater use of
convenience (including frozen) foods, and imported foods, in the 1960s has been
partly offset by a reversion to a slightly less expensive diet. Other trends include
the continuing popularity of health foods and slimming products, an increase in
the number of meals eaten away from home, either at work or in restaurants,
and a growth in consumption of food from ‘take-away* and ‘fast food’ shops. The
last 20 years or so have seen a gradual decline in total food supplies per person,
which is regarded as consistent with reductions in physical activity and the
greater proportion of less active people in the population. The trend is common
to most developed countries.
Over the period 1967-77 total estimated consumption of beer (Britain’s most
popular alcoholic drink) rose by 25 per cent per head; that of wine by 83 per
cent; and that of spirits by 67 per cent. A notable development in the 1970s was
the large increase in consumption of lager, now estimated to account for a
quarter of the beer consumed.
The greatest social changes have probably been in the economic and domestic
lives of women. Almost all theoretical sex discrimination in political and legal
rights has been removed.
The changes have been significant but, because tradition and prejudice can
still handicap women in their working careers and personal lives, major
legislation to help to promote equality of opportunity and pay was passed during
the 1970s.
At the heart of women’s changed role in society has been the rise in the
number of women at work, particularly married women. As technology and
society permit highly effective and generally acceptable methods of family
planning there has been a decline in family size. Women as a result are involved
in child-bearing for a much shorter time and, related to this, there has been a
rapid increase, which is still continuing, in the number of women with young
children who return to work when their children are old enough not to need
constant care and attention.
Since 1951 the proportion of married women who work has grown consider¬
ably, to more than half of those under 45 and three-fifths of those between
45 and 60. Compared with their counterparts elsewhere in the European Com¬
munity, British women comprise a relatively high proportion of the workforce,
about two-fifths (only Denmark has a comparable percentage). There is still a
significant difference between women’s average earnings and men’s, but the
equal pay legislation which came into force at the end of 1975 aPPears to have
helped to narrow the gap between women’s and men’s basic rates. During the
1970s women’s wages rose proportionately more than men’s but remain relatively
low because women tend to work in lowly-paid sectors of the economy, they
often work in predominantly female workforces, and they work less overtime
than men. In 1970 the average hourly earnings of men were 60 per cent greater
than those of women (for full-time employment); by 1977 this differential had
been almost halved.
As more and more women joined the workforce in the 1960s and early 1970s
THE LAND AND THE PEOPLE
Ethnic and
National
Minorities
Leisure
Trends
there was an increase in the collective incomes of women as a whole and a major
change in the economic role of large numbers of housewives. Families have
come to rely on married women’s earnings as an essential part of their income
rather than as ‘pocket money’ or a means of buying ‘extras’. At the same time
social roles within the family are increasingly being shared.
Britain has a long history of accommodating minority groups and in the last
hundred years or so a variety of people have settled in the country, some to
avoid political or religious persecution, others seeking a better way of life and an
escape from poverty.
Many Irishmen have made homes in Britain, and comprise the largest
single minority group. Many Jewish refugees started a new life in the country
towards the end of the nineteenth century and in the 1930s, and after 1945
large numbers of other European refugees, Poles in particular, also came to
settle. The large communities from the West Indies and the Indian sub¬
continent date from the 1950s and the early 1960s. There are also sizeable
groups of Americans, Australians, Chinese and various European communities
such as Greek and Turkish Cypriots, Italians and Spaniards. In the last genera¬
tion British society has therefore become more multi-racial as ethnic minority
groups from almost all parts of the world have made a permanent home in the
country. Although a small proportion of the total population, they represent a
significant element in certain areas.
The minority communities tend to live mainly in the urban centres, especially
the largest towns, and in particular areas within these centres. The most recent
immigrants, such as the West Indians and the Asians, are usually concentrated
in the poorer inner city areas, whereas earlier arrivals have tended to move out
to the suburbs.
Most minorities share a way of life that is broadly similar to that of the
British community as a whole, though some of the newer arrivals, mainly
from Commonwealth countries and sometimes with a poor command of the
English language, may face problems of limited employment opportunities
and inadequate housing. Many have, however, opened small family businesses
such as general stores and restaurants which widen the range of choice and
services for local communities. In areas with large and fairly recently-arrived
immigrant populations arrangements are made in schools and elsewhere to
enable host and minority communities to understand each other’s traditions
better and to help immigrants who need special language training.
Most people have considerably more free time, more ways in which to spend it
and higher real incomes than had previous generations. Agreed hours of full¬
time work are usually from 35 to 40 hours a week, although many people
actually work somewhat longer (about 45 on average for manual workers)
because of voluntary overtime work, while the hours worked by women and
girls average somewhat less. Most employees work a five-day week.
Almost all full-time employees are entitled to a paid holiday each year in
addition to public holidays and in practically every case the minimum period
is three weeks.
The number of holidays (of four or more nights) taken in Great Britain by
British residents was 43 million in 1978 compared with 31 million in 1966. More
than two holidays in five in Great Britain are spent at the home of a friend or
relative, and a quarter involve camping or caravanning. Holidays abroad in 1978
numbered 7-5 million, compared with 5*5 million in 1966, and well over half
involved ‘package’ arrangements. Spain is by far the most popular destination,
i8
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and receives well over a quarter of all British holiday-makers abroad. A third of
the population each year, however, takes no holiday away from home.
Leisure patterns generally are determined by age, sex, social class, income,
access to a car and education. The most common activities are home based, or
social, with television-watching the most popular; about 98 per cent of house¬
holds have a television set and in winter the population aged five and over spend
on average 20 hours a week watching programmes.
Other popular pursuits include: listening to the radio, records or tapes;
reading; do-it-yourself (DIY; work done by amateur handy-men such as painting
and decorating their homes); photography, needlework and many other hobbies;
going out for a meal or for a drink to a public house (the ‘pub’ or ‘local’ is a
traditional social centre for many people); gardening (a majority of British
families have some garden or allotment despite the high proportion living in
urban areas); open-air outings; games and sports (as both spectator and partici¬
pants); dancing; going to social clubs1 and leisure centres; cinema going
(especially among young people); visits to buildings and museums; and social
and voluntary work. The social activity with perhaps the largest participation is
the visiting or entertaining of friends or relatives.
1 These include clubs run by political groups; trade unions; church groups; social,
cultural and academic groups; youth clubs and organisations; and groups of local business
and professional people. The longer-established clubs organised on a national basis
include the Working Men’s Clubs and Institutes, the Townswomen’s Guilds and the
Women’s Institutes.

GENERAL SURVEY
The origins and traditions of the United Kingdom are to be found in each of
its four component parts: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
England was united as a kingdom a thousand years ago, and Wales formally
became part of the kingdom in 1536. The thrones of England and Scotland
were dynastically united in 1603, and in 1707 legislation passed in the two
countries provided for the establishment of a single Parliament of Great Britain
with supreme authority both in England and Wales and in Scotland. Ireland
had had links with the kingdom of England since the thirteenth century, and in
1800 the creation of the United Kingdom was completed by a union joining
the Irish Parliament to that of Great Britain. In 1922 Southern Ireland (now
the Irish Republic) became a self-governing country. The six counties of
Northern Ireland had in 1920 been given their own subordinate Parliament,
and voted to remain within the United Kingdom (arrangements in Northern
Ireland are described on p 53).
The United Kingdom Parliament at Westminster in London—with an elected
chamber comprising members from English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern
Ireland constituencies—therefore represents people whose backgrounds and
traditions vary considerably from one part of the country to another. It has
ultimate authority for government and law-making, but administrative arrange¬
ments have developed in such a way as to take account of the particular needs of
different areas.
The United Kingdom is a member of the Commonwealth and of the European
Community (see Chapter 3).
The Scotland Act and the Wales Act passed in July 1978 provided for the
establishment in Scotland and Wales of assemblies with responsibility for a wide
range of their domestic affairs, subject to affirmation in referenda by at least
40 per cent of those entitled to vote. In the referenda which took place in Scotland
and Wales on 1 March 1979, a small majority of votes cast in Scotland (but less
than 33 per cent of total electorate) was in favour of an assembly, and in Wales a
large majority was against. In accordance with the requirement of the Acts the
legislation was repealed and the Government is considering ways of improving
the administration of Scotland and Wales. Talks with the political parties in
Scotland have been proposed and the special arrangements in Parliament for
Scotland and Wales are being extended.
The Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (which are Crown dependencies, not
part of the United Kingdom) have their own legislative assemblies and systems
of local administration and of law, and their own courts. At the same time, they
have a special relationship with the United Kingdom because of the antiquity
of their connection with the Crown. The United Kingdom Government is res¬
ponsible for their defence, their international relations and, ultimately, their good
20
The
Constitution
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
government. They have separate arrangements with the European Community
which take into account their special relationship with the United Kingdom.
The United Kingdom constitution is formed partly by statute, partly by
common law and partly by conventions, which have never been codified and
are not directly enforceable in a court of law, but which, nevertheless, are
regarded as rules of the constitution. Because the constitution is not contained
in any single document, and because it can be altered by the passing of an Act
of Parliament or by general agreement to vary, abolish or create a convention,
it can the more readily be adapted to changing political conditions and ideas.
The organs of government are readily distinguishable although their functions
often intermingle and overlap. They are:
1. the legislature, the supreme authority in the realm (see p 24);
2. the executive, which consists of: (a) the Government—that is the Cabinet and
other ministers of the Crown, who are responsible for initiating and directing
national policy (see p 36); (b) government departments, most of them under
the direct control of ministers and all staffed by civil servants, which are
responsible for administration at the national level (see p 39); (c) local
authorities, which administer and manage many services at the local level
(see p 59); and (d) public corporations which may be responsible for the
operation of particular nationalised industries or, for example, of a social
or cultural service, and which are subject to ministerial control in varying
degrees; and
3. the judiciary, which determines common law and interprets statutes, and
is independent of both the legislature and the executive.
THE MONARCHY
The monarchy is the most ancient secular institution in the United Kingdom.
Its continuity has been broken only once in over a thousand years; and, in
spite of interruptions in the direct line of succession, the hereditary principle
upon which it was founded has never been abandoned. The royal title in the
United Kingdom is: ‘Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith’.
The form of the royal title is varied for those other member States of the
Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of State,1 to suit the particular
circumstances of each. (For a full list of members of the Commonwealth see
P 7S-)
The seat of the monarchy is in the United Kingdom. In the Channel Islands
and the Isle of Man the Queen is represented by a Lieutenant-Governor. In
the other member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is
head of State, her representative is the Governor-General, who is appointed by
her on the advice of the ministers of the country concerned and is wholly
independent of the United Kingdom Government. In the United Kingdom
dependencies the Queen is usually represented by governors who are appointed
by the Crown, having various executive and legislative powers, and are respon¬
sible to the United Kingdom Government for the good government of the
countries concerned.
1 The other Commonwealth countries of which the Queen is head of State are: Australia,
Bahamas, Barbados, Canada, Fiji, Grenada, Jamaica, Mauritius, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Solomon Islands, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tuvalu.

Succession,
Accession and
Coronation
Acts of
Government
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The title to the Crown derives partly from statute and partly from common
law rules of descent. Lineal Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia (the
Electress of Hanover, grand-daughter of James I of England and VI of Scotland)
are alone eligible to succeed, and although succession is not bound to continue
in its present line, it cannot now be altered other than by common consent of
the member nations of the Commonwealth of which the Queen is head of
State. Rules of descent provide that the sons of the Sovereign are in order of
succession to the throne according to their seniority; if there are no sons, the
daughters succeed in order of their seniority. When a daughter succeeds, she
becomes Queen-Regnant and the powers of the Crown are vested in her as fully
and effectively as though she were a king. By convention, the consort of a king
takes the rank and style of her husband; the converse, however, does not apply
and the constitution has never attached any special rank or privileges to the
husband of the Queen-Regnant although in practice he fills an important role
in the life of the nation.
There is no interregnum between the death of one Sovereign and the accession
of another. Immediately on the death of his or her predecessor the new Sovereign
is proclaimed at an Accession Council to which all members of the Privy
Council are summoned. The Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Lord Mayor,
aldermen and other leading citizens of the City of London, and the High
Commissioners in London of the member nations of the Commonwealth are also
invited to attend.
The coronation of the Sovereign, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, follows
the accession after an interval of possibly a year or more. The ceremony has
remained much the same in substance for over a thousand years although the
details have frequently been modified to bring it into conformity with the customs
of the time. The coronation service is held at Westminster Abbey in the presence
of representatives of the Lords, the Commons and all the great public interests
in the United Kingdom, of the Prime Ministers and leading citizens of the other
Commonwealth countries and of representatives of foreign States.
The Queen is the personification of the State. In law, she is the head of the
executive, an integral part of the legislature, the head of the judiciary, the
commander-in-chief of all the armed forces of the Crown and the temporal
‘governor’ of the established Church of England. In practice, as a result of a
long evolutionary process during which the absolute power of the monarchy
has been progressively reduced, the Queen acts on the advice of her ministers
which she cannot constitutionally ignore. The United Kingdom is governed by
Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
Within this framework, and in spite of a trend during the past hundred years
towards assigning powers directly to ministers without any necessity for royal
intervention, there are still important acts of government which require the
participation of the Queen. These include the summoning, prorogation and
dissolution of Parliament; giving royal assent to Bills passed by both Houses
of Parliament; making appointments to all important State offices, including
those of government ministers, judges, officers in the armed forces, governors,
diplomats and all the leading positions in the established Church of England;
conferring peerages, knighthoods and other honours1; and remitting all or part
of the penalty imposed on a person convicted of a crime. An important function
is the appointment of the Prime Minister. This is normally automatic, and the
1 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister,
a few are conferred on her personal selection—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the
Thistle, the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.

Queen must invite the leader of the political party commanding a majority in
the House of Commons to form a government. If, however, no party has a
majority, or if the majority party has no recognised leader, the Queen must
select a Prime Minister, and can consult anyone she wishes. In international
affairs, the Queen as head of State has the power to declare war and make peace,
to recognise foreign States and governments, to conclude treaties and to annexe
or cede territory.
With rare exceptions (such as in the appointment of the Prime Minister)
these and other acts involving the use of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are nowadays
exercised by government ministers who are responsible to Parliament and can
be questioned about a particular policy. The law does not require Parliament’s
prior authority before such powers can be exercised, but Parliament has the
power to pass legislation to restrict or abolish a prerogative right.
Ministerial responsibility for the exercise of powers by the Crown does not,
however, detract from the importance of the Queen’s participation in the smooth
working of government. She holds meetings of the Privy Council, gives audiences
to her ministers and other holders of office at home and overseas, receives
accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads dispatches and signs innumerable State
papers, she must be informed and consulted on every aspect of the national life5
and she must show complete impartiality.
Such is the significance attached to these royal functions that provision has
been made for a regent to be appointed to fulfil them if the Sovereign is totally
incapacitated (or is under the age of 18 years on accession to the throne). The
regent would be the Queen s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, and thereafter those
in succession to the throne who are of age. In the event of the Sovereign’s partial
incapacity or absence abroad, provision is made for the appointment of Coun¬
sellors of State (the Duke of Edinburgh, the four adult persons next in succession
to the Crown, and the Queen Mother) to whom the Sovereign may delegate
certain royal functions. Counsellors of State may not, however, dissolve
Parliament (except on the express instructions of the Sovereign), or create
peers.
Ceremonial has always been associated with British kings and queens, and, in
spite of the changes that have taken place in the outlook of both the Sovereign
and the people, many traditional customs and usages remain. Royal marriages
and royal funerals are marked by public ceremony. The birthday of the Sovereign
is officially celebrated early in June by Trooping the Colour on the Horse Guards
Parade and is also celebrated as Commonwealth Day. State banquets take place
when a foreign monarch or head of State visits the United Kingdom; investitures
are held at Buckingham Palace; and royal processions add significance to such
occasions as the opening of Parliament, when the Queen drives in state from
Buckingham Palace. The Queen and other members of the royal family visit
many parts of the United Kingdom every year, and their presence at scientific,
artistic, industrial and charitable events of national importance encourages
nationwide interest and publicity. The Queen pays State visits to foreign govern¬
ments, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, and undertakes lengthy tours
in other countries of the Commonwealth. Other members of the royal family pay
official visits overseas.
More than three-quarters of all expenditure arising from the official duties of
the royal family is borne on the accounts of public departments—including,
for example, the costs of the royal yacht, the Queen’s Flight, travel by train and
the upkeep of the royal palaces. Apart from this the Queen’s public expenditure
24
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
on staff and expenses incurred in carrying out official duties as head of
State is financed from the Civil List, approved by Parliament. Her private
expenditure as Sovereign is met from the Privy Purse, which is supplied mainly
from the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster1; and her personal expenditure as
a private individual from her own personal resources. Annual allowances
approved by Parliament are specifically made to certain other members of the
royal family. No allowances are made to the Prince of Wales, who as Duke of
Cornwall is entitled to the net revenue of the estate of the Duchy of Cornwall
(he has voluntarily agreed to surrender half the revenue to the nation). The
Queen meets from her Privy Purse the official expenses of members of the royal
family for whom Parliament has not specifically provided.
PARLIAMENT
Parliament is the supreme legislative authority in the United Kingdom. The
three elements of Parliament, the Queen, the House of Lords and the elected
House of Commons, are outwardly separate; they are constituted on different
principles; they work in different places; and they meet together only on
occasions of symbolic significance such as the State opening of Parliament when
the Commons are summoned by the Queen to the House of Lords. As a law¬
making organ of State, however, Parliament as a rule needs the concurrence of
all its parts.
The Parliament at Westminster can legislate for the United Kingdom as a
whole, or any of the constituent countries separately, or for any combination of
them. Parliament can also legislate for the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man,
which are Crown dependencies and not part of the United Kingdom, and have
subordinate legislatures2 which legislate on island affairs.
Because it is not subject to the type of legal restraints imposed on the legis¬
latures of countries with formal written constitutions, Parliament is free to
legislate as it pleases: generally to make, unmake, or alter any law; to legalise
past illegalities and make void and punishable what was lawful when done and
thus reverse the decisions of the ordinary courts; and to destroy established
conventions or turn a convention into binding law. It can prolong its own life
beyond the normal period without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament is slow to exercise its supremacy in this way.
Its members bear in mind the common law and have tended to act in accordance
with precedent and tradition. Moreover, although the validity of an Act of
Parliament that has been duly passed, legally promulgated and published by the
proper authority cannot be disputed in the law courts, no Parliament would be
likely to pass an Act which it knew would receive no public support. The system
of party government helps to ensure that Parliament legislates with its responsi¬
bility to the electorate in mind.
As a member of the European Community, the United Kingdom recognises
the various types of Community legislation (see p 71). The first direct elections
to the European Parliament took place in June 1979 (see p 72).
1 The Duchy of Lancaster is an inheritance which, since i399> has always been enjoyed
by the reigning Sovereign; it is kept quite apart from his or her other possessions and is
separately administered by the Chancellor of the Duchy.
2 The legislatures of the Channel Islands (the States of Jersey and the States of Guernsey)
and the Isle of Man (the Tynwald Court) consist of the Queen, the Privy Council and the
local assemblies. It is the duty of the Home Secretary, as the member of the Privy Council
primarily concerned with island affairs, to scrutinise each legislative measure before it is
submitted to the Queen in Council.
GOVERNMENT
25
The Functions
of Parliament
The Meeting of
Parliament
The House of
Lords
The main functions of Parliament are (1) to pass laws regulating the life of the
community, (2) to provide, by voting taxation, the means of carrying on the
work of government; and (3) to scrutinise government policy and administration,
particularly proposals for expenditure. In discharging these three functions
Parliament helps to bring the relevant facts and issues before the electorate. By
custom, Parliament is also consulted before the ratification of all important
international treaties and agreements, the making of treaties being, in theory at
least, a royal prerogative exercised on the advice of the Government and not
subject to parliamentary approval.
A Parliament (in the sense of a parliamentary period) has a maximum duration
of five years, but is often dissolved and a general election held, before the end
of this term. The maximum life has been prolonged by legislation passed in the
usual way in such rare circumstances as during the two world wars. Dissolution
is ordered by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, by means of a
royal proclamation which, besides dissolving the existing Parliament, orders the
issue of writs for an election, and announces the date on which the new Parlia¬
ment is to meet (not less than 20 days after the dissolution). The proclamation is
followed by the issue of writs in each constituency to cause an election to be held
on the day named.
The life of a Parliament is divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for one
year—beginning and ending most often in October or November and inter¬
spersed with ‘adjournments’ at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter and
the spring holiday and during a long summer recess starting late in July or
early in August. The average number of ‘sitting’ days in a session is about 175
in the House of Commons and about 140 in the House of Lords. At the start of
each session the Queen’s speech to both Houses of Parliament outlines the
Government’s broad policies and proposed legislative programme. Each session
is terminated by prorogation, a prerogative act which appoints the day of meeting
in a new session (on rare occasions Parliament has been dissolved without
prorogation), and a short speech is made on behalf of the Queen summarising
Parliament’s work during the past session. Parliament then ‘stands prorogued’
until the new session opens. Whereas an adjournment does not affect
uncompleted business, the effect of a prorogation is at once to terminate
nearly all parliamentary business, so that all public Bills not completed in the
session lapse, and must be reintroduced in the next unless they are to be
abandoned.
The House of Lords consists of the Lords Spiritual and the Lords Temporal.
The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops of the Church of
England, according to their seniority as diocesan bishops. The Lords Temporal
consist of (1) all hereditary peers and peeresses of England, Scotland, Great
Britain and the United Kingdom who have not disclaimed their peerages under
the Peerage Act 1963, (2) all life peers and peeresses created by the Crown under
the Life Peerages Act 1958, and (3) those Lords of Appeal created life peers
under the Appellate Jurisdiction Acts 1876 and 1887 (as amended) who are
appointed to assist the House in the performance of its judicial duties. Hereditary
peerages carry with them a right to sit in the House of Lords (subject to certain
statutory disqualifications), provided the holder is 21 years of age or over, but
anyone succeeding to a peerage may, within 12 months of succession, disclaim
that peerage for his or her lifetime. Disclaimants lose their right to sit in the
House of Lords but they gain the right to vote at parliamentary elections and to

offer themselves for election to the House of Commons. Some 15 peers have so
far disclaimed. No hereditary peerage has been conferred since 1965.
Not all peers with a right to sit in the House of Lords attend the sittings of
that House. Those who do not wish to attend may apply for leave of absence for
the duration of a Parliament.
Peers who frequently attend the House of Lords (the average daily attendance
is about 310) include elder statesmen and others who have spent their lives in
public service. Lords receive no salary for their parliamentary work, but they
are entitled to recover expenses incurred in attending the House (except for
judicial sittings) and certain travelling expenses.
The House of Lords is presided over by the Lord Chancellor, who takes his
place on the woolsack as ex officio Speaker of the House. In the absence of the
Lord Chancellor his place may be taken by a deputy speaker appointed by the
Crown or a deputy chairman appointed by the House or, if neither a deputy
speaker nor a deputy chairman is present, by a speaker chosen by the Lords
present. The first of the deputy speakers is the Lord Chairman of Committees,
who is appointed each session and takes the chair in all committees, unless the
House otherwise directs. The Lord Chairman and the Principal Deputy Chair¬
man of Committees are salaried officers of the House.
The permanent officers include the Clerk of the Parliaments, who is respon¬
sible for the records of proceedings including judgments and for the promulga¬
tion of Acts of Parliament; the other Clerks at the Table; the Gentleman Usher
of the Black Rod, who is also Serjeant-at-Arms in attendance upon the Lord
Chancellor; and the Yeoman Usher who is Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms.
The House of Commons is a representative assembly elected by universal adult
suffrage and consists of men and women (members of Parliament, ‘MPs’) from
all sections of the community. There are 635 seats in the House of Commons
(516 for England, 36 for Wales, 71 for Scotland, and 12 for Northern Ireland1).
General elections are held after a Parliament has been dissolved and a new
one summoned by the Queen. If a vacancy occurs in the House as a result of
the death or resignation2 of a member, or as a result of his elevation to the
House of Lords, a by-election takes place. Members are paid an annual salary
of £9,450 (to be increased to £12,000 in 1981 with an interim increase in 1980)
and an allowance for secretarial and research expenses. They also have a
number of other allowances, including travel allowances, a supplement for
London members and, for provincial members, subsistence allowances. (For
ministers’ salaries, see p 38.)
The chief officer of the House of Commons is the Speaker, who is elected by
the members to preside over the House. Other parliamentary officers of the
House are the Chairman of Ways and Means, and two deputy chairmen who
act as Deputy Speakers; these officers are elected by the House on the nomination
of the Government and, like the Speaker, neither speak nor vote other than in
their official capacity. The House is administered by a statutory Commission
chaired by the Speaker.
Permanent officers of the House (that is, those who are not members of
1 The House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1979 provides for the number of
parliamentary constituencies in Northern Ireland to be increased from 12 to 17, with the
Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland having power to vary this number between
a minimum of 16 and a maximum of 18. The Boundary Commission is drawing up the
new constituencies.
2 If a member wishes to resign from the House, he or she may apply for what is technically
an office of profit under the Crown (Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds or Steward of the
Manor of Northstead) which automatically involves disqualification from membership of
the House but to which, in fact, no remuneration attaches.

Parliament) include the Clerk of the House of Commons, who conducts the
business of the House in the official department under his control and is the
accounting officer for the House of Commons Estimate, and the Serjeant-at-
Arms, who attends upon the Speaker, executes the orders of the House, is the
official housekeeper of the Commons part of the building, and is responsible
for its security.
b or electoral purposes the United Kingdom is divided into constituencies, each
of which returns one member to the House of Commons. To ensure equitable
representation, four permanent Boundary Commissions (for England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland) make periodic reviews of constituencies and
recommend any redistribution of seats that may seem necessary in the light of
population movements or for some other reason.
Election to the House of Commons is decided by secret ballot. British subjects
(except members of the House of Lords) and citizens of the Irish Republic
resident in the United Kingdom are entitled to vote provided they are 18 years
of age or over, are registered in the annual register of electors, and not subject to
any legal incapacity to vote (that is, are not convicted and sentenced offenders in
penal institutions or persons found guilty of illegal election practices within the
past five years). Service voters (that is, members of the armed forces, Crown
servants and staff of the British Council employed overseas, together with their
wives and husbands if accompanying them) may also be registered for an address
in a constituency, if they normally reside there. Each elector may cast one vote
at a polling station in person, but service voters, voters who are abroad on polling
day because of the nature of their occupation (and their wives or husbands who
accompany them), may vote by proxy. Absent voting facilities also exist for
merchant seamen. Voters entitled to vote by post include those who have a
service vote but happen to be in the United Kingdom at the time of an election,
persons employed on polling day as constables or by the returning officer,
candidates in another constituency and their wives and husbands, and electors
who are blind or physically incapacitated.
Voting is not compulsory but, of nearly 41 million people entitled to vote in
the general election of May 1979, 76 per cent cast their votes. The candidate
who polls the most votes in any constituency is elected; an absolute majority (a
greater number of votes than those cast for all other candidates combined) is not
required.
Anyone, man or woman, who is a British subject and who has reached the age
of 21 can stand for election. Undischarged bankrupts, clergymen of the Church
of England, Church of Scotland, Church of Ireland and Roman Catholic Church,
peers, and certain people holding offices of profit under the Crown are, however,
not eligible. The House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 defines those
who may not become a member of Parliament. They include holders of judicial
office, civil servants and some local government officers, members of the regular
armed forces, members of the police forces and members of public corporations
and government commissions. A candidate usually belongs to one of the main
national political parties, although smaller parties or groupings also nominate
candidates, and individuals may be nominated without party support.
The maximum sum of money that a candidate may spend on an election
campaign is £ 1,750, plus pence for each elector in a borough constituency or
2 pence for each elector in a county constituency. A candidate may send by post
(free of postal charge) an election address to each elector in the constituency. All
other expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal expenses, must not exceed
the statutory limit.
28
The Party
System
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The party system, existing in one form or another since the seventeenth century,
is an essential element in the working of the constitution.
The present system is based upon the existence of organised political parties,
each laying its own policies before the electorate. Whenever there is a general
election or a by-election, the parties may put up candidates for election; any
other citizen who wishes may also stand. The electorate then indicates, by its
choice of candidate at the poll on election day, which of the opposing policies
it would like to see put into effect.
The percentages of votes cast for the main political parties in the general
election held in May 1979 and the resulting distribution of seats in the House of
Commons are given in Table 4.

The party which wins the majority of seats (although not necessarily the
majority of votes) at a general election, or which has the support of a majority of
members in the House of Commons, usually forms the Government. By tradition,
the leader of the majority party is appointed Prime Minister by the Sovereign;
and about 100 of its members in the House of Commons and the House of Lords
receive ministerial appointments (including appointment to the Cabinet—see
p 38) on the advice of the Prime Minister. The largest minority party becomes the
official Opposition with its own leader1 and its own council of discussion or
‘shadow Cabinet’; while the members of any other parties or any independents
who have been elected may support or oppose the Government according to
their party’s or their own view of the policy being debated at any given time.
Similar arrangements for the parties also apply in. the House of Lords; however,
Lords who do not wish to be associated with either the Government or the
Opposition may sit on the cross benches of the Chamber.
The effectiveness of the party system in Parliament largely rests on the
relationship between the Government and the opposition parties. Depending on
the relative voting strengths of the parties in the House of Commons, the
Opposition might seek to overthrow the Government by securing its defeat on a
‘matter of confidence’. In general, however, its aims are to contribute to the

formulation of policy and its expression in legislation by constructive criticism
of the Government’s approach; to oppose specific government proposals that it
considers objectionable; to secure concessions on government Bills; and to
increase support outside Parliament and enhance its chances of success in by-
elections or at the next general election.
The detailed arrangements of government business are settled, under the
direction of the Prime Minister and the Leaders of the two Houses, by the Chief
Government Whips in consultation with the Chief Opposition Whips. The
Chief Whips together constitute the ‘usual channels’ often referred to in the
House of Commons when the question of the possibility of finding time for
debating some particular issue is discussed. The direction of the business of the
Houses is primarily the responsibility of the Leaders of the Houses and it is
their duty to provide all reasonable facilities for the House to debate matters
about which they are concerned.
Outside Parliament, party control is exercised by the national and local
organisations. Inside Parliament, it is exercised by the Chief Whips and their
assistants (chosen within the party) whose duties include keeping members
informed of forthcoming parliamentary business, maintaining the voting
strength of their parties by ensuring the attendance of members at important
debates, and conveying upwards to the party leadership the opinions of their
back-bench members. The Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons
is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; of the other Government Whips,
three (one of whom is deputy Chief Whip) are officers of the Royal Household,
five hold titular posts as Lords Commissioners of the Treasury and five are
Assistant Whips. Salaries are likewise paid to the Chief Opposition Whips in
the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and to two of the Assistant
Whips for the Opposition in the House of Commons. The Government Whips
in the House of Lords hold offices in the Royal Household and act as spokesmen
for the Government in debates.
Annual financial assistance from public funds helps opposition parties in
Parliament to carry out their business. It is limited to parties which had at
least two members elected at the last general election or one member elected
and a minimum of 150,000 votes cast. The formula is: ^550 for every seat and
£1.10 for every 200 votes, up to a maximum of ,£165,000.
Parliamentary procedure is based on custom and precedent, mainly formulated
in standing orders governing details of practice in each House. The system of
debate is much the same in the two Houses: for instance, every matter is deter¬
mined upon questions put from the chair or woolsack and resolved in the affirma¬
tive or negative, as the case may be; and members speak from wherever they
have been sitting and not from a rostrum. The main difference is that in the
House of Lords the office of Speaker carries with it no authority to check or
curtail debate, such matters being decided by the general sense of the House,
whereas in the Commons the Speaker has full authority to give effect, promptly
and decisively, to the rules and orders of the House. The Speaker must guard
against abuse of procedure or any infringement of minority rights, and has a
discretion whether to allow or disallow any closure motion (that is, a motion to
end discussion so that the matter may be put to the vote). The Speaker has
certain powers to check irrelevance and repetition in debate, and to save the
time of the House in various other respects. In case of grave disorder the House
can be adjourned or the sitting suspended on the Speaker’s own initiative. Voting
in the House of Commons is under the direction of the Speaker whose duty it is
to pronounce the final result. In the event of a tied vote the Speaker must give
3°

Proceedings

the casting vote, but he does so only in accordance with rules which preclude an
expression of opinion on the merits of the question.
The procedure on voting in the House of Lords is similar to that in the House
of Commons, except that the Speaker or chairman has an original, but no casting
vote. The general principle is that Bills and subordinate legislation are allowed
to proceed in the form before the House unless a majority votes to reject or
amend them; on other motions the question is decided in the negative unless
there is a majority in favour. When the House is sitting judicially (see pp 106 and
p 117) the judgment under appeal is not changed if the votes are equal.
The House of Commons has a public register of members’ pecuniary interests.
Members with a direct pecuniary interest in a matter before the House must
declare it when participating in debate and must abstain from voting in con¬
nection with it, though in order to operate as a disqualification the interest must
be immediate and personal, and not merely of a general or remote character. In
any proceedings of the House or in transactions with other members or with
ministers or civil servants, members must disclose any relevant pecuniary
interest or benefit.
All proceedings of either House are public, except on extremely rare occasions;
the minutes (in the House of Commons called Votes and Proceedings and in
the House of Lords, Minutes of Proceedings) and the speeches (The Official
Report of Parliamentary Debates, Hansard) are published daily. The records of
the Lords from 1497 and of the Commons from 1547, together with the parlia¬
mentary and political papers of certain past members of the Houses, are available
to the public in the House of Lords Record Office. There are radio broadcasts of
some of the proceedings of both Houses but no television transmissions. A
Parliamentary Sound Archive has been established.
The law undergoes constant reform in the courts as established principles are
interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet new circumstances, but substantial
changes are the responsibility of Parliament and the Government through the
normal legislative process.
Draft legislation takes the form of a parliamentary Bill. Most Bills are public
Bills involving measures relating to public policy, but there are also private
Bills which deal solely with matters of individual, corporate or local interest.
Public Bills can be introduced either by a Government minister or by a private
member of either House of Parliament who does not hold office in the Govern¬
ment. Most public legislation is in practice drafted on behalf of ministers, and
has the support of the Cabinet before being presented to Parliament.
In the modern legislative process, before a Government Bill is finally drafted,
there is normally considerable consultation with, for instance, professional
bodies, voluntary organisations and other agencies interested in the subject
matter of the proposals, such as major interest groups and ‘pressure’ groups
which aim to promote a specific cause. Proposals for legislative changes are
sometimes set out by the Government in ‘White Papers’ which may be debated
in Parliament before the introduction of a Bill. From time to time consultative
documents, sometimes called ‘Green Papers’, are published setting out for
public discussion major ministerial proposals which are still at the formative
stage.
Public Bills can be introduced in either House. As a rule, however, Govern¬
ment Bills likely to raise political controversy go through the Commons before
the Lords, while those of an intricate but uncontroversial nature often pass
through the Lords first. A Bill with a mainly financial purpose is nearly always
introduced in the Commons, and a Bill involving taxation must be based on
GOVERNMENT
31
resolutions agreed to by that House, often after debate, before it can be intro¬
duced. If the main object of a Bill is to create a public charge, it can only be
introduced by a minister or, if brought from the Lords, be proceeded with in
the Commons if taken up by a minister, which gives the Government consider¬
able control over legislation.
At the beginning of each session private members of the Commons ballot
for precedence in introducing a Bill during time specially allocated for private
members’ Bills; the first 20 are successful. A private member may also present
a Bill after question time on notice given, or seek leave to introduce a Bill under
the ‘ten minute rule’ which allows two speeches, one in favour of and one
against the measure, after which the House decides whether to allow the Bill
to be brought in. Private members’ Bills do not often proceed very far, but a
few become law each session. If one secures a second reading, the Government
usually introduces any necessary money resolution. Private members’ Bills may
be introduced in the House of Lords at any time, without notice, but the time
that can be given to them in the Commons is strictly limited.
The process of passing a public Bill is similar in both Houses of Parliament.
The Bill receives a formal first reading on introduction, it is printed, and after
a while (between one day and several weeks depending on the nature of the
Bill) it is given a second reading after a debate on its general principles and
merits. In the Commons a non-controversial Bill may be referred to a second
reading committee to recommend whether it should be taken as read a second
time. After a second reading in the Commons, a Bill is usually referred for
detailed examination to a standing committee (see p 32). If the House so decides,
the Bill may be referred to the whole House sitting in committee. The House
may vote to limit the time devoted to examining a Bill by passing a timetable
motion, commonly referred to as a ‘guillotine’. In the Lords a Bill is considered
by a committee of the whole House as a matter of course, unless the House takes
the rare decision to refer it to a Public Bill Committee. The committee stage is
followed by the report stage, during which previous amendments may be
altered and new amendments incorporated. At the third reading a Bill is re¬
viewed in its final form. In the Commons this stage is taken without a debate
unless there is a motion in the name of six members that the question ‘be not
put forthwith’—a procedure of which substantial use is made.
After the third reading a Commons Bill is sent to the Lords where it goes
through broadly the same stages. Similarly a Bill which starts in the Lords and
is passed by that House is then sent to the Commons for all the stages there.
Amendments made by the second House generally must be agreed by the first,
or a compromise reached, before a Bill can become law.
Most Government Bills introduced and passed in the Lords pass through
the Commons without difficulty because of their non-controversial nature.
However, should any non-governmental Lords Bill be unacceptable to the
Commons it would not generally become law because no debating time would
be allotted to it. The Lords, on the other hand, cannot in general prevent a Bill
insisted upon by the Commons from finally becoming law. In the normal course
of events they either accept a Commons Bill without changes, or they amend
and return it for consideration by the Commons, who frequently agree to the
amendments made. In practice, the Lords pass without amendment such
financial Bills as the Finance Bill, which authorises taxation, or the Consolidated
Fund or Appropriation Bill, which authorises national expenditure. A Bill that
deals only with taxation or expenditure must become law within one month of
being sent to the Lords, whether or not they have agreed to it, unless the
Commons directs to the contrary. If no agreement is reached between the two

Houses on a non-financial Commons Bill (or an amendment to it) the Lords can
in practice delay the Bill (with certain exceptions) for about 13 months. At the
end of this time it becomes law in the form originally passed by the Commons.
Bills to lengthen the life of a Parliament require the full assent of both Houses
in the normal way. The limitations on the power of the Lords are based on the
belief that the principal legislative function of the non-elected House nowadays
is to act as a chamber of revision, complementing, not rivalling, the elected
House.
When a Bill has passed through all its parliamentary stages, it is sent to the
Queen for royal assent, after which it is part of the law of the land and known
as an Act of Parliament. The royal assent has not been refused since 1707.
Private Bills, which can be promoted by people or organisations outside
Parliament, go through substantially the same procedure as public Bills, but
most of the work is done in committee, where proceedings follow a semi¬
judicial pattern: the promoter must prove the need for the powers or privileges
he seeks, and objections on the part of the opposing interests are heard. Both
parties may be legally represented.
The system of delegated legislation, which is used to relieve pressure on parlia¬
mentary time, empowers ministers and other authorities to regulate administra¬
tive details after a Bill has become an Act. In order to minimise the risk that
powers thus conferred on the executive might supersede or weaken parliamentary
government, they are normally delegated to the Queen in Council or to authorities
directly responsible to Parliament, that is, to government ministers, government
departments for which ministers are responsible, or to organisations whose
regulations are subject to confirmation or approval by ministers who thereby
become responsible to Parliament for them. Moreover, the Acts of Parliament
by which particular powers are delegated normally provide for some measure of
parliamentary control over legislation made in the exercise of these powers, for
instance, by reserving to Parliament the right to affirm or annul the orders them¬
selves. Certain Acts also require direct consultation with organisations which will
be affected thereby before rules and orders (in the form of statutory instruments)
are made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports on the technical propriety of
statutory instruments. In the Commons, in order to save time, discussions on
the merits of the instruments are often referred to standing committees with any
decisions reserved to the House.
Either House may resolve itself into a committee, known as a committee of
the whole house, to consider Bills in detail, clause by clause, after their second
reading. A committee of the whole house is presided over by the Chairman of
Ways and Means (the Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords) or a
deputy chairman.
House of Commons standing committees include those which examine public
Bills at the committee stage and, in certain cases, at the second reading and
report stages; two Scottish standing committees; the Scottish Grand Com¬
mittee; the Welsh Grand Committee; and the Northern Ireland standing
committee. Ordinary standing committees have no distinctive names, being
referred to simply as Standing Committee A, B, C, and so on. Each has between
16 and 50 members with the balance of the parties reflecting as far as possible
that in the House as a whole. The Scottish Grand Committee, which comprises

all 71 Scottish members and 10 to 15 others, considers the principles of Scottish
Bills referred to it at second reading stage, the Scottish estimates and other
matters relating exclusively to Scotland. The Welsh Grand Committee, with
all 36 Welsh members and up to five others, considers Bills referred to it at
second reading stage, and matters relating exclusively to Wales. The Northern
Ireland committee considers matters relating specifically to the province. A
standing committee on regional affairs comprising the 516 members from English
constituencies considers matters relating to the English regions. The Lords
equivalent to a standing committee, a Public Bill Committee, is rarely used.
Select committees are generally set up, by either House, to help Parliament
with the control of the executive by examining some aspect of administration
and reporting to the House. They may be appointed as occasion demands, or
for a session, or for the rest of the life of a Parliament. On rare occasions a
parliamentary Bill is examined by a select committee (a procedure additional
to the usual legislative process). Select committees are constituted on a party
basis, in approximate proportion to party strength in the House.
A new structure of select committees has been agreed and it is intended to
replace committees dealing with specific topics, for example, nationalised
industries and science and technology by 12 new committees, each of which will
examine the work of one of the main government departments. The Committee
of Selection and the Standing Orders Committee have duties relating to private
Bills, and the Committee of Selection also chooses members to serve on standing
and select committees.
In their scrutiny of administrative activity and government policies, the
committees question ministers, senior civil servants and interested bodies and
individuals. They bring before Parliament and the public generally, through
their hearings and published reports, a body of fact and informed opinion on
many important issues and they build up considerable expertise in their subjects
of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, as well as the Appeal and Appellate Committees in
which the bulk of the House’s judicial work is transacted, there are sessional
committees on the European Communities, House of Lords offices, hybrid
instruments, leave of absence and lords’ expenses, personal Bills, private Bills,
standing orders, privileges, procedure, selection and sound broadcasting.
The two Houses may agree to set up joint select committees, and joint com¬
mittees are also appointed in each session to deal with Consolidation Bills and
delegated legislation.
In addition to the official committees of the two Houses there are several un¬
official party organisations or committees. The Conservative and Unionist
Members Committee, popularly known as the 1922 Committee, consists of
the back-bench membership of the party. The Parliamentary Labour Party
is a corporate body comprising all members of the party in both Houses; when
the Labour Party is in office a liaison committee acts as a channel of communi¬
cation between the Government and its back-benchers in both Houses; when
the party is in opposition the Parliamentary Labour Party is organised under
the direction of a Parliamentary Committee.
Other Forms of The effectiveness of parliamentary control of the Government is a subject of
Parliamentary continuing discussion, both inside Parliament and in Britain generally. Control
Control of the Government is exercised in the final analysis by the ability of the House

of Commons to force it to resign either by passing a resolution of ‘no confidence’
or by rejecting a proposal which the Government considers so vital to its policy
that it has made it a ‘matter of confidence’ or, ultimately, by refusing to vote
the money required for the public service. A number of opportunities for a
searching examination of government policy by both the Opposition and the
Government’s own back-benchers are provided in the procedure of the House
of Commons. As well as the system of scrutiny by select committees, these
include:
1. Question time, which is an hour of parliamentary time on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday during which ministers, in rotation, answer
questions put to them on matters for which they are responsible. Parlia¬
mentary questions are one means of eliciting information about the Govern¬
ment’s intentions, as well as a way of airing, and possibly securing redress of,
grievances brought to members’ notice by constituents.
2. The right of members to use motions for the adjournment of the House to
initiate discussions on constituency cases or matters of public concern.
There is a half-hour adjournment period at the end of public business; and
immediately before the adjournment for each recess (Christmas, Easter,
spring and the summer) a day is spent discussing matters raised by private
members. Moreover, a member wishing to discuss a ‘specific and important
matter that should have urgent consideration’ may, at the end of question
time, ask leave to move the adjournment of the House. If the Speaker accepts
the terms of the motion, the member asks the House for leave for it to be put
forward. Leave can be given unanimously, or if 40 or more members support
the motion, or if fewer than 40 but more than ten support it and the House
(on a vote) is in favour. Once leave has been given, the matter is debated for
three hours, usually on the following day.
3. The 29 ‘supply’ days each session, which were formerly used to discuss
details of proposed government expenditure, and which are nowadays
time for the Opposition to choose subjects for debate. (Scrutiny by small
committees has been found more apt for detailed expenditure proposals.)
Procedural opportunities for criticism of the Government also arise during
the debate on the Queen’s speech at the beginning of a session, during debates
or motions of censure for which the Government gives up part of its own time,
and during debates on the Government’s legislative proposals.
Opportunities for criticism of the Government are also provided in the House
of Lords at question time, during debates on specific motions and in ‘unstarred’
(that is, debatable) questions at the end of the day’s business.
The involvement of Parliament, and more particularly the House of Com¬
mons, in the management of the revenues of the State and payments for the
public service is described in Chapter 18, Finance.
Arrangements have been made in Parliament to keep the two Houses informed
about European Community developments, and to enable them to scrutinise
and debate proposals for Community legislation and other policies which are
to be decided in the Council of Ministers.
The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (the ‘Parliamentary
Ombudsman’) is an independent statutory officer whose function is to investigate
complaints of maladministration when so requested by members of the House
of Commons on behalf of members of the public. Powers of investigation extend
to actions taken by central government departments in the exercise of their
GOVERNMENT
Parliamentary
Privilege
35
administrative functions, but not to policy decisions (which are the concern of
the Government and can be questioned in Parliament). Certain administrative
actions also outside the Commissioner’s jurisdiction include matters affecting
relations with other countries. Complaints by British citizens arising from deal¬
ings with British posts overseas are open to investigation in some circumstances.
The Parliamentary Commissioner has access to all departmental papers in the
course of an investigation and reports findings to the member of Parliament who
presented the complaint. The Parliamentary Commissioner reports annually to
Parliament and may submit other reports, for example, of individual
investigations.
A select committee of the House of Commons makes recommendations in
connection with the Parliamentary Commissioner’s work but does not review
individual cases.
Each House of Parliament enjoys certain rights and immunities designed to
protect it from unnecessary obstruction in carrying out its duties. Those rights
apply collectively to each House and individually to each member.
For the Commons the Speaker formally claims from the Crown ‘their ancient
and undoubted rights and privileges’ at the beginning of each Parliament.
These include freedom of speech in debate; freedom from arrest in civil process;
and the right of access to the Crown, which is a collective privilege of the
House. Further privileges include the right of the House to control its own
proceedings (so that it is able, for instance, to exclude strangers if it so wishes);
the right to pronounce upon legal disqualifications for membership and to
declare a seat vacant on such grounds; and the right to penalise those who
commit a breach of its privileges.
The privileges of the House of Lords include: freedom of speech in debate;
freedom of access to the Sovereign for each peer individually; and the right to
commit for contempt. These privileges are not formally claimed by the Speaker
as in the House of Commons; they exist independently.
THE PRIVY COUNCIL
Until the eighteenth century, the Sovereign in Council, or Privy Council, was
the chief source of executive power in the State. As the system of Cabinet
government developed, however, the Privy Council became less prominent.
Many of its powers were transferred to the Cabinet as an inner committee
of the Privy Council, and much of its work was handed over to newly created
government departments, some of which were originally committees of the
Privy Council. Nowadays the Privy Council is responsible for advising the
Queen to approve Orders in Council, of which there are two kinds, differing
fundamentally in constitutional principle: those made by virtue of the royal
prerogative, such as Orders approving the grant of royal charters of incorpora¬
tion; and those made under statutory powers, which are the highest form of
delegated legislation. It is an accepted principle that members of the Privy
Council attending meetings at which Orders in Council are made do not thereby
become personally responsible for the policy upon which the orders are based;
this rests with the minister responsible for the subject matter of the order in
question, whether or not he or she was present at the meeting.
The Privy Council also advises the Crown on the issue of royal proclamations,
some of the most important of which relate to prerogative acts (such as sum¬
moning or dissolving Parliament) of the same validity as Acts of Parliament.
The Privy Council’s own statutory responsibilities, which are independent of
36 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the powers of the Sovereign in Council, include powers of supervision over the
registering bodies for the medical and allied professions.
Apart from Cabinet Ministers, who must be Privy Counsellors and are
sworn of the Council on first assuming office, membership of the Privy Council
(which is retained for life) is accorded by the Sovereign on the recommendation
of the Prime Minister to certain eminent persons in independent monarchical
countries of the Commonwealth. There are about 360 Privy Counsellors. The
whole Privy Council is called together only on the death of the Sovereign or
when the Sovereign announces his or her intention to marry.
There are a number of advisory Privy Council committees whose meetings differ
from those of the Privy Council itself in that the Sovereign cannot constitutionally
be present. These may be prerogative committees, such as those which deal with
legislative matters submitted by the legislatures of the Channel Islands and Isle
of Man and with applications for charters of incorporation; or they may be
provided for by statute as are those for the universities of Oxford and Cambridge
and the Scottish universities.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal
from the courts of the United Kingdom dependencies, courts of independent
members of the Commonwealth which have not elected to discontinue the
appeal, courts of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and certain other
courts, some professional and disciplinary committees and church sources.
The administrative work of the Privy Council committees is carried out in
the Privy Council Office under the Lord President of the Council, a senior
Cabinet minister, with responsibility for work relating to the development of
political institutions.

HER MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT
Her Majesty’s Government is the body of ministers responsible for the admini¬
stration of national affairs.
The Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
The majority of ministers are members of the House of Commons. However,
the Government must be fully represented by ministers in the House of Lords
as it requires spokesmen of standing to expound its policy and justify its actions
to that House. The Lord Chancellor is always a member of the House of Lords.
t
Composition The composition of the Government is subject to variation from time to time,
both in the number of ministers and in the titles of some offices. The creation
of a paid ministerial office with entirely new functions requires legislation, but
the abolition of an office, the transfer of functions from one minister to another,
or a change in the designation of a minister may be effected by Order in Council.
Ministers may be classified as follows:
Prime Minister The Prime Minister is also First Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The head of the Government became known as the Prime Minister
during the eighteenth century. The unique position of authority enjoyed by the
holder of this office derives from the ability to command a majority in Parliament
and from the power to submit a personal choice of ministers to the Queen and
to obtain their resignation or dismissal individually. By convention, the Prime
Minister always sits in the House of Commons.
The Prime Minister informs the Queen of the general business of the Govern-
GOVERNMENT 37
ment; presides over the Cabinet; and is responsible for the allocation of functions
among ministers.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities include making recommendations
to the Queen for the appointment of Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans and the incumbents of some 200 Crown livings, as well as for appoint¬
ments to high judicial offices, such as the Lord Chief Justice, Lords of Appeal
in Ordinary, and Lord Justices of Appeal. They also include advising the Queen
on appointments of Privy Counsellors, Lords-Lieutenant and certain civil
appointments, such as Lord High Commissioner of the General Assembly of
the Church of Scotland, Poet Laureate, Constable of the Tower, and some
university appointments which are in the gift of the Crown. The Prime Minister
makes similar recommendations for appointments to various public boards and
institutions, such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well as to various
royal and statutory commissions. Recommendations are likewise made to the
Queen for the award of many civil honours and distinctions and of Civil List
pensions (awarded to people who have achieved eminence in science and the
arts and who are in some financial need). The Prime Minister also selects the
trustees of certain national museums and institutions.
Departmental Departmental ministers are in charge of government departments. The holders
Ministers of these offices, who are usually in the Cabinet, are known as ‘Secretary of
State’ or ‘Minister’, or they may have a special title, as in the case of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer (who is responsible for the Treasury and a number
of sub-departments).
Non-
Departmental
Ministers
Non-departmental ministers include the holders of various traditional offices—
the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,
the Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General—and from time to time Ministers
without Portfolio. These ministers may have few or no departmental duties and
are thus available to perform any special duties which the Prime Minister may
wish to entrust to them. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, for example,
has ministerial responsibility for the arts and the Paymaster General is responsible
for co-ordinating information. (The Lord President of the Council and the Lord
Privy Seal, however, have been given departmental responsibilities within the Civil
Service Department and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office respectively.)
Lord Chancellor The Lord Chancellor holds a special position, being a Minister of the Crown
and Law Officers with departmental functions and also head of the judiciary in England and
Wales. The four Law Officers of the Crown are: for England and Wales, the
Attorney General and the Solicitor General; for Scotland, the Lord Advocate
and the Solicitor General for Scotland.
Ministers of State Ministers of State are usually appointed to work with ministers in charge of
government departments. Although the departmental minister is ultimately
responsible for the department, Ministers of State may be responsible to him or
her for specific functions and sometimes their titles reflect these particular
functions. More than one Minister of State may be appointed to a particular
department. It is possible for a Minister of State to be given a seat in the Cabinet
and paid accordingly.
Junior Ministers Junior ministers generally have the title of Parliamentary Secretary or, where
the senior minister is a Secretary of State, Parliamentary Under Secretary of
State. They share in parliamentary debates, answering parliamentary questions,
and assisting in departmental duties. In certain cases, however, they may be
38
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
given responsibility, directly under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury
and the other Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are in a different category
as Government Whips (see p 29).
Ministerial The salaries of ministers in the House of Commons range from £9,811 a year
Salaries for junior ministers and £12,625 to £15,339 f°r more senior ministers to £19,650
or £19,764 for Cabinet ministers. The Prime Minister receives £22,000 a year.
The Lord Chancellor receives £22,228 a year, including £2,500 for the speaker-
ship of the House of Lords. (Increased rates for 1981 have been agreed, with an
interim increase in 1980; the Prime Minister and Lord Chancellor have declined
an increase until 1981).
Ministers in the House of Commons, including the Prime Minister, also
have parliamentary salaries of £5,265 (£5,650 for non-Cabinet ministers) in
recognition of their constituency responsibilities and are entitled to claim the
allowances paid to all members of the House.
The Cabinet The Cabinet is composed of about 20 ministers personally selected by the
Prime Minister and may include the holders of departmental and non-depart-
mental offices. Its origins can be traced back to the informal conferences that the
Sovereign held with leading ministers, independently of the Privy Council,
during the seventeenth century. After the Sovereign’s withdrawal from an
active role in politics in the eighteenth century, and the development of organised
political parties stimulated by successive extensions of the franchise from 1832
onwards, the Cabinet assumed its modern form.
The functions of the Cabinet are: the final determination of the policy to
be submitted to Parliament; the supreme control of the national executive in
accordance with the policy agreed by Parliament; and the continuous co¬
ordination and delimitation of the authority of government departments. The
exercise of these functions is vitally affected by the fact that the Cabinet is a
group of party representatives, depending for its existence upon the support of
a majority in the House of Commons.
The Cabinet meets in private and its proceedings are strictly confidential. Its
members are bound by their oath as Privy Counsellors not to disclose information
about its proceedings. The Official Secrets Acts forbid the publication of
Cabinet as well as of other State papers (although after they have been in
existence for 30 years they may be made available for inspection in the Public
Record Office) and a resigning minister wishing to make a statement involving
disclosure of Cabinet discussions should first obtain the permission of the
Queen through the Prime Minister.
In normal times the Cabinet meets for a few hours once or twice a week
during parliamentary sittings, and rather less frequently when Parliament is not
sitting. Additional meetings may be called by the Prime Minister at any time if
a matter urgently requiring discussion should arise. To keep the amount of work
coming before the Cabinet within manageable limits, a great deal of the work
of the Cabinet is carried on through the committee system, which involves the
reference of any issue either to a standing Cabinet committee or to an ad hoc
committee composed of the ministers primarily concerned. The committee then
considers the matter in detail and either disposes of it or reports upon it to the
Cabinet with recommendations for action. The present Cabinet has four standing
committees: a defence and overseas policy committee and an economic strategy
committee both under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister; a home and

social affairs committee under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary; and a
legislation committee under the chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor. Sub¬
committees of the standing committees may be established. The membership and
terms of reference of all Cabinet committees is confidential.
Ministers not in the Cabinet may attend its meetings for discussion of matters
affecting their departments; they may also be members of Cabinet committees.
Ihe Secretary of the Cabinet and senior officials of the Cabinet Office also
attend meetings of the Cabinet and its committees as appropriate.
The term ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the collective responsibility
which ministers share for government policy and actions and to ministers’
individual responsibility to Parliament for their departments’ work.
The doctrine of collective responsibility, which was fully accepted by the
middle of the nineteenth century, means that the Cabinet is bound to offer
unanimous advice to the Queen even when Cabinet Ministers do not hold
identical views on a given subject. Consequently it means that the policy of
departmental ministers must be consistent with the policy of the Government
as a whole. In principle, once the Government’s policy on a matter has been
decided, each minister is expected to support it, unless he or she chooses to
resign. On rare occasions, ministers have been allowed free votes in Parliament
on government policies involving important issues of principle. The individual
responsibility of a minister for the work of his or her department means that, as
political head of that department, he or she is answerable for all its acts and
omissions and must bear the consequences of any defect of administration, any
injustice to an individual or any aspect of policy which may be criticised in
Parliament, whether personally responsible or not. Since the majority of ministers
are members of the House of Commons, they are available to answer questions
and to defend themselves against criticism in person. Departmental ministers in
the House of Lords are represented in the Commons by someone qualified to
speak on their behalf, usually a Minister of State or a Parliamentary Secretary.
Departmental ministers normally decide all matters within their responsibility,
although on important political matters they usually consult their colleagues
collectively, through the Cabinet or a Cabinet committee. Any decision by a
departmental minister binds the Government as a whole.
I he responsibility of ministers for their departments is an effective way of
bringing government under public control, for the knowledge that any depart¬
mental action may be reported to and examined in Parliament discourages the
taking of arbitrary and ill-considered decisions.
On assuming office ministers must resign directorships in private and public
companies. In all other respects they must order their affairs in such a way that
there is no conflict between their public duties and their private interests.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Government departments are the main instruments for giving effect to govern¬
ment policy when Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. They may,
and frequently do, work with and through local authorities, statutory boards,
and government-sponsored organisations1 operating under various degrees of
government control.
i The Survey of Fringe Bodies (see Bibliography) lists some of these organisations and boards.
1 hey are sometimes referred to as ‘quangos’ (often taken to stand for ‘quasi-autonomous
non-governmental organisations’, although there is no precise definition of the term). As
a result ot a review of such organisations being undertaken by the Government with a view
to a reduction in their numbers and expense, some have been disbanded.

Bodies
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A change of government does not necessarily affect the number or general
functions of government departments, although a radical change in policy may
be accompanied by some organisational change.
The work of some departments (for instance, the Ministry of Defence)
covers the United Kingdom as a whole. Other departments (for example, the
Department of Employment) cover England, Wales, and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others, such as the Department of Education and Science and
the Department of the Environment, are mainly concerned with affairs in England.
There are separate departments for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.
A department is usually headed by a minister. Certain departments in which
questions of policy do not normally arise are headed by a permanent official, and
a minister with other duties is responsible for them to Parliament. For instance,
the minister in charge of the Civil Service Department is responsible for the
Central Office of Information, Her Majesty’s Stationery Office, and the Depart¬
ment of the Government Actuary; and Treasury ministers are responsible for
the Board of Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue, the Department for
National Savings and a number of small departments including the Treasury
Solicitor’s Department, the Royal Mint, and the National Debt Office. Generally,
departments receive their funds directly out of money provided by Parliament
and are staffed by the Civil Service.
Departments differ in size and in the volume, type and complexity of their
work. Since each department makes its own arrangements for discharging its
duties, there are variations in internal organisation. Most departments, however,
have certain features in common: for instance, the minister of a major department
is likely to have at the head of his or her officials a permanent secretary, sometimes
assisted by one or more second permanent secretaries, and also one or more
deputy secretaries, and a varying number of under secretaries and assistant
secretaries. Usually major departments also have a principal finance officer and
a principal personnel and organisation officer. Many departments also have their
own legal advisers or solicitors, economists and statisticians and their own
information divisions. The Government Statistical Service, which includes the
Central Statistical Office (CSO), the Business Statistics Office (BSO), the Office
of Population Censuses and Surveys and the statistics divisions of the major
departments, provides a service of statistical information and advice. Each
department compiles statistics relating to its own policy area and publishes
them, usually through its own publications. Information about individual
industries is published by the BSO in Business Monitors.
Some departments maintain a regional organisation, and some that have
direct contact with the public throughout the country also have local offices.
Many government departments are assisted by advisory councils or committees
(several hundred in all) which undertake research and collect information,
mainly to enable ministers to ascertain informed opinion before coming to a
decision involving a legislative or executive act. In some cases there is a statutory
obligation on a minister to consult a standing committee, but usually advisory
bodies are appointed at the discretion of the minister concerned because he or she
feels the need for their advice.
The membership of the advisory councils and committees varies according
to the nature of the work involved, and may include civil servants and repre¬
sentatives of varying interests and professions—for instance, industrialists,
trade unionists, university and industrial scientists, educationists, lawyers and
local government councillors and officers.

In addition to these standing advisory bodies, there are ad hoc committees
which the Government frequently sets up to examine and make recommendations
on specific matters. For certain important inquiries Royal Commissions, whose
members are selected on the grounds of their wide experience and diverse
knowledge, may be appointed (by royal warrant). Royal Commissions examine
written and oral evidence from government departments and interested organisa¬
tions and individuals, and on this evidence submit recommendations. The
Government may accept the recommendations in whole or in part, or it may
decide to take no further action or to delay action. Inquiries may also be under¬
taken by departmental committees, appointed by the head of the appropriate
department.
of The following pages provide an outline of the principal functions of the main
government departments. They are arranged in alphabetical order, except for
the Cabinet Office, the Civil Service Department, and the Treasury (which,
in view of their central positions, are placed first) and the Scottish and Northern
Ireland departments (which are grouped at the end of the section). Further
information on the work of departments is given in later chapters under the
relevant subject headings.
The Cabinet Office, headed by the Secretary of the Cabinet, under the direction
of the Prime Minister, comprises the Cabinet Secretariat, the Central Policy
Review Staff, the Central Statistical Office and the Historical Section.
The Cabinet Secretariat serves ministers collectively in the conduct of Cabinet
business. It operates as an instrument in the co-ordination of policy at the
highest level. Functions of the office include circulating the memoranda and
other documents required for Cabinet or Cabinet committee business, preparing
agenda for meetings of the Cabinet and its committees, recording their discus¬
sions and circulating the minutes, keeping in touch with the progress of action
on decisions, and safeguarding the security of documents.
The Central Policy Review Staff advises ministers collectively on major issues
of policy.
The Central Statistical Office is concerned with the preparation and inter¬
pretation of the statistics necessary to support economic and social policies and
management. It is directly responsible for the central economic aggregates such
as the national accounts, balance of payments, financial statistics and measures
of output and it prepares a wide range of statistical publications. It co-ordinates
the statistical work of other departments and agencies and its director is head
of the Government Statistical Service.
The Historical Section of the Cabinet Office is in the process of completing
the official histories of the second world war, and is responsible for the prepara¬
tion of official histories of certain peacetime events.
The Civil Service Department is responsible for the management of the Civil
Service and is under the control of the Prime Minister as Minister for the Civil
Service. Responsibility for day-to-day work is delegated to a senior minister, the
Lord President of the Council, who is assisted by a minister of State. The
Department s Permanent Secretary, its most senior civil servant, is also the
official head of the Home Civil Service.
The Department is responsible for personnel management in the Civil Service,
which includes policy and central arrangements for recruitment, training (includ¬
ing the Civil Service College), promotion, general career management, catering,
welfare and retirement. It is also responsible for controlling expenditure on Civil
42

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Service manpower and related administrative expenses, for pay, pensions, and
conditions of service in the Civil Service, and for the co-ordination of pay and
pension policies in the public sector as a whole. Further responsibilities include
advising the Prime Minister on the allocation of functions and responsibilities
between ministers, making recommendations to the Prime Minister on senior
appointments and advising on public appointments made by ministers generally.
The Department also advises other departments on the development and appli¬
cation of new systems and techniques in management and administration; the
provision of central management services covering subjects and techniques such
as organisation and methods, operational research and management accounting;
and central planning, procurement and co-ordination of government computing.
The Civil Service Commission, which is responsible for recruitment to the Civil
Service, forms part of the Civil Service Department. In matters concerned with
recruitment policy, the commissioners are responsible to ministers in the normal
way, but in the selection of individuals for appointment they act under Order in
Council and are completely independent of ministers.
Parliamentary
Counsel
Office
The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is responsible for the drafting of all
Government Bills, except Bills or provisions of Bills extending exclusively to
Scotland, which are handled by the Lord Advocate’s Department. The Office
advises departments on questions of parliamentary procedure; and attends
sittings (and committees) of both Houses as required. In addition the Parlia¬
mentary Counsel draft subordinate legislation when specially instructed, and
advise the Government on legal, parliamentary and constitutional questions
falling within their special experience.
The Treasury Nominally the heads of the Treasury are the Lords Commissioners: the First
Lord of the Treasury (always the Prime Minister), the Chancellor of the Ex¬
chequer and five junior Lords. In practice, the Lords Commissioners never meet
as a board and their responsibilities are carried by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer assisted by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Financial
Secretary and two Ministers of State. The Parliamentary Secretary to the
Treasury is the Chief Government Whip in the House of Commons.
The Treasury is the government department primarily responsible for the
development of Britain’s overall economic strategy. Its Public Services Sector
is responsible for controlling aggregate public expenditure and for most of the
individual public expenditure programmes; the Domestic Economy Sector is
concerned with fiscal, monetary and counter-inflation policies, and with the
Treasury’s contribution to industrial policies, including control of public
expenditure on industry and agriculture; the Overseas Finance Sector is respon¬
sible for balance of payments policies, the management of Britain’s foreign
currency reserves, international monetary questions, financial relations with
other countries and the aid programme; and the Chief Economic Adviser’s
Sector is responsible for the preparation of short-term and medium-term
economic forecasts and for specialist advice on broad economic policies.
The Ministry of The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is responsible for administering
Agriculture, government policy for the agriculture, horticulture and fishing industries in
Fisheries and England, and for matters relating to the food and drink manufacturing and
Food distribution industries in Britain generally. Directed by the Minister of Agricul¬
ture, Fisheries and Food (who is assisted by two Ministers of State and a Parlia¬
mentary Secretary) its functions include the administration, in co-operation with

the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce, of agricultural support, and in
particular the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community. The
Ministry also administers schemes such as those designed for the control and
eradication of animal and plant diseases and grants to encourage capital invest¬
ment in the agricultural and horticultural industry including those for the
improvement and drainage of agricultural land; and it exercises responsibilities
relating to applied research and development. In addition it is concerned with the
safety and quality of food including standards of composition, labelling and
advertising, food additives and contaminants; and it has certain responsibilities
for ensuring public health standards in the production and handling of basic
foods in cargoes, stores and slaughterhouses. Where appropriate these measures
and those of the Community are being harmonised.
The Ministry’s responsibilities extend to Scotland and Wales regarding the
operational control of certain diseases of animals. It also acts on behalf of the
Secretary of State for Wales in certain matters relating to, for instance, fisheries,
the provision of agricultural advice and the safety and quality of food.
The Ministry maintains relations with other Commonwealth and foreign
countries and participates in certain of the activities of a number of international
organisations concerned with agriculture, fisheries and food, and trade in food
products, such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations,
and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
An executive department subject to the direction and control of ministers
responsible for agriculture, the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce is
responsible for the implementation in the United Kingdom of the market
support arrangements and certain other aspects of the European Community’s
Common Agricultural Policy provided for under the guarantee section of the
European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund. In consultation with the
Overseas Development Administration, the Board is responsible for mobilising
cereals for developing countries under the Food Aid Convention 1971, and for
administering occasional Community donations of other commodities to
developing countries and areas of national disasters.
The Office of Arts and Libraries is the responsibility of the Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster and deals with policy and financial support for the arts and
for libraries and museums.
The primary work of the Board of Customs and Excise is to collect and ad¬
minister the customs and excise duties, including value added tax, imposed
from time to time in the annual Finance Acts or by other legislation, and to
advise the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected with them.
The Board is also responsible for preventing and detecting evasion of the
revenue laws.
The Board undertakes, for other departments, a wide range of non-revenue
agency work, for instance, the enforcement of prohibitions and restrictions on
the import and export of certain classes of goods, exchange currency control,
and the compilation of United Kingdom overseas trade statistics from customs
import and export documents. Parliamentary responsibility for the Board’s work
is exercised by Treasury ministers.
The Ministry of Defence is the government department responsible for defence

Navy, Army and Air Force (including the procurement of defence equipment).
The Secretary of State for Defence is in charge of the department, assisted by a
Minister of State. Three Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State are responsible
for the three armed services.
The Department of Education and Science is responsible under a Secretary of
State, assisted by a Minister of State and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries
of State, for the general promotion of education in England; for the Govern¬
ment’s relations with universities in Great Britain; and for fostering the progress
of civil science both in Britain and internationally.
Among the matters relating to the development of school and post-school
education for which the Department has responsibility are the broad allocation
of resources for education, the capital programmes for the building of new
schools and other institutions, the supply, training and superannuation of
teachers, and the basic standards of education. The Department works in co¬
operation with local education authorities whose duty it is to provide and run
the schools and colleges in their areas. Its relations with the universities are
conducted through the University Grants Committee. Activities concerning
civil science are discharged through five research councils: the Medical Research
Council, the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural Environment
Research Council, the Social Science Research Council and the Science Research
Council. On questions of scientific policy an advisory board for the research
councils advises the Secretary of State.
The Department of Employment has responsibility for manpower policies in
Britain, either directly or through statutory agencies, and for the formulation of
labour legislation. It is also responsible for monitoring labour market trends,
including pay, and for producing statistics on them and on retail prices (from
which the rate of inflation is calculated). The Department is responsible for
the payment of unemployment benefit through its local offices; for the issue
of work permits to workers from overseas; and for the Race Relations
Employment Advisory Service. The Secretary of State for Employment is
assisted by a Minister of State and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of
State.
The Department of Energy is concerned with the development of government
policies for the supply and use of all forms of energy. It discharges functions
connected with the nationalised coal and gas industries in Great Britain and the
electricity industry in England and Wales; is responsible for the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority; and is the sponsoring department for the nuclear
power and oil industries including the British National Oil Corporation. It is
also responsible for the policy for the development of offshore oil and gas
resources in the British sector of the continental shelf; and it sponsors, through
the Offshore Supplies Office in Glasgow, the suppliers of equipment to the
offshore operators. The Department also represents Britain in international
discussions on energy policy, including relations and co-operation with oil-
producing countries. It is the co-ordinating and sponsoring body for energy
conservation policy, in addition to implementing measures not falling
directly to any other department. The Department also encourages the deve¬
lopment of new sources of energy, being assisted by the Energy Technology
Support Unit at Harwell, Oxfordshire. The Secretary of State for Energy is
assisted by a Minister of State and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of
State.

The Department of the Environment is responsible in England for a wide range
of functions relating to the physical environment in which people live and work.
The Department is concerned primarily with the strategic issues of policy
and priorities, including public expenditure, which determine the operations
of the Department as a whole. It is also responsible for urban affairs and inner
city renewal; new towns; local government; regional affairs; the finance and
policy of the housing programme; the construction industries; planning, develop¬
ment control and land; special responsibilities for sport and recreation; the
control of pollution; water and sewerage; minerals; countryside affairs; and the
Property Services Agency (which provides nearly all government common
services relating to land, property, building and furnishings).
The Department is also concerned with the conservation of historic towns
and buildings and ancient monuments, and research into planning matters
building and construction, environmental pollution and resources.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is assisted by two Ministers of State
(the Minister for Housing and Construction and the Minister for Local Govern¬
ment and Environmental Affairs) and four Parliamentary Under Secretaries
of State, one of whom has special responsibility for sport and recreation.
The Export Credits Guarantee Department, which is a separate government
department within the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Trade, offers
two main facilities to British exporters; insurance against the risk of not being
paid for goods and services; and access to special fixed interest rates for export
finance. The Department also provides support for ‘buyer credits’ (loans made
direct to overseas buyers for capital goods contracts enabling the supplier to
be paid on cash terms); insurance against the political risks of new overseas
investment for up to 15 years; partial protection for large capital goods contracts
against an unexpectedly high rise in costs; and support for the issue of per¬
formance bonds.
Under the direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs the Foreign and Commonwealth Office provides, mainly through diplo¬
matic missions, the means of communication between the British Government
and other governments and international governmental organisations for the
discussion and negotiation of all matters, including economic issues, falling
within the field of international relations. In particular the Department is
responsible for alerting the British Government to the implications of develop¬
ments overseas; for protecting British interests overseas, including commercial
interests; for protecting British citizens abroad; and for explaining British
policies to, and wherever possible cultivating friendly relations with, govern¬
ments and peoples overseas. The Department is also responsible for the dis¬
charge of British responsibilities in the associated States (mainly for defence
and external affairs) and dependent territories. In the dependent territories,
each of which has its own internal administration, the British Government is
finally responsible for good government and for the relations between these
territories and other countries.
The Secretary of State is assisted by the Lord Privy Seal and four Ministers
of State (one of whom has responsibility for overseas development—see below)
and a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.
Overseas development functions are the responsibility of the Minister for Over¬
seas Development, a Minister of State within the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office. The Overseas Development Administration is responsible for Britain’s

policy of financial aid and technical co-operation in developing countries. It is
concerned with the aid programme as a whole and its detailed composition. The
provision of financial aid includes both grants and loans (the latter mostly
interest-free) and support for multilateral aid agencies, such as the IBRD
(World Bank); technical co-operation comprises the supply of British experts
and equipment, the training of overseas personnel, and the support of research
and advisory services.
The Department of Health and Social Security headed by the Secretary of
State for Social Services is responsible in England for the administration of the
National Health Service; the social services provided by local authorities for
the elderly and handicapped, socially deprived families, and children in care;
and for certain aspects of public health, including hygiene. Throughout Great
Britain it is responsible for the collection of social security contributions and the
payment of benefits. The Department is concerned in making reciprocal health
and social security arrangements with other countries and in the administration
of European Community social security regulations for immigrant workers. It
also represents the United Kingdom in the World Health Organisation.
Through its Supplementary Benefits Commission the Department is respon¬
sible for determining awards of non-contributory benefits and Family Income
Supplement, for reception centres, and for assessing the means of people
applying for legal aid. The Department also has responsibilities in connection
with pensions and welfare services (including in some cases the provision of
medical and surgical treatment) for war pensioners in the United Kingdom,
the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and, through its various agencies, for
United Kingdom war pensioners living in other countries.
The Secretary of State for Social Services is assisted by two Ministers of
State (the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Security, who also
has special responsibility for the disabled) and two Parliamentary Under
Secretaries of State.
The Home Office deals with those internal affairs in England and Wales not
assigned to other government departments. The Secretary of State is the
means of communication between the Crown and the public, and between the
United Kingdom Government and the Governments of the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man. The minister exercises certain prerogative powers of the Crown,
of which the most important are the prerogative of mercy and the maintenance of
the Queen’s Peace. The Home Office is also concerned with: the administration
of justice; criminal law; the treatment of offenders; probation; the prison service;
public morals and certain public safety matters; the police, fire and emergency

The Department of Industry, under a Secretary of State, is responsible for
general industrial policy and for industrial aspects of regional policy including
financial assistance to industry under the Industry Act. Some regional industrial
policy functions in Scotland and Wales are exercised by the Scottish and Welsh
Offices. The Department sponsors individual manufacturing industries, and is
responsible for four nationalised industries: the British Steel Corporation, the
Post Office, British Aerospace and British Shipbuilders. It is also responsible
for industrial research and development, including civil aerospace research and
the supervision of industrial research establishments and for the provision of
technical services to industry. The Design Council and the National Research
Development Corporation come within its sphere.
The Department’s regional offices also serve the Departments of Trade, and
Energy.
The Secretary of State is assisted by two Ministers of State and two Parlia¬
mentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Central Office of Information (COI), a common service department,
produces information and publicity material, and supplies publicity services
required by other government departments (which are responsible for the
policies expressed). In the United Kingdom, it conducts press, television,
radio and poster advertising; produces booklets, leaflets, films, radio and
television material, exhibitions, photographs and other visual material; and
distributes departmental press notices. For the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office it supplies British information posts overseas with press, radio and television
material, publications (including magazines), reference services (including this
official handbook), films, exhibitions, photographs, and display and reading-
room material. The COI provides exhibition services (except for trade and
cultural exhibitions); and organises visits (other than those sponsored by the
British Council and the British Overseas Trade Board) for people officially
invited to Britain. It also provides services for London-based correspondents of
the overseas news media and training facilities for information officers of overseas
governments. There are nine regional information offices in England providing
services for the home departments and assisting the overseas services by supply¬
ing material and by arranging visits for overseas visitors; similar services are
provided on a mutually agreed basis by the information staffs of the Scottish,
Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices.
I he Board of Inland Revenue administers the laws relating to income tax,
corporation tax, capital gains tax, stamp duty, capital transfer tax, petroleum
revenue tax, development land tax and certain other direct taxes, and advises
the Chancellor of the Exchequer on any matters connected with them. It is also
responsible for the valuation of land and buildings for such purposes as com¬
pensation for compulsory purchase and, in England and Wales, local rates (a
form of local taxation).
The Law Officers of the Crown for England and Wales (the Attorney General
and the Solicitor General) appear on behalf of the Crown in important civil
and criminal proceedings and before international tribunals such as the Inter¬
national Court of Justice at The Hague and the European Commission and
Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg. The Attorney General is the senior legal
adviser to the Government and has the ultimate responsibility for the enforce¬
ment of the criminal law. The Attorney General has to consent before proceed¬
ings for a number of criminal offences can be commenced and superintends

the Director of Public Prosecutions. Legal proceedings for the enforcement
of public rights and on behalf of the interests of charity are conducted in
the name of the Attorney General, who also directs the work of the Queen’s
Proctor, an officer with duties connected with the operation of the divorce laws.
The Attorney General is also spokesman for the Lord Chancellor in
the House of Commons on matters affecting the administration of justice. The
Solicitor General is subject to the authority of the Attorney General, with the
same rights and duties. The Law Officers, who are leading barristers, are always
members of the House of Commons.
The Chancellorship is a legislative, judicial and executive office held by an
eminent ex-member of the judiciary or of the Bar and carrying Cabinet rank.
In addition to functions as Speaker of the House of Lords and Custodian of
the Great Seal, the Lord Chancellor may sit judicially as a member of the
Appellate Committee of the House of Lords or of the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council.
The Lord Chancellor is also the minister primarily responsible for the admini¬
stration of the courts and of the law. The Home Secretary has important
responsibilities in respect of the criminal law but the Lord Chancellor appoints
magistrates and recommends to the Crown most other appointments to the
judiciary in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Responsibility for the courts
and for their administrative staff is exercised through six regional (or circuit)
offices and their sub-offices.
The Lord Chancellor is responsible for court procedure and for law reform,
including appointing the members of the Law Commission, and for presenting
the Commission’s reports to Parliament.
The Lord Chancellor appoints the chairmen of certain administrative tribunals
in England and Wales, and (with the Secretary of State for Scotland) the
members of the Council on Tribunals; and is responsible for the administration
of the Judge Advocate General’s Department,1 the Department of the Official
Solicitor2 and the Public Record Office (which preserves, and provides access
to, the national archives).
The Ordnance Survey is responsible for the surveying and mapping of Great
Britain (Northern Ireland has its own Ordnance Survey). This includes geodetic
surveys and associated scientific work, topographic surveys and the production
of maps at appropriate scales from these surveys. The Department also under¬
takes a considerable amount of agency work for other departments, particularly
the Ministry of Defence, and for the Institute of Geological Sciences and the
Land Registry. Parliamentary responsibility for the Ordnance Survey is exercised
by ministers of the Department of the Environment.
The Paymaster General’s Office acts generally as a banker for government
departments other than the Boards of Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise,
for which separate arrangements exist. Money granted by Parliament is
transferred (in such sums as may be required from day to day) from the

and the Defence Council on legal matters arising out of the administration of military
law, and reviews the proceedings of army and air force courts martial.
2 The Official Solicitor is concerned with the interests of minors and people with a mental
disability involved in proceedings in the High Court, who would otherwise not be rep¬
resented. Additional roles are the protection of the interests of people committed to
prison for contempt of court, and acting as Receiver for people with a mental disability,
and as Judicial Trustee in complex and disputed trusts.

Exchequer account to the account of the Paymaster General at the Bank of
England. Most departmental payments are made by means of payable orders
drawn on the Paymaster General’s Office; their recipients obtain payments
through the commercial banks, whose accounts at the Bank of England are in
turn reimbursed by the Paymaster General’s Office. The Department is also
responsible for the regular payment of many public service pensions.
The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) is the office of the
Registrar General for England and Wales. The Office is responsible for admini¬
stering the Marriage Acts and local registration of births, marriages and deaths;
estimating and projecting national, regional and local populations and the move¬
ment of people within Britain and between Britain and overseas; statistics of
diseases, injuries and deaths, and of other aspects of health service information;
taking the Census of Population and processing, analysing and reporting the
resulting statistics; and conducting surveys on a wide range of subjects for other
government departments.
The Treasury Solicitor provides a common legal service for a large number of
government departments in England and Wales. The duties of the Department
include instructing Parliamentary Counsel on Bills and drafting subordinate
legislation, representing other departments in court, and giving general advice
on the interpretation and application of the law. The Department undertakes a
considerable amount of conveyancing connected with the transfer of property,
administers the estates of persons dying without known relatives and intestate,
and deals with the outstanding property and rights of dissolved companies.
The Statutory Publications Office is staffed and controlled by the Treasury
Solicitor, who reports annually on its work to the Statute Law Committee (a
body appointed by the Lord Chancellor from among the judiciary and legal
profession in Great Britain).
Some government departments are wholly dependent on the Treasury
Solicitor for their legal work; some have their own legal staffs for a proportion
of the work and draw on the Treasury Solicitor for special advice and, often,
for litigation and conveyancing; others, whose administrative work is based on or
deals with a code of specialised law or involves a great deal of legal work, have
their own independent legal sections.
The Treasury Solicitor is also the Queen’s Proctor (an officer who has certain
duties in connection with the divorce laws).
Her Majesty’s Stationery Office (HMSO) is the publisher for Parliament and the
Government. The Controller is the Queen’s Printer of Acts of Parliament and
is responsible for the copyright of all British government documents. Official
publications are sold by government bookshops in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff,
Belfast, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham, and through agents and book¬
sellers overseas. HMSO is the United Kingdom agent for publications of the
European Community and of other principal international organisations.
HMSO provides a wide range of printing, duplicating, photocopying, and
micro-copying facilities for Parliament and the Government in its eight printing
works and other establishments, and through commercial contractors. It
operates five binderies, two of which are involved in the repair of manuscripts
from national archives. HMSO is the central purchasing organisation providing
the home and overseas public service with paper, printing, binding, books, office
supplies and office machinery, and supporting services, such as addressing, and
distribution and maintenance of office machinery.

Affairs) and two Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State.
The Department of Transport, headed by a Minister who is assisted by a
Parliamentary Secretary, is responsible in England for the main transport
industries, including railways, buses, freight and ports. It is also responsible for
the planning and construction of motorways and trunk roads, although decisions

autonomy. The Secretary of State for Scotland, a Cabinet minister, has responsi¬
bility in Scotland (with some exceptions) both for the formulation of policy
and for its execution in such matters as agriculture and fisheries, education, law
and order, local government and environmental services, social work, health,
housing, roads and certain aspects of shipping and road transport services.

in particular in relation to responsibility for the electricity supply industry in
Scotland.
The Secretary of State is responsible for legal services in Scotland, and other
important functions are exercised by the two Scottish Law Officers: the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland. On many domestic matters, in
order to reflect distinctive Scottish features and the different conditions and
needs of the country and its people, there is separate legislation relating wholly
to Scotland, or else clauses of special application to Scotland only are inserted
in Acts which otherwise apply to the United Kingdom generally. The Secretary
of State is also responsible for a range of other functions from fire services to
sport and tourism.
A Minister of State and three Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State assist
the Secretary of State.
The United Kingdom Government’s administrative functions arising from
these responsibilities are carried out principally by five Scottish departments
based in Edinburgh and known as the Scottish Office. A management group
including five heads of departments under the chairmanship of the Permanent
Under Secretary of State advises the Secretary of State, particularly on questions,
such as the allocation of resources and forward planning, with which more than
one of the departments are concerned.
United Kingdom government departments with significant Scottish responsi¬

schemes for the improvement of land, farm stock and crops, the development
of crofting and the management of a large area of agricultural land which is in
public ownership. Its duties for fisheries include participation in international
arrangements for conservation and other aspects of fishing and in the
European Community negotiations on fisheries policy, financial support for
the fishing industry, assistance for fishery harbours, scientific research and the

and the administration of penal institutions. It also has responsibility for the
administration of the National Health Service in Scotland, legislation relating
to public service superannuation schemes in Scotland and the administration
of the teachers’ and National Health Service superannuation schemes. The
Home and Health Department is the central authority in Scotland for the
fire service, for certain home defence and emergency services, and for legislation
concerning shops, theatres, cinemas, licensed premises and land tenure matters.
In addition to the main departments, there are a number of other Scottish
departments, all of which work in varying degrees under the direction of the
Secretary of State. Such departments include the Department of the Registrar-
General for Scotland (the General Register Office); the Scottish Record Office;
and the Department of the Registers of Scotland. There are also Scottish
branches of the Great Britain and United Kingdom departments under the
direction of controllers, who are responsible for ensuring that the execution in
Scotland of the policy and procedure of their departments is in accordance with
Scottish conditions and needs.
The Law Officers of the Crown for Scotland (the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor
General for Scotland) are the chief legal advisers to the Government on Scottish
questions and the principal representatives of the Crown for the purposes of
litigation in Scotland. The Lord Advocate is also closely concerned with
questions of legal policy and administration and is responsible for the
institution and direction of all prosecutions on indictment in Scotland, and the
control of summary prosecutions in the Sheriff and District Courts, which are
conducted by officials of the Procurator Fiscal Service. In some of this work the
Lord Advocate is assisted by the Lord Advocate’s Department and the Scottish
Courts Administration. The members of the Lord Advocate’s Department also
act as legal advisers on Scottish questions to certain government departments

which have no Scottish legal adviser of their own. The work relevant to pro¬

The Parliamentary Draftsmen for Scotland, incorporated in the Lord
Advocate’s Department, are responsible to the minister concerned and to the
Law Officers for the drafting of government Bills affecting the law of Scotland.
The Scottish Courts Administration has a general responsibility to the Secretary
of State for the organisation, administration and staffing of the courts and court
offices, and is responsible to the Lord Advocate for certain functions in the field
of law, including the programme of the Scottish Law Commission, proposals
for law reform and questions involving private international law, internal
conventions and associated problems, the jurisdiction and procedure of the
Scottish courts, and enforcement of judgments.
The Government of Ireland Act 1920 enacted a constitution which, while
preserving the supreme authority of the United Kingdom Parliament and
reserving certain matters to that Parliament, provided Northern Ireland with its
own legislature and executive to deal with domestic ‘transferred’ matters. This
structure remained in force until 1972 when, following several years of sectarian
violence and terrorism in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Government
resigned and a period of direct rule was introduced, with executive powers under
the control of a Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. In 1973 R new constitu¬
tion for the Province provided, among other things, for the devolution of powers
to a legislative assembly and a ‘power-sharing’ executive with responsibility for
the devolved services (such as agriculture, commerce, education, health and the
environment). Responsibility for law and order, electoral matters and business
of national importance such as foreign policy, defence and most aspects of
taxation remained with the United Kingdom Government and Parliament.
These arrangements came into force in January 1974, but following widespread
opposition in Northern Ireland the Executive resigned and the Assembly was
prorogued in May 1974. In July 1974 the Northern Ireland Act was passed,
providing for the election of a Constitutional Convention to consider what
arrangements for the government of Northern Ireland would be likely to
command most widespread acceptance throughout the community. The Act
provided for an interim period (defined as one year from the passing of the Act)
during which the United Kingdom Government, through the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland, should continue to be responsible to the United
Kingdom Parliament for the devolved services.
The Northern Ireland Assembly was finally dissolved at the end of March
I975> and elections to the Constitutional Convention and its first meeting took
place in May of that year. In March 197^) the Convention was dissolved, having
failed to reach agreement on the central issue of a system of government which
would attract the widespread acceptance of the community. Direct rule as
provided for in the Northern Ireland Act has since been extended for further
periods of a year and Northern Ireland departments continue to discharge their
functions under the direction and control of the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland. The Government’s aim is to restore peace and security to the Province
and to promote social and economic welfare. It is also seeking an acceptable way
ol restoring to the people of Northern Ireland more control over their own affairs.

answerable to Parliament, for the government of Northern Ireland. Through
the Northern Ireland Office the Secretary of State has responsibility for constitu¬
tional developments, law and order and security, and electoral matters.
The Northern Ireland departments are subject to the direction and control of
the Secretary of State. Their principal functions are listed below.
The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the development of Northern
Ireland’s agricultural, forestry and fishing industries. Its functions also include
the collection of agricultural census data, the compilation of statistics, the pro¬
vision of extensive advisory services to farmers, and the promotion of agricultural
research, education and training. The Department acts as agent of the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in agricultural support and the implementa¬
tion of the European Community’s Common Agricultural Policy.
The Department of the Civil Service is responsible for the general management
and control of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.
The Department of Commerce is concerned with the development of Northern
Ireland’s industry and commerce, and with the administration of schemes of

THE CIVIL SERVICE
A civil servant is a servant of the crown employed in a civil capacity, other than
the holder of a political or judicial office and other than an office-holder under the
Crown whose terms and conditions of service are separately provided for.
Including part-time staff (two part-time officers being reckoned as equivalent
to one full-time), there are about 733,000 civil servants (nearly 40 per cent of
them women), roughly 350,000 of whom are engaged in the provision of public
services, such as paying sickness benefits and pensions, collecting taxes and
contributions, running employment services, staffing prisons, and providing
services to industry and agriculture. About 249,000 are employed in the Ministry
of Defence, including the Royal Ordnance factories and Royal Dockyards. The
rest are about equally divided between: central administrative and policy duties;
service-wide support services, such as accommodation, printing and information;
and largely financially self-supporting services, for instance those provided by
the Department for National Savings and the Royal Mint.
Three-quarters of civil servants work outside London. As part of its policy
of reducing the claims of the public sector on the country’s resources the Govern-
ment has declared its intention to make cuts in Civil Service manpower.
The total number includes about 167,000 ‘industrial’ civil servants, mainly
manual workers in government industrial establishments, whose pay and condi¬
tions of service are largely separately administered from those of ‘non-industrial’
civil servants.
Stability of administration is ensured by the political neutrality of the Service
Although civil servants work under the authority and direction of the ministers
of the department to which they are appointed, legally they are servants of the
Crown. A change of minister, whether due to ministerial changes within a
government or the advent of a government of a different political complexion
does not involve a change of staff.
Ministers sometimes personally appoint special advisers from outside the
Civil Service.
The structure of the Home Civil Service is being redesigned to provide for a
more flexible deployment of staff so that talent can be used to the best advantage
56 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and the highest levels of the Civil Service seen to be open to people of out¬
standing ability, whatever their specialist background or original method of
entry to the service. These structural changes involve the abolition of classes,
and are being allied with personnel management policies designed to ensure
that, although work requiring specialist skill is always done by appropriately
qualified individuals, people with the necessary aptitudes are given opportunities
to gain suitably wide experience to fit them for higher posts.
At the top levels of the Civil Service, where staff are predominantly concerned
with higher management and policy, there is an open and unified structure, with
three grades—permanent secretary, deputy secretary and under secretary—
available for all types of posts. Posts at these levels are filled by the people most
suitable for them without restrictions over academic background or over previous
service in a specialist or administrative stream.
At other levels the structure is being based on a system of occupational
groups, which are the basic groupings of staff for the purposes of pay, recruit¬
ment and personnel management, and categories which consist of one or more
occupational groups having a common pay and grading pattern.
Categories consist of the General Category (which covers the Administration,
Economist, Statistician, Information Officer and Librarian groups), the Science
Category, the Professional and Technology Category (including architects,
surveyors, electrical and mechanical engineers, graphics officers and marine
services staff), and the Training, Legal, Police, Secretarial, Data Processing,
Research Officer and Social Security Categories. Together these ten categories
account for over 70 per cent of the non-industrial staff.
The The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of the Crown, provides the staff for
Diplomatic service in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and at United Kingdom
Service diplomatic missions and consular posts in foreign and in independent Common¬
wealth countries. Its functions include advising on policy, negotiating with
overseas governments and conducting business in international organisations;
promoting British exports and the advancement of British trade; administering
British aid, presenting British ideas, policies and objectives to the people of
overseas countries; and protecting British interests abroad.
The Service has its own grade structure, linked for salary purposes with that
of the Home Civil Service, and conditions of work are in many ways comparable
while taking into account the special demands of the Service, particularly of
postings overseas. The Service also has secretarial, communications and security
officer branches. Members of the Home Civil Service and the armed forces, and
individuals from the private sector, may serve in the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office and at overseas posts on loan or attachment. It is intended to build
a closer working relationship between the Diplomatic Service and the Home
Civil Service.
The Northern Northern Ireland has its own Civil Service which, subject to regional differences,
Ireland Civil is modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain, recruitment being effected
Service through its own Civil Service Commission. Interchange of staff between the
two Civil Services occurs to a minor extent only, and is a matter for departmental
agreement in individual cases.
Public Services Britain’s dependent territories fill vacancies in their public services by the
of Overseas appointment of suitably qualified local candidates wherever possible; but when
Dependent vacancies cannot be filled by this means generally the Foreign and Common-
Territories wealth Office, the Overseas Development Administration and the Crown Agents

for Oversea Governments and Administrations are asked to recruit other
candidates, principally from the United Kingdom. Hong Kong has its own
Government office in London with responsibility for recruiting to the Hong
Kong public service.
Recruitment to the Home Civil Service and the Diplomatic Service is the
responsibility of the Civil Service Commission which, working in conjunction
with departments, ensures that staff are selected on the basis of fair and open
competition. The selection of junior staff such as those engaged in clerical and
manual work, is undertaken almost entirely by departments. The Commission,
however, always issues the ‘certificate of qualification’ necessary for permanent
appointment. The appointment of a successful candidate is made by the depart¬
ment concerned. ^
For the Administration Group, which forms the central part of the Home
Civil Service, entry is at three levels relating broadly to the academic achieve¬
ments of: university honours graduates; 18-year-old school-leavers; and 16-
year-old school-leavers. The selection procedure for the highest of these levels
(the Administration Trainee entry) comprises qualifying tests, followed by a
series of tests and interviews at the Civil Service Selection Board and an inter¬
view by the Final Selection Board. The next level (the Executive Officer entry)
selection from among those possessing the necessary academic qualifications is
in two stages, a set of qualifying tests followed by an interview. For the clerical
entrants selection is normally by interview of those holding the prescribed
educational qualifications.
Entry to the professional and technical grades usually requires appropriate
qualifications, and selection is on the basis of past record and by interview.
In all except the smallest government departments, there are full-time training
officers and instructors whose task is to help identify the training needs of the
staff and to organise courses, both general and technical, to provide for their
varying requirements. A substantial number of management courses is run
within the Civil Service both by departments and by the Civil Service College.
Use is also made of external management courses in business schools, the
Administrative Staff College at Henley, and other centres.
In order that they may continue their education, arrangements are made for
the release of civil servants under the age of 18 to attend appropriate courses
usually on one day a week (‘day release’ schemes). Adult staff are assisted
financially to undertake, mainly in their own time, private studies leading to
recognised educational or professional qualifications in approved subjects.
There are also opportunities for civil servants in mid-career to obtain fellow¬
ships or otherwise to go on sabbatical leave to undertake research in areas of
interest to themselves or their departments.
A period of probation (varying according to grade, with extensions in certain
instances) is the rule for all new entrants to the Civil Service.
Promotions are made partly through centrally conducted examinations and
partly by the departments themselves. Promotions or appointments to deputy
secretary-level posts and above and all transfers between departments at these
levels are approved by the Prime Minister, who is advised by the official head
of the Home Civil Service.
Normally promotion is from grade to grade, but arrangements exist for
accelerated promotion for staff who have shown exceptional promise.
Civil servants are encouraged to join the trade union which represents the
grade or specialism to which they belong. The National Whitley Council
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
structure consisting of senior officials and representatives of the unions, exists to
discuss all matters affecting conditions of service of staff and to provide a forum
for consultation. Whitley committees exist in all government departments.
Negotiations about pay are conducted directly with the individual unions or
with the National Staff Side representing all the unions.
Civil servants are required to serve loyally the Government of the day, regardless
of its political composition. In order therefore to maintain the reputation of the
Civil Service for political impartiality, some restrictions are placed on civil
servants’ freedom to participate in political activities. Statutory restrictions
prevent any civil servant from being a Member of Parliament, and (with certain
exceptions corresponding to the ‘politically free’ group shown below) from being
adopted as parliamentary candidate.
Civil Service rules place staff in one of three groups for the purpose of political
activities: (1) the ‘politically free’ group, consisting of industrial and non-office
grades, who are free to engage in any political activity including standing for
Parliament (although they would have to resign from the Service if elected);
(2) the ‘politically restricted’ group, consisting of all staff above Executive Officer
level, together with those Executive Officers and certain related grades such as
Information Officers, who are debarred from national political activities but
may apply for permission to take part in local political activities; and (3) the
‘intermediate’ group, comprising all other staff—mainly members of the
clerical and typing grades—who may apply for permission to take part in
national or local political activity apart from adoption as a parliamentary
candidate.
Where permission is required, it is granted to the maximum extent consistent
with the reputation of the Civil Service for political impartiality and the
avoidance of any conflict with official duties. Permission is granted subject to a
code of discretion requiring moderation and the avoidance of embarrassment to
ministers. An independent committee of enquiry, set up by the Government to
review the Civil Service rules governing political activities, has reported in
favour of retaining the general framework of these rules in order to maintain the
principle of Civil Service political impartiality, and recommended some changes
which would transfer a substantial number of staff from the ‘restricted’ to the
‘intermediate’ group, establish standard criteria against which applications for
permission could be judged, and provide an appeal body for staff who are refused
permission. These recommendations are the subject of consultations.
All civil servants have the right to register their private political opinions by
voting, for instance, at general or local authority elections. They may also engage
in such private activities as they wish, provided that these do not in any way
conflict with their official duties, nor with the provisions of the Official Secrets
Acts 1911 and 1920, and the Prevention of Corruption Act 1926. However,
since civil servants must not use their official position to further their private
interests, they are subject to certain restrictions in commerce and business: for
instance they may not hold private interests in public contracts and they may
not use official information in writing, broadcasting or lecturing without the
approval of their department.
As a general rule the political views of civil servants are not a matter of official
concern. However no one whose loyalty is in doubt may be employed on work
the nature of which is vital to the security of the State. For this reason certain
posts are not open to anyone who is known to be a member of a Communist or
Fascist organisation, or associated with such an organisation in a way as to raise

legitimate doubts about his or her reliability, or to anyone whose reliability may
be in doubt for any other reason.
Each government department is responsible for maintaining its own internal
security, advised as necessary by the Security Service. In addition, the Security
Commission, if requested to do so by the Prime Minister after consultation with
the Leader of the Opposition, may investigate any report on breaches of security
in the public service and advise whether any change in security procedure is
necessary or desirable.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
A wide range of public services is provided by local authorities throughout the
United Kingdom, democratically elected in the areas for which they are
responsible. J
The specific powers and duties of local authorities are conferred on them by
Act of Parliament, or by measures made under the authority of an Act. The
actual administration, and the exercise of discretion within statutory limits, are
the responsibility of the local authority. In the case of certain services, however,
government ministers have powers, defined in the relevant Acts, to secure a
measure of national uniformity in the standard of a service provided, to safeguard
public health, or to protect the rights of individual citizens. For some services the
minister concerned has wide powers of supervision; for others there are strictly
limited powers. J
Government policy is to ensure that central government controls over local
authorities are kept to the minimum necessary; existing controls, the authorities’
statutory duties and government control over their capital expenditure are under
review.
In addition to their statutory powers, ministers concerned with local govern-
ment give assistance to local authorities by the general issue of advisory circulars
and by giving advice in individual cases.
The main links between local authorities and the central Government are:
in England, the Department of the Environment; in Scotland, the Scottish
Development Department; in Wales, the Welsh Office; and in Northern Ireland,
the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
I he main pattern of local government organisation in England and Wales
(outside Greater London) is a division of the country into 53 large county
authorities, within which there are 369 smaller district authorities. Both types
of authority have independent, locally elected councils, and have separate
functions to perform. County authorities normally provide the large-scale
local government services, while the districts are responsible for the more
ocal ones (see pp 61-2). However, in six of the English counties, which are in
heavily populated areas and known as ‘metropolitan’ counties, responsibility
for some large-scale services rests with the district authorities. In England
populations in the non-metropolitan counties range from 286,000 to about
i.'S million (the Isle of Wight with a population of about 114,000 is an excep¬
tion), and in the metropolitan counties from 1-2 to 27 million. District authorities
within metropolitan counties have populations of between 166,000 and i-i
million; other districts’ populations average between 75,000 and 100,000
a though many fall outside this range. The local government system in Wales
closely resembles that in non-metropolitan areas of England. Populations in the
counties range from 104,000 to 543,000 and the districts have populations of
between 19,600 and 279,000. English parish councils or meetings in villages and

small towns serve as focuses for local opinion as bodies with limited powers of
local interest. In Wales community councils have similar functions.
Greater London—an administrative area of about 1,580 sq km (610 sq miles)
and a population of some 7 million—is administered by the Greater London
Council, the councils of 32 London boroughs (with populations ranging from
136,000 to 330,000) and the Corporation of the City of London (the historic
centre which has a resident population of nearly 8,000).
On the mainland of Scotland local government is on a two-tier basis: nine
regions are divided into 53 districts, each area having its own elected council.
There are three virtually all-purpose authorities for Orkney, Shetland and the
Western Isles. Provision is made for local community councils to be formed.
These councils have no statutory functions and are not local authorities.
The pattern of local authorities, and of their electoral arrangements, is kept
up to date by Boundary Commissions for England, Wales and Scotland.
In Northern Ireland there are 26 district councils which are responsible for
local environmental and certain other services. Statutory bodies and local offices,
responsible to central departments, administer major services such as roads,
water, education, health, and housing. Populations of the districts range from
13,000 to over 354,000.
Local authority councils consist of a number of elected unpaid councillors
presided over by a chairman. They can claim a flat-rate attendance allowance on
the performance of council business; they are also entitled to travelling and sub¬
sistence allowances. Parish and community councillors cannot claim for duties
within their own areas.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland each council annually elects a
chairman and vice-chairman. Some districts have the ceremonial title of borough,
or city, both granted by royal authority (except in Northern Ireland where they
are granted by the Secretary of State). In boroughs and cities the chairman is
normally known as the Mayor (in the City of London and certain other large
cities, he or she is known as the Lord Mayor). In Scottish regions and islands areas
the chairman is called the convener and the chairman of the district councils of
each of the four cities is called the Lord Provost. No general title is laid down
for the chairmen of the other district councils, but some are known as conveners,
while others continue to use the old burghal title of ‘provost’.
The term of office of a councillor elected to any form of local government is
usually four years. In England and Wales county council elections took place
in 1977 and will be held every fourth year thereafter. Metropolitan district
elections are held for a third of the seats in each year when there is no county
council election. Non-metropolitan district councils may adopt the same
procedure or opt for whole council elections; the latter took place in 1979 an(^
will be held again every following fourth year. In London elections to the
Greater London Council were held in 1977 and elections to the London borough
councils in 1978; elections will be held every fourth year. In Scotland elections
for the regions and islands areas took place in i97^> anc^ ^)e held again in
1982. Elections for the districts were held in 1977, and will be held again in 1980.
Elections for the district councils in Northern Ireland took place in 1977 an^
will be held every fourth year thereafter.
Any person (including a member of the House of Lords) is entitled to vote
at a local government election in Great Britain provided that he or she is 18
years of age or over, is a British subject or a citizen of the Irish Republic, is not
subject to any legal incapacity and is registered as a local government elector for
the area for which the election is held. A person qualifies for registration as a
GOVERNMENT
Functions and
Services
61
local government elector if, on the qualifying date for the register (compiled
annually), he or she is resident in the council area. In Northern Ireland there
are slightly different residence requirements.
A candidate for election as councillor—man or woman—normally stands as a
representative of one of the national political parties, as a member of an associa¬
tion representing some local interest, or as an independent. Candidates must be
British subjects or citizens of the Irish Republic and aged 21 or over. In addition
they must be registered as a local government elector in the area of the local
authority to which they seek election; or have resided or occupied (as owner or
tenant) land or other premises in that area during the whole of the 12 months
preceding the day on which they are nominated as candidates or, in that 12
months, have had their principal or only place of work there. Candidates are also
subject to a number of statutory disqualifications designed to ensure that
unsuitable people do not offer themselves for election.
Local authority areas are generally divided into electoral areas for local
council elections. Administrative counties in England and Wales are divided
into electoral divisions returning one or more councillors. Districts in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland are divided into electoral ‘wards’. In Scotland
in the regions and islands areas the electoral areas are called electoral divisions,
each returning a single member; the districts are divided into wards, similarly
returning a single member. For parish or community council elections in
England and Wales, each parish or ward of a parish (or, in some cases, a com¬
bination of parishes) forms an electoral area which returns one or more members.
For elections to the Greater London Council, Greater London is divided into
electoral divisions, each returning one councillor.
Voting takes place at polling stations arranged by the returning officer con¬
cerned, and under the supervision of a presiding officer appointed for the
purpose. I he procedure for local government voting in Great Britain is similar
to that for parliamentary elections, although facilities for postal voting are
more restricted. In Great Britain each elector has one vote for each seat contested
in the electoral area: he or she need not record every vote, but must not give
more than one vote for each candidate. In Northern Ireland local government
elections are held on the basis of proportional representation and for this purpose
electoral wards are grouped into district electoral areas. Facilities for postal
voting are available.
d he functions of local authorities are far reaching. Some are framed primarily
as duties on an authority, others are purely permissive.
Broadly speaking, functions in England and Wales are divided between
county and district councils on the basis that county councils are responsible
for matters requiring planning and administration over wide areas or requiring
the support of substantial resources. Within the metropolitan areas district
councils are responsible for functions needing substantial resources because
they have populations large enough to give such support. District councils as a
whole administer functions of more local significance. In London the division
of functions is slightly different.
In England county councils are generally responsible for such matters as
strategic planning, transportation planning, highways, traffic regulation, con¬
sumer protection, refuse disposal, police and the fire service. Education, libraries
and the personal social services are mostly functions of county councils in non¬
metropolitan areas and of district councils in metropolitan areas. All district
councils are responsible, for instance, for environmental health, housing,
decisions on most planning applications and refuse collection. They may also

provide off-street car parks subject to the consent of the county council.
Powers to operate some functions—such as the provision of museums, art
galleries and parks—are available at both levels; arrangements depend on local
agreement.
In Greater London the London boroughs and the Corporation of the City of
London are responsible for the same range of functions as district councils in
metropolitan areas (with the addition of consumer protection). The Greater
London Council (GLC) deals only with those services which by their nature
require unified administration and control over the whole area. In the inner
London area education is administered by the Inner London Education
Authority, an autonomous committee of the GLC. Responsibility for highways
in London is divided according to the type of road: the main strategic road net¬
work is a matter for the GLC, while the London boroughs look after the other
roads. The boroughs have prime responsibility for the provision of housing.
The GLC, which has maintained a substantial stock of housing, proposes to
relinquish its role as a primary housing authority (by transferring its housing
stock to the boroughs and surrounding districts and by offering tenants the
chance to buy their own homes) and to concentrate on its role as a strategic
authority, focusing attention on areas of particular housing need. The police
force in the London area (see p 101) is directly responsible to the Home
Secretary.
In Wales the division of functions between county and district councils is
much the same as that between county and district councils in non-metropolitan
areas of England. The main differences are that Welsh district councils are re¬
sponsible for refuse disposal; they may, subject to the consent of the county
council, provide on-street as well as off-street car parking facilities; and they
may, exceptionally, exercise library and consumer protection functions.
Local authorities in England and Wales may arrange for most of their functions
to be carried out on their behalf by another local authority. The exceptions to
this general rule are functions relating to education, police, the personal social
services and national parks.
In Scotland the regional and district authorities discharge local government
functions in a way broadly similar to that of authorities in England and Wales,
including some at both levels. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, because
of their isolation, have single, virtually all-purpose authorities.
In Northern Ireland, local environmental and certain other services are
administered by the district councils, but responsibility for planning, roads,
water supply and sewerage services is exercised in each district by a local
office of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland working
closely with the district council and its staff. Area boards, responsible to central
departments, administer locally education, public libraries and the health and
personal social services. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, responsible
to the Department of the Environment, administers housing.
Local authorities are free to a very considerable extent to make their own in¬
ternal arrangements and to choose the means and methods by which they dis¬
charge their responsibilities. Most councils use the committee system, whereby
questions of policy and principle are decided in full council, and committees are
appointed to administer the various services. Parish and community councils in
England and Wales are often able to do their work efficiently in full session
although they appoint committees from time to time as necessary. Some councils
have established policy advisory or co-ordinating committees with powers to
originate policy, subject to the approval of the full council. The powers and
GOVERNMENT

Employees

Finance
duties of local authority committees (which may be advisory or executive) are
usually laid down in the appointing council’s standing orders.
A council is free to delegate all its powers to committees, except its powers in
connection with raising loans, levying rates (see p 64), or making financial
demands on other authorities liable to contribute, which are legally reserved to
the council as a whole.
Local authorities can make arrangements among themselves for the discharge
of their functions. These include co-operation through joint committees, joint
teams and the loan of staff. One authority may discharge functions for another,
and may also supply others with a range of goods and services.
The public and the press are admitted to all meetings of a council (and of
committees) but may be excluded while a particular item is considered if the
council (or committee) resolves that publicity for that matter would be pre¬
judicial to the public interest.
The execution of council policy rests with salaried officers and employees, of
whom there may be tens of thousands in the larger authorities. Some 2-8 million
people are employed by local authorities in Great Britain. These include ad¬
ministrative, professional and technical staff, manual workers and teachers.
Although a few appointments, such as chief education and fire officers and the
director of social services, must by law be made by all the authorities responsible
for the functions concerned, councils are individually responsible within national
policy requirements for determining the size and composition of their work forces
and the way they should be used. An authority must not, however, employ one
of its own councillors. In Northern Ireland, each council must by law appoint a
clerk of the council as its chief officer.
As a general rule, employees are of three kinds: heads of departments or chief
officers, whose duties are mainly of an administrative and managerial kind-
subordinate officers employed in an administrative, a professional, clerical or
technical capacity; and manual workers who are employed to do the physical
work for which the council is responsible. Senior staff appointments are usually
made on the recommendation of the committee or committees particularly
concerned; most junior appointments are made by heads of departments, who
are also responsible for engaging manual workers. Appointments and engage¬
ments always conform to the council’s set establishment, and committees are
informed of any appointments which they have not made themselves.
Rates of pay and conditions of service for local authority staff are within
the jurisdiction of the employing council, although there are recommended
scales.
Local authority expenditure in the United Kingdom (on both current and
capital accounts) was nearly £21,000 million in 1978. A clear distinction is made
between capital and current expenditure. Capital expenditure (just under a
quarter of the total) is financed partly from the current account surplus (about
half), from borrowing (two-fifths) and the remainder from grants and other
incomes. Housing, the major element, accounted for over half in 1978. Current
expenditure by local authorities accounts for just over a quarter of total current
account spending by central and local government. The education service
represents over a third of this expenditure, followed by the police, personal
social services, roads (including lighting), public health and debt interest.
Current expenditure is financed mainly from central government grants (about
three-fifths) and from local rates paid by occupiers of land and building (about
one-third). Each local authority is responsible for its own finance, although in

a few cases several authorities combine to organise a specialist service which it
would be uneconomic for each authority to provide on its own. In order to
achieve substantial reductions in public expenditure the Government has asked
local authorities to reduce their spending in line with reductions being made in
its own expenditure.
Government ‘rate support grants’ to local authorities are paid in aid of revenues
generally. Grants are also paid towards the cost of specific services—either
towards current expenditure, such as on the police, or towards capital expen¬
diture, such as on the acquisition and clearance of derelict land. (In Wales,
approved schemes for the acquisition and clearance of derelict land are financed
by the Welsh Development Agency.) Annual subsidies are paid for local authority
housing.
Rate support grants are distributed among authorities in three parts: the
‘needs’ element which is designed to give most help to authorities whose spend¬
ing needs are greatest; the ‘resources’ element, which is used to supplement the
rate income of authorities whose rateable value per head of population falls
below a standard figure, prescribed for each year; and the ‘domestic’ element,
which compensates authorities for loss of rate income from reductions in rate
poundage which they are required to give to householders. The formula for
distributing the ‘needs’ element is subject to annual variations. Grants are also
made towards the cost of rate rebates for people with low incomes.
In Northern Ireland the district councils receive specific grants plus a general
grant used to supplement the resources of those councils whose rateable value
resources are below the standard level.
Rates are local taxes paid by the occupiers of land and property (with certain
exceptions, see below) to meet part of the cost of local services. Each occupier’s
payment is calculated annually by the rating authority by multiplying the rate¬
able value of his property (broadly equivalent to its annual rental value) by the
rate poundage—an amount per £ of rateable value fixed by the authority
according to its projected financial needs. In England and Wales rateable values
are assessed periodically by the Board of Inland Revenue (see p 47). The last
general revaluation of all property was in 1973. Disputes about rating assessments
are heard by local valuation courts, and on appeal by the Lands Tribunal. Public
undertakings have their rates separately determined. Crown property is not
rateable but payments are made, based on values assessed by the Treasury
Valuer, in lieu of rates.
In Scotland valuation is carried out by assessors appointed by the regional
and islands councils. The last general revaluation was in 1978. Appeals are
heard by the valuation appeal committees of each valuation area and thereafter
by the Lands Valuation Appeal Court of the Court of Session.
In Northern Ireland valuations are carried out by the Valuation Officer of
the Department of Finance. There is a right of appeal. The present valuations
came into force in 1976.
Responsibility for levying and collecting rates in England and Wales lies
with the district councils and London borough councils. Each county council
(and the Greater London Council) determines what rate will be required to
meet its estimated expenditure, and district councils (and London borough
councils) include this element in the rate they levy. Householders benefit from
domestic rate relief and those with lower incomes may also qualify for rate
rebates; both reliefs are financed by government grants. Rates may be paid by
instalments, normally in ten one-monthly payments. Rating relief is available

in certain circumstances on premises adapted for the use of the disabled.
Agricultural land and buildings (apart from living accommodation) and places
of religious worship are exempted from rate payments. Charities pay half the
full rate on premises they occupy for charitable purposes and may be given
further relief by rating authorities, who can also reduce or remit the rates for
a wide range of non-profit-making bodies. Rates may be levied on empty
properties at any percentage up to the full amount and in the case of empty
commercial property a rating surcharge may be payable.
In Scotland every authority determines a rate for its own services, but the
collection of rates and the administration of rating is the responsibility of
regional and island councils. Industrial (including freight transport) premises
in Scotland are rated at a half of net annual value and the right to pay rates in
instalments extends to all ratepayers. There is empty property rating in Scotland
but no empty property surcharge.
In Northern Ireland there are two rates: one set by the district councils
and one set by the Department of Finance. Both are collected by the Department
and the appropriate part paid over to the respective councils. Industrial (includ¬
ing freight transport) premises are rated at a quarter of net annual value and the
degree of charitable exemption is decided by the Valuation Office. Empty
properties are not rated.
Loans may be raised by local authorities to finance capital expenditure under
general powers conferred by national legislation. For items of expenditure in
key sectors (such as education, housing and roads) local authorities in England
and Wales must seek approval from the government department concerned
before raising loans. For other capital expenditure, each authority receives an
annual loan authorisation within which it determines what sums to borrow and
what projects to undertake. The GLC applies annually for parliamentary sanction
to raise the money it needs for capital expenditure while the City of London
has ancient charter powers to cover its borrowings. In Northern Ireland long¬
term borrowing by district councils is subject to approval by the Department of
the Environment for Northern Ireland. In Scotland departmental approval is
given to capital expenditure, not to loans.
Local authorities may raise long-term loans by means of private mortgages,
issuing stock upon the Stock Exchange and bonds which may or may not be
quoted on the Stock Exchange. Local authorities also have right of access to the
Public Works Loan Board, financed by the Exchequer, or, in Northern Ireland,
to the Government Loans Fund, for long-term borrowing to finance a proportion
of their reckonable capital payments, and may borrow temporarily for a limited
proportion of their current outstanding loan debt.
Internal control of finance is normally exercised on behalf of the council con¬
cerned by a finance committee, whose function it is to keep the financial policy
of the council under constant review. (There is no statutory requirement for
local authorities to appoint a finance committee, but they have to make proper
arrangements for the administration of their financial affairs.) Local authorities
must have their accounts audited. Those in England and Wales can choose
between the district auditor (appointed by the Secretary of State for the Environ¬
ment) and an approved private auditor (or partly both). In Scotland the auditing
of accounts is the responsibility of the independent Commission for Local
Authority Accounts in Scotland appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland,
and in Northern Ireland it is carried out by independent local government
auditors appointed by the Department of the Environment.

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A complaints system for local government in England and Wales involves inde¬
pendent statutory Commissions for Local Administration (one each for England
and Wales) comprising a number of local commissioners, each responsible in a
particular area of the country for investigating citizens’ complaints of malad¬
ministration by local authorities. In Scotland there is a single Commissioner for
Local Administration. The commissioners help local authority councillors to
protect the interests of constituents.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for Complaints deals with complaints
alleging injustices suffered as a result of maladministration by district councils
and certain other public bodies.
THE FIRE SERVICES
The fire services in Great Britain are organised on a local basis, subject to a
measure of central control. The cost is borne by local authorities, aided by
central government through the rate support grant (see p 64). Every part of
the country is covered by a public fire brigade. Northern Ireland has its own
service responsible to the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
Each of 68 fire authorities in the United Kingdom must by law make provision
for fire-fighting purposes, and in particular maintain a brigade of sufficient
strength to meet efficiently all normal requirements (in some parts of Scotland,
authorities are combined to provide fire cover). Other fire-fighting organisations
are maintained, for instance, by the Army and Air Force Departments of the
Ministry of Defence; by the Department of Industry at certain establishments;
and by some large industrial and commercial concerns.
The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland have central
responsibility for the fire service in England and Wales and in Scotland respec¬
tively. Central control is directed mainly towards ensuring the operational
efficiency of brigades. Ministers have statutory powers to make regulations on
such matters as appointments and promotions, standards of training and equip¬
ment, pensions, and disciplinary matters. Their approval is also required for
reductions in the operational establishments of fire brigades. Each minister is
advised by a Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council, consisting of officers of the
respective home departments, representatives of the local authority associations,
and of the associations representing members of fire brigades, and other persons
with special qualifications, appointed by the minister concerned. Inspectorates
of fire services advise the ministers on operational and technical matters.
Most fire brigade establishments include part-time retained personnel to aug¬
ment and support the full-time strength in return for a retaining fee and call-out
and attendance fee. Volunteer members (who receive no remuneration) under¬
take to attend a fire if called upon. Fire authorities also employ people for duties
in controls communications and mobilising and staff duties. In the United
Kingdom there are about 32,000 full-time and 15,000 part-time operational
members of fire brigades.
Every fire authority must buy such appliances and equipment as may be
necessary to meet efficiently all normal fire-fighting requirements in its area.
Certain items of equipment are standardised so that there is complete inter¬
changeability when a fire is attended by personnel and appliances from more
than one area. The principal types of fire-fighting appliances are bought by
fire authorities to requirement specifications approved by the Home Office and
GOVERNMENT
67

Services
the Scottish Home and Health Department on the advice of the respective
Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. These specifications ensure that
minimum standards are maintained, and allow sufficient freedom of design to
meet special circumstances and encourage further developments.
Each fire authority must appoint a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in Scotland)
for its fire brigade. The appointment must be approved by the Home Secretary
or by the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Central control is exercised by the Chief Fire Officer from brigade head¬
quarters. Divisional officers in charge of the geographical divisions into which
most brigade areas are divided are responsible for mobilising forces to deal with
outbreaks of fire in their divisions. Constant communication is maintained
between divisional and brigade headquarters and, if at any time an outbreak of
fire should grow beyond the capabilities of a division, help is sent from one or
more neighbouring divisions, or even from the area of another fire authority
Under arrangements for mutual help made by all fire authorities, the nearest
available force is sent to a fire, regardless of area boundaries.
Fire authorities are concerned with fire prevention measures relating to most
buildings to which the public have resort or in which they are employed. The
authorities are also under a statutory duty to give advice on fire prevention,
restricting the spread of fires, and means of escape in case of fire. Courses in
fire prevention are held at the Fire Service Technical College for fire brigade
officers. °
Fire precautions are not normally required by law in private dwellings, so
that, in addition to enforcement duties, brigades are also involved in educational
and publicity activities to promote fire safety in the home.
Central government is advised on all these fire prevention matters by the
Joint Fire Prevention Committee of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils,
representing the service and central and local authorities.
A. comprehensive programme of research into fire brigade operations, organisa¬
tion, fire-fighting appliances and equipment is conducted by the Home Office
with the help of the fire service under the auspices of the Joint Committee on
Fire Research of the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Councils. Individual
research projects are undertaken by the Home Office Scientific Advisory Branch
or, under contract to the Home Office, by other government agencies, notably
the Fire Research Station, which is part of the Building Research Establishment
of the Department of the Environment, or by private consultants. The Fire
Research Station is the main organisation undertaking the study and investigation
of the technical aspects of fire.
Fire authorities have discretion to employ their brigades and equipment for
purposes other than fire-fighting, and they are used in a variety of emergencies
(such as rail, road and aircraft accidents, collapse of buildings, flooding of
premises, leakage of noxious gas or liquids and the rescue of people or animals
from dangerous situations) for which no charges are made. Brigades are also
used, by prior arrangement, for such purposes as emptying swimming pools
and filling water tanks.
3 Overseas Relations
Administration
Britain has varied and world-wide overseas relations. It has diplomatic relations
with some 150 countries, and with about 20 of these has special treaty relations
providing for common security arrangements, principally through the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Commercial matters form a major
component of relations with other countries, and Britain is a world financial
centre. It has considerable overseas investments and extensive trade relations,
reflecting its dependence on imports for nearly half its food and more than half
its raw material requirements and the relatively high proportion of its gross
national product accounted for by exports (over a third); for details of trade and
payments, see Chapter 19. British development assistance is provided to over
120 countries.
Since 1945 Britain has placed itself in a number of common decision-making
structures or consultative processes with other nations with a view to achieving
common solutions to shared problems—a recognition that, in an increasingly
inter-dependent world, the attainment of overseas objectives and the ability to
exert influence in support of them can best be provided for through inter¬
national co-operation on a regional or global basis. As a result, Britain is now a
member of some 120 international organisations ranging from the world-wide
United Nations concerned with problems of world peace, international economic
co-operation and social issues to regionally based and technically orientated
bodies. In particular, with eight other Western European nations, Britain is a
member of the European Community whose policies it helps to determine, and
is increasingly co-ordinating its overseas policies through the Community’s
political co-operation mechanism (see p 72). As a member of the Common¬
wealth, Britain is a part of a representative cross-section of the international
community, which has evolved from the former British Empire (since 1945
Britain has progressively, and largely peacefully, dismantled its Empire and
prepared over 35 countries for independence) and whose 42 members share a
common language, common technical standards, similar systems of law and
close professional, academic, and commercial links.
Britain has strong ties, also, with the United States, including a common
language and many common political and cultural traditions.
A long involvement in world affairs has given Britain both a vital interest and
a firm belief in the maintenance of international order governed by respect for a
generally accepted system of law. As a permanent member of the United Nations
Security Council it makes support for the United Nations a central feature of its
foreign policy.
The responsibilities of most government departments have a significant overseas
dimension, but overall conduct of Britain’s overseas relations is the responsi¬
bility of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs acting
through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (see p 45) and Britain’s missions
overseas. The latter comprise embassies and high commissions in more than 130
countries, together with subordinate consulates general and consulates, and
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
The British
Council
69
missions at eight multilateral organisations. These posts, like the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, are staffed by members of the Diplomatic Service (see
P S6), together with locally engaged staff. Other government departments
which have a primary concern with overseas relations include the Ministry of
Defence (see p 43), the Department of Trade (see p 50) and the Overseas
Development Administration which is part of the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office (see p 45), but the involvement of most departments has increased
considerably in recent years with the growing dependence of domestic economic
policy on international economic decisions and with Britain’s membership of the
European Community.
Where questions of overseas policy involve matters within the responsibility
of other departments, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office formulates policy
in consultation with the departments concerned. The balance of responsibilities
between them is a matter of constant adjustment, and in many cases the depart¬
ment with the predominant functional interest, even though it may be primarily
domestic, takes the lead. This is particularly so in policy concerning the
European Community and international monetary matters. In the case of policy
towards the Community, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office exercises its
co-ordinating role at official level through the machinery of the Cabinet Office.
A number of other official and unofficial bodies are also involved in the
administration of overseas relations. These include the British Overseas Trade
Board (see p 367) and the Export Credits Guarantee Department (see p 367)
which provide export services for British industry; the Crown Agents for
Oversea Governments and Administrations (see p 355) which helps to arrange
purchases from British aid funds and appointments under technical co-operation
programmes (see pp 86-7); and the British Council (see below), the Inter-
University Council for Higher Education Overseas and the Technical Education
and Training Organisation for Overseas Countries which, between them, are
responsible for administering the bulk of Britain’s educational assistance
programme (see pp 86-7).
The purposes of the British Council, founded in 1934, are defined in its Royal
Charter as the promotion of a wider knowledge of Britain and the English
language abroad and the development of closer cultural relations between
Britain and other countries. (For an outline of Britain’s international scientific
relations see pp 387-9.) The activities of the Council, which has staff in over 80
countries, include the teaching of English and the recruitment of British
teachers for posts overseas, administering the Government’s technical co-opera¬
tion training programme; fostering personal contacts overseas and in Britain
between British and overseas people, especially in the educational, professional
and scientific areas; running, or helping to maintain, libraries of British books
and periodicals overseas and providing information through touring exhibitions
and bibliographical services; and presenting overseas the best of British arts.
In Britain, the Council is concerned mainly with arranging programmes for
professional visitors and with the placing, administration and welfare of
overseas students. A basic principle is that the Council’s work should be of
benefit both to Britain and to the receiving country.
Over 80 per cent of the Council’s budget, estimated at ^101-2 million for
1979-80, is provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (including
funds from the Overseas Development Administration) and on its behalf the
Council is responsible for the implementation of more than 30 cultural
agreements between Britain and other countries. Overseas it acts as education
adviser to Britain’s diplomatic missions and is responsible for educational

assistance in developing countries in which it is represented. Increasingly, the
Council is undertaking education projects paid for by overseas clients and is
providing English classes abroad; these activities are expected to provide about
17 per cent (some £18 million) of its income in 1979-80.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
Britain, together with the Irish Republic and Denmark, joined the original six
countries—Belgium, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Luxem¬
bourg and the Netherlands—in the European Community on 1 January 1973.
In a national referendum in 1975, British membership of the Community was
endorsed, after renegotiation of the terms of membership. Britain plays a full and
positive part in all Community activities seeking actively with its partners to
develop the Community in the interests of all its members.
The European Community consists of three communities set up by separate
treaties—the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Economic
Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.
The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), set up in 1952, established
a common market for coal and steel and formed the model for the ‘community’
approach to economic integration. It is designed to ensure an orderly supply of
coal and steel to member countries, to promote the rational expansion and
modernisation of production and to provide better conditions of employment
and living for the employees in the industries. The ECSC is financed mainly by
a levy on production and provides funds for capital investment, research and
other programmes as well as loans to help create new jobs where coal seams are
being exhausted or where restructuring of the steel industry is taking place.
Grants are also made to assist redundant coal and steel workers until they find
new employment, or while they are undergoing retraining.
The European Economic Community (EEC) was created by the Treaty of
Rome signed by the six countries in 1957. It aims to promote a continuous and
balanced economic expansion by establishing a common market and pro¬
gressively approximating the member states’ economic policies. The preamble
to the Treaty includes among the basic objectives of the EEC the laying of the
foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, the improve¬
ment of their living and working conditions, the progressive abolition of
restrictions on trade, and the development of the prosperity of overseas countries.
The initial steps towards the attainment of these objectives have been the
abolition of internal tariffs and other barriers to trade and the establishment of a
common customs tariff, the development of a common policy for agriculture,
and the introduction of measures to establish the free movement of labour,
capital and services. At the same time, provision has been made for the overseas
countries which have special links with the member countries to have preferential
treatment in aid and the development of trade. This principle is embodied in the
Lome Convention (see pp 73-4).
The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) was set up by a second
treaty signed in Rome in 1957, which provided for the co-ordinated development
of members’ atomic energy industries and of their other peaceful nuclear
activities. Euratom has worked to develop a co-ordinated research programme
(for power production, industrial and medical purposes) to ensure the dis¬
semination of technical information, to facilitate the co-ordination of investment

in the nuclear field, to ensure an adequate supply of nuclear ores and fuels, and
to develop wider commercial outlets. Since 1959, there has been a common
market for all nuclear materials, while the Community has established common
nuclear legislation and a common control system for nuclear materials to prevent
their diversion to purposes other than those declared.
The Treaty of Accession was signed by the applicant countries and the original
member states in January 1972. Britain thereby became a party to the two
treaties of Rome establishing the EEC and Euratom, adjusted as necessary to
take account of enlargement. Accession to the ECSC was effected by a decision
of the Council of Ministers. The European Communities Act 1972 made the
legislative changes necessary for Britain to comply with the obligations entailed
by membership of the Community and to exercise the rights of membership.
In 1977, following a transitional period during which tariffs on trade in
industrial products between Britain and the original six members were pro¬
gressively reduced, the internal tariffs were abolished and the phased intro¬
duction of the common customs tariff on British imports from countries neither
members of the Community, nor having any special arrangements with it, was
completed. Britain had also adopted, progressively, the Community system of
agricultural support under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The
Treaty of Accession provided for a slightly longer period of adjustment (due to
end in December 1979) with regard to payments to the Community budget
(see p 74). Other provisions included those relating to participation in the
Community’s institutions and to its relations with Commonwealth and other
countries.
The separate institutions established by the treaties for each of the three
communities were merged in 1967* Each state has one representative on the
Council of Ministers; in the other institutions Britain’s representation is in line
with that of the other large member states (France, the Federal Republic of
Germany, and Italy). English is one of the six official languages of the
Community.
The Council of Ministers is the final decision-making body for all major
community questions and is the only institution established by the treaties
whose members, usually the foreign minister or other ministers appropriate to
the subject of discussion, directly represent each member country. The
presidency of the Council changes at six-monthly intervals. Most Council
decisions are taken on the basis of a proposal by the Commission (see below).
Some issues may be decided by majority, or qualified majority, with votes
weighted according to provisions in the Treaty of Accession. Where member
states’ vital interests are involved, however, the Council’s practice is to proceed
only on the basis of unanimity. A Committee of Permanent Representatives
(COREPER) assists the Council by preparing its meetings and co-ordinating the
work of the Council’s other subordinate bodies and working groups.
The Commission is responsible for formulating detailed policy proposals for
submission to the Council of Ministers, for promoting the Community interest
and attempting to reconcile national viewpoints and for implementing the
provisions of the treaties and Community measures. Delegated to it are some
limited powers of decision relating mainly to the detailed administration of
agriculture. It is composed of 13 commissioners nominated by the member
governments; two are from Britain. The President of the Commission, since
I977 a former British Cabinet Minister, is appointed for a two-year renewable
term as the Commission’s representative and is responsible for its general
72
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
administration. Each of the other commissioners is responsible for one or more
of the main Community activities. The Commission is pledged to act inde¬
pendently of national or sectional interests and to formulate its proposals and
administer policy in the interests of the Community as a whole. Its proposals are
made only after extensive consultation with officials of the national governments
and with producers, trade unions, employers’ associations and many others.
The Court of Justice interprets and adjudicates on the meaning of the treaties
and of any measures taken by the Council of Ministers and Commission under
them, hears complaints and appeals brought by or against Community institu¬
tions, member states or individuals and gives preliminary rulings on questions
referred to it by courts in the member states. As a court of final appeal, its
procedure in such cases is broadly similar to that of the highest courts in member
states; its rulings are binding on member countries, Community institutions and
individuals. The Court consists of nine judges, assisted by four advocates-
general.
The elected European Parliament is composed of 410 members, 81 elected
from Britain, who sit according to party affiliation and not nationality. The first
direct elections to the Parliament, which was formerly a nominated body, were
held in June 1979, and elections will subsequently be held every five years. The
Parliament is consulted on and debates all major policy issues of the Community.
Members may question the Council of Ministers and Commission, and have the
power on a two-thirds majority to dismiss the Commission. The Parliament also
has the power to reject in its entirety the Community’s draft annual budget as
presented by the Commission and approved by the Council; a formal con¬
ciliation procedure has been adopted for use in the event of disagreement
between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers on matters with major
budgetary or financial implications.
The European Court of Auditors, set up in 1977, carries out a continuous
audit of the handling of Community funds by all member states and
institutions.
The Economic and Social Committee is a consultative body representing a
cross-section of economic interests. Its members—representing employers’
organisations, trade unions and other interests—are consulted by the Council
of Ministers and Commission during the formulation of policy. Britain is
entitled to send 24 members out of a total of 144.
In addition to, and separately from, the institutions operating within the
Community framework established by treaty, the member states have set up the
European political co-operation machinery for the consideration of important
problems of foreign policy. Britain attaches considerable importance to Com¬
munity co-operation in this area. The Community foreign ministers meet in this
framework four times a year. Close contact is maintained with Community
institutions when this is appropriate, and decisions are made on the basis of
consensus.
The Community’s heads of State or of Government meet at least three times
a year as the European Council. This Council, formally established in 1974,
operates outside the treaty framework and may consider both Community
matters and those arising in the context of political co-operation. It discusses
issues unresolved in the Council of Ministers as well as the general problems
facing the Community, and lays down guidelines and an overall political direction
for future work.
The implementation of Community policies is effected by means of regula¬
tions, which are legally binding and directly applicable in all member countries;
directives, which are binding, as to the result to be achieved, on those member

states to which they are addressed but allow national authorities to decide on the
means of implementation; decisions, which are binding on those to whom they
are addressed (for example, member States, firms, or individuals); and recom¬
mendations and opinions, which have no binding force. The Council can also
indicate a general policy direction through resolutions.
A further enlargement of the Community is planned to take place within the
next few years when Greece, Portugal and Spain join the Community. In May
I979 Greece signed a Treaty of Accession; once the Treaty is ratified, Greece
will become the tenth member state in January 1981. The negotiations with
Portugal and Spain are continuing and it is hoped they will join in 1982 or 1983.
Britain strongly supports this enlargement of the Community as a means
of strengthening democracy in Europe.
The nine member Governments of the Community discuss a wide range of
foreign policy issues and, where possible, reach common positions. At the
General Assembly of the United Nations their policies are closely co-ordinated,
and they have voted together on a large number of issues. They adopted a
common strategy at the 1975 Helsinki Conference on Security and Co-operation
in Europe (see p 79) and co-sponsored a number of proposals to improve the
implementation of the Conference’s Final Act at the Belgrade follow-up meet¬
ing. They have issued a number of statements on the Middle East, including a
declaration in 1977 setting out the Nine’s views on the conditions necessary for a
comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Other issues to which
considerable attention has been given include human rights issues throughout
the world, and Southern Africa, where the Nine have adopted a code of conduct
on employment practices for member states’ companies operating in South
Africa, and supported efforts to promote internationally acceptable solutions to
the problems of Namibia and Rhodesia.
On international trade matters the Community adopted a common
negotiating position in the latest round of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT, see p 365) multilateral trade negotiations. Commercial
co-operation agreements have been concluded with a large number of countries
in the Mediterranean area, the South Asian sub-continent, Latin America and
other areas. Dialogues covering trade and other matters have been established
with regional groupings of Latin American countries, Arab countries and with
the Association of South East Asian Nations.
The Community has also improved progressively its generalised scheme of
preferences, which covers manufactures and semi-manufactures exported by
developing countries, with the aim in particular of benefiting the poorest
developing countries (see p 366).
The first five-year Lome Convention governing aid, trade and co-operation
between the Community and developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and
the Pacific (ACP) came into operation in 1975. It will be succeeded in 1980 by
an improved convention which was signed by the Community and 58 ACP
countries in Lome in October 1979. This provides for increased aid and European
Investment Bank lending of about £3,345 million, industrial and agricultural
co-operation, an extension of the scheme designed to stabilise the commodity
export earnings of the ACP countries, assistance for ACP mineral producers
whose production and income suffer from temporary disruptions beyond their
control, and duty-free access to the Community of ACP countries’ exports of all

industrial and most agricultural goods, including improved access for exports such
as rum and beef. All British dependent territories (with the exception of Bermuda,
Gibraltar and Hong Kong), together with the overseas countries and territories
of other Community members, were formally linked with the Community
as a whole in 1976 under conditions similar to those in the Lome Convention.
Britain has played a leading part in urging the Community to adopt a new aid
and development policy based on the criterion of need and applicable on a
world-wide basis, thereby encompassing those developing countries (many of
which are among ;the world’s poorest) not covered by the Lome Convention or
having any other special relationship with the Community. Although it is still
small, the aid programme for these non-associated states has grown steadily since
1976 and Britain supports its further expansion.
The Community has contributed to the North-South dialogue (see pp 87-9)
and is providing $385 million (of which Britain’s share is $115 million) to the
$1,000 million special action aid programme agreed upon in 1977 at the Confer¬
ence on International Economic Co-operation.
Internal All member countries contribute to a common budget which provides funds for
Policies specific Community policies. The budget is largely financed by an ‘own resources’
system based on levies on agricultural imports and customs duties supplemented
by a proportion, not exceeding 1 per cent, of the proceeds of the value added
tax collected on a harmonised basis.
Britain has pointed out that its budgetary contributions are out of balance
with its receipts, and that it is one of the largest net contributors to the budget
despite its relatively low gross domestic product per head. In particular, it takes
the view that the Common Agricultural Policy (see p 283) takes too large a
share of the budget in comparison with other sectors such as industrial, regional,
social and urban policies. (Expenditure on the Policy accounts for 74 per cent of
the total budget, while social policy takes up about 4 per cent, regional develop¬
ment 4 per cent, aid to developing countries 3 per cent, and projects concerned
with research, energy, industry and transport 2-5 per cent.) This situation,
Britain believes, is detrimental to the fundamental objective of the Community,
which is to strengthen the economies of the member states and, by reducing
regional differences, to ensure their harmonious development.
The European Monetary System was established in March 1979 with the aim
of promoting monetary stability in Europe. Britain is currently reconsidering
its decision not to participate in the exchange rate mechanism of the scheme. It
has agreed to take part in other aspects of the scheme, such as the development
of the new European currency unit and of the European Monetary Fund.
The European Social Fund finances schemes for training and retraining young
people, migrant workers, workers in the textile and clothing industries, the handi¬
capped and workers leaving agriculture. The European Regional Development
Fund (see p 221) provides grants for industrial and infrastructure projects in the
less developed or industrially declining regions of the Community with the aim
of reducing existing imbalances or preventing the creation of new imbalances.
Britain has received substantial grants from the two funds, together with other
grants and loans from the European Coal and Steel Community, the European
Investment Bank (see p 221) and the European Agricultural Guidance and
Guarantee Fund.
Other areas of action include industrial policy, where the Community has
taken an active role in safeguarding the interests of the steel industry, energy,
environment and transport policy.

THE COMMONWEALTH
Britain is a member of the Commonwealth, a voluntary association of 42
independent states with a combined population of some 1,000 million, about a
quarter of the world total. Britain participates fully in all activities of the Com¬
monwealth and values it as a means of consulting and co-operating with peoples
of widely differing cultures, thereby contributing to the promotion of inter¬
national understanding and world peace.
Commonwealth members are a representative cross-section of mankind in all
stages of political and economic development. Their peoples are drawn from
practically all the world’s main races and from all continents. As some of its
members are very rich and others very poor, the Commonwealth acts as a bridge
between rich and poor nations.
The member states are Australia, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados,
Botswana, Britain, Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji, The Gambia, Ghana'
Grenada, Guyana, India, Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi, Malaysia’
Malta, Mauritius, Nauru, New Zealand, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Saint
Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore,
Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago’
Tuvalu, Uganda, Western Samoa and Zambia. Nauru, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines, and Tuvalu are special members which are entitled to take part in
all functional Commonwealth meetings and activities but not meetings of heads
of Government. The Queen is recognised as head of the Commonwealth (see
p 20): she is also head of State in 15 countries, the remainder having their own
monarchs or presidents.
I he origin of the Commonwealth lies in the gradual granting of self-govern¬
ment to the older-established British colonies (later known as the Dominions) in
Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa* where European settlement
had occurred on a large scale. During the last half of the nineteenth century and
the first quarter of the twentieth, restrictions on the independence of the
Dominions were gradually relaxed and their fully-independent status in relation
to Britain was legally formulated in the Statute of Westminster of 1931.
The main expansion in Commonwealth membership took place after the
second world war following Britain’s decision to guide its dependent territories
towards self-government and independence. This process began in 1947 with
the independence of India and Pakistan, and in 1957 Ghana became the first
British African territory to become independent. By the end of the 1960s the
British dependencies in Africa had all gained their independence as had many
territories in the Caribbean and in Asia. The most recent Commonwealth
members (1979) ^re Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the
Caribbean and Kiribati in the Pacific.
As a member of the Commonwealth, Britain participates in a system of mutual
consultation and co-operation. The Commonwealth does not formulate central
policies on, say, economic or foreign affairs. Nevertheless the extent of the
consultation and co-operation, which is considerable, is not only of benefit to
member countries but also contributes to international understanding.
^ Consultation takes place through diplomatic representatives known as High
Commissioners, meetings of heads of Government, specialised conferences of
other ministers and officials, and discussions at international conferences and the
United Nations. Trade and cultural exhibitions and conferences of professional
1 South Africa ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth in 1961.

and unofficial medical, cultural, educational and economic organisations are
other ways in which frequent contacts are made.
Heads of Government usually meet every two years, most recently in Lusaka
in 1979. Proceedings are normally in private thereby facilitating a frank, free and
informal exchange of views. On international affairs no formal decisions are
taken and no attempt is made to formulate specifically Commonwealth policies,
although, on occasion, common views on certain matters of major international
concern are formulated and reflected in the communiques issued at the end of
the meetings.
One of the most important Commonwealth activities is consultation and
co-operation in economic affairs. Finance ministers meet annually to discuss
world economic problems, these meetings being held on the eve of those of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. In recent years ministers
have paid particular attention to the problems of development and the establish¬
ment of a fairer international economic order. Other ministerial meetings include
the regular Commonwealth Education and Commonwealth Medical Conferences.
The Commonwealth Secretariat provides the central organisation for con¬
sultation and co-operation among member states. Established in London in
1965, headed by a Secretary-General appointed by the heads of Government,
and financed by member governments, the Secretariat is responsible to Common¬
wealth Governments collectively.
As the main agency for multilateral communication between Governments,
the Secretariat promotes consultation, disseminates information on matters of
common concern, and organises meetings and conferences, including those of
heads of Government and of ministers. It co-ordinates many Commonwealth
activities, its main areas of operation being international affairs, economic
affairs, education, information, legal matters, medical and scientific affairs,
youth activities, and applied studies in government. It also administers the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation (see below).
Because of its neutral position the Secretariat has been able to make its good
offices available in cases of dispute, and has carried out, on request, special
assignments requiring demonstrable impartiality.
Britain plays an active part in the work of the Commonwealth Fund for Technical
Co-operation established within the Commonwealth Secretariat to provide
technical co-operation for economic and social development in Commonwealth
developing countries. The Fund is financed by contributions from both de¬
veloped and developing states, Britain contributing about a third of its
expenditure (Canada is the other major contributor). In 1978-79 the Fund’s
resources amounted to some £12 million.
The Fund provides experts to undertake advisory assignments or fill specific
posts and uses consultancy firms to make studies for governments. Its education
and training programme is of particular help in raising levels of technical and
vocational skill, and makes wide use of training facilities within developing
member countries for the benefit of other developing countries. It has a special
programme to help countries develop their exports and a small technical assistance
group to give advice in key areas.
Expenditure by Britain on technical co-operation with Commonwealth develop¬
ing countries in 1978 was £75 million, the greater part being spent on financing
staff for service for Commonwealth Governments (£50 million) and in financing
training places in Britain for people from Commonwealth countries (£13 mil-

lion); volunteers are also sent from Britain to serve overseas. Other technical
help includes the sending of consultants to carry out feasibility surveys, the
supply of training and research equipment, and making available the advisory
services of British scientific and technical institutions (see also p 87).
Britain is a major contributor to the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellow¬
ship Plan, a system of awards for people of high intellectual promise to study in
Commonwealth countries other than their own, and provides 650 awards
annually out of a total of over 1,000 within the scheme. Under the Aid for the
Commonwealth Teaching of Science Scheme, Britain sends out experts to serve
in curriculum development units, institutes of education and the inspectorates
of ministries of education.
Other British financial aid to Commonwealth countries includes investment
finance from the Commonwealth Development Corporation (see p 86).
A large number of organisations are concerned with the Commonwealth. The
Commonwealth Institute, financed largely by the British Government, promotes
knowledge about the Commonwealth through films, library services, lecture
tours by members of the staff and study conferences for students; its head¬
quarters in London has a permanent exhibition open to the public depicting
the life of member states, each country financing its own stand. The Common¬
wealth Foundation, financed by member Governments, administers a fund for
increasing co-operation between professional organisations; it has assisted in the
creation of 18 Commonwealth-wide professional associations, helped in the crea¬
tion and growth of many national ones, and has created some ten multi-disciplin¬
ary professional centres. The Royal Commonwealth Society, which is over 100
years old, is a centre for the study and discussion of Commonwealth affairs, the
library in London having one of the world’s largest collections on the Common¬
wealth. The Society has branches, affiliated organisations and representatives in
many countries.
In keeping with the fact that the Commonwealth is an association of peoples
as well as Governments, many unofficial organisations, professional bodies and
voluntary societies provide machinery for co-operation. Professional bodies in¬
clude associations of architects, doctors, engineers, lawyers, librarians, magis¬
trates, museum curators, nurses, pharmacists, planners, surveyors, and veterinary
surgeons. Other organisations include the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association which organises an annual conference of parliamentarians, the
Commonwealth Press Union, the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association, the
Commonwealth Youth Exchange Council, the Commonwealth Games Federa¬
tion, and the Commonwealth Arts Association.
There are 14 remaining British dependent territories1: Belize, Bermuda, British
Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin Islands,
Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands and Dependencies, Gibraltar, Hong Kong,
Montserrat, Pitcairn Island, St Helena and Dependencies, Turks and Caicos
Islands and the Anglo-French Condominium of New Hebrides. British policy is
to give independence to those territories that want it, and not to force it on those
which do not.
The population of the dependencies is about 5 million, ranging from Hong
1 Rhodesia, where sovereignty remains vested in Britain, has been under the control of
an illegal regime since 1965. Britain is committed to bringing about a peaceful settlement
providing for majority rule and following extensive consultations, particularly with other
Commonwealth Governments, new British proposals for bringing Rhodesia to legal
independence were announced in August 1979. A constitutional conference to consider
these opened in London in September 1979.
78
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Kong with well over 4 million people to Pitcairn Island with less than 100.
Only three have populations of over or near 100,000 (Belize, Hong Kong and the
New Hebrides), few are rich in natural resources, and some are scattered groups
of islands. There are no permanent inhabitants in the British Antarctic Territory
or British Indian Ocean Territory.
Most dependencies have considerable self-government with their own
legislature and civil service. Britain is generally responsible for defence, internal
security and foreign aifairs, these functions being exercised through a
Governor.
Some territories are on the way to independence: the New Hebrides, for
example, is expected to progress to independence in 1980. There are particular
problems associated with Belize, the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar which are the
subject of territorial claims by neighbouring states—Guatemala, Argentina and
Spain respectively. In all three cases Britain refuses to accept that British sove¬
reignty is in doubt. In Belize it is British policy, supported by the United Nations,
to bring the territory to secure independence as soon as possible. Britain has
pointed out that Belize would be independent now had it not been for the Guate¬
malan claim. Fresh British proposals for a settlement were made to Guatemala in
1978 but were rejected. In the Falkland Islands and Gibraltar, the inhabitants
of both territories wish to retain the link with Britain, and the Government is
pledged not to support any transfer of sovereignty against their wishes.
Two territories in the Caribbean—St Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla, and Antigua,
which have a combined population of some 140,000—are known as Associated
States, a status providing for complete control of internal affairs with Britain
retaining responsibility for external relations and defence. This arrangement
originally covered six territories but four—Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines—have since become independent.
Associated statehood is entirely voluntary and can be terminated at any time
by either party. Unlike dependencies, Associated States can proceed to inde¬
pendence without the consent or assistance of the British Government.
Legislation to this effect has to be approved by a two-thirds majority in the
territory’s legislature and by a two-thirds majority in a referendum. Alternatively
the British Government can end the associated status through an Order in
Council, and this procedure was followed at the request of all those which have
become independent. Britain considers it right to take such action at the request
of an Associated State provided that it is satisfied that the majority of the people
want independence and that the proposed independence constitution makes
proper provision for the preservation of fundamental rights and freedoms.
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY
One of Britain’s foremost foreign policy concerns is to protect its territorial
integrity and political independence, as well as the interests of its remaining
dependencies and Associated States and of its allies. The attainment of these
objectives is seen as depending on an effective national security policy, in which
defence is coupled with strenuous efforts towards removing or alleviating the
causes of international tension, and widening and strengthening international
arms control and disarmament measures.
British defence policy is described in Chapter 4. It is based on the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)1 which member countries regard as the
1 NATO’s 15 member countries are Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, the
Federal Republic of Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Turkey and the United States. Neither France nor Greece participates
fully in NATO’s integrated military structure.

guarantor of their security, freedom and well-being, and as an important
contribution to international peace and stability. All the members share a belief
in democracy, human rights, justice and social progress. Britain makes a major
contribution to NAT O, devoting to it the greatest proportion of its defence
effort and concentrating this in areas where it can best support NATO’s security
objectives.
NATO s twin aims are defence and detente. It pursues a strategy of deter¬
rence, designed to convince any potential aggressor that the use of force, or the
threat of it, carries risks far outweighing any likely advantage. In recent years
NATO has placed increasing emphasis upon complementing its defensive
capability with efforts to negotiate arms control and disarmament agreements
with a view to maintaining the balance of security at a lower level of risk.
Outside Europe, Britain is committed to joint consultation with Australia,
New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore under the Five Power Defence arrange¬
ment. It is also responsible for the security of its overseas dependencies and
Associated States (see p 92), and supports the peace-keeping efforts of the
United Nations (see p 81).
Britain seeks genuine improvements in East-West relations based on undiminished
security. It takes an active part in arms control and disarmament negotiations (see
below), and in the process initiated by the 1975 Helsinki Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe. It attaches great importance to the full and balanced
implementation by all participants of the provisions of the Conference’s Final Act
for increased stability in Europe and improved co-operation between the 35 Euro¬
pean and North American signatory states. (The Final Act is a charter and code of
conduct of behaviour for what the participants hope will in time become a more
normal and open relationship between both Governments and people in East and
West. It includes undertakings about security, human rights, and co-operation in
economic, humanitarian and other matters.) Britain participated fully in the
I977—7^ Belgrade follow-up meeting at which there was a thorough exchange of
views on the implementation of the Final Act. It has since taken part in the
various expert-level meetings agreed at Belgrade and is actively involved in
preparations for the second follow-up meeting in Madrid in November 1980.
Together with France, the United States and the Soviet Union, Britain is a
signatory to the Quadripartite Agreement on Berlin which came into force in
I972- I he Agreement reaffirms the four countries’ rights and responsibilities in
Berlin, and provides for greatly improved travel and communications facilities
between Berlin and both the Federal Republic of Germany and the German
Democratic Republic, and for the maintenance and development of the ties
between West Berlin and the Federal Republic.
Britain has played a prominent part in all the major multilateral disarmament
negotiations, and has become party to all the treaties concluded as their result.
(It is a depository government for most of these agreements.) At the United
Nations Special Session on Disarmament in 197^5 Britain reaffirmed its commit¬
ment to work for progress through multilateral, balanced and verifiable arms
control and disarmament agreements. It participates in the Committee on
Disarmament (as it did in the Committee’s predecessor, the Conference of the
Committee on Disarmament) and in the arms control and disarmament work of
the United Nations.
One of the world’s nuclear-weapon states, Britain is committed to negotiating
in good faith to halt the nuclear arms race and to move towards nuclear dis¬
armament. It is engaged in negotiations with the Soviet Union and the United
8o
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
States for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. Such a treaty, in the British
view, would curb the development of new types of nuclear weapons. Britain
regards the widest possible international adherence to the treaty as an important
objective; meanwhile, it adheres to the Partial Test Ban Treaty (which bans
nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space and under water), having been,
with the Soviet Union and the United States, one of the first three signatories
in 1963.
Britain fully supported the United States in its efforts to conclude an agree¬
ment with the Soviet Union in the second set of the strategic arms limitation
talks (SALT II), and welcomed the conclusion of an agreement in June 1979
which is designed to establish parity in strategic nuclear weapons and enhance
stability.
Britain believes it is possible to improve international access to the benefits of
the peaceful uses of nuclear energy while minimising the risk of the spread of
nuclear weapons technology, and has played a leading part in strengthening the
regime of non-proliferation through the International Atomic Energy Agency
and other organisations. A party to the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty (which is
designed to curb the nuclear arms race and to provide an assurance, through
international safeguards, that civil nuclear activities of non-nuclear-weapon
states will not be diverted to making such weapons), Britain has undertaken not
to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states which have inter¬
nationally binding commitments not to manufacture or acquire nuclear explosive
devices (except in the case of an attack on British interests by such a state in
association with a nuclear-weapon state). It intends to play a full part in the 1980
review conference of the Treaty.
The establishment of nuclear weapon-free zones in different parts of the world
can contribute to non-proliferation and regional security, and Britain supports
proposals for such zones wherever possible. It was the first nuclear-weapon state
to ratify the protocols to the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons
in Latin America (the Treaty of Tlatelolco).
As a result of a British initiative, another category of weapons of mass destruc¬
tion, biological weapons, is the subject of the 1972 Convention on Prohibition of
the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological)
and Toxic Weapons and on their Destruction. Britain has also taken an active
part in efforts to agree on a ban on chemical weapons, and in 1976 put forward a
draft convention on the prohibition of their development, production and stock¬
piling. Britain believes also that new scientific discoveries should not be used
to create totally new weapons of mass destruction. In this context, it feels that
the best approach is for the Committee on Disarmament to keep under review
the question of the development of such weapons and to consider the desirability
of formulating agreements with regard to them as and when they are identified.
On conventional weapons, which are still the main component of most
countries’ national armouries, Britain has argued for international discussions on
ways to halt the world-wide build-up. In particular it believes in the value of
regional agreements as a means of facilitating this. In the talks on Mutual and
Balanced Force Reductions, Britain, together with its NATO allies, is working
for an agreement with the Warsaw Pact participants which would contribute to
a more stable relationship and to the strengthening of peace and security in
Europe.1 The NATO position is based on the principle that the outcome should
be one of approximate parity between NATO and Warsaw Pact forces in central

Europe. Britain has also proposed at the United Nations regional ‘confidence¬
building measures, such as notification of military movements and exchanges
of observers, in areas of potential tension and conflict.
At a United Nations conference on ‘inhumane’ weapons, Britain has
proposed a convention regulating the use of landmines and booby-traps, and
has supported proposals for bans or restrictions on other weapons deemed likely
to cause unnecessary suffering or to be indiscriminate in their effects.
Britain is concerned about the rising scale of global military expenditure, and
has made proposals at the United Nations for a multilateral, balanced and
verifiable reduction of military budgets. It is also playing a leading part in the
United Nations study on the relationship between disarmament and develop¬
ment.
BRITAIN AND THE UNITED NATIONS
Support for the United Nations (UN) and the purposes and principles of its
Charter has been a cornerstone of British policy since 1945. In particular,
Britain is concerned that the United Nations should be able to act effectively as
an agency for crisis anticipation, peace-keeping and peace-making; as a forum for
the discussion of major world issues; and as an instrument for development and
for providing a wide variety of specialised and technical services. Britain also
sees a strong and effective United Nations as the best framework for pursuing
and achieving many of its foreign policy objectives—the resolution of disputes,
an ordered North-South dialogue, disarmament and arms control, the pro¬
tection of human rights, the promotion of the rule of law—designed to con¬
tribute both to its own wellbeing and security and to the development of a more
harmonious international community.
The United Nations has in recent years had a growing role as the central
institution for the discussion of ‘global’ issues. In addition to those of peace and
war, these include disarmament, nuclear proliferation, disaster relief, the sea¬
bed, action against terrorism, the world environment, energy, development and
world resources. While in some cases there are specialised institutions, usually
UN agencies, for dealing with these issues, in many others, including most of
those referred to above, discussion takes place mainly in the United Nations
itself. Britain plays an active and positive role in these debates.
The maintenance of international peace and security, the primary purpose
envisaged for the United Nations at the time of its establishment, remains one
of the world’s greatest problems. Britain supports the view that the United
Nations, as the only forum in which the whole international community is
represented, has the right and duty to be involved in disputes which threaten
peace and stability whether on a regional or world scale. In concert with other
members, it has worked to strengthen and make more effective the machinery of
the Security Council, the organ with primary responsibility for security matters,
for preventing and settling disputes. As a permanent member of the Security
Council, Britain has a particular interest in and responsibility for questions of
international peace and security, and plays an active role in the Council’s work.
Another British concern is that the United Nations should have the capacity
to play an effective peace-keeping role. Britain currently supplies the largest
national contingent to the UN Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus, together with
logistic support for the entire force, and provides some logistic support for the
UN Interim Force in Southern Lebanon. In addition, in 1978 the British
Government announced its willingness, subject to national commitments and
8a
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
exigencies, to make available a limited British force for short-term peace-keeping
purposes.
Britain plays an active role in the work of the Special Committee on Peace¬
keeping Operations which is working for the establishment and implementation
of guidelines for peace-keeping operations, and agreement on practical measures
to facilitate such operations.
Human Rights Britain has supported the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights since
its adoption by the General Assembly in 1948. While not legally binding, it has
inspired many other international instruments designed to secure the observance
of its provisions. These include the two international covenants adopted by the
General Assembly in 1966 which do impose legal obligations on those who
ratify them—the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Both came into force in 1976 and were
ratified by Britain in the same year. Similarly, Britain has accepted Article 41 of
the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognising the competence of the
UN Human Rights Committee (set up to supervise the Covenant’s imple¬
mentation) to receive and consider state-to-state complaints.
Britain is also a party to a number of more specific conventions aimed at
implementing particular rights contained in the Universal Declaration, including
those on the elimination of racial discrimination, on the rights of women, the
status of refugees and stateless persons and slavery.
Britain recognises, however, that the adoption of conventions and covenants
in itself is insufficient to secure the protection of human rights, and believes it is
necessary to develop effective procedures to ensure the implementation of
standards which such arrangements contain. Britain also believes that UN
member states, through their voluntary acceptance of the Universal Declaration
and the International Covenants, have demonstrated that abuses of human
rights wherever they occur are the legitimate subject of international concern;
and that a consistent policy on the part of a member government in breach of
these obligations is a proper matter for discussion at the United Nations.
Overall responsibility within the United Nations for human rights activities
lies with the Economic and Social Council. The bodies directly concerned are
the Commission on Human Rights, its Sub-Commission on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, and the Commission on the
Status of Women. Britain has been represented on all these bodies and has
played an active part in their work. (In 1978 Britain, for the first time, was not
re-elected to the Commission on Human Rights, but contributed to the work of
the 1979 meeting as an observer. It has been re-elected to the Commission for
1980 and 1981.)
Economic and The Charter states that ‘the promotion of the economic and social advancement
Social Affairs of all peoples’ is one of the principal aims of the United Nations, and it is
estimated that some 90 per cent of the organisation’s efforts, in terms of
resources and personnel, are now employed to this end. Against a background of
growing concern for and assistance to meet the problems of development, the
main emphasis in this work has become increasingly the provision of operational
programmes of direct assistance for member states. The UN system is now the
largest single source of technical assistance for developing countries, as well as
providing considerable emergency and relief aid and assistance for refugees.
(The provision of capital assistance has been generally confined to the World
Bank group and regional development banks whose operations are generally
considered separately from those of the rest of the United Nations system.)
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
83
Successive British governments have affirmed their support for the functional
and developmental work of the United Nations system, and have continued to
increase the amount of funds made available to the system for assisting develop¬
ing countries. Britain is the seventh largest contributor to the United Nations’s
regular budget, providing some £9-1 million, 4-5 per cent of the total, in 1978.
In addition, it contributed about .£3-6 million to the World Health Organisation,
£2 million to the International Labour Organisation, £2-9 million to the Food
and Agriculture Organisation and £2-4 million to the UN Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organisation. Britain provides a considerably larger proportion of
the UN’s voluntary funds, donating some £47-8 million in 1978, including
£24-15 million for the UN Development Programme, £3-7 million for the UN
Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, £3-9 million for the UN
Children’s Fund, £3-4 million for the UN Fund for Population Activities, about
£7 million for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and £5-2 million to
the World Food Programme.
Britain plays an active role in the deliberations of the governing bodies of the
various agencies and programmes, especially with a view to encouraging, in
line with the objectives of its own aid policy, the deployment of resources
towards the poorest countries and the poorest communities in the developing
world (see p 84). It also seeks to ensure that the institutions make the most
efficient use of the development resources placed at their disposal, and to promote
improvements in the co-ordination, control and effectiveness of the system,
especially in order to avoid unnecessary duplication and overlapping of
responsibilities.
The United Nations is central to the North-South dialogue (see p 87), not only
through the involvement of its agencies in development and other international
economic problems, but also as the forum within which the overall dialogue is
reviewed. Britain supported the establishment by the General Assembly in 1978
of a Committee of the Whole to monitor developments in the dialogue. The
preparation of a new international development strategy for the 1980s and
possibly beyond will be the subject of a special session of the General Assembly
in 1980. Britain is participating fully in this process, and believes that the new
strategy should reflect the interdependent nature of the world economy.
OTHER INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
Britain is an active member of a number of other international organisations,
including those concerned with the management of the world economy and
which, therefore, have an important role to play in the North-South dialogue
(see p 87). It is a founder member of the International Monetary Fund, estab¬
lished in 1944 (along with the World Bank—see p 87) as the principal
administrator of the international financial system and as a source of credit for
member states facing balance of payments problems, and has welcomed the
creation by the Fund of facilities to provide special assistance to developing
countries experiencing financial or trading difficulties. It is a strong supporter of
efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to liberalise
further and promote the growth of world trade, and to improve the developing
countries’ participation in it (see pp 88 and 365).
Britain is also a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), an instrument for inter-governmental co-operation
among 24 industrialised countries on matters relating to economic and social
policy. Its aims are to promote policies designed to achieve the highest sustain¬
able economic growth and employment, and a rising living standard, in member

countries while maintaining financial stability, and thus to contribute to the
development of the world economy; to contribute to sound economic expansion
in member as well as non-member countries in the process of economic develop¬
ment; and to contribute to the expansion of world trade on a multilateral,
non-discriminatory basis in accordance with international obligations.
Other organisations to which Britain belongs or extends support are more
restricted in their operations and include the regional development banks in
Africa, the Americas and Asia and specialist technical, agricultural and medical
institutions.
With 20 other nations Britain is a member of the Council of Europe which
aims to provide the widest possible European forum for the discussion of
current political, economic, social and scientific issues with a view to achieving a
greater unity between its members. Membership is open to any European state
which is a parliamentary democracy and accepts the principles of the rule of law
and protection of human rights. The Council was responsible for the adoption in
1950 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Britain is a party.
DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION
The basic objective of Britain’s aid programme, which is the responsibility of the
Overseas Development Administration, is to help developing countries’ efforts
to raise their living standards. This involves assistance in the broadest sense
(from the provision of finance to purchase capital goods to expert advice and
training) to supplement developing countries’ own programmes for generating
economic growth and social development. Aid is provided either bilaterally on
a government-to-government basis or multilaterally through contributions to
international development agencies.
Recent British aid policy has focused on reducing absolute poverty in the
developing world, reflecting a recognition that the poorest countries find it most
difficult to generate investment funds domestically or attract external private
flows. The emphasis in the aid programme, therefore, has been on the poorest
countries and on the poorest communities within these countries. Since these
communities live mainly in rural areas, the policy has meant increased support
for rural development. The aim has been to alleviate poverty by providing more
and better opportunities for productive employment, usually of a labour
intensive nature, and the basic social services such as health care and education.
At the same time, Britain has continued to support other projects to which
developing countries attach priority.
In addition to the official aid programme, private investment in developing
countries is encouraged by the provision of government insurance to private
investors by the Export Credits Guarantee Department (see p 367). An
important contribution is also made by the work of private voluntary organisa¬
tions (see p 87).
Since 1945 total official aid disbursements have amounted to about £6,620
million. The average gross annual disbursement over the four years 1975-78
was about ^580 million. In 1978 official aid flows totalled some £743 million, of
which ^685 million represented official development assistance1 and £58
million other official flows. Of the overall total, bilateral aid accounted for
^555 million including technical co-operation funds of £153 million;
^ Official development assistance, the international basis for reporting on aid performances,
is defined as official flows for development purposes with a grant (concessional) element of
25 per cent or more.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Bilateral Aid
85
assistance provided through multilateral agencies was £188 million. Repay¬
ments of capital and payments of interest on loans made previously came to
,£54 million and ^41 million respectively.
The strategy for the Second UN Development Decade, adopted in 1970,
recommended that each developed country should progressively increase its
official development assistance to the developing countries and exert its best
efforts to contribute a minimum net amount of 07 per cent of its gross national
product (GNP) annually. Britain has accepted this in principle without commit¬
ment to a target date, progress being dependent on Britain’s own economy and
other calls on resources. In 1978, net disbursements of official development
assistance (see Table 5) amounted to £632 million, 0-39 per cent of GNP (the
net official flow figure was £689 million, 0-43 per cent of GNP). Britain has also
accepted the UN target of 1 per cent of GNP for total net financial flows (that is,
including private and official flows) to developing countries.
Historically, Britain’s aid programme began as part of the discharge of its
responsibilities towards dependent territories, and the main emphasis remains
on the Commonwealth which includes among its members some of the world’s
poorest countries. In 1978 £401 million (74 per cent) of bilateral aid went to
Commonwealth countries. Of this, £37 million went to Britain’s remaining
dependencies, which are a first charge on the aid programme, and £8 million
to the Associated States.
In regional terms, most British aid goes to Asia, which in 1978 received £211
million (40 per cent) of the bilateral programme, followed by Africa (£175 million),
Latin America and the Caribbean (£38 million) and Oceania (£30 million). The
country receiving the largest amount was India with £119 million. Other major
recipients included Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malawi, Kenya, Zambia and Jamaica.
In line with the policy of concentrating aid on the poorest countries, £313
million (58 per cent) of bilateral aid went to countries with a 1976 per capita
income of $280 or less.

Financial Aid
Technical
Co-operation
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Bilateral financial aid in 1978 totalled £389 million; over 68 per cent was in
grants and the rest in loans. Budgetary aid, over £14 million in 1978, is provided
in the form of grants. Development aid can be in grant or loan form, but the
greater part is provided in grants following a decision to provide aid to the
poorest developing countries (which include India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and
many African countries) in grant form only. The terms of development loans
have been progressively relaxed since 1958. In 1978 loan commitments, excluding
investments by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (see below)
totalled XI45 million, of which 40 per cent was on interest-free terms. Where
loans bear interest it is at fixed concessionary rates ranging from 2 per cent to 6
per cent, and both kinds of loan carry from three to seven years’ grace periods,
during which repayments of capital are not made. Of all loans committed in
1978 the average maturity was 25 years. Britain has more than fulfilled the 1972
recommendations of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development on easing the terms of financial
aid. In 1978 Britain announced its intention to cancel debts worth £900
million on past development loans to 17 of the poorest countries (see also
P 88).
Loans and grants are normally tied to the purchase of goods, equipment and
services from Britain, although there may be a limited element for local costs and
a foreign content not exceeding 20 per cent in contracts financed from tied aid in
appropriate cases. New loan commitments can be untied, if the recipient agrees,
to the extent that goods can be purchased from the poorest developing countries
as well as from Britain.
An important role in development assistance is played by Britain’s Common¬
wealth Development Corporation (CDC), set up in 1948 to assist the economic
development of the then dependent territories. Subsequent legislation extended
its area of operations to independent Commonwealth countries and, with British
Government approval, to other countries. By the end of 1978 some £275
million had been invested out of a total commitment of £397 million. Of the
latter ^96 million was in East Asia and the Pacific, £55 million in the Caribbean
and virtually all of the remainder in Africa. Commitments approved in 1978
totalled over £59 million, of which 86-5 per cent went to the poorest countries
and 53 per cent to renewable natural resources projects.
Technical co-operation, the transfer of specialised knowledge and skills from
country to country, is complementary to financial aid, the availability of such
expertise often being a precondition of a successful programme of financial aid
or investment. Expenditure on it has increased in recent years and was ^153
million, 28 per cent of bilateral aid, in 1978. Of this, £69 million was for the
provision of expert personnel, including volunteers, £24 million for students
and trainees in Britain, £10 million for research services and projects, .£10
million for consultancy services, and -£40 million for books and equipment for
training and research.
During 1978, there were 8,014 people financed by Britain (other than
volunteers) working in developing countries, of whom some 3,607 were engaged
in the field of education, 1,383 in public works and communications, 1,144 in
public administration, 1,057 in agriculture and allied fields, 521 in health
services, and 302 in industrial posts. In addition, under the British Volunteer
Programme there were 1,505 volunteers, mainly graduates or otherwise qualified,
working in developing countries, the majority of them teaching. Recruitment,
training and placing overseas is undertaken by four voluntary bodies: Catholic
Institute for International Relations, International Voluntary Service, United

Nations Association and Voluntary Service Overseas; 90 per cent of the societies’
costs are met by the British Government.
Britain receives large numbers of students and trainees from developing
countries. Over 14,000 were financed in Britain in 1978 under regional pro¬
grammes of technical co-operation, by awards under the Commonwealth
Scholarships and Fellowship Plan, and under various British Council schemes.
To support practical development activity overseas, the Government main¬
tains four specialist scientific organisations (the Directorate of Overseas Surveys,
the Land Resources Development Centre, the Tropical Products Institute and
the Centre for Overseas Pest Research) and provides support for many others.
These organisations provide specialist information and advice, experts for
service overseas and undertake field and laboratory research investigations.
Britain is the second largest subscriber (after the United States) to the World
Bank group of institutions—the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the International Development Association (IDA) and the
International Finance Corporation. The British commitment to the IDA’S
Fifth Replenishment (for 1977 to 1980) is £474 million. Britain has contributed
or has agreed to contribute, to the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the African Develop¬
ment Fund. Britain s contribution to the United Nations Development Pro¬
gramme for 1979 is j£28’5 million, and it is the largest source for expertise and
fellowships provided under the programme. In addition there is a major
British contribution to other United Nations agencies and programmes (see
P 83)* and an increasing proportion of British development assistance is
now being channelled through the European Community’s aid programme (see
P 73)-
Voluntary agencies provided some £26 million for their work in developing
countries in 1978. The funds were spent mainly on agriculture, health and
nutrition, and education projects and on emergency relief operations. The
Government co-operates with the agencies in various ways, especially in
immediate post-disaster relief and rehabilitation operations and through its
Joint Funding Scheme. Under this scheme, the Government meets half the cost
of selected development projects undertaken by the agencies and aimed at
helping the poorest. Two hundred such projects were approved in 1978, includ¬
ing community health, non-formal education, the improvement of food supplies,
agricultural training, water supply and irrigation. Expenditure on the scheme in
1978 was over £1 million. Disaster relief and rehabilitation aid provided through
the agencies during 1978 amounted to nearly £3 million.
Voluntary agencies also provide support for refugees. The Government
finances about half the annual budget of the United Kingdom Standing Con¬
ference on Refugees, a consultative body for agencies engaged in assisting
refugees, and in 1977 indicated its willingness to consider applications from
agencies for grants for projects aimed at improving refugees’ welfare and their
ability to support themselves. In 1978 grants for such projects amounted to
£i43 >000.
The North-South dialogue, which embraces questions of development, transfer
of resources, raw materials, trade and international monetary issues, is being
conducted between the industrialised nations and the developing countries with
a view to evolving a more equitable balance in the world’s economy. Britain
attaches importance to securing progress in the dialogue, and in its approach to
88
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the discussions involved works in close association with its partners in the
European Community.
As a Community member state Britain contributed significantly to the work
of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation1. The Conference
did not achieve complete success but reached a considerable degree of agree¬
ment particularly on development issues (see p 74).
A major development in aid policy in 1978 was the commitment by major
donor countries, at a ministerial meeting of the Trade and Development Board
of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), to adjust the
terms of past bilateral aid to bring them into line with prevailing more relaxed
terms—known as retrospective or retroactive terms adjustment—or to take
equivalent measures. It was following this that Britain decided to relieve 17 of
the poorest countries of debt repayments worth some £900 million to the end
of the century, thus placing past aid to these countries on the same grant-only
basis as present assistance programmes (see p 86).
Britain, in close collaboration with its Community and OECD partners, made a
full contribution to the discussions on North-South issues at the Fifth UNCTAD
conference in Manila in mid-1979. The conference was a stage in the continuing
dialogue, with discussions on most of the important issues between the developed
and developing countries. Much attention focused on the Declaration and
Programme of Action in which the Group of 77 developing countries set out
their main demands.
In the commodities field, Britain took the initiative at the Commonwealth Heads
of Government Meeting in 1975 in giving impetus to the establishment of price
stabilisation arrangements on a commodity-by-commodity basis. This took shape
in the programme of work on individual international commodity agreements
initiated by the Resolution on the Integrated Programme for Commodities
adopted by UNCTAD in 1976; the Resolution also called for a Common Fund
to help finance the agreements. In the subsequent negotiations on the Common
Fund and on individual commodities, Britain has played an active part within
the European Community and consumer countries generally in the search for
appropriate solutions. A framework agreement on the Common Fund was
reached in March 1979, and negotiations on the detailed provisions were
resumed later in the year.
In 1964 Britain was the first major developed country to support the idea of
extending tariff preferences on a non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis to
all developed countries. It therefore strongly supported the objectives of the
latest round of multilateral trade negotiations. Set out in the 1973 Tokyo
Declaration (see p 365), these were the further liberalisation of world trade
through the progressive dismantling of tariff and non-tariff barriers, and within
this, the provision of special and more favourable treatment for the developing
countries where possible.
Since its entry into the European Community, Britain has adopted the
Community’s trade arrangements, which are among the most liberal applied by
industrial nations, and has played a significant role in determining their nature.
In particular it took a major part in the negotiations for the first Lome Con¬
vention (see p 73), not only with a view to safeguarding the trading interests of
1 The Conference on International Economic Co-operation met in Paris from December
1975 to June 1977 and was, while it continued, the focal point of the North-South
dialogue. It was attended by representatives of eight western industrial countries
(including the European Community as a single entity), known as the ‘Group of Eight’;
and seven members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 12 other
developing countries,, who made up the ‘Group of 19’. Discussions have since reverted to
the United Nations and its constituent bodies.
OVERSEAS RELATIONS
89
Commonwealth developing countries, but also to ensure that reciprocal pre¬
ferences would not be demanded from the developing countries as had been the
case with previous Community arrangements. Britain also contributed to the
successful conclusion of the second convention (see p 73). In addition, Britain
has supported improvements to the Community’s Generalised System of Pre¬
ference scheme, 366, especially with regard to more liberal access into the
Community for imports of manufactured and processed agricultural products and
in its application to the poorest developed countries, particularly those in South
Asia. Before entering the Community, Britain secured a commitment to expand
and reinforce Community trade relations with the Commonwealth countries of
Asia, and this has led to the conclusion of commercial co-operation agreements
with India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
4 Defence
POLICY
Britain’s basic security depends on the continued strength of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation (NATO) (see also pp 78-9) which celebrated its 30th anniver¬
sary in 1979. With the greater part of its military forces committed to NATO,
Britain makes a major contribution to the full range of deterrent capabilities,
both conventional and nuclear, required to maintain the North Atlantic Alliance’s
defensive posture. Britain believes that the Alliance’s defence needs can best be
met through co-operative action, and has agreed to participate fully in the Long
Term Defence Programme which is a major co-operative undertaking adopted
by the Alliance in 1978 in order to strengthen its defence and deterrent posture
in the face of the continuing build-up in Warsaw Pact military strength. Britain
also plays an important part in the efforts of the European members to assume,
through closer co-operation, an increasing responsibility for Western defence.
In the ‘Eurogroup’ Britain and ten other European members are working to
improve their contribution to the Alliance and to achieve a more effective
collective result from the available resources. The sub-groups of the Eurogroup,
each of which concentrates on a specific area such as training or logistics, make an
important contribution towards the strength of the Alliance by increasing
co-operation among its members. Britain also participates in the independent
European Programme Group of all European members of the Alliance; the
Group extends co-operation among European countries in defence equipment
and contributes to greater co-operation over equipment throughout the Alliance.
The Alliance complements its defence preparations with efforts to reduce
tension and achieve a more just and lasting peaceful order in Europe through
such measures as arms control and disarmament agreements, and Britain plays
a major part in these efforts (seepp 79-81). In recent years, Britain has withdrawn
from its commitments outside NATO wherever this has been consistent with
its fundamental military and political obligations (see p 79).
PLANNING AND CONTROL
Supreme responsibility for national defence rests with the Government as a
whole, which is responsible to Parliament. The formulation of defence policy
is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence who is assisted by a
Minister of State, and by three Under-Secretaries of State—for the Navy,
Army and Air Force respectively. They, together with the Chief of the Defence
Staff, the three Service Chiefs of Staff, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State
for Defence, the Vice-Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel and Logistics), the
Chief Scientific Adviser and the Chief of Defence Procurement, form the
Defence Council, which deals with major aspects of defence policy. The Chiefs
of Staff Committee is responsible for giving professional advice on strategy and
operations, and on the military implications of defence policy. The day-to-day
management of the three Services is the responsibility of the Admiralty, Army
and Air Force Boards of the Defence Council.

DEPLOYMENT
The NATO strategy of flexibility in response, together with the principle of
forward defence, is based on the premise that peace and stability can only be
maintained if a potential aggressor is convinced that it would lose far more than
it could ever hope to gain by the use of force. The strategy is designed to enable
NATO to respond to aggression at a variety of levels, being flexible enough to
allow the appropriate degree of effective military action to be taken. It requires
the possession of a wide range of mobile and well-equipped conventional forces,
and of theatre and strategic nuclear capabilities which provide a chain of options
from which to choose the appropriate method of countering aggression.
Britain makes a major contribution to the forces required by NATO’s present
strategy. Together with its tactical nuclear forces, the British Polaris strategic
force provides a unique European contribution to NATO’s nuclear deterrent.
Virtually all ships of frigate size and above are earmarked for assignment in
an emergency to NATO. The Royal Navy also contributes to NATO’s Standing
Naval Force Atlantic, Standing Naval Force Channel, and the Naval On Call
Force Mediterranean. The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) and Royal Air

Force (RAF) Germany are deployed in the Federal Republic of Germany and
there is a Field Force in Berlin. The main combat element of BAOR is First
(British) Corps which comprises four armoured divisions, an artillery division,
and an infantry formation. Its peacetime strength of around 55,000 would be
more than doubled on mobilisation by reinforcements and reserves from
Britain (see p 96). Virtually all the RAF’s combat and combat support aircraft
are assigned to NATO. RAF Germany is a tactical air force including strike/
attack, reconnaissance, close support and air-defence aircraft. In addition,
combat units based in Britain form an important part of NATO’s mobile
reinforcement capability. These include the ground elements of the United
Kingdom Mobile Force, the British contribution to the Allied Command Europe
Mobile Force (Land) and three squadrons of 22 Special Air Service Regiment.
RAF Strike Command provides forces for strike/attack, reconnaissance, close
support, air defence and maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare, together
with transport forces and air elements for the United Kingdom Mobile Force
and Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (Air).
In the Mediterranean, British forces are deployed in Cyprus to meet Britain’s
commitment to the United Nations Force and to provide for the security of the
Sovereign Base Areas. In Hong Kong, units of all three Services provide a
garrison for external defence, and a Gurkha battalion is stationed in Brunei. A
Royal Marines detachment is maintained in the Falkland Islands; and in the
Caribbean, units of the Army and the RAF provide a garrison for the external
defence of Belize.
At home a major task of the armed forces since 1969 has been to assist the
civil authorities in Northern Ireland in the maintenance of law and order, and
they have operated to counter the terrorist activities of extremist organisations.
THE ARMED FORCES
Britain’s armed forces excluding non-United Kingdom personnel totalled about
317,000 on 1 January 1979, 73,500 in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines,
158,100 in the Army and 85,400 in the Royal Air Force. The forecast total for
1 April 1980 is 321,900. The average number of civilian staff expected to be
employed by the Ministry of Defence during 1979-80 is 263,300.
The three women’s Services, the Women’s Royal Naval Service, the Women’s
Royal Army Corps, and the Women’s Royal Air Force, are integral parts of the
armed forces, and servicewomen serve alongside servicemen in Britain and
overseas. Nursing services are provided by Queen Alexandra’s Royal Naval
Nursing Service, Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps and Princess
Mary’s Royal Air Force Nursing Service.
Britain’s armed forces consist entirely of personnel serving on a voluntary
basis. Engagements available to non-commissioned ranks range from three to
22 years, with a wide freedom of choice on the length and terms of service.
Recruits to non-commissioned ranks are committed for only a minimum period

may leave at any time at 18 months’ notice. Discharge may also be granted on
compassionate grounds, by purchase, or on grounds of conscience (applications
being assessed by an independent tribunal). Commissions may be granted for
short, medium and long terms. In all three Services there are opportunities for
promotion from the ranks. Direct entry to commissioned ranks is on the basis

of educational and other qualifications. All three Services have schemes for
university cadetships.
Entrants to non-commissioned ranks are given basic training, and further and
specialist training is given during the course of their careers. Young servicemen
and women are encouraged to study for educational qualifications, and extensive
facilities exist for this. Trade and technical training, though primarily designed
for Service purposes, leads for about half the total number of service personnel
to nationally recognised qualifications.
Service technical training is highly valued in industry, which is a significant
advantage on return to civilian life. To assist resettlement the Services provide

are also opportunities for short- and longer-term retraining both before and after
discharge from the Services.
Entrants to commissioned ranks receive initial training at the Britannia Royal
Naval College, Dartmouth, the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, the Royal
Air Force College, Cranwell, or similar institutions. This is followed by specialist
training, often including degree courses at university or Service establishments.
Staff training is provided by the Royal Naval Staff College, Greenwich, the
Army Staff College at Camberley, and the Royal Air Force Staff College at
Bracknell. The National Defence College at Latimer is designed to fit selected
mid-career officers of all three Services for key posts that contribute to

formulation of defence policy in the Ministry of Defence and on international
staffs. Specially selected senior officers and civilian officials from Britain, the
Commonwealth, NATO and other countries attend the Royal College of Defence
Studies in London, which provides the wider background necessary for those
destined to fill higher appointments.
Considerable operational training is carried out through joint-Service and
inter-allied exercises. All three Services provide training for the armed forces of
allied and Commonwealth countries.
Combat forces are functionally divided into the nuclear strategic force, Royal
Navy general purpose combat forces, European theatre ground forces, other
Army combat forces and Royal Air Force general purpose forces.
The British contribution to NATO’s strategic deterrent comprises the Royal
Navy’s force of four Polaris nuclear submarines—Resolution, Repulse, Renozvn,
and Revenge. Each can remain on underwater patrol for long periods and is
equipped with 16 Polaris missiles, armed with nuclear warheads, with a range of
about 4,500 km (2,800 miles).
Britain’s maritime forces are concentrated in the Eastern Atlantic and English
Channel, where they provide the majority of forces readily available to NATO.
However, they retain an ability to be deployed world-wide in defence of allied
or national interests. Nearer home they provide protection for Britain’s fishing
interests and the North Sea oil and gas installations.
Equipment The first of a new class of anti-submarine warfare cruiser, HMS Invincible, is
expected to enter service in 1980. The primary task of the cruisers will be to
act as command ships for anti-submarine warfare forces. They will deploy the
Sea King anti-submarine helicopter, and carry the Sea Dart missile system and
Sea Harrier maritime vertical short-take-off and landing (V/STOL) aircraft for
area air defence and anti-surface ship operations. Sea Kings are also embarked
on the anti-submarine warfare cruisers HMS Hermes and HMS Bulwark and
the command helicopter cruiser HMS Blake. There are seven County class
guided-missile destroyers all armed with Seaslug and Seacat surface-to-air
missiles and four with the Exocet surface-to-surface guided-missile system, the
Type 82 guided-missile destroyer HMS Bristol (equipped with the Sea Dart
area air defence missile system and the Ikara anti-submarine guided weapon
system), and six of the new class of Type 42 Sea Dart guided-missile destroyers.
Other surface vessels include 49 general purpose frigates (comprising 26 Leander
class, seven Tribal class, eight Rothesay class and eight of the new Type 21
Amazon class), three anti-submarine frigates (including the first two Type 22
frigates), three anti-aircraft frigates, 39 mine counter-measure vessels (including
HMS Brecon, the first of the Hunt class of glass-reinforced-plastic mine counter¬
measure vessels) and seven new Island class offshore patrol vessels. The frigate
classes are variously armed with automatic guns, surface-to-air missile systems,
underwater detection and anti-submarine weapons. Most have the Wasp
helicopter embarked, which is being replaced, where appropriate, by the Anglo-
French Lynx.
Exocet missile systems are being installed in some Leander class and Type 21
frigates, giving these vessels a better surface-to-surface capability, and in the
Type 22 frigates, which also have the Seawolf surface-to-air missile system.
Some Leander class frigates are also equipped with the Ikara anti-submarine
weapon. Eleven nuclear-fleet submarines are in service, including the first five

of the Swiftsure class, as are 16 conventional patrol submarines. There is also an
amphibious capability comprising the two assault ships HMS Fearless and HMS
Intrepid and the Royal Marines Commando Forces, supported by HMS Hermes
and HMS Bulwark which retain a secondary role as commando ships.
Ships under construction include HMS Illustrious, and HMS Ark Royal, the
second and third of the anti-submarine warfare cruisers, and four Type 22
frigates. In addition, work is in hand on three nuclear-fleet submarines, including
two of a new class, eight Type 42 Sea Dart destroyers, and four Hunt class mine
counter-measure vessels.
European The European theatre ground forces consist of BAOR, and the forces stationed
Theatre Ground in Britain, the main elements of which have primary roles in support of the
Forces North Atlantic Alliance (see p 91—2).
Other Army Other Army combat forces comprise land forces stationed overseas to meet
Combat Forces treaty commitments to Commonwealth and other countries (see p 92).
Equipment Armoured regiments are equipped with the Chieftain main battle tank. A new
series of tracked combat reconnaissance vehicles is in service, including Scorpion
and Scimitar, mounting respectively a 76mm and a 30mm gun, Striker, carrying
the Swingfire anti-tank missile, and Sultan, a command vehicle. The primary
tracked armoured personnel carrier used by mechanised infantry battalions is the
FV432. Entering service with the infantry is the crew-portable Milan anti-tank
weapon system. Artillery units are equipped with the Abbot 105mm self-
propelled gun, 155mm and 175mm self-propelled guns, the 105mm light gun
and Field Artillery Computer Equipment (FACE). The FH70 155mm field
howitzer will enter service in 1979. Tactical nuclear support is provided by the
Lance missile system. Air defence is provided by the Rapier low-level surface-to-
air missile system and the Blowpipe man-portable very-low-level missile.
Royal Air Force 1 he Royal Air Force general purpose forces consist of aircraft for air defence,
General strike/attack, reconnaissance, offensive support, airborne early warning, maritime
Purpose patrol and anti-submarine warfare, transport and in-flight refuelling, and the
Forces RAF Regiment field squadrons in the anti-aircraft and ground defence roles.
Equipment Phantom and Lightning aircraft, together with Rapier and Bloodhound surface-
to-air missiles, are employed in air defence. Radar warning is provided by
Shackleton airborne early warning aircraft (to be replaced in the 1980s by
specially equipped Nimrods which will form part of NATO’s integrated air¬
borne early warning force) and by the ground radars and control and reporting
centres of the United Kingdom Air Defence Ground Environment system.
Jaguars, Buccaneers and Vulcans operate in the strike/attack role; Jaguars,
Canberras and Vulcans are employed for reconnaissance; Jaguars and the
Harrier V/STOL aircraft for offensive support (with the Harrier also having a
tactical reconnaissance capability); Nimrods for long-range maritime patrol and
anti-submarine warfare and for offshore surveillance and fishery protection duty.
The Tornado multi-role combat aircraft will replace the Vulcan, Buccaneer,
Canberra, Phantom and Lightning aircraft in their respective roles during the
1980s. The first will enter service in the strike/attack role in 1980.
The VC 10 provides strategic transport and the Hercules (which also has a
strategic capability) is used for tactical transport over medium ranges. For
short-range tasks, the Wessex and Puma helicopters are used, while for search
and rescue operations Wessex, Whirlwind and Sea King helicopters are used in

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Britain. Victor tankers are used for in-flight refuelling, which gives added range
and flexibility to combat aircraft.
Reserve and auxiliary forces are an integral part of the armed forces. Apart
from their essential military role—to supplement the regular forces in time of
war or emergency with trained personnel able immediately to take their places
in the Services either as formed units or as individual reinforcements—they
form an important link between the Services and the civil community. Some
of their members have a reserve liability following a period of regular service
(regular reserve); others are volunteer men and women who devote their spare
time to training for the roles they would undertake in war or an emergency. The
latter include the Territorial Army (TA) whose role is to re-inforce the ground
forces committed to NATO and to assist in maintaining a secure home base in
the United Kingdom, the Royal Naval Reserve, the Royal Marines Reserve and
the Royal Airforce Volunteer Reserve. There is also the Ulster Defence Regiment
which is a locally-recruited and largely part-time force designed to support the
regular forces in Northern Ireland. On 1 January 1979 regular reserves totalled
184,200, and volunteer reserves and auxiliary forces 73,500. Cadet forces, which
make a significant contribution to recruitment to the regular forces, totalled
141,100.
CIVIL DEFENCE
Civil defence arrangements are principally based on the extended and adapted
use of existing public services operated by nationalised industries, local
authorities, the police and government departments. Supplementary effort from
volunteers and voluntary organisations would be brought in, either at the
discretion of local authorities or in response to a national appeal, in time of crisis.
Recent policy has aimed at improving the preparedness of local government to
meet a war emergency. Since there is common ground between such planning
and that required for a major peace-time emergency or national disaster a closer
relationship in local planning for the different emergencies of peace and war has
also been sought.
Within an annual budget of ^35-8 million, emphasis is placed on a high
quality of central and local government planning. Studies and seminars are
arranged by the Home Office on staff college lines.
Arrangements also include an emergency system for decentralised govern¬
mental control and communications. The United Kingdom Warning and
Monitoring Organisation, which includes the civilian Royal Observer Corps, is
organised to provide public warning of an attack, of the location and strength of
nuclear explosions, and of the distribution and level of radioactive fall-out.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Responsibility for the procurement (that is, research, development and pro¬
duction) of defence equipment lies with the Procurement Executive within the
Ministry of Defence. The Executive is responsible for liaising between the
Service users and the machinery for procurement, and co-ordination with
industry in the formulation of programmes; this ensures a cost-effective
approach.
Research and
Development
Most research is undertaken by the Ministry of Defence’s research and develop¬
ment establishments, but the Ministry also sponsors a substantial amount of
DEFENCE
National Projects
Production
97
research by industry and the universities. The Ministry’s establishments have a
very wide technological capability, which has civil as well as military applications:
for example, support is given to civil aerospace projects and advanced aero¬
engines. On the development side, the establishments collaborate closely with
the Ministry’s contractors by monitoring their progress, and by assisting in
testing programmes and in solving particular technical problems.
Modern defence equipment is becoming ever more complex, and its develop¬
ment requires a high initial investment; in 1979-80 the cost of British equipment
research and development is estimated at £1,160 million. The search for a more
efficient use of these resources has caused attention to be concentrated on
collaborative projects, which enable development and costs to be shared with
other countries. In some cases the outright purchase of foreign equipment is the
most economical solution. Nevertheless, the importance of maintaining a sound
national industrial base for defence procurement is recognised, and there is close
consultation between government and industry both in the National Defence
Industries Council and through other specialised machinery.
Collaboration between Britain and other European countries is extensive, and
is expected to increase, particularly through the work of the European Pro¬
gramme Group. Successful joint projects include the Anglo-French Jaguar
aircraft, the Martel air-to-surface missile, the Lynx, Puma and Gazelle heli¬
copters and the Anglo-Belgian family of armoured combat reconnaissance
vehicles. Production and development of the Tornado multi-role combat air¬
craft with the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy is continuing and good
progress is being made in the development, with these two countries, of the
medium artillery pieces FH70 and SP70. Equipment collaboration also
facilitates joint logistic support and training arrangements, like those taking place
among the five European countries which have agreed to purchase the Lance
surface-to-surface missile system from the United States.
A considerable number of projects, covering all the main equipment areas, are
under development. They include a complete range of new avionic and sonic
equipment which will greatly improve the effectiveness of the Nimrods; an air
defence variant of the Tornado; a search and rescue version of the Sea King
helicopter with a greater range and capability; a new range of logistic vehicles
for battlefield support; a new type of tank armour, Chobham Armour, which
weight for weight provides greatly improved protection for armoured vehicles;
and the Wisp and Wideye remotely-piloted helicopters. An airborne early
warning (AEW) version of the Nimrod is being developed, equipped with an
advanced AEW radar, which will complement the AEW force which other
NATO countries are planning to procure.
Following the development of defence equipment, either nationally or in
co-operation with allies, production is usually undertaken by private industry
on a contract basis or by the Royal Ordnance Factories and Royal Dockyards.
Production may also be undertaken on a collaborative basis. The Defence
Sales organisation provides support, assistance and advice to British industry
and the Royal Ordnance Factories in promoting the sales of defence equipment
overseas. In 1979-80 the value of exports of British defence equipment is
expected to reach £1,200 million.
Justice and the Law
THE LAW
Although the United Kingdom is a unitary State, it does not have a single body
of law. England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own
legal systems and law courts. There is substantial identity on many points, but
considerable differences remain in law and in procedure. In Northern Ireland
procedure closely resembles that of England and Wales but there are often
differences in enacted law. However, a large volume of modern legislation applies
throughout the United Kingdom.
A feature common to the legal systems of the United Kingdom is the dis¬
tinction made between the criminal law and the civil law. The criminal law is
concerned with wrongs against the community as a whole while civil law is
concerned with the rights, duties and obligations of individual members of
society between themselves.
Sources of Law The main sources of law in the United Kingdom are legislation, common law
and European Community law. Legislation consists of Acts of Parliament,
orders, rules and regulations made by ministers under the authority of an Act of
Parliament, or by-laws made by local government or other authorities exercising
powers conferred upon them by Parliament. Common law is the ancient law of
the land as deduced from custom and interpreted by the judges. Generally
speaking it has never been precisely defined or codified but forms the basis of
the law except when it has been superseded by legislation.
European Community law (see p 72) is largely confined to economic and
certain social matters; in certain circumstances it prevails over domestic law. It is
normally applied by the domestic courts, but the most authoritative rulings are
given by the European Court of Justice (see p 72).
CRIMINAL JUSTICE
Four distinct stages are involved in the British system of criminal justice: the
enactment of criminal legislation which, for instance, defines prohibited acts,
establishes criminal courts and provides for the treatment of offenders; the
prevention of crime and the enforcement of the law—largely matters for the
police service; the determination by the courts of the guilt or innocence of
people accused of crimes, followed by the selection of appropriate sentences for
the guilty; and the treatment of convicted offenders.
A Royal Commission has been set up to examine the powers and duties of the
police in England and Wales, the rights and duties of suspects and accused
people, and the process of and responsibility for the prosecution of criminal
offences.
The Criminal The criminal law, like the law generally, undergoes constant reform in the courts
Law as established principles are interpreted, clarified or refashioned to meet new
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
99
circumstances. Substantial changes in the law are the responsibility of Parlia¬
ment. In practice most legislation affecting the criminal law is government-
sponsored, but there is often consultation between government departments and
bodies representing the legal profession, the police and the probation and prison
services. 1 he views of voluntary bodies are also considered.
Crime Statistics Chief constables in England and Wales have a duty to supply statistics relating
to offences, offenders, criminal proceedings and the state of crime in their areas.
Crime statistics are published annually by the Home Office and further in¬
formation about crime trends (as well as about police matters) is contained in the
annual reports of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary and (for
London) the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Similar arrangements
operate in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The differences in the legal systems of the United Kingdom make it im¬
practical to analyse in detail trends in criminality for the country as a whole. In
considering trends it has to be remembered that the number of offences recorded
by the police does not cover all offences committed since some offences go
undiscovered and others are not reported to the police. Nevertheless it is clear
that, as in western Europe generally, there has been an upsurge in crime since
the early 1950s.
Table 6 shows the rate of indictable offences (the more serious offences)
recorded by the police in 1978 in England and Wales. There were about 5,200
indictable offences per 100,000 population.
In 1978 424>°29 people were found guilty of indictable offences by courts in
England and Wales. Of these, about 49 per cent were under 21 years of age. Not
all apprehended offenders are taken to court. For indictable offences 106,842
people were given formal oral cautions by the police; of these 90 per cent were
under 21. For non-indictable offences (excluding motoring offences) oral
cautions were given to 34J551 people of whom 50 per cent were aged under 21.

Criminological A wide range of criminological and other social research is carried out by the
Research Home Office Research Unit and by the research branch of the Scottish Home
and Health Department. The results of the research are published in learned
journals, the Home Office Research Studies series and the Scottish Office Social
Research Studies series. Research is also carried out in university departments,
much of it financed by the Government. The principal university research
establishment is the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge.

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme provides ex gratia compensation to
victims of violent crimes including victims of violence within the family and to
people hurt as a result of attempts to arrest offenders and prevent offences. It
is administered by a board consisting of legally qualified members appointed by
the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland after consultation
with the Lord Chancellor. Compensation, which is assessed on the basis of
common law damages and usually takes the form of a lump sum payment, has
totalled over £50 million since the scheme began.
The scheme does not apply in Northern Ireland where there is statutory
provision in certain circumstances for compensation from public funds for
criminal injuries caused to people and also for malicious damage to property
(see below). Compensation for property damage includes losses of profits arising
from the damage.
Various temporary measures to deal with terrorism in connection with Northern
Ireland have affected some aspects of the British criminal justice system. Wide-
ranging emergency powers in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, contained in
recent legislation, include: the right to search, arrest and detain suspected
terrorists; the proscription of organisations engaged in terrorism connected with
Northern Ireland affairs and occurring in the United Kingdom; and the
exclusion from Great Britain and Northern Ireland of people concerned in
terrorism. People who are not British citizens can be excluded from the United
Kingdom as a whole. There is also a system of controls at ports on passengers
travelling between Great Britain and Ireland.
Trials in Northern Ireland criminal courts of offences involving terrorism are
heard by a judge sitting without a jury to obviate the possibility of intimidation
of jurors.
The emergency laws are temporary and must be reviewed periodically; they
have also been subject to independent examination. Although they confer
special powers on the appropriate Secretary of State, they have been used
sparingly. No one can be imprisoned for political beliefs; all prisoners except
those awaiting trial have been found guilty in a court of law of criminal offences.
The security forces in Northern Ireland are subject to the law and can be
prosecuted in the courts for criminal offences. The procedure for dealing with
complaints against the police involves two independent elements: the Director of
Public Prosecutions where allegations of criminal conduct are made; and the
Police Complaints Board for Northern Ireland where complaints relate only to
disciplinary offences.
The Criminal Jurisdiction Act 1975 creates extra-territorial offences under
Northern Ireland law so that it is possible to try in the province a person
accused of certain offences committed in the Irish Republic. It also enables
evidence to be obtained in Northern Ireland for the trial of offences in the Irish
Republic. Reciprocal legislation is in force in the Irish Republic.
As a result of the civil disturbances in the province since 1968, over £48
million has been paid from public funds in compensation for personal injuries
and about £290 million for damage to property.
Crime prevention and crime investigation, the preservation of the peace and the
bringing to trial of offenders are primarily the concern of the police service.
British police action in enforcing the law rests mainly upon common consent,
for there are only a small number of officers in relation to the population
(roughly one officer to 430 people). Officers do not normally carry firearms (their
only weapon is a truncheon) and there are strict limitations on police powers.

and Chief

Central
Authorities
There are 43 police forces in England and Wales, eight in Scotland and one (the
Royal Ulster Constabulary) in Northern Ireland. Each force is responsible for
law enforcement in its own area, but there is constant co-operation among them.
Outside London most counties (regions or islands in Scotland) have their
own police forces, though in the interests of efficiency several have combined
their forces. In London, the Metropolitan Police Force, with headquarters at
New Scotland Yard, is responsible for an area within a radius of about 24
kilometres (15 miles) from the centre, but excluding the City of London, where
there is a separate force. The strength of the regular police force in Great Britain
is over 124,000 (including nearly 9,700 policewomen); in Northern Ireland the
strength of the force is about 6,500 (arrangements are being made to increase
this to 7,500). The size of individual police forces depends on the area and
population which they serve. The strength of the Metropolitan Police Force is
over 22,600.
In addition to the regular police forces, constabularies are maintained by the
British Railways Board, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, the
Ministry of Defence and a few other public bodies. Considerable numbers of
people are employed by commercial security organisations which are subject to
the ordinary law of the land. Proposals made by the previous Government for
licensing private security firms are under discussion.
Each of the regular police forces is maintained by a police authority, a com¬
mittee consisting of local councillors and, in England and Wales, magistrates.
The police authority for the Metropolitan Police Force is the Home Secretary.
In Northern Ireland the police authority is appointed by the Secretary of State.
The primary duty of the police authority is to provide an adequate and
efficient police force in the area for which it is responsible. Its functions, some
of which are subject to ministerial approval, include appointing the chief
constable, deputy chief constable and assistant chief constables and, if necessary,
calling on them to retire; fixing the maximum permitted strength of the force;
and providing buildings and equipment. In the Metropolitan Police area the
chief officer of police and his immediate subordinates are appointed on the
recommendation of the Home Secretary.
Chief constables are responsible for the direction and control of police forces
and for the appointment, promotion and discipline of all ranks below deputy or
assistant chief constable. They are generally answerable to the police authorities
on matters of efficiency, and must submit a written report every year.
The Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland are concerned with the organisation, administration
and operation of the police service. They approve the appointment of chief
constables, and may require a police authority to retire a chief constable in the
interests of efficiency, call for a report from a chief constable on any matters
relating to the policing of his area, or cause a local inquiry to be held. They also
have the power to make regulations covering such matters as police ranks;
qualifications for appointment, promotion and retirement; discipline; hours of
duty, leave, pay and allowances; and uniform and equipment. Some of these
regulations are first negotiable on the Police Council (a negotiating body on
which are represented the police authorities, police staff associations and
ministers); others are discussed on representative advisory bodies, together with
any general questions affecting the police service.
All police forces in Great Britain (except the Metropolitan Police for which
the Home Secretary is directly responsible) are subject to inspection. Inspectors
102

Officers and

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of constabulary carry out, under Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary
and Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, a formal
annual inspection of the forces in their regions, inquiring into efficiency and
reporting to the Home Secretary or the Secretary of State for Scotland. Annual
reports are published, covering the whole range of police matters. The inspectors
also maintain close touch with forces for which they are responsible, and have
various advisory functions.
In Northern Ireland periodic inspections of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
are made by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary.
The income of police authorities comes from central and local government.
The Government’s contribution, which is a half of approved expenditure (a third
in the City of London), is conditional on the Home Secretary or the Secretary of
State for Scotland being satisfied that a force is being efficiently administered
and maintained.
In general, entry to the regular police force is open to men and women between
the ages of i8f and 30. A chief constable may approve the appointment of
especially suitable older men and women.
The standard police ranks in England, Scotland and Wales, except in the
Metropolitan Police and City of London Police areas, are: chief constable,
assistant chief constable, chief superintendent, superintendent, chief inspector,
inspector, sergeant and constable. The chief officer in the Metropolitan Police
area, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, is assisted by a deputy com¬
missioner and four assistant commissioners. Next in rank are deputy assistant
commissioners, and then commanders; from chief superintendent the ranks are
the same as in the regions. In the City of London the ranks are the same as
in the regions except that the chief officer is the Commissioner of Police and the
second in command is an assistant commissioner. Police ranks in Northern
Ireland are very similar to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
Cadet training is designed to prepare boys and girls between 16 and i8| years
of age for a police service career. They have no police powers but, in addition
to their educational studies and physical and adventure training, are instructed
in elementary police work.
In order to release as many uniformed police officers as possible for operational
duties, police authorities employ some 25,000 civilians on administrative and
technical duties.
Traffic wardens (of whom there are over 4,000) discharge specified duties
normally undertaken by the police. They may be authorised to issue fixed
penalty notices1 for some minor traffic offences; to man police car pounds
(except in Scotland and Northern Ireland); to enforce some aspects of the
vehicle excise laws; and to obtain the names and addresses of people thought to
have committed certain types of traffic offence. They may also be authorised to
direct traffic, to act as parking attendants at street parking places, and as school¬
crossing patrols. Wardens are under the control of the chief constable.
Each police force has an attachment of special constables who volunteer to
perform police duties without pay in their spare time. In England and
Wales, they act as auxiliaries to the regular force when required. In Scotland
they are employed only in emergencies although they may be assigned for
duty for training. In Northern Ireland there is a largely part-time (and paid)
reserve.

clerk of the appropriate court instead of having his case tried in the ordinary way.

formance of police duties. Strict procedures, often including an independent
element, govern the way complaints against police officers are handled.
Members of the police service may not belong to a trade union nor may they
withdraw their labour in furtherance of a trade dispute. All ranks, however, have
their own associations which can make representations to ministers or to police
authorities on matters of interest or concern to their members.
Police work ranges from the protection of people and property, road or street
patrolling and traffic control to crime prevention, criminal investigation and the
arrest of offenders. In urban areas, particularly, police officers often have to deal
with social problems and they can bring in other social agencies and expert
help. In England and Wales they also prosecute accused people (see p 104).
The main departments in all forces are the uniform department, criminal
investigation department, traffic department and specialised departments,
including river or marine police, mounted police, and dog handlers.
A number of common services are provided by the central government depart¬
ments and by arrangements made between forces. The most important of these
are: training services; a forensic science service in England and Wales with
seven regional laboratories (in addition to the Metropolitan Police Laboratory);
telecommunications services which supply and maintain police radio equipment;
and central and provincial criminal records which are available to all forces. In
addition, regional crime squads, consisting of teams of experienced detectives
from several forces, investigate major crimes involving inquiries in more than
one police area. The Scottish Crime Squad assists forces in the investigation and
prevention of crime.
Certain special services such as liaison with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (Interpol) are provided for other British forces by the Metropolitan
Police Force. The services of the Force are available, on request, to assist any
other police force in England and Wales in criminal investigation, as are the
services of the Fraud Squad, which is run jointly by the Metropolitan Police and
the City of London Police for the investigation of company frauds.
Research into technical services is organised in separate units within the Home
Office Police Department: the Forensic Science Service Unit and its regional
laboratories; a Central Research Establishment staffed by scientists; and a
Directorate of Telecommunications with one section of engineers engaged solely
on research and development. The Police Scientific Development Branch is
staffed by scientists and technicians assisted by police officers seconded from the
Police Research Services Unit; the Branch and the Unit are concerned with
operational research into police methods and the development of equipment for
police forces. The Economic Planning Unit, composed mainly of economists and
accountants, is responsible for the development of a planning—programming-
budgeting system for the police; this work includes the production of programme
accounts and studies of the use of resources.
In all aspects of police work the use of scientific aids is widespread. A national
police computer has been developed to rationalise the keeping of records and to
speed up the dissemination of information.
In England and Wales arrest may be made on a warrant issued by a judicial
authority on sworn information laid before it or without warrant. An arrested
person is entitled to ask the police to notify a named person, such as a relative

or a solicitor, about his or her arrest. The police may delay notification if they
think it necessary in the interests of the investigation, the prevention of crime or
the apprehension of offenders.
Anyone arrested without a warrant may be released by the police on bail and
must be so released if he or she cannot be brought before a magistrates’ court
within 24 hours, unless the alleged offence is serious. If remanded in custody,
the defendant must be brought before a magistrates’ court as soon as practicable.
People granted bail have to surrender to custody at an appointed time and place.
On appearance before a magistrates’ court, a defendant charged with an im-
prisonable offence may be refused bail in certain specified circumstances only,
the most important of which are that there are substantial grounds for believing
that he or she might abscond, commit further offences or otherwise interfere
with the course of justice; if bail is refused by the magistrates, the defendant can
apply to a judge of the High Court and, if committed to the Crown Court, may
apply for bail to that court. In 1978 some 81 per cent of people committed for
trial by magistrates were given bail.
Once anyone has been charged with an offence, the police may not put any
further questions, save, in exceptional circumstances, to prevent or minimise
harm or loss to any person or to the public, or to clear up an ambiguity in a
previous answer or statement. This is laid down by the Judges’ Rules which do
not have the force of law but carry very great weight.
A person detained in custody who thinks that the grounds for detention are
not lawful1 may apply for a writ of habeas corpus against the person who
detained him or her, this person being required to appear before the court on
the day named to justify the detention. An application for such a writ is normally
made to a divisional court of the High Court either by the person detained or by
someone acting on his behalf. Similar procedures apply in Northern Ireland.
In Scotland the police have similar powers of arrest as have the police in
England and Wales. Although the Judges’ Rules do not apply, an arrested person
must be cautioned and have the charge read out. Thereafter only voluntary
statements made by the arrested person are used in evidence at the trial and the
court will reject any statements he or she made unless it is satisfied that they have
been fairly obtained. Anyone apprehended must be brought before a court with
the least possible delay. Where a prosecution on indictment is contemplated, the
accused is brought before a judge for judicial examination and may then be
committed for trial or for further examination. Eight days may elapse between
commitment for further examination and commitment for trial.
People in custody in Scotland, other than those charged with murder or
treason, may be liberated on bail by the sheriff or, if the offence is within the
jurisdiction of a summary court other than the sheriff court, by that court or by
the police. Even in the case of murder or treason, bail may be granted at the
discretion of the Lord Advocate or the High Court of Justiciary. There is a right
of appeal to the High Court by the accused person against the refusal of bail, by
the prosecutor against the granting of bail, or by either party against the amount
fixed. The writ of habeas corpus does not apply in Scotland, but the High
Court of Justiciary has power to release anyone unlawfully detained and trials
must be brought to a conclusion within 110 days of committal to custody.
The decision to prosecute normally rests, in England and Wales, with the
police and in Scotland with public prosecutors. In Northern Ireland there is a

Director of Public Prosecutions (see below). In England and Wales (and very
exceptionally in Scotland) a private person may institute criminal proceedings.
Police have powers to issue cautions (warnings in Scotland) instead of prosecut¬
ing, especially in the case of young people.
In England and Wales some offences can only be prosecuted by, or with the
consent of, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions, the latter
acting under the superintendence of the Attorney General. Where the consent
of the Attorney General is required, the Director is in practice responsible
for prosecution; offences in the category include crimes such as bribery and
corruption of officials, and the use and possession of explosives.
The Director has to prosecute cases such as treason and murder. The police
must report to the Director’s office a further list of offences, including serious
offences against the person, sedition, criminal offences by police officers, and
offences relating to obscene or indecent publications. The Director does not
necessarily prosecute all such cases referred but may do so in any that appear
to be important or where intervention is thought to be necessary; otherwise
proceedings are conducted by solicitors employed by the police. The Director
also considers whether proceedings should be taken in cases reported by
government departments, and advises the police and others concerned with the
administration of the criminal law.
When cases go for trial, barristers in private practice are instructed to appear
on the Director’s behalf; at the Central Criminal Court in London, these are
drawn from a panel of ‘Treasury Counsel’ appointed by the Attorney General.
The prosecution process in Scotland is different from that in the rest of the
United Kingdom. The Lord Advocate (see p 121) is responsible for the
prosecution of all crimes but delegates most of the work to the Solicitor General
(see p 121), to ten Advocates Depute and to procurators fiscal. The permanent
adviser to the Lord Advocate on prosecution matters is the Crown Agent who is
head of the procurator fiscal service and is assisted by a staff of civil servants
known as the Crown Office. Prosecutions in the High Court of Justiciary are
prepared by the Crown Office while crimes tried before the sheriff and district
courts are prosecuted by the procurators fiscal who are lawyers and full-time
civil servants. The police investigate offences known to them and report to the
procurator fiscal who decides whether or not to prosecute, subject to the
discretion and control of the Crown Office.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland, who is responsible to
the Attorney General, prosecutes all offences tried on indictment, and may do
so in summary cases of a serious nature. Other summary offences are prosecuted
by the police.
Magistrates’ courts deal with about 98 per cent of criminal cases in England and
Wales, and conduct preliminary investigations into the more serious offences.
The Crown Court, situated in a number of towns and cities, takes all criminal
work above the level of magistrates’ courts.
Magistrates’ courts hear and determine charges against people accused of
‘summary offences’, that is those that can be legally disposed of by magistrates
sitting without a jury. There are some 700 courts and some 24,000 magistrates.
Each court normally consists of a bench of three lay unpaid magistrates whose
function is to ascertain the facts of a case and apply the law to them. The
Io6 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
magistrates are advised on points of law and procedure by a clerk to the justices
(or an assistant) who is normally legally qualified and who is also in charge of
the court’s administrative arrangements. Magistrates are appointed by the Lord
Chancellor.
In inner London and some other large urban areas where the pressure of work
is heavy and continuous there are also professional ‘stipendiary’ magistrates who
are full-time, salaried and legally qualified. They usually preside alone.
Magistrates must as a rule sit in open court, but when they make preliminary
inquiries into a more serious case to see whether there is sufficient evidence to
justify committal for trial in the Crown Court the proceedings must not be
reported in the press at the time except at the defendant’s request, unless the
person is discharged by the magistrates.
Magistrates cannot usually impose a sentence of more than six months’
imprisonment or a fine exceeding £1,000. If an offence carries a higher maxi¬
mum penalty, they may commit the offender for sentence to the Crown Court if
they consider their own power inadequate.
Cases involving people under the age of 17 are heard in juvenile courts. These
are specially constituted magistrates’ courts which sit either in a different room
or building from other courts, or at a different time; only limited publicity is
allowed. If a young person under the age of 17 is charged jointly with someone
of 17 or over, the case is heard in the ordinary magistrates’ court. If the young
person is found guilty, that court may remit the case to a juvenile court, unless it
wishes to dispose of the case by penalty.
The Crown Court The Crown Court is responsible for trials of the more serious cases, the senten¬
cing of offenders committed for sentence by magistrates’ courts, and appeals
from magistrates’ courts. It has about 90 centres and is served by High Court
judges, full-time ‘circuit judges’ and part-time recorders. All contested trials in
the court take place before a jury. A High Court judge sits alone for the most
serious cases. A circuit judge or recorder sits with between two and four
magistrates for appeals and committals for sentence from magistrates’ courts and
may sit with magistrates to try the less important cases.
The Crown Court may impose a fine of any amount on a convicted offender
and, within the maximum penalty determined for the offence by Parliament,
any other custodial or non-custodial penalty.
In 1978 the Crown Court tried 80,000 people; 49,500 pleaded guilty to at
least one charge and 25,850 not guilty to all charges. About a half of defendants
pleading not guilty to all counts were acquitted.
Appeals A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may appeal to the Crown Court
against the sentence imposed and, if he contested his guilt, against the con¬
viction. Where the appeal is on a point of law, either the prosecutor or the
defendant may appeal from the magistrates’ court to the High Court, which sits
in London and some regional centres (see pp 94-5). Appeals from the Crown
Court, either against conviction or against sentence, are usually made to the
Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). A further appeal from the Court of
Appeal to the House of Lords can be brought if the court certifies that a point of
law of general public importance is involved and it appears to the court or the
House of Lords that the point is one that ought to be considered by the House.
A prosecutor or defendant may appeal to the House of Lords from a decision of
the High Court in a criminal case.
The Attorney General may seek the opinion of the Court of Appeal on a point
of law which has arisen in a case where a person tried on indictment is acquitted;

the court has power to refer the point to the House of Lords if necessary. The
acquittal in the original case is not affected, nor is the identity of the acquitted
person revealed without his consent.
There are three criminal courts: the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff court
and the district court. The High Court tries serious crimes such as murder,
treason and rape while the sheriff court is concerned with less serious offences
and the district court with minor offences.
Criminal cases are heard either under solemn procedure, when proceedings
are taken on indictment and the judge sits with a jury of 15 members, or under
summary procedure, when the judge sits without a jury. All cases in the High
Court of Justiciary and the more serious ones in the sheriff courts are tried by
a judge and jury. Proceedings are taken under summary procedure in the less
serious cases in the sheriff courts, and in the district courts.
A government committee is considering the effect on the criminal courts and
the prosecution system of the volume of minor offences dealt with by summary
prosecution and whether some other process could be devised to deal with such
offences while maintaining safeguards for accused persons.
District courts are the administrative responsibility of the district and islands
local authorities (see p 60). The judges are lay justices of the peace including
up to one-quarter of the membership of district and islands authorities who may
be nominated as ex officio justices. In Glasgow there are three stipendiary
magistrates who are full-time salaried lawyers.
Scotland is divided into six sheriffdoms which are further divided into sheriff
court districts, each of which has a sheriff who is the judge of the court.
The High Court of Justiciary is Scotland’s supreme criminal court. It is both a
trial court and an appeal court. Any one of the following judges is entitled to try
cases in the High Court: the Lord Justice General (the head of the court), the
Lord Justice Clerk (the judge next in seniority) or one of the Lord Com¬
missioners of Justiciary who preside at sessions of the court in other towns. The
main seat of the court is in Edinburgh where all appeals are heard.
All appeals are dealt with by the High Court of Justiciary. In both solemn and
summary procedure, an appeal may be brought against conviction, or sentence,
or both. The High Court cannot order a retrial if it sets aside a conviction.
Appeals are heard by three or more judges; there is no further appeal to the
House of Lords.
Children under 16 years (and in some cases people between 16 and 18) who
have committed an offence or are considered to need compulsory care may be
brought before an informal children’s hearing comprising three members of the
local community (see p 115).
The structure of the courts in Northern Ireland is broadly similar to that of
England and Wales. The day-to-day work of dealing summarily with minor
local cases is carried out by magistrates’ courts presided over by a full-time
resident magistrate appointed from the legal profession by the Queen, on the
recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. Young offenders under 17 years and
young people under 17 who need care, protection and control are dealt with by
juvenile courts consisting of the resident magistrate and two lay members (at

least one of whom must be a woman) with special qualifications for dealing with
juveniles. Appeals from magistrates’ courts are dealt with by the county court.
The Crown Court in Northern Ireland is responsible for dealing with all trials on
indictment of criminal cases. It is divided into four circuits and is served by
High Court and county court judges. Proceedings in the Crown Court are heard
before a single judge: and all contested cases, other than those involving
scheduled offences under emergency legislation, take place before a jury.
Appeals from the Crown Court, either against conviction or sentence, lie to the
Northern Ireland Court of Appeal. Procedures for a further appeal to the House
of Lords are similar to those in operation in England and Wales.
All criminal trials in the United Kingdom take the form of a contest between the
prosecution and the defence. Since the criminal law presumes the innocence of
the accused until guilt has been proved, the prosecution is not granted any
advantage, apparent or real, over the defence. A defendant has the right to
employ a legal adviser and in certain circumstances may be granted legal aid
wholly or partly from public funds. If remanded in custody, the person may be
visited in prison by a legal adviser to ensure that a defence is properly prepared.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland during the preparation of the case, the
prosecution usually informs the defence of any relevant documents which it is
not proposed to put in evidence and discloses them if asked to do so. The
prosecution should also inform the defence of any witnesses whose evidence
may assist the accused and whom the prosecution does not propose to call. The
defence or prosecution may suggest that the mental state of the defendant is
such that he or she is unfit to be tried. A jury must decide whether or not this is
so. If they find that it is, the defendant is admitted to a hospital specified by the
Home Secretary in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland to one specified
by a health and social services board (see p 126).
Criminal trials in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are
normally held in open court and the rules of evidence (which are concerned with
the way facts may be proved and what facts may not be proved) are rigorously
applied. If evidence is admitted in contravention of the law, a conviction can be
quashed on appeal.
During the trial the defendant has the right to hear and subsequently to cross-
examine (normally through his lawyer) all the witnesses for the prosecution; to
call his or her own witnesses who, if they will not attend voluntarily may be
legally compelled to attend; and to address the court either in person or through
a lawyer—the defence having the right to the last speech at the trial. More¬
over, the defendant cannot be questioned without consenting to be sworn as a
witness in his or her own defence. When he or she does testify, cross-examination
about character or other conduct may be made only in exceptional circum¬
stances and generally the prosecution may not introduce evidence of such
matters. Although confessions made in the course of previous judicial proceed¬
ings are admissible as evidence if they have been made upon oath, no con¬
fessions made in any other circumstances are admitted unless it can be proved
that they were made voluntarily.
In jury trials the judge determines questions of law, sums up the evidence for
the benefit of the jury, and discharges the accused or passes sentence. Only
the jury decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. If the jury cannot
reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may direct it to bring in a majority verdict

provided that, in the normal jury of 12 people, there are not more than two
dissentients. If the jury returns a verdict of ‘not guilty’, the prosecution has no
right of appeal against the verdict and the defendant cannot be tried again for
the same offence. From a verdict of ‘guilty’ there is a right of appeal by the
defendant to the appropriate court.
A jury is completely independent of the judiciary. Once members are sworn
in, they are protected from interference of any kind. Both the prosecution and
the defence can object to particular jurors. In England, Wales and Northern
Ireland people whose names appear on the electoral register are liable for jury
service; in Scotland, where the minimum age for jurors is 21, not all those on the
register are eligible to serve as the minimum voting age is 18.
At summary trials in Scotland accused people are asked to plead to the charge
at the first calling of the case and, if they plead guilty, the court may dispose of
the case. Where the plea is ‘not guilty’, the court may proceed to trial at once or,
more usually, may appoint a later date.
In Scottish trials on indictment, the first ‘pleading’ proceedings take place in
the sheriff court, when the accused person is called upon to plead guilty or not
guilty. If the plea is not guilty, the case is continued to the second ‘trial’ proceed¬
ings in the appropriate court. If the plea is guilty, and the case is to be dealt
with in the sheriff court, the sheriff may dispose of it at once. If it is a High Court
case, it is continued to the second proceedings for disposal.
The trial proceedings are held at least nine days after the pleading proceed¬
ings, either before the sheriff or the High Court, with a jury of 15. Evidence is
presented without opening speeches, and there are closing speeches for the
prosecution and for the defence, followed by the judge’s charge to the jury. The
jury may return a verdict of ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’, both of which result in
acquittal, or they may find the accused ‘guilty’, in which case the court proceeds
to deliver sentence. The verdict may be by a simple majority. With a few minor
exceptions, no person may be convicted without the evidence of at least two
witnesses, or corroboration of one witness by facts and circumstances which
clearly implicate the accused in the crime.
Most of the work of coroners’ courts involves the investigation of violent and
unnatural deaths or of sudden deaths where the cause is unknown. Cases may be
brought to the notice of the local coroner (a senior lawyer or doctor appointed by
local government) by doctors, the police, various public authorities or members
of the public, and it is the coroner’s duty to hold an inquiry into how, when and
where the deceased died. If the death is a sudden one of which the cause is
unknown, the coroner need not hold an inquest in court, but may order a post¬
mortem examination to determine cause of death. Where there is reason to
believe that the deceased died a violent or unnatural death or died in prison or in
other circumstances provided for by statute, the coroner must hold an inquest.
In Scotland the office of coroner does not exist. The local procurator fiscal
inquires privately into all sudden and suspicious deaths in his district and may
report the result of his inquiries to the Crown Agent.
Coroners in Northern Ireland are mostly senior lawyers and are appointed by
the Lord Chancellor; the work of their courts is similar to that of coroners’
courts in England and Wales.
Courts Martial
Courts martial have jurisdiction over serving members of the armed forces and in
certain circumstances over their dependants and other civilians who accompany
them overseas. The courts do not deal with certain serious offences if

committed in the United Kingdom, such as treason, murder, manslaughter, and
rape which are dealt with in the ordinary courts.
OFFENDERS1, °F WhUe custodial treatment is an important part of British penal practice, it is
only one of several ways to deal with people who break the law.
Sentencing The criminal courts’ discretion to select the sentence most appropriate for an
offender is modified by statutory provisions designed to ensure that prison
sentences are kept to a minimum. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a
person who has not previously served a custodial sentence of a particular kind
may not be sentenced to custodial treatment of that kind unless he or she is
legally represented or has chosen not to be, and in the case of imprisonment
unless the court is satisfied that no other sentence will suffice. In England and
Wales, extended sentences longer than the normal maximum term may be
imposed on persistent offenders. In the case of murder there is a mandatory
penalty of life imprisonment. This is the maximum penalty for a number of
serious offences such as robbery, rape, arson and manslaughter. A few rare
serious offences, such as treason, carry the death penalty but it is not mandatory.
In Scotland, unless the sentence is limited by statute, the maximum penalty is
determined by the status of the court trying the accused. In trials on indictment,
the High Court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for any term up to life
and the Sheriff Court, up to two years. In summary cases, the sheriff may
impose up to six months’ imprisonment.
Non-Custodial Non-custodial treatment includes fines; probation; absolute or (in England,
Treatment Wales and Northern Ireland) conditional discharge for up to three years (one
year in Northern Ireland)—a discharge being made when the court feels that
there is no need to impose punishment on a convicted person; and ‘binding
over’ where the offender is required to pledge money, with or without sureties,
to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
In England and Wales, offenders aged 17 or over who are convicted of
imprisonable offences can, with their consent, be given community service
orders. Between 40 and 240 hours’ unpaid service to be completed within 12
months, may be ordered. Examples of work done include decorating the houses
of old or disabled people and building adventure playgrounds for children. Com¬
munity service schemes have begun in Scotland and in Northern Ireland.
The sentence imposed on an offender in England, Wales and Northern Ireland
may also, with his or her consent, be deferred for up to six months to enable a
court to arrive at the most appropriate sentence, taking into account conduct
after, for instance, some expected change in circumstances.
The courts may order a convicted offender to pay compensation for any
personal injury, loss or damage resulting from an offence. In cases where the
loss amounts to ,£15,000 or more they may make a criminal bankruptcy order
against an offender. In Scotland a committee has reported to the Secretary of
State and the Lord Advocate on the question of the potential role of the criminal
court in ordering reparation by the offender to the victim.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland a judge is free to pass a suspended
sentence of not more than two years. The sentence is not served by the offender
unless he or she is convicted of a further offence punishable with imprisonment;
in that event the suspended sentence normally takes effect and another sentence
may be imposed for the new offence. An offender receiving a suspended sentence
of more than six months may be made subject to supervision by a probation
officer for all or part of the period. The Criminal Law Act 1977 provided the
JUSTICE AND THE LAW
III
Probation
Prisons
courts in England and Wales with power, when passing a sentence of between
six months’ and two years’ imprisonment, to order that part should be served
and the rest held in suspense, the suspended part being not less than one quarter
nor more than three quarters of the whole. This provision has not yet, however,
been brought into force.
In certain circumstances courts may order forfeiture of property involved in
the commission of crime. An offender convicted of a serious crime may be
disqualified from driving if a motor vehicle was used in its commission.
In most circumstances, a person convicted of a criminal offence need not
disclose it, and the offence will not be held against him or her after a rehabilitation
period of from six months to ten years depending on the nature of the sentence
imposed. This does not apply to those who have received a prison sentence of
more than 2^ years.
Probation is designed to secure the rehabilitation of an offender, who continues
to live an ordinary life under the supervision of a probation officer. The officer’s
duty is to advise, assist and befriend the probationer. Before making a pro¬
bation order (which lasts for between six months and three years), the court
must explain its effects and make sure that the probationer understands that
failure to comply with its requirements will make him or her liable to be dealt with
again for the original offence. An order can be made only if the offender is 17
years of age or over (14 in Northern Ireland) and must have his or her consent;
it usually requires the probationer to keep in regular touch with the probation
officer, to be of good behaviour and to lead an industrious life. It may also require
the offender to live in a specified place, or in certain circumstances to receive
psychiatric treatment.
In England and Wales the probation service is administered locally by
probation and after-care committees consisting of local magistrates and co¬
opted members with legal and specialist interests. In Northern Ireland it is
administered by the Northern Ireland Office. Probation officers are usually
members of small teams, although each has a large measure of independence in
his or her casework with an offender.
Probation and after-care committees may, with the approval of the Home
Secretary, provide and maintain day training centres (which offenders may be
required to attend for up to 60 days), bail hostels, probation hostels and other
establishments for use in the rehabilitation of offenders. The service is also
responsible for administering the community service scheme.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the services of probation and
after-care officers are available to every criminal court. In Scotland, offenders
subject to probation orders or to after-care supervision are supervised by
specially approved local authority social workers.
Although the courts have made proportionately less and less use of prison as a
penalty for criminal activity, there has been an increase in the prison population
as a result of the rise in crime. In 1978 the average number of people in prisons,
borstals, and detention centres was about 41,800 in England and Wales and
4,870 in Scotland; there are 113 prison service establishments and the size of
the prison service in 1978 was 22,277. The Government is studying a committee
of inquiry’s report on Britain’s prison services published in October 1979.
Prisons to which offenders may be committed directly by a court are known as
‘local prisons’; all are closed establishments. Other prisons, which may be open
or closed, receive prisoners on transfer from local prisons (open prisons do not
have physical barriers to prevent escape). Sentenced prisoners in England and

Wales are classified into four groups for the purposes of security. Separate
prisons cater for women prisoners.
People awaiting trial are entitled to privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners and, as far as practicable, are separated from convicted prisoners.
Prisoners under 21 are separated from older prisoners.
Many British prisons were built during the nineteenth century and are un¬
satisfactory by modern standards. Overcrowding is also a problem. However, a
number of new prisons have been built in the past few years, and existing
establishments are being redeveloped and modernised.
All prisoners in Great Britain serving a determinate sentence of more than one
month, except those sentenced to imprisonment for life, are allowed remission
of one-third of their sentence provided that this does not reduce the sentence
to less than 31 days (in Scotland, 30 days). Remission may be forfeited for
serious misconduct in prison. In addition, prisoners serving fixed sentences of
more than 18 months become eligible for consideration for release on parole
after serving one-third of their sentence or 12 months, whichever expires
later.
The parole licence remains in force until the date on which the prisoner
would have been released had not parole been granted. The licence prescribes
the conditions with which the offender must comply when on parole. About
9 per cent of prisoners granted parole in England and Wales in 1978 were
recalled to prison.
Prisoners serving life sentences are also eligible for release on licence, after
consultation with the judiciary and on the recommendation of the Parole Board.
Those released in this way remain on licence for the rest of their lives and are
subject to recall at any time should the circumstances warrant it.
In Northern Ireland, where there is no parole scheme, prisoners receive one-
half remission on determinate sentences, provided that remission does not
reduce the sentence to below 31 days. For those serving over a year, a court can
order all or part of the outstanding balance of the remitted period to be served
in the event of reconviction for an imprisonable offence in the remitted period,
in addition to any penalty imposed for a further offence.
The aims of prison industries are to give inmates work experience which will
assist them when released and to secure an economic return which will reduce
the cost of the prison system to public funds. The main industries are clothing
and textile manufacture, engineering, woodwork, laundering, electro-mechanical
production, farming and horticulture. Most production caters for internal needs
and for other public services but a considerable volume is for the commercial
market. A few prisoners are employed outside prison. Small payments are made
to inmates for the work they do; in some prisons, incentive schemes provide an
opportunity for higher earnings on the basis of output and skill.
Education for those in custody is financed by the prison service and provided
by the local education authorities. Every prison department establishment in
England and Wales has an education officer assisted by a team of full-time and
part-time teachers. Education is compulsory for young offenders below school
leaving age. Some prisoners study for public examinations (including those of
the Open University). Within the resources available there is teaching in
recreational and leisure pursuits.
Physical education is voluntary for adults but those under 21 have to attend a
certain number of classes. Many establishments, however, do not have the

proper facilities. In Northern Ireland the prison population has increased in
recent years and industrial and educational facilities are being expanded on the
same lines as those in the rest of Britain.
Education and vocational training are provided by the Prison Education
Service.
The prison medical service has a general responsibility for the physical and
mental health of all those in custody. Each establishment has accommodation
for sick people and there are some larger prison hospitals (some with up to 100
beds) to which patients can be transferred if necessary. Four prisons have
surgical units and patients can also be transferred to hospitals within the
National Health Service. There is one specialist psychiatric prison and some
other centres in the prison service where patients can receive psychiatric care.
In some establishments there is special treatment for alcoholics.
Prison psychologists are involved in the evaluation of treatment programmes
and regimes, contribute to the management and treatment of individuals and
groups, take part in advisory and training work with prison staff, and clinically
examine selected inmates.
All prisoners have a general right to write and receive letters and to be visited by
their relatives at regular intervals. They have such privileges as a personal radio,
books, periodicals and newspapers, and the right to make purchases from the
canteen with money they have earned in prison. Depending on the facilities
available, they may be granted the further privileges of dining and recreation in
association and watching television in the evening.
Breaches of discipline are dealt with by the prison governor, or by the board
of visitors (visiting committee in Scotland), who have power to order, among
other penalties, forfeiture of remission and forfeiture of privileges. Boards of
visitors consist of lay people, two of whom must be magistrates.
The welfare of prisoners is the general concern of all the prison staff. Much of
this work is the responsibility of probation officers (in Scotland social workers)
stationed in prisons who help prisoners in their relations with individuals and
agencies outside and make plans for after-care on release.
Prisoners may also receive visits from specially appointed prison visitors
whose work is voluntary.
Chaplains give spiritual help and advice to inmates and are increasingly
involved in management decisions affecting their needs and quality of life. A
chaplain of the Church of England (in Scotland of the Church of Scotland, and
in Northern Ireland of the Church of Ireland and of the Presbyterian Church), a
Roman Catholic priest and a Methodist minister are appointed to every prison.
Ministers of other denominations are appointed or specially called in as
needed.
All prisons in England and Wales arrange pre-release preparations for prisoners.
Those serving sentence of four years or more are considered for outside employ¬
ment for a period before release. If selected, work is found outside the prison for
about the last six months of sentence; during the period prisoners may live in a
separate part of the prison or in a hostel outside. Normal wages are paid so that
they can resume support for their families.
Periods of home leave may be granted in the last nine months of sentence to
those serving two years or more to assist their resettlement.

After-care
Children in
Trouble
England and
Wales
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The aim of after-care, run by the probation and after-care service, is to assist
offenders on return to society by offering the help of skilled case workers.
Compulsory supervision by probation officers is given to offenders under 21
when released, adult offenders released on parole, and those released on licence
from a sentence of life imprisonment. A voluntary system is offered to the
remainder. After-care is also provided by a number of voluntary societies,
most of which are members of the National Association for the Care and
Resettlement of Offenders. Hostels and other forms of accommodation are
provided, often with some financial help from the Home Office.
In England and Wales no child under ten years can be held guilty of any offence.
A child aged ten to 16 years who is alleged to have committed an offence may be
the subject of criminal proceedings or of ‘care’ proceedings, both of which are
normally held before juvenile courts (see p 106).
In care proceedings the fact that a child is found guilty of an offence is not
in itself sufficient justification for the making of an order; the court must also
be of the opinion that the child is in need of care or control which he or she is
unlikely to receive unless an order is made. In criminal proceedings a court may
make a care order without the need to consider whether the child is in need of
care or control; this applies to a child found guilty of an offence (other than
homicide) punishable in the case of an adult by imprisonment.
A number of orders are available to courts in both care and criminal pro¬
ceedings. A care order commits the child to the care of the local authority, so
that the authority becomes responsible for deciding where the child should be
accommodated, for example, with foster parents or in a community home (see
P i36)* The care order must be reviewed every six months by the authority,
and can be ended at any time by the court; normally it expires when the child
reaches 18 or 19. For children who are too severely disturbed or disruptive to be
treated in other child care homes, ‘youth treatment centres’ are provided by the
Department of Health and Social Security.
Under a supervision order (usually valid for three years or less) a child
normally remains at home under the supervision of a local authority social
worker or a probation officer. He or she may be required to undergo ‘inter¬
mediate treatment’ which is a compromise between measures involving complete
removal from home and those which do not. It consists of participation under a
supervisor in a variety of constructive and remedial activities through a short
residential course or, more usually, attendance at a day or evening centre. An
intermediate treatment fund, administered by the Rainer Foundation with the
help of government finance, has been created to give grants to individuals,
groups or organisations willing to provide intermediate treatment facilities.
A court may also order a parent or guardian to enter into recognisances to take
proper care of the child and to exercise proper control over him or her; such an
order may only be made with the consent of the parent or guardian. In care
proceedings, the court may order a stay in hospital in accordance with the
mental health legislation.
The courts may also order payments of compensation, or impose fines or
grant a conditional or absolute discharge. Offenders, both male and female, may
be ordered to spend a total of (normally) 12 to 24 hours of their spare time on
Saturdays at an attendance centre (up to three hours on any one occasion). The
centres are for those found guilty of offences for which older people could be
sentenced to imprisonment, and provide physical training and instruction in
handicrafts or some other practical subject. For boys aged 14 or over courts
may make a detention centre order (see p 115), and young people of 15 and

over may be committed to the Crown Court with a view to passing a sentence
of borstal training. In the case of a very serious crime, detention in a place
approved by the Home Secretary may be ordered by the Crown Court.
In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight years but prosecution of
children in the criminal courts is rare and can take place only on the instructions
of the Lord Advocate; court proceedings usually apply only to very serious
offences such as murder or assault. Instead children under 16 years who have
committed an offence or need care and protection may be brought before an
informal children’s hearing which decides the most appropriate measures of care
and treatment (see p 136). An official ‘reporter’ decides whether a child should
come before a hearing. If the grounds for referral are not accepted by the child
and parents, the case goes to the sheriff court (sitting in its civil capacity) for
proof. It can then come back to the hearing. The sheriff also decides appeals
against a decision of a children’s hearing.
The age of criminal responsibility in Northern Ireland is ten. Children aged 16
and under charged with committing a criminal offence may be brought before a
juvenile court. If found guilty of an offence punishable by imprisonment in the
case of an adult, the child may be sent to a training school, placed in the care of a
‘fit person’, possibly the area Health and Social Services Board or under super¬
vision. Alternatively the court can order a period of attendance at an attendance
centre or a remand home, or impose a fine or compensation. A conditional or
absolute discharge is also possible. Whatever other order it makes, a juvenile
court can also require the parents to enter into a recognizance as security for the
child’s good behaviour. Young people aged 16 or over may be given a sentence
of borstal training. Children brought before the courts in need of care and
protection may be placed in care locally. The law relating to young offenders
and the care of children is under review.
Offenders aged 17 to 20 years are recognised as a category distinct from juvenile
and adult offenders. The main non-custodial measures are generally the same
as those used in dealing with adults. The custodial sentences available are:
detention in a detention centre, borstal training and imprisonment.
Some 12 senior detention centres provide a means of treating young male
offenders (age 17-21) in Great Britain for whom a long period of residential
training away from home does not seem necessary or justified by the offence,
but who need to be taught respect for the law through some form of custody.
There are also six junior centres for boys aged 14 to 16 years. The normal period
of detention is three months but in England and Wales there is power to award
up to six months and, exceptionally, nine months. Life in a centre demands the
highest standards of discipline and achievement. Training comprises a normal
working week of 40 hours, including an hour each day of physical training, with
considerable attention paid to education. After discharge, all offenders are super¬
vised for a year. An experimental project for stricter and shorter sentences is to
take place at two senior detention centres in England.
Borstal training is remedial and educational, based on personal training by
carefully selected staff. Emphasis is placed on vocational training in skilled
trades. There is much freedom of movement and many borstals are open
establishments. Offenders are placed as near their homes as possible in order to
maintain their ties with the local community. The training system is available
to offenders aged 15 to 20 years (16 to 20 years in Scotland and Northern
Ireland). Courts rarely order borstal training unless they have already tried

fines, probation or detention centre training, perhaps all three. The training
period usually ranges from six months to two years and is followed by super¬
vision in the community.
A person under 17 years cannot be sentenced to imprisonment in England
and Wales, and no court may pass a sentence of imprisonment on an offender
aged 17 to 20 years unless satisfied that no other penalty is appropriate. A court
cannot impose a sentence of between six months and three years unless the
offender has already served a term of borstal training or at least six months’
imprisonment. Sentences of up to two years may be ordered by a court to be
suspended. Prisoners under the age of 21 at the time of their sentence are classified
as ‘young prisoners’, and generally serve their sentences separately from older
prisoners unless they are reclassified as adults and treated as such in an adult
prison. In Scotland no offender under 21 years may be sent to prison; where
neither borstal nor detention training is suitable for an offender aged 16 to 20
years, detention in a special ‘young offenders’ institution may be ordered.
Custodial sentences for young adult offenders are under review. The Govern¬
ment has announced its intention of amending legislation limiting prison
sentences on young offenders. It also intends to give magistrates more clearly
defined powers when making residential and secure care orders.
CIVIL JUSTICE
The main sub-divisions of the civil law of England, Wales and Northern Ireland
are: family law, the law of property, the law of contract and the law of torts
(covering injuries suffered by one person at the hands of another irrespective of
any contract between them and including such concepts as negligence, defama¬
tion and trespass). Other branches of the civil law include constitutional and
administrative law (particularly concerned with the use of executive power),
industrial law, maritime law and ecclesiastical law. Scottish civil law has its
own, often analogous, branches.
The limited civil jurisdiction of magistrates’ courts extends to matrimonial
proceedings for custody and maintenance orders, adoption orders and affiliation
and guardianship orders. The courts also have jurisdiction concerning nuisances
under the Public Health Acts and the recovery of rates. Committees of magis¬
trates license public houses, betting shops and clubs.
The jurisdiction of the 300 or so county courts covers, for instance, actions
founded upon contract and tort (with minor exceptions) where the amount
claimed is not more than £2,000; trust and mortgage cases, where the amount
does not exceed £15,000; and actions for the recovery of land where the net
annual value for rating does not exceed £2,000. Cases outside these limits may
be tried in the county court by consent of the parties, or may in certain circum¬
stances be transferred from the High Court to the county court.
Other matters dealt with by the county courts include hire purchase, the
Rent Acts, landlord and tenant and adoption cases. In addition, undefended
divorce cases are heard and determined in county courts designated as divorce
county courts (defended cases are transferred to the High Court) and outside
London bankruptcies are dealt with in certain county courts. The courts also
deal with complaints of race and sex discrimination in education and the pro¬
vision of goods, facilities, services and premises (see p 135). Where small claims
are concerned (especially those for less than £200 involving consumers), there
are special facilities for arbitration and simplified procedures.

JUSTICE AND THE LAW 117
All judges of the Supreme Court (comprising the Court of Appeal, the
Crown Court and the High Court) and all circuit judges and recorders have
power to sit in the county courts, but each court has one or more circuit judges
assigned to it by the Lord Chancellor, and the regular sittings of the court are
mostly taken by them. The judge normally sits alone, although on the request of
a party the court may, in exceptional cases, order a trial with a jury.
The High Court of Justice is divided into the Chancery Division, the Queen’s
Bench Division and the Family Division. Its jurisdiction, which is both original
and appellate and covers all civil and some criminal cases, is vested in all its
divisions. In general, particular types of work are assigned to a particular
division. The Family Division, for instance, is concerned with all jurisdiction
affecting the family, including that relating to adoption and guardianship of
children. The Chancery Division deals with the interpretation of wills and the
administration of estates. Maritime and commercial law is the responsibility of
admiralty and commercial courts of the Queen’s Bench Division.
There are 75 High Court judges, each of whom is attached to one division on
appointment but may be transferred to any other division during his term of
office. The Lord Chancellor is president of the Court of Appeal and of the
Chancery Division—the administration of the Chancery Division being the
responsibility of the senior judge known as the Vice-Chancellor. The Queen’s
Bench Division is presided over by the Lord Chief Justice of England, who
ranks next to the Lord Chancellor in the legal hierarchy, and the Family Division
is headed by the President. Outside London (where the High Court sits at the
Royal Courts of Justice) sittings are held at 23 Crown Court centres.
For the hearing of cases at first instance, High Court judges sit singly.
Appellate jurisdiction in civil matters from inferior courts is exercised by courts
of two (or sometimes three) judges, or by single judges of the appropriate
division, nominated by the Lord Chancellor.
Appeals in matrimonial proceedings heard by magistrates’ courts go to a
divisional court of the Family Division of the High Court. Affiliation appeals
are heard by the Crown Court, as are appeals from decisions of the licensing
committees of magistrates. Appeals from the High Court and the county courts
are heard in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) and may (with leave of the
court or of the House of Lords) go on to the House of Lords, which is the
ultimate court of appeal in civil cases.
The ex officio members of the Court of Appeal are the Lord Chancellor, the
Lord Chief Justice, the President of the Family Division and the Master of the
Rolls; the ordinary members are 17 Lords Justices of Appeal.
The judges in the House of Lords are the nine Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
who must have a quorum of three, but usually sit as a group of five, and some¬
times even of seven. Lay peers do not attend the hearing of appeals (which
normally take place in a committee room and not in the legislative chamber),
but peers who hold or have held high judicial office may also sit. The president
of the House in its judicial capacity is the Lord Chancellor, and proceedings take
the form of the normal proceedings of the House; judgments are given as
speeches to a motion, and the decision is in the form of a vote.
The main civil courts are the sheriff courts and the Court of Session.
The civil jurisdiction of the sheriff court extends to most kinds of action and is
normally unlimited by the value of the case. Much of the work is done by the
n8

sheriff, against whose decisions an appeal may be made to the sheriff-principal
or directly to the Court of Session.
The Court of Session sits only in Edinburgh, and has jurisdiction to deal with
all kinds of action, subject to a few exceptions. The main exception is an action
exclusive to the sheriff court, namely one where the value claimed is less than
j£500- The Court of Session has sole jurisdiction in divorce and certain other
actions. The court is divided into two parts: the Outer House, a court of first
instance, and the Inner House, which is mainly an appeal court. The Inner
House is divided into two divisions of equal status, each consisting of four
judges—the first division being presided over by the Lord President and the
second division by the Lord Justice Clerk. Appeals to the Inner House may be
made from the Outer House and from the sheriff court. From the Inner House
an appeal may go to the House of Lords. The judges of the Court of Session
are the same as those of the High Court of Justiciary. The Lord President of the
Court holds the office of Lord Justice General in the High Court (see p 107).
The Scottish Land Court is a special court whose jurisdiction relates to agri¬
cultural tenancies and similar matters. It consists of a judge (ranking equally
with the judges of the Court of Session) and four laymen who are specialists in
agriculture.
Minor civil cases in Northern Ireland (where the amount in dispute is less than
f 1,000) are dealt with in county courts, though magistrates’ courts also deal with
certain classes of minor civil cases. The superior civil law court is the High
Court of Justice from which an appeal may lie to the Court of Appeal. These
two courts, together with the Crown Court, comprise the Supreme Court of
Judicature of Northern Ireland and their practice and procedure are similar to
those in the corresponding English courts. The House of Lords is the final civil
appeal court.
In England and Wales civil proceedings are instituted by the aggrieved person;
no preliminary inquiry as to the authenticity of the grievance is required.
Actions in the High Court are usually begun by a writ of summons served on
the defendant by the plaintiff, which notifies the defendant that the plaintiff
has a claim and states the nature of the claim. If the defendant intends to contest
the claim he or she informs the court. Documents setting out the precise
question in dispute (the pleadings) are then delivered to the court. County
court proceedings are initiated by a ‘request’ served on the defendant by the
court; subsequent procedure is simpler than in the High Court.
A decree of divorce must be pronounced in open court, but the special
procedure introduced for a limited class of case in 1973 and extended to most
undefended cases in 1977 dispenses with the need to give evidence in court and
provides for written evidence to be considered by the registrar.
Civil proceedings, because they are a private matter, can usually be abandoned
or compromised at any time without leave of the court—the parties to a dispute
being able to settle their differences through their solicitors before the stage of
actual trial is reached. Actions that are brought to court are usually tried by a
judge without a jury, except in cases involving claims for defamation, false
imprisonment, or malicious prosecution, when either party may insist on trial by
jury, or in a case of fraud, when the person against whom fraud is alleged may
claim this right. The jury decides questions of fact and damages awarded to the
injured party; majority verdicts may be accepted.
JUSTICE AND THE LAW

II9
Judgments in civil cases are enforceable through the authority of the court.
Most are for sums of money and may be enforced, in cases of default, by seizure
of the debtor’s goods or by attachment of earnings (a court order requiring an
employer to make periodic payments to the court by deduction from the debtor’s
wages). Other judgments can take the form of an injunction restraining someone
from performing an illegal act. Refusal to obey a judgment directing the
defendant to do something or to refrain from doing something may result in
imprisonment for contempt of court. Arrest under an order of committal may be
effected only on a warrant of the court.
The general rule is that the costs of the action (the barristers’ fees, solicitors’
charges, court fees and other payments) are in the discretion of the court.
Normally, the court orders them to be paid by the party losing the action.
In Scotland proceedings in the Court of Session or ordinary actions (of a
value exceeding £500) in the sheriff court are initiated by serving on the defender
a summons (an initial writ in the sheriff court). In Court of Session actions the
next step is the publication of the action in the court lists.
A defender who intends to contest the action must inform the court; if he or
she does not appear, the court grants a decree in absence in favour of the pursuer.
In ordinary actions in the sheriff court the defender is simply required to enter
appearance within a certain number of days after service of the initial writ, and
this is followed by a formal appearance in court by the parties to the dispute or
their solicitors.
In summary causes (actions normally of a value less than £500) in the sheriff
court the procedure is less formal. The statement of claim is incorporated in the
summons, which is a printed form obtained from the sheriff clerk. The pro¬
cedure is designed to enable most actions to be carried through without the
parties involved having to appear in court. They (or their representatives) need
appear only when an action is defended or where there is some doubt about the
method. Proceedings in Northern Ireland are similar to those in England and
Wales.
The Restrictive Practices Court is a specialised United Kingdom court which
deals with monopolies and restrictive trade practices. It comprises five judges and
up to ten other people with experience and expertise in industry, commerce or
public life.
Administrative tribunals consist of persons or bodies exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions outside the ordinary hierarchy of the courts. As a rule,
they are set up by Act of Parliament or under powers conferred by statute, which
also govern their constitution, functions and procedure.
The continuing expansion of governmental activity and involvement in the
social and economic affairs of the nation has greatly multiplied the occasions on
which the individual may find himself at issue with the administration, with a
group of people or with another individual. Consequently there has been a sub¬
stantial growth of administrative tribunals adjudicating in disputes arising under
regulatory or welfare legislation. Such tribunals include those concerned with:
land and property; national insurance; supplementary benefits; employment
rights; mental health; transport; taxation; and many which do not fall into any
specified group. Usually they consist of an uneven number of people so that a
majority decision can be reached. Members are normally appointed by the
minister concerned with the subject but other authorities (for instance, the Lord
Chancellor) have the power of appointment in appropriate cases. The Lord
Chancellor (or the Lord President of the Court of Session in Scotland) makes

appointments in most cases where a lawyer chairman or member is required.
Members usually hold office for a specified period.
There are also tribunals which enforce professional discipline (for example of
doctors and solicitors) but these are entirely different in constitution from the
statutory tribunals and have no jurisdiction over the general public.
Appeals on a point of law from all the more important tribunals may be made
in England and Wales to the High Court, in Scotland to the Court of Session
and in Northern Ireland to the Court of Appeal. An appeal may also be made to a
specially constituted appeal tribunal, to a minister of the Crown or to an inde¬
pendent referee. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, which hears appeals on
questions of law from decisions of industrial tribunals (see p 330), has High
Court and Court of Session status. The Council on Tribunals (appointed jointly
by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Advocate) exercises general supervision
over tribunals and reports on particular matters, those peculiar to Scotland
being dealt with by the Scottish Committee of the Council.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW
The United Kingdom judiciary is entirely independent of the Government and
is not subject to ministerial direction or control. There is no minister of justice.
Responsibility for the administration of justice rests with the Lord Chancellor,
the Home Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Also concerned is the Prime Minister who recommends the highest
judicial appointments to the Crown.
The Lord Chancellor is the head of the judiciary (and sometimes sits as a judge
in the House of Lords); he is concerned with court procedure, is responsible for
the administration of all courts other than magistrates’ courts, and appoints
magistrates. On the civil law side, law reform and supervision of the legal aid
and advice scheme are matters for the Lord Chancellor.
The Home Secretary is concerned with the criminal law (including law
reform), the police service, prisons and the probation and after-care service.
A general supervision over magistrates’ courts is also held with some specific
responsibilities (such as approving the appointment of justices’ clerks). On
matters relating to crime prevention and the treatment of offenders, the Home
Secretary is advised by the Advisory Council on the Penal System. Prison policy
and the administration of custodial centres are functions of the Home Office
Prison Department and the Home Secretary appoints to each centre a board of
visitors representing the local community to investigate and advise on the state
of prison premises, administration and treatment of inmates. The boards
have certain disciplinary powers in relation to serious breaches of discipline and
they hear applications or complaints from inmates. The Home Secretary is
advised by a special Parole Board on the release of prisoners on licence.
Responsibility for the treatment of offenders under the age of 17 is shared by
the Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Security.
The Home Secretary is also responsible for advising the Queen on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy to grant a free pardon in connection
with a person’s conviction, or to remit all or part of a penalty which may have
been imposed on an offender by a court.
The Secretary of State for the Environment is responsible for providing
accommodation for all the superior courts in England and Wales, except for the
Central Criminal Court, which is the responsibility of the City of London.

Crown for England and Wales, are the Government’s principal advisers on
English law, and represent the Crown in appropriate domestic and international
cases. They are senior barristers, elected members of the House of Commons
and hold ministerial posts. The Attorney General is also Attorney General for
Northern Ireland.
As well as exercising various civil law functions, the Attorney General has
ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of the criminal law; the Director of
Public Prosecutions (see p 105) is subject to the Attorney General’s super¬
intendence. The Attorney General is concerned with the institution and
prosecution of certain types of criminal proceedings, but must exercise an
independent discretion, and must not be influenced by Government colleagues.
The Solicitor General is, in effect, the deputy of the Attorney General.
The Secretary of State for Scotland recommends the appointment of all judges
other than the most senior ones, appoints the staff of the High Court of Justiciary
and the Court of Session and is responsible for the composition, staffing and
organisation of the sheriff courts. District courts are staffed and administered by
the district and islands local authorities. The Secretary of State is also responsible
for crime prevention, the police and the penal system, and is advised on parole
matters by the Parole Board for Scotland.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland are the chief legal
advisers to the Government on Scottish questions and the principal repre¬
sentatives of the Crown for the purposes of litigation in Scotland. The Lord
Advocate is closely concerned with questions of legal policy and administration
and is also responsible for the Scottish parliamentary draftsmen, and for the
public prosecution of all major crimes (see p 105).
In Northern Ireland the judiciary are appointed by the Queen on the advice of
the Lord Chancellor. The administration of all courts (including magistrates’
courts) is the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor, while the Northern Ireland
Office, under the Secretary of State, deals with the police and the penal
system.
The courts of the United Kingdom are the Queen’s Courts since the Crown is
the historic source of all judicial power. The Queen, acting on the advice of
ministers, is responsible for all appointments to the judiciary.
Full-time judges do not engage in politics, except for the Lord Chancellor, who
is head of the judiciary, speaker of the House of Lords and a Cabinet minister.
With the exception of lay magistrates, judges are normally appointed from
practising barristers (advocates in Scotland) or solicitors. Lay magistrates in
England and Wales need no legal qualifications but on appointment they undergo
a period of basic training, so that they may gain sufficient knowledge of the law,
including the rules of evidence, and may understand the nature and purpose of
sentencing. A special committee advises the Lord Chancellor on training policies.
The Scottish district court justices of the peace likewise need no legal qualifica¬
tions, and the Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible for training. In
Northern Ireland lay magistrates serving on juvenile courts undertake training
courses; resident magistrates are drawn from practising solicitors or barristers. In
certain circumstances (for instance, in cases of misconduct or proven incapacity)
judges of the inferior courts in England and Wales and Northern Ireland may
be removed from their position by the Lord Chancellor, and in Scotland, by the
Secretary of State on a report by the Lord President of the Court of Session and

the Lord Justice Clerk, by order subject to annulment by either House of
Parliament.
In order to safeguard and perpetuate the independence of the judiciary from
the executive, however, superior judges in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland (other than the Lord Chancellor who, as a Cabinet minister, changes
with the Government) are subject to a power of removal only by the Sovereign
on an address presented by both Houses of Parliament; in Scotland there is no
statutory provision for removal of judges of the Court of Session or High Court
of Justiciary from office and it is probable that special legislation would be
required to effect such a dismissal.
The legal profession is divided into two branches: barristers (advocates in
Scotland) and solicitors. Barristers are known collectively as the ‘Bar’, and
collectively and individually as ‘counsel’. Solicitors undertake legal business for
lay clients, while barristers advise on legal problems submitted through solicitors
and present cases in the higher courts although certain functions are common
to both. Although people are free to conduct their own cases, most people prefer
to be legally represented in the more serious court cases.
A Royal Commission reported in October 1979 on the provision of legal
services in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (see Bibliography). A similar
Commission is inquiring into legal services in Scotland.
In England and Wales every barrister and every student wishing to become a
barrister must be a member of one of the four Inns of Court (Lincoln’s Inn, Inner
Temple, Middle Temple and Gray’s Inn). To become a student member of an
Inn, an entrant must normally have a law degree from a United Kingdom
university or polytechnic. People with other degrees and ‘mature’ students may
also be accepted, but they must pass a diploma in law. All students must pass
the professional examinations run by the Council of Legal Education. After
training, a student can be called to the Bar, but may not practise independently
until a year’s pupillage with an established barrister has been completed. The
governing body of the profession is the Senate of the Inns of Court and the Bar.
The Bar Council (composed of those members of the Senate who are elected by
the Bar) maintains the standards and independence of the profession and
improves its services.
A prospective solicitor in England and Wales must be considered suitable by
the Council of the Law Society (the professional organisation of solicitors)
and must enter into ‘articles of clerkship’ with a practising solicitor of not less
than five years’ standing before beginning a professional career. The term of
articles lasts from two to four years, depending upon the educational qualifications
of the student. An articled clerk must pass the necessary examinations prescribed
by the Law Society and, with very few exceptions, is required to attend a course
of studies at a recognised law school. Once qualified a solicitor may become a
member of the Law Society.
In Scotland prospective advocates and solicitors undergo much the same train¬
ing. While the respective professional organisations—the Faculty of Advocates
and the Law Society of Scotland—have their own professional examinations,
candidates usually obtain exemption from them by including the necessary sub¬
jects in a law degree of a Scottish university. The prospective advocate must,
thereafter, undergo a period of training (either of 21 months or of 12 months
depending on whether or not exemption from nine months’ training has been
granted) in a solicitor’s office, followed by about nine months’ pupillage with a
practising advocate. The prospective solicitor must serve an apprenticeship of
two years in a solicitor’s office before he or she can begin a professional career.

In Northern Ireland most students wishing to become solicitors or barristers
must, after attaining a law degree, undertake a period of study at the Institute of
Professional and Legal Studies for one year before being eligible to practise.
Barristers are members of the Inn of Court of Northern Ireland; there is also a
General Council of the Bar of Northern Ireland. The professional organisation
for solicitors is the Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland.
Assistance from funds provided by the State is available to a person requiring
help in meeting the cost of legal advice and representation in court proceedings.
The State is entitled to be reimbursed from contributions which assisted people
may have to pay according to their means and costs, and damages recovered
from legally aided people’s opponents in litigation.
Where court proceedings are not involved, people with moderate means can
obtain help from a solicitor on any legal matter either free or subject to a con¬
tribution. This includes giving advice, writing letters, drafting wills and obtain¬
ing opinions from a barrister. A solicitor may act for a client until costs and
expenses reach a total of £25 (£45 for undefended divorce cases), but authority
must be obtained for this limit to be exceeded. A person seeking help has to give
the solicitor brief details about income and savings. The income limit laid down
by the scheme is reviewed at least annually.
An important development of the last decade has been the growth of law
centres in deprived urban areas providing free legal advice to people of limited
means who might not otherwise obtain it. All law centres, which are voluntary
organisations drawing their finance from various sources, including government
grants, have at least one full-time salaried lawyer and many employ community
workers. Most centres devote the largest proportion of their time to tenant-
landlord disputes and other housing problems. Free legal advice is also available
in many Citizens Advice Bureaux, consumer and housing advice centres and in
specialist advice centres run by various voluntary organisations.
Legal aid for civil proceedings is available to people whose disposable incomes
and capital fall below certain prescribed amounts,1 but a contribution is payable
according to the level of the applicant’s income; if that is below a prescribed
amount, legal aid is given free. As in the case of legal advice and assistance, the
qualifying income limits are reviewed at least once a year.
An applicant for legal aid must also show reasonable grounds for taking or
defending the proceedings. Provided the application is successful the case is
then conducted in the ordinary way, except that no money passes between the
assisted person and the solicitor—payments being made in and out of the legal
aid fund. The costs of an action which an assisted litigant loses against an
unassisted opponent may also, subject to certain conditions and if the court so
orders, be met out of the fund. Solicitors and counsel have a duty to review the
case at each stage to see that it is not being pursued unreasonably at public
expense. Legal aid is not generally available in cases where redress is sought for
alleged defamation or for representation in most proceedings in administrative
tribunals.
The civil legal aid schemes are run by the Law Society, the Law Society of
1 Assessments of disposable income and capital are made by the Supplementary Benefits
Commission and are governed by regulations which allow for deductions from gross
income for maintenance of dependants, interest on loans, income tax, rent and other
matters reasonably provided for out of income, and deductions for furniture and other
household goods from capital.

Scotland and the Incorporated Law Society of Northern Ireland, under the
general guidance respectively of the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for
Scotland and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
In criminal proceedings in England and Wales a legal aid order may be made
by the court concerned if it appears to be in the interests of justice and if a
defendant’s means are such that financial help is needed in meeting the costs of
the proceedings. An order must be made when a person is committed for trial on
a charge of murder or where the prosecutor appeals or applies for leave to appeal
from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) or the Court Martial Appeal
Court to the House of Lords. No person who is unrepresented can be given a
custodial sentence for the first time unless given the opportunity to apply for
legal aid.
Voluntary duty solicitor schemes at many magistrates’ courts provide ‘stand¬
by’ help for unrepresented defendants.
The criminal legal aid scheme in England and Wales is administered by the
courts, under the overall responsibility of the Home Secretary.
The arrangements for aid in criminal proceedings in Scotland and Northern
Ireland are broadly similar, but in Scotland there is a statutory duty solicitor
scheme for accused people in custody in sheriff, and district, court cases and the
‘interests of justice’ test applies only in summary cases.
The duty of keeping the law under review in order to ensure that it meets the
needs of modern society lies in England and Wales with the Law Reform
Committee, the Criminal Law Revision Committee and the Law Commission,
and in Scotland with the Scottish Law Commission. The Law Reform Com¬
mittee and the Criminal Law Revision Committee are standing committees of
judges and distinguished practising and academic lawyers, appointed respectively
by the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary, to examine aspects of the civil
and criminal law referred to them by the appropriate minister.
The Law Commission is a permanent body consisting of five lawyers of high
standing, charged with the duty of scrutinising the law with a view to its
systematic development and reform, including the possibility of codification,
the elimination of anomalies, the repeal of obsolete and unnecessary enactments,
and the reduction of the number of separate enactments. It reports to the Lord
Chancellor. The Scottish Law Commission, which has a constitution similar to
that of the English body and similar functions, reports to the Lord Advocate.
The work of the two commissions has led to changes in many areas of the law,
the repeal of some 950 obsolete Acts and the pruning of the contents of nearly
1,400 others.
The Law Commission is also concerned with the reform in Northern Ireland
of those branches of the law which were outside the scope of the powers of the
former Parliament of Northern Ireland. Other aspects of law reform in Northern
Ireland are dealt with by the Office of Law Reform.

The British social welfare system comprises the National Health Service, the
personal social services and social security. Education is described in Chapter
7, and housing in Chapter 9. The National Health Service supplies, largely
free, the best medical service available to all, irrespective of means. The local
authority personal social services and voluntary organisations provide advice and
help to elderly people, disabled people and children in need of care. The social
security system is designed to secure a basic standard of living for people in
financial need by providing income support during periods of inability to earn,
helping families and compensating for disablement.
Joint finance and planning between health and local authorities aims to prevent
overlapping of services and to encourage the development of community services.
In deciding their priorities, some local authorities attach greater importance
than others to the personal social services and to the various categories of people
in need of help, with the result that provision can vary from area to area.
Central government is responsible directly for the National Health Service,
administered by health authorities and boards acting as its agents, and for the
social security system. It has an indirect responsibility for the personal social
services administered by local government authorities.
Spending on social welfare in 1978 was: health £7,615 million, personal
social services £1,390 and social security £15,786 million.
NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE
The National Health Service is based upon the principle that medical care and
advice should be readily available to everyone, at little or no cost. Health services
are available largely free of charge to everyone ordinarily resident in Britain.
Visitors can also use the Service if they require immediate treatment for an
unforeseen emergency; they are expected to pay if the purpose of their visit is
to seek treatment. There are reciprocal health arrangements with some countries
(see p 133). The Service is administered by appointed statutory authorities and
is financed largely from general taxation; but sources of revenue include charges
for some items and a small part of the national insurance contribution (see p 138).
How far the improvements in the nation’s health over the past 30 years or so
are attributable to the Service is difficult to determine, but some changes have
been aided by the planning and provision of such a national system of care; the
advances in maternal and child care, for example, the use of vaccines for the
benefit of all sections of the community, the more efficient use of acute hospital
services (for surgery, gynaecology and childbirth), and the establishment of
primary health care teams and health centres. Like health care systems in other
countries, the National Health Service has its problems, however. They range
from regional disparities in health provision to shortages of resources and
industrial relations difficulties. An additional problem is the high cost of techno¬
logically advanced equipment required for diagnosis and treatment.
The Government has announced its intention of improving the use of available
resources within the National Health Service and of simplifying its organisation
126
ADMINISTRA¬
TION

by removing one tier of its administrative structure in England. It recognises
the need to provide a more decentralised service with local health authorities
having greater flexibility in responding to local needs. A Royal Commission on
the National Health Service reported in July 1979 (see Bibliography). Its
principal recommendations included a greater emphasis in the role of preventive
medicine, measures to simplify the administration of the Service, changes in
internal financing methods, and a review of national arrangements for negotiating
pay and settling disputes.
The health ministers—the Secretary of State for Social Services in England and
the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—are respon¬
sible for all aspects of the health services in their respective areas. Within
each of the four parts of the country the health departments (the Department of
Health and Social Security in England, the Scottish Home and Health Depart¬
ment, the Welsh Office and the Department of Health and Social Services in
Northern Ireland) are responsible for strategic planning. Area health authorities
in England and Wales and health boards in Scotland are responsible for planning
and operational control of all health services in their area. In England, because
of its greater size and population, there is an additional tier of regional authorities
responsible for regional planning and certain services best administered on a
regional basis (for example, research and major capital building work).
There are 14 regional health authorities and 90 area health authorities in
England, 8 area health authorities in Wales, 15 health boards in Scotland. The
authorities and boards, which consist of unpaid, part-time members are statutory
agencies of central government and co-operate closely with local authorities
responsible for social work, environmental health, education and other services.
In general the areas covered by area health authorities and health boards corres¬
pond with those of the major local authorities. Health and local authorities in
England, Wales and Scotland co-operate by means of joint planning arrange¬
ments and joint consultative committees.
In Northern Ireland the four health and social services boards act as agents
for the Department of Health and Social Services, spanning both health and
personal social services.
The area authorities and health boards can determine the pattern of services
best suited to their areas but have to take account of national priorities. In most
areas the day-to-day running of services is carried out by management teams in
districts which usually contain a district general hospital and have a population
of between 200,000 and 500,000, though some are considerably larger (in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland they may be much smaller, particularly in
the remoter areas). In Scotland a Common Services Agency organises certain
central services; there are similar agencies in Wales and Northern Ireland.
There is statutory provision for professional advisory committees at national,
regional and area level; the authorities have a duty to consult with these com¬
mittees. The main national advisory bodies are the Central Health Services
Council in England and Wales, the Scottish Health Service Planning Council
in Scotland and the Health and Social Services Council in Northern Ireland.
The Health Advisory Service for England and Wales reports to the Secretaries
of State on conditions in hospitals and the community health service. The
Scottish Hospital Advisory Service reports to health boards and to the Secretary
of State.
Public representation in the Service for England and Wales is provided by
community health councils. These consist of about 20 to 30 members, half of
them appointed by local government councils and the rest mainly on the
SOCIAL WELFARE
127
nomination of voluntary bodies interested in local health services. They have
access to the area health authority, the right to secure information and the right to
visit hospitals. In Scotland local health councils have been set up by the health
boards to represent the interests of the public. District committees exercise this
function in Northern Ireland.
Health Service Legislation provides for the appointment of three Health Service Commissioners
Commissioners (for England, Scotland and Wales) to investigate complaints from members
of the public about the health service. All three posts are held by the
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (see pp 34-5), whose health
service jurisdiction covers the failure of a health authority to carry out its
statutory duties, maladministration, and injustice or hardship caused by a
failure in a service. Complaints can only be considered if they are first sent to
the relevant health authority; sufficient time must be given for the authorities to
investigate the problem and reply to the complainant. Matters outside the
Commissioner’s jurisdiction include action taken solely in the exercise of clinical
judgment and the action of family practitioners (see p 128).
The Commissioner reports annually to ministers who lay the reports before
Parliament; and also publishes at regular intervals full texts of reports of
investigations without, however, naming individuals or institutions.
In Northern Ireland the Commissioner for Complaints (see p 66) investigates
complaints concerning the health service, but not the actions of medical practi¬
tioners or the professions supplementary to medicine.
Finance About 88 per cent of the cost of the health services is paid for through general
taxation; the rest is met from the National Health Service contribution paid with
the national insurance contribution and from the charges towards the cost of
certain items such as drugs prescribed by a family doctor, dental treatment and
spectacles.
The charges for medical prescriptions do not apply to children under 16 years,
expectant and nursing mothers, women aged 60 and over and men aged 65 and
over, patients suffering from certain medical conditions, war and Service
disablement pensioners (for treatment of their disability), and families with very
low incomes, including those receiving supplementary benefits and family income
supplement. Charges for dental treatment do not apply to clinical examination
only, or to people under 21 (with the exception that young people between 16
and 21 who have left school pay for dentures), pregnant women or those who
have had a baby within the last year. Children’s spectacles are free. Certain low
income groups are exempt from dental and optical charges.
A limited amount of accommodation may be made available at a small charge
for hospital patients wanting privacy as long as the accommodation is not
needed on medical grounds for non-paying patients.
Provision is also made at certain hospitals for patients to be treated as private
patients on payment of the whole cost of their accommodation and treatment.
Hospital medical staffs are salaried and can be employed full-time or part-
time. Part-time hospital doctors are free to accept private patients. General
medical practitioners are self-employed and paid by a system of fees and
allowances designed to reflect responsibilities, work load and practice expenses.
Dentists providing treatment in their own surgeries are paid on a prescribed
scale of fees according to the treatment they have carried out. Pharmacists
dispensing on their own premises are paid on the ingredient cost of the prescrip¬
tions they dispense. Ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians
taking part in the general ophthalmic service are paid approved fees for each

sight test made; opticians who dispense spectacles are paid according to the
number and type of pairs supplied.
Primary health care is in the hands of doctors, dentists, opticians and pharmacists
working within the Service as independent practitioners, and district nurses,
midwives and health visitors employed by the health authorities; a wide range
of other services is also available including the school health service, social
services and chiropody service.
The family practitioner services cover the services given to patients by doctors,
dentists, opticians and pharmacists of their own choice. They are administered
in England and Wales by family practitioner committees established by the
health authorities, in Scotland by the health boards and in Northern Ireland
by the Central Services Agency on behalf of the four health and social services
boards.
There are nearly 27,000 family doctors under contract to the National Health
Service. A doctor may not normally have more than 3,500 patients; the average
number in Great Britain is about 2,300 and in Northern Ireland 2,150. Access
to most other parts of the health service is obtained through the family doctor.
There are 949 ophthalmic medical practitioners and about 6,960 ophthalmic
and dispensing opticians engaged in the general ophthalmic services which
provide for the testing of sight and supply of spectacles. Patients requiring
treatment are dealt with through the hospital eye service.
There are over 15,530 dentists taking part in the health service.
There are about 10,670 retail pharmacies under contract to the National
Health Service with responsibility for the dispensing of prescriptions except
for the small number dispensed by hospital pharmacies and some family doctors.
District nurses give skilled nursing care to people at home or elsewhere outside
hospital; they also play an important role in preventive care and health education.
Although almost all babies are born in hospital, there is a domiciliary service
for mothers having their babies at home, with midwives and family doctors
caring for mothers and babies after birth. Midwives also assist births in hospital.
Health visitors are concerned with the health of the household as a whole and offer
an advisory service for families including those with young children and elderly
people; they undertake health teaching, assist in preventing ill-health, and work
closely with family doctors, district nurses and social workers.
Family doctors often work as members of health care teams with health visitors,
district nurses, and sometimes midwives or social workers. About four-fifths are
in partnership or group practices. About a fifth of the doctors in Great Britain
and just over a half in Northern Ireland work in some 962 modern and well-
equipped health centres built and maintained by the health authorities. At
health centres, child health services can be provided as well as facilities for
health education, family planning, speech therapy, chiropody, assessment of
hearing, physiotherapy and remedial exercises. Dental, pharmaceutical and
ophthalmic services, hospital out-patient services and supporting social work
services may also be provided.
The hospital and specialist services include district general hospitals with
treatment and diagnostic facilities for in-patients, day-patients and out-patients,
hospital maternity departments, infectious disease units, psychiatric and geriatric
facilities, rehabilitation facilities, convalescent homes and all forms of specialised

treatment. A number of specialist hospitals for mentally ill, mentally handicapped
and elderly people are also provided.
A large proportion of the hospitals in the National Health Service were built in
the nineteenth century; some trace their origins to much earlier charitable
foundations, such as the famous St. Thomas’ and St. Bartholomew’s hospitals
in London. Much has been done to improve and extend existing hospitals,
some of which are housed in inconvenient buildings, and many new hospitals
have been or are being opened. The most recent development in hospital
design is the ‘nucleus’ hospital of some 300 beds which will make a more inten¬
sive use of space and facilities; it can be used either as the first stage of a new
hospital or as an extension of an existing hospital. Building work on the first
nucleus hospital began in 1978.
The policy of recent Governments has been to concentrate acute facilities in
large district general hospitals, and to limit the role of the small hospital in acute
medicine while at the same time expanding its role in the care of the long-stay
patient, particularly the elderly. The Government intends to examine this
policy which, it considers, involves the risk of hospital services becoming too
remote from the local communities that they serve. There are 2,700 National
Health Service hospitals with nearly half a million beds and a nursing and mid¬
wifery staff of nearly 415,700 (whole time equivalent). There are over 37,260
medical staff including over 13,780 consultants.
Rehabilitation is an important part of medical care beginning at the onset of
illness or injury and aimed at helping people to live as normally as possible.
Rehabilitation is especially important for elderly, disabled and mentally-ill
people who need such help in order to become self-sufficient. Facilities are
provided in the majority of hospitals and at special centres. The work is carried
out by teams of doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, remedial gymnasts, occupa¬
tional therapists, speech therapists and social workers. The hospital departments
work closely with the Disablement Resettlement Service of the Manpower Ser¬
vices Commission (the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland).
Medical services may include the provision, free of charge, of artificial
limbs and eyes, hearing aids, surgical supports, wheelchairs, and other
appliances. Very severely physically handicapped patients may be issued with
electrical control equipment which enables them to operate devices such as
alarm bells, radio and television, a telephone, and heating. The controls are
operated by continuous depression of a microswitch or by sustained suction
through a pneumatic tube with a pipe-stem mouthpiece. Nursing aids for the
handicapped at home can be borrowed.
Social workers, home helps and occupational therapists are available to hospital
patients who, because of their illness, have difficulties on their return home.
Some 40 hospices provide care for the dying either directly in residential homes
or through the provision of nursing and other assistance in the patient’s own
home. About ten are administered entirely by the National Health Service; the
remainder, most of which receive support from public funds, are run by inde¬
pendent charitable organisations. Control of symptoms and psychological support
for patients and their families form the central features of hospice care. The
hospice movement, which is worldwide, orginated in Britain.
Treatment for narcotic drug dependence is provided mostly on an out-patient
basis in the drug treatment units provided by the National Health Service,
I3°

although some addicts have a period of in-patient treatment when necessary.
Following legislation in 1968, only doctors licensed by the Home Secretary are
allowed to prescribe heroin and cocaine for the treatment of drug addiction. (In
Northern Ireland licensing is the responsibility of the Department of Health and
Social Services.) These doctors work mainly in National Health Service treatment
centres. Doctors who are not licensed can no longer prescribe these drugs except
for the relief of pain due to organic disease or injury. All doctors must notify the
Home Secretary of any patient they consider to be addicted to certain controlled
drugs (in Northern Ireland the chief medical officer of the health department).
In addition to hospital-based facilities there are a number of non-statutory
agencies which work with and complement the Health Service provision. In 1978
an experimental short-stay residential unit for unstable young multiple drug
users was established with substantial financial support from the Department of
Health and Social Security.
Rehabilitation facilities are less commonly available and are mainly provided
by voluntary organisations, some of which receive financial help from local
authorities. Social work help is given by the probation service and local social
services departments.
The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, set up under the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971, advises ministers on a wide range of matters associated with the
prevention and treatment of drug abuse and connected social problems.
Treatment and rehabilitation for alcoholics is provided by the National Health
Service, social services and voluntary organisations. Treatment includes in¬
patient and out-patient services in general hospitals, psychiatric units and
hospitals and specialised alcoholism treatment units of which there are 34.
Primary care teams (general practitioners, nurses and social workers) play an
important part. Two experimental detoxification centres have been sponsored
by the Department of Health and Social Security.
Special pieventive health services, including free dental care, are available for
expectant and nursing mothers and young children. A feature of the service is
the education of parents before and after the birth by means of talks, discussion
groups, demonstrations and classes. Pre-school-age children receive regular
medical examination and are tested for vision, hearing, speech and language
deficiencies so that any handicap can be identified. Family planning advice and
help is provided at many clinics, and welfare foods (dried milk and vitamins) are
distributed from them.
Sick children are treated at home or in hospital as in-patients, day-patients
or out-patients. If admission to hospital is necessary, the Government encourages
health authorities to accommodate them in children’s departments under the
care of consultant paediatricians and specially trained nurses.
The school health service, which is part of the National Health Service,
organises health surveillance of school children including medical inspection
and dental inspection and treatment where appropriate. The staff of the school
health service work closely with local education authorities in the medical
assessment of handicapped children thought to need special attention.
Child guidance and child psychiatric services provide help and advice for
children with psychological or emotional problems.
Free family planning facilities are available to everyone through family planning
clinics, hospitals and a domiciliary service. Most family doctors provide a
similar service for women only.

Abortion
Blood
Transfusion
Under the Abortion Act 1967 termination of a pregnancy may take place if two
registered doctors think that its continuance would involve a greater risk to the
life of the pregnant woman (or injury to her physical or mental health or
that of any existing children in the family) than if the pregnancy were ended.
Termination may also be allowed if the two doctors think that there is a sub¬
stantial risk of the child being born with severe physical or mental abnormalities.
Abortions may be carried out in National Health Service hospitals or in premises
officially approved for the purpose. The Department of Health and Social
Security has issued guidance on counselling women with unwanted pregnancies.
The Abortion Act does not apply in Northern Ireland.
The blood transfusion service has about 2 million voluntary unpaid blood
donors. There are 19 regional transfusion centres in Britain recruiting donors and
organising donor sessions in towns and villages, factories and offices, and in
establishments maintained by the armed forces. Donors must be between the
ages of 18 and 65. The regional centres are also responsible for blood grouping
and testing, maintaining blood banks, providing a consultant service to hospitals,
teaching in medical schools, and instructing doctors, nurses and technicians.
There are four central laboratories which prepare blood products and undertake
research.

categories: emergency work dealing with sudden illness, urgent maternity
cases, and accidents of all kinds; and non-urgent work providing transport for
people needing out-patient treatment at hospitals, clinics and day hospitals.
The London Ambulance Service is probably the largest of its kind in the
world, catering for 7 million residents and non-residents in an area of 1,580 sq
km (610 sq miles). It uses over 1,000 vehicles at 75 ambulance stations and has
a staff of over 2,000. On an average day it receives 1,500 emergency calls (one call
every minute) and carries out 9,000 non-urgent patient journeys.
In some areas the ambulance service for non-urgent cases is augmented by
volunteers using their own cars.
In Scotland an air ambulance service is available in the islands off the north
and west coasts and in the remoter parts of the mainland.
In England, Wales and Northern Ireland health education is promoted by the
Health Education Council which assists in the development of programmes of
health education with the health authorities, professional organisations, voluntary
bodies and industry. Central health education services in Scotland are organised
by the Scottish Health Education Unit, which is part of the Common Services
Agency. Major themes of publicity campaigns are the encouragement of family
planning, correct diet and exercise, and warnings against cigarette smoking and
excessive consumption of alcoholic drink. Although expenditure for health
education is met largely from central government funds, the Health Education
Council is free to determine its own priorities and programme.
Within the National Health Service, medical officers advise health authorities
on health education, and specialist officers have executive responsibility.
Under the Medicines Act 1968, which came into force in 1971 and applies to
the whole of the United Kingdom, the health and agriculture ministers are
responsible for licensing the manufacture, marketing and importation of
medicines for human and veterinary use. The Medicines Commission advises

the ministers on policy regarding medicines and a Committee on Safety of
Medicines advises the health ministers on the safety, efficacy and quality of new
medicines and monitors adverse drug reactions. The Committee on Dental and
Surgical Materials gives advice on products not appropriate to the Medicines
or the Veterinary Products Committee. A review of medicines on the market
began in 1975, the health ministers being advised by the Committee on the
Review of Medicines. The Act also controls the advertising, labelling, packaging,
distribution, sale and supply of medicines.
Only people whose names are on the medical and dental registers may practise
as doctors and dentists in the National Health Service. University medical and
dental schools are responsible for teaching medical students; the National Health
Service provides hospital clinical facilities for their training. Registration as a
doctor requires five or six years’ training in medical school and hospital, with an
additional year’s experience in a hospital; for a dentist, four or more years’ train¬
ing at a dental school is required. The governing body of the medical profession
is the General Medical Council and that of the dentists is the General Dental
Council. The British Medical Association is the doctors’ main professional
association; that of the dentists is the British Dental Association.
The minimum period of hospital training required to qualify for registration
as a nurse is normally three years. Training may be in general, sick children’s,
mental or mental subnormality nursing. An enrolled nurse takes a two-year
course. The examining bodies of the nursing profession in England and Wales
and in Scotland are the general nursing councils. Midwives in England and
Wales and in Scotland must have the certificate of the appropriate Midwives
Board. The examining body for nurses and midwives in Northern Ireland is
the Northern Ireland Council of Nurses and Midwives. Most pupil midwives
are already registered general nurses or sick children’s nurses; for them the
two-year midwifery training period is reduced to one year and for other registered
and enrolled nurses to 18 months. The Royal College of Nursing and the Royal
College of Midwives are the professional bodies for nurses and midwives. Health
visitors are registered general nurses who have undergone at least the first part
of the midwifery course or obstetric nursing before taking a year’s course in
health visiting, promoted by the Council for the Education and Training of
Health Visitors. District nurses are state registered or state enrolled nurses, the
majority of whom have undertaken additional training.
A retail or hospital pharmacist must have his or her name entered in the
register maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, the governing
body of the profession; in Northern Ireland the register is maintained by the
Department of Health and Social Services on behalf of the Pharmaceutical
Society of Northern Ireland. Four years’ academic study and practical training
are necessary for registration. The dispensing of all medicines on doctors’
prescriptions and sale of certain specified medicines can be carried out only by,
or under the supervision of, a registered pharmacist.
The General Optical Council regulates the professions of ophthalmic optician
and dispensing optician; only registered ophthalmic opticians (or registered
medical practitioners) may test sight. Training of ophthalmic opticians takes
four years including a year of practical experience under supervision. Dispensing
opticians may take a two-year full-time course with a year’s practical experience
or a part-time day-release course while employed with an optician.
State registration may be obtained by chiropodists, dietitians, medical
laboratory scientific officers, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists,
radiographers and remedial gymnasts. The governing bodies are eight boards,

corresponding to the eight professions, under the general supervision of the
Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine. A professional training
lasting two to four years is needed to qualify for registration. Only members of
those professions who are state registered may be employed in the National
Health Service and some other public services.
Dental therapists (who have undergone a two-year training course) and
dental hygienists (who have undergone a training course of about a year) may
carry out some simple dental work under the direction of a registered dentist.
Britain has special health arrangements with other member States of the European
Community under which most United Kingdom nationals are entitled to
receive immediately necessary treatment in another Community country on the
same basis as insured nationals of that country. There are also reciprocal arrange¬
ments with some other countries under which similar treatment is available.
Though practically all residents in Britain use the National Health Service, a
number of people choose to pay for private consultations and treatment.
Among the major users are the families of subscribers to the provident
schemes which make provision for private health care in return for annual
subscriptions. The Government intends to introduce legislation to facilitate the
wider use of private medical care. It plans to repeal the legislation for the phasing
out of private facilities within the National Health Service introduced by the
previous administration and to examine methods of encouraging the private
sector to develop as a service complementary to the National Health Service.
Environmental health officers employed by local authorities are responsible
for the control of air pollution and noise, the inspection of offices, the investi¬
gation of unfit housing, and in some instances for refuse collection. Doctors who
specialise in community medicine and are employed by the health authorities
advise local authorities on the medical aspects of environmental health. They
may also assist the water authorities responsible for water supply and sewerage.
Environmental health officers are also stationed at ports and airports where they
carry out a range of duties concerned with shipping, inspection of imported foods
and disease control.
In Northern Ireland district councils are responsible for noise control,
collection and disposal of refuse, clean air, and food composition, labelling and
hygiene.
It is illegal to sell food which is injurious to health, unfit for human consumption,
or not of the nature, substance or quality demanded by the buyer. In England
and Wales the composition, labelling and description of food are the concern of
food and drugs authorities (county councils, London borough councils and the
City of London Corporation) while food hygiene and the safety and fitness of
food are the concern of district councils, London borough councils and port
health authorities. Premises where food or drink is prepared, handled, stored
or sold must conform to certain hygiene standards. Environmental health
officers may take for analysis or for bacteriological or other examination samples
of any food on sale for human consumption. There are special regulations
controlling the safety of particular foods such as milk, meat and ice-cream. The
Department of Health and Social Security, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food and the Welsh Office are the central departments responsible for
giving advice and making regulations. Expert committees of these departments
periodically review regulations dealing with food.
134
CONTROL OF

DISEASES
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In Scotland regional and islands councils are responsible for food standards
and labelling, and district and islands councils for food hygiene. District councils
in Northern Ireland are responsible for food hygiene, food standards and
labelling.
The health authorities have general responsibility for the prevention of disease
and co-operate with the local authority environmental health services. The
area health authorities and health boards carry out programmes of vaccination
and immunisation against diphtheria, measles, rubella (females only), polio¬
myelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis and whooping cough. Although vaccination is
voluntary, the Government encourages parents to obtain protection for their
children from these diseases.
The Public Health Laboratory Service provides a network of bacteriological
and virological laboratories throughout England and Wales which conduct
research and assist in the diagnosis, prevention and control of epidemic diseases.
Its largest establishment is the Central Public Health Laboratory at Colindale,
in north-west London, which includes the National Collection of Type Cultures,
the Food Hygiene Laboratory, and reference laboratories specialising in the
identification of infective micro-organisms. In addition it has a surveillance
centre, which investigates and monitors human communicable diseases. In
Scotland bacteriological work is done mainly in hospital laboratories. In Northern
Ireland a central public health laboratory shares the bacteriological work with
hospital laboratories.
PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES
Responsibility for personal social services rests with the social services authorities
(local authority social services departments in England and Wales, social work
departments in Scotland and health and social services boards in Northern
Ireland). Many of their services are directed towards the same groups of people
needing health services, for example, many elderly or disabled people. Other
groups helped are young families with social problems, children deprived of a
normal home life, the mentally disordered and young offenders. Close co¬
operation is maintained between local authority social services departments and
health authorities. In Scotland local authorities also undertake duties similar to
those of the separate probation and after-care service in England and Wales
(see p m).
The Personal Social Services Council advises ministers on policy issues and
provides information and advice to all concerned with the personal social
services in England and Wales, based on research projects or inquiries sponsored
by the Council. Its members are from local government, voluntary, educational
and research bodies, and professional organisations. There is cross-representation
with the Central Health Services Council and the Central Council for Education
and Training in Social Work. Finance comes from central and local government.
In Scotland there is an Advisory Council on Social Work and in Northern
Ireland a Central Personal Social Services Advisory Committee. Advice on health
and personal social services for children in England and Wales is given by the
Children’s Joint Committee; its members are nominated by the Central Health
Services Council, the Personal Social Services Council, and the Secretaries of
State for Social Services and for Wales.
The Social services authorities have a duty to provide social services for disabled
Handicapped people. They are required to establish the number of disabled people in their

area and to publicise services. A wide range of facilities may be available including
advice on personal and social problems arising from disability, assistance in
overcoming the effects of disability, adaptations to people’s homes (such as
fitting ramps, ground floor toilets and grab rails) and various aids to daily living.
In certain circumstances a telephone or a television set may be installed. Other
facilities include social and occupational clubs, residential homes and the organ¬
isation of outings and holidays. In addition some authorities make arrangements
for the teaching of handicrafts and other occupations. Voluntary organisations
also provide services for disabled people.
Help available from other sources includes social security, medical treatment,
special education, employment and training services and specially designed
housing and means of access to public buildings.
Services for elderly people are provided by statutory and voluntary bodies to
help them to live at home for as long as possible. These may include the advice
and help of social workers, domestic help, delivery of cooked meals, sitters-in,
night attendants and laundry services as well as day centres, clubs and re¬
creational workshops. In many areas ‘good neighbour’ and friendly visiting
services are arranged by the local authority or a voluntary organisation. Social
services authorities also provide residential accommodation for the elderly and
infirm and have powers to register homes run by voluntary organisations or
privately. The newer homes usually have accommodation for some 30-50
residents. About 2,600 homes for elderly people are provided by local authorities
in England which house about 1-5 per cent of the population over the age of 65.
There are similar homes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Local authorities, as part of their responsibility for public housing, build
flats specially designed for elderly people; some of these blocks have resident
wardens. Housing associations also build this type of accommodation.
Social services authorities must make arrangements for helping the mentally
ill or mentally handicapped in the community, and for prevention and after-care
services. Recent developments in the treatment of mental illness, which
enable patients either to be treated at home or to be discharged from
hospital more quickly provided support is available in the community, are
adding to demands for these services and particularly for social work support.
Arrangements include training centres for the mentally handicapped, day
centres for the mentally ill, as well as social centres and a variety of residential
care for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped of all ages. Social workers
help patients and their families to deal with social problems arising from mental
illness or handicap and can arrange compulsory admission (on a medical recom¬
mendation) of mentally disordered people to hospital in certain circumstances.
Social services authorities, through their own social workers or a voluntary
organisation, make available help and advice to families facing special problems.
The home help service provides practical assistance at home for sick and disabled
people, elderly people and expectant mothers.
Some authorities make direct provision for the special needs of unmarried
mothers and their babies, but most contribute to the cost of work done by
voluntary organisations and other bodies.
Day care facilities for children under five are provided by local authorities,
voluntary agencies and privately. In allocating places in day nurseries and other
facilities they themselves provide, local authorities give priority to children
136
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
with special social or health needs for day care. They also register, and provide
support and advice services for, childminders, private day nurseries and play¬
groups operating in their area.
The authorities have a duty to offer advice, guidance and assistance to
families in difficulties in order to promote the welfare of children. The aim is
to intervene at an early stage to reduce the need to receive children into care
or bring them before a juvenile court.
The recognition, prevention and management of cases of child abuse are the
concern of many authorities, agencies and professions, and area review commit¬
tees have been established throughout the country to provide a forum for the
discussion and co-ordination of all those involved and to draw up policies and
procedures for handling these cases.
Authorities must receive into their care any child under the age of 17 who
has no parent or guardian or who has been abandoned or whose parents are
unable to provide for him or her if they are satisfied that such intervention
is in the interests of the child. The child remains in care until the age of 18
unless discharged to the care of parents, other relatives or friends before that
time. In certain circumstances the local authority may pass a resolution assuming
the rights and duties of one or both parents. The parents must be notified and
if they give notice of objection the continuance of the resolution will depend
upon its being upheld by a court of law. When taking a decision on a child in
care, the authorities have to give first consideration to the need to safeguard and
promote the welfare of the child. Where children are in care, efforts are made to
work with their families in order, where appropriate, to enable the children to
return home.
Children in England and Wales may be brought before a juvenile court if they
are neglected or ill-treated, exposed to moral danger, are beyond the control
of parents, not attending school or (if ten years or over) have committed an
offence other than homicide. At the same time it must be shown that the children
are in need of care or control which they are unlikely to receive unless a care or
other relevant order is made by the court. Local authorities are responsible for
undertaking inquiries through social workers, consultation with parents, schools
and the police. Children may be committed to the care of a local authority
under a care order if the juvenile court is satisfied that they are in need of care
or control. As an alternative the court may make a supervision order for a period
of up to three years. Supervision is carried out by a social worker or a probation
officer.
In Northern Ireland the court may send children to a training school (see
p 115), commit them to the care of a fit person (which may include a health and
social services board), or make a supervision order.
In Scotland children in trouble (see p 115) or in need may be brought before
a children’s hearing which can impose a supervision requirement on a child if it
thinks that compulsory measures of care are appropriate. Under these require¬
ments most children are allowed to remain at home under the supervision of a
social worker but some may be sent to a residential establishment while under
supervision. Supervision requirements are reviewed at intervals of not more
than one year until terminated by a children’s hearing.
When practicable, children in care are boarded out with foster parents, who
receive an allowance to cover the cost of maintenance. If foster homes are not
considered appropriate or cannot be found, the children may be placed in
children’s homes, voluntary homes or other suitable residential accommodation.
Community homes for children in care in England and Wales comprise local
authority and some voluntary children’s homes and include community homes

with education on the premises which provide long-term care usually for the
more difficult children. In Scotland local authorities are responsible for placing
children in their care either in foster homes, in local authority or voluntary
homes, or in residential schools. In Northern Ireland there are residential homes
for children in the care of the health and social services boards, although training
schools and remand homes are administered separately.
Regulations regarding conduct of community homes and registered voluntary
homes and the boarding out of children in care are made by central government.
Voluntary organisations, many of which were pioneers in child care, continue
to play a valuable part in providing accommodation for children both in the care
of local authorities and voluntary organisations. Some children’s homes run by
voluntary organisations which are not within the community homes system are
registered with central government.
Voluntary bodies concerned with the welfare of children in their own homes
include local family casework agencies and the Family Service Units. The
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and its Scottish
counterpart maintain inspectors and visitors to investigate reported cruelty or
neglect.
Adoption of children is strictly regulated by legislation and some 12,000 adoption
orders were made in England and Wales in 1978 and 1,350 in Scotland; the
Registrars General keep confidential registers of adopted children. Local
authorities have the power to act as adoption agencies and eventually will be
obliged to offer such a service. Voluntary adoption societies (over 60 societies
in Britain arrange adoptions) must be registered with their local authority.
Adoptions of minors under the laws of some European and Commonwealth
countries are recognised but this does not confer British citizenship on the
adopted person.
The effective operation of the social services is largely dependent upon the
availability of professionally qualified social workers trained in the methods of
social work. Training courses in social work are provided by universities, poly¬
technics and colleges of further education; their length depends upon previous
educational qualifications and can extend from one to four years. The Central
Council for Education and Training in Social Work recognises social work
courses and offers advice to people considering entry to the profession.
Professional social workers (including those working in the National Health
Service) are employed by social services authorities. Others work in voluntary
organisations or in the probation service (see p m). Not all social workers
employed by social services authorities are professionally qualified, but efforts
are being made to increase the number of trained personnel.
SOCIAL SECURITY
National insurance, industrial injuries benefits, child benefit, family income
supplement, supplementary benefits, and war pensions constitute a comprehen¬
sive system of social security. The payment of many benefits depends on prior
payments to the national insurance scheme, while others are available without
contribution conditions. The former are paid from the national insurance fund
which consists of contributions from employed people and their employers,
self-employed people and the Government. Non-contributory benefits are
financed from general taxation revenue.
I38 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Department of Health and Social Security administers these services in
Great Britain; within the Department, the Supplementary Benefits Commission
is responsible for the system of supplementary benefits. In Northern Ireland
social security benefits are administered by the Department of Health and Social
Services and the Supplementary Benefits Commission for Northern Ireland is
responsible for determining entitlement to supplementary benefits. Pensions and
welfare services for war pensioners and their dependants are the responsibility
of the Department of Health and Social Security throughout the United King¬
dom. Appeals relating to claims for the various benefits are decided by indepen¬
dent tribunals.
A series of Acts in the 1940s established a comprehensive social security
system which became operative in 1948. Benefits were flat-rate but as the
level of earnings rose in the 1950s and 1960s the gap between earnings and
benefits tended to widen. In the 1960s, therefore, a modest earnings-related
addition to retirement pension based on graduated contributions was introduced;
this principle was extended to unemployment and sickness benefit and, in 1975,
to maternity allowance. In the 1970s new benefits have included better pension
arrangements for widows, pensions for people aged 80 and over who have not
qualified for a national insurance retirement pension, and more benefits for
disabled people (see pp 141-2). The new earnings-related state pension scheme
provides improved retirement, widows’, and invalidity pensions.
Measures are taken to ensure that social security payments go only to those
for whom they are intended and increased efforts are to be made to cut down on
fraudulent claims. The size of the problem, however, remains small; the value of
benefits unclaimed by people entitled to them is believed to be very many times
greater than that of the money lost by fraud. The Government has announced
its intention of examining a number of aspects of the social security system with
the aim of generally simplifying its administration. It also intends to change the
basis on which the annual increases for longer-term benefits is made (see p 139).
Class 1 contributions are earnings-related and cover the employee for retirement
pension, sickness and invalidity benefits, unemployment benefit, maternity
benefits, widows’ benefits, death grant and child’s special allowance. Earnings-
related supplement to sickness and unemployment benefit and maternity allow¬
ance and earnings-related addition to widows’ allowance are also covered.
Industrial injuries benefits, although non-contributory, are payable from the
national insurance fund. Additional payments are made for dependants.
The contribution paid by the employee varies; if he or she is not a member of a
‘contracted-out’ occupational pension scheme run by his or her employers
(see p 139), the contribution is 6-5 per cent of earnings up to £135 a week (the
upper earnings limit) provided that these earnings are at least ^19-50 (the lower
earnings limit). The employer pays 10 per cent of the same earnings range.
If the employee is a member of a ‘contracted-out’ occupational pension scheme,
a lower Class 1 contribution is payable, namely 6-5 per cent of earnings up to the
lower earnings limit and 4 per cent of earnings between the two limits; the
employer’s contribution is 10 per cent and 5-5 per cent respectively. Con¬
tributions are collected through the ‘Pay As You Earn’ income tax system. The
employer also pays to the Exchequer a national insurance surcharge of 3*5 per
cent of the earnings range for each employee (see p 348).
Self-employed people pay a flat-rate Class 2 contribution of £2-10 a week and
a Class 4 contribution amounting to 5 per cent of net profits or gains between
£2,250 and £y,ooo a year. Self-employed contributors receive basic retirement

pension (see below) and the same benefits as employees with the exception of
unemployment benefit, earnings-related supplements, and industrial injuries
benefits.
Certain married women and widows retain the right to pay Class 1 contributions
at the reduced rate of 2 per cent when employed and to pay no Class 2 contribu¬
tions when self-employed. This right is being phased out and is retained only
by those entitled to it at 5 April 1978. Reduced contributions do not count for
the purposes of benefit. The employer’s contribution is not affected.
Voluntary Class 3 contributions of £2 are payable by people wanting to safe¬
guard rights to some benefits. Class 3 (and Class 2) contributions are paid by
stamping a national insurance card or by direct debit of a bank or National
Girobank account.
Some people do not have to pay contributions. Employees who continue working
after pensionable age (60 for women and 65 for men) do not pay contributions
though the employer remains liable. People earning less than the lower earnings
limit are not liable for contributions, neither are their employers. Self-employed
people with earnings below £1,050 a year and those over pensionable age are
excused payment of contributions.
For most of the benefits there are two contribution conditions. First, before
benefit can be paid at all, certain contributions have to be paid; secondly, the
full rate of benefit cannot be paid unless contributions have been paid or credited
up to a specific level over a specified period. There are special rules to help a
widow not entitled to a widow’s pension at widowhood or when her children
have grown up, to qualify for sickness, unemployment or maternity benefit in
the period before she can have established or re-established herself in insurance
through her own contributions; there are also provisions to help a divorced
woman who was not paying contributions during her marriage. The main
benefits (payable weekly) are summarised below. The rates quoted are those
effective from November 1979; allowances for children include child benefit.
Since 1975 benefits such as retirement pension have been increased annually
in line with percentage movements in retail prices or average earnings, which¬
ever was the greater; short-term benefits such as sickness benefit have been
linked with movements in retail prices. The Government is to introduce
legislation to link the uprating of all benefits with percentage increases in retail
prices.
A state retirement pension is payable to women at the age of 60 and to men at
the age of 65. People who are still working five years after the minimum pension
age are eligible to receive the pension. The weekly rate of basic pension is
£23'3° f°r men and women qualifying on their own contributions and £14 for
a married woman qualifying on her husband’s contributions. In 1978 the new
state pension scheme came into operation and will mature fully after 20 years of
contributions; the retirement pension will consist of the basic pension plus an
additional (earnings-related) pension. The additional pension will be 1-25 per
cent of earnings between the earnings limits (see p 138) for each year of contribu¬
tions up to a maximum of 20 years.
Employers are free to ‘contract-out’ their employees from the state scheme
for additional pension and provide their own occupational pension in its place
provided that the latter is at least as good as the state additional pension. The
I40 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
State remains responsible for the basic pension. Lower national insurance
contributions are payable if contracting-out takes place.
Rights to basic pension are safeguarded for mothers who are away from work
looking after children or for people giving up work to care for severely disabled
relatives. Women contributors receive the same pension as men with the same
earnings.
A small pension may also be payable to those people who contributed to the
state graduated pension scheme which operated between 1961 and 1975. Since
1978 graduated pension has also been protected against inflation.
In real terms the value of the basic retirement pension for a married couple
has more than doubled since 1948.
A non-contributory retirement pension of £14 for a man, single woman or
widow and ^8-40 for a married woman (including an age addition of 25p) is
payable to people over the age of 80 who have not qualified for a contributory
pension or who qualified for one at a lower rate than the non-contributory
pension. The age addition is also paid to all other pensioners aged over 80.
A maternity grant of £25 is payable for each living child born and for a still¬
born child if the pregnancy lasts for at least 28 weeks. Maternity allowance is
^18-50 a week and is payable normally from 11 weeks before the expected week
of confinement until the sixth week following the birth. Mothers who have paid
full Class 1 or Class 2 contributions while they were working may qualify for
maternity allowance even if they gave up work some time previously. An
earnings-related supplement may also be payable.
Child Benefit The non-contributory child benefit is the main social security benefit for
children. The rate is £4 for each child; an additional £2-50 is payable for the
only, or older child of single-parent families (it is proposed to extend this
addition to any other person bringing up a child alone). Child benefit, which is
tax free and is paid to the mother, is payable for children up to the age of 16
and for those up to the age of 19 if they continue in full-time education; benefit
is not payable if the young person is taking a degree, teacher training or any
other advanced course or if the education is sponsored by an employer, or in
Northern Ireland, by a body such as the Department of Manpower Services
or an Industrial Training Board.
A contributory child’s special allowance of £ii-io for each child, inclusive of
child benefit, is payable to a mother on the death of a former husband if the
marriage was dissolved or annulled and if the husband was contributing to the
support of the children.
A non-contributory guardian’s allowance is a weekly payment of £7-10 for an
orphaned child payable to a person who is entitled to child benefit for that child.
In certain circumstances it can be paid on the death of only one parent. One of
the dead parents must have satisfied a residence condition. Where guardian’s
allowance is payable, that child cannot be counted for the purposes of other social
security benefits for children.
Other Benefits Additions for children are payable with widows’, sickness, unemployment and
other benefits.

related addition earned by the late husband’s Class 1 contributions may also be
payable. After this a widowed mother receives a basic widowed mother’s allow¬
ance of ^23-30 plus ^ii'io for each child, inclusive of child benefit. Widow’s
pension is payable to a widow who is 40 years or over when her husband dies
or when her entitlement to widowed mother’s allowance ends; the rates payable
range from ^6-99 for widows of 40 to ^23-85 for widows of 50 or over.
The widow’s pension and widowed mother’s allowance consists of a basic
pension and an additional pension earned by the late husband’s contributions.
If the widow is aged between 40 and 50 when widowed (or when her
children have grown up), additional pension is reduced like the basic pension.
Payment continues irrespective of earnings until the widow remarries or begins
drawing retirement pension.
A man whose wife dies when both are over pension age inherits his wife’s
pension rights just as a widow inherits her husband’s rights.
Industrial Injuries There are also benefits for widows under the industrial injuries scheme.
A pension of ^32-60 is payable for the first 26 weeks of widowhood. A
widow may also receive an earnings-related addition if sufficient Class 1 con¬
tributions have been paid by her late husband on earnings in excess of the
lower earnings limit in the relevant tax year. Thereafter, she can receive a
pension of £23-85 a week if she was aged 50 at the date of her husband’s death,
or has dependent children or fulfils certain other conditions; otherwise, she
receives £6-99 a week. If she was living apart from her husband, a pension is
payable only if she was receiving or entitled to receive at least 25P a week
for her maintenance from him.
In addition allowances are paid for children within the child benefit age
limits. For widows they are £n-io for each child inclusive of child benefit.
Certain other dependants, such as parents and other relatives, may be entitled
to pensions, allowances or gratuities.
Sick and There is a large variety of benefits for people unable to work because of sickness
Disabled People or disablement.
Sickness Benefit Contributory sickness benefit of £18-50 a week is payable for up to 28 weeks. There
are allowances of £11-45 f°r a w^e or other adult dependant and £5-70 for each
child inclusive of child benefit. An earnings-related supplement may be payable
for up to six months but the total of flat-rate benefit (including increases for
dependants) and supplement cannot exceed 85 per cent of the reckonable weekly
earnings on which the supplement is based. Where the flat-rate benefit alone
exceeds this figure it is payable in full.
Invalidity Pension Invalidity pension of £23-30 plus £14 for a wife and £n-io for a child, inclusive
and Allowance of child benefit, is payable when sickness benefit ends if the beneficiary is still
incapable of work. Invalidity allowance (ranging from £1-55 to £4-90 according
to age) is paid with the pension to those people who become sick more than five
years before retirement age.
Invalidity pension consists of a basic pension and an earnings-related pension
calculated in the same way as that for retirement pension.
Industrial Injuries Various benefits are payable for injury or disablement caused by an accident at
Benefits work or a prescribed disease.
Injury benefit for an adult is £21-25 a week plus £11-45 f°r an adult dependant
and £5-70 for each child, inclusive of child benefit. It is paid when the employed

earner is incapable of work and payment can continue for a maximum of 26
weeks beginning on the date of the accident or development of the disease. A
person entitled to sickness benefit who draws injury benefit instead, also receives
an earnings-related supplement subject to the 85 per cent limit on total benefit
(see p 141).
When injury benefit ends disablement benefit may be paid if, as the result
of the industrial accident or prescribed disease, there is a loss of physical or
mental faculty. The amount depends on the extent of the disablement as assessed
by a medical board; it varies from ^38 a week for 100 per cent disablement to
£7-60 for 20 per cent disablement, but for disablement of less than 20 per cent a
gratuity is normally paid.
In certain circumstances disablement benefit may be supplemented as
follows: unemployability supplement at the weekly rate of ^23-30; invalidity
allowance according to age (see above); constant attendance allowance of up to
^15-20 a week normally, or up to ,£30-40 in exceptionally severe cases; an
allowance of ,£15-20 a week payable in addition to constant attendance allowance
in certain cases of exceptionally severe disablement; a special hardship allowance
of up to ^15-20 for a person who is unfit to return to his or her regular job or
to do work of an equivalent standard; and hospital treatment allowance which
raises the disablement benefit to that for a 100 per cent assessment during
hospital treatment for the industrial injury. Increases of disablement benefit
for dependants may be payable with unemployability supplement. There are
benefits for widows and their children (see p 141).
An attendance allowance of ,£i8-6o may be payable to severely disabled people
requiring a great deal of attention by day and at night. A lower rate of ,£12-40
may be paid to those who need help either by day or at night. A non-contributory
invalidity pension of ,£14 is payable to people of working age unable to work
and not qualifying for the national insurance invalidity pension; it is also
payable to disabled housewives incapable of work and unable to perform their
normal household tasks.
A weekly invalid care allowance of £14 is payable to people (aged between
16 and pension age) who cannot go out to work because they are caring for a
severely disabled relative receiving an attendance allowance.
Physically disabled people unable or virtually unable to walk may be entitled
to a mobility allowance of ,£12 a week to help pay their transport costs. The
allowance is intended for people aged between 5 and 65. At present the age
group 5-60 is covered. The phasing-in of the allowance, covering the age group
61 to 64, will be completed in November 1979. An independent organisation
called Motability assists those disabled drivers and disabled passengers wanting
to use their mobility allowance to obtain a vehicle.
Unemployment benefit at the same rate as sickness benefit (see p 141) is payable
for up to 312 days (not counting Sundays) in any one spell of unemployment.
Periods of unemployment benefit which are 13 weeks or less apart and periods
of unemployment benefit which are more than 13 weeks apart but which are
linked by periods of sickness benefit or training allowance count as one period.
Earnings-related supplement may be payable on the same basis as that for sickness
benefit. Generally speaking anyone claiming unemployment benefit has to be
registered for employment at a local office of the Manpower Services Commission
(in Northern Ireland the Department of Manpower Services) which helps people
to find jobs.

A death grant is payable on the death of a contributor or a contributor’s near
relative. It is normally £30 for an adult and a smaller sum for a child.
Any person aged 16 or over who is not in full-time v/ork and who does not
have enough money to live on may be entitled to supplementary benefit. It is
not awarded to people attending school or for the requirements of people in¬
volved in an industrial dispute (dependants of strikers, however, are covered). In
Northern Ireland a residence condition must also be satisfied. The benefit
takes the form of a supplementary allowance for people under the minimum
retirement age, and a supplementary pension for those over. The benefit is the
amount by which a person’s needs exceed his or her available resources, both
being defined by rules approved by Parliament. The calculation of needs is
based on different amounts for single people and family groups (for blind people
there are special higher amounts) with, in each case, an addition for rent. A
higher long-term scale is used for retirement pensioners and for people under
pension age who have received supplementary benefit for more than two years
without having to register for work. Additions can be made for requirements
such as a special diet or extra heating. Certain needy groups receive the heating
addition automatically. A single payment may be made to meet an exceptional
need. When resources are calculated, most social security benefits are taken
into account in full. Part of most other income including part-time earnings,
disablement benefit and war widow’s pension is ignored, as is the capital value
of an owner-occupied house or capital resources of less than .£1,250.
The payment of a supplementary allowance to an able-bodied person of
working age may be conditional on registering for work at an unemployment
benefit office of the Department of Employment or, in Northern Ireland,
the Department of Manpower Services. The supplementary benefits scheme is
administered by a Supplementary Benefits Commission within the Department
of Health and Social Security in England, Scotland and Wales; there is a similar
commission in Northern Ireland.
The Supplementary Benefits Commission also has a duty to influence people
without a settled way of living to lead a more normal life. It provides temporary
accommodation for them in 21 reception centres, one of which is administered
by a local authority on its behalf. For men who have been unemployed for long
periods and who are receiving supplementary allowances, the Commission runs
17 re-establishment centres, three of which have residential accommodation,
where they are given help to fit them again for work. These provisions do not
apply in Northern Ireland.
Family income supplement is a cash benefit for families with small incomes where
the head of the family is in full-time work and where there is at least one depen¬
dent child. It is payable when the gross weekly income of a family falls below a
prescribed amount, fixed at £54 a week where there is one child plus amounts
ranging from £4 to £5 for each additional child. The weekly rate of the supple¬
ment is half the difference between the family’s income and the prescribed
amount up to a maximum of £12-50 for a one-child family and this is increased
by £ 1 for each additional child.
Families receiving the supplement are automatically entitled to a number of
other benefits including an additional £1 a week for heating, free school meals,
milk and vitamins for expectant mothers and for children under school age,
exemption from prescription charges and National Health Service charges for
dental treatment and glasses.
A similar, but independent, scheme is run in Northern Ireland.

BENEFITS
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The war pensions scheme is administered throughout the United Kingdom
by the Department of Health and Social Security. Pensions are payable to
people disabled as a result of service in the armed forces or from injuries received
in the merchant navy or civil defence during war-time or to civilians injured by
enemy action.
The current basic pension for 100 per cent disablement for a private soldier is
£38 a week, but the amount varies according to rank and to the degree of disable¬
ment. Allowances for a wife and children are paid in addition to the basic
pension. There is a wide range of supplementary allowances, the main ones
being for unemployability (£24-70 a week), constant attendance (up to £15-20
and, exceptionally, £30-40 a week), comforts (£3-30 or £6-6o a week), and
lowered standard of occupation (up to £15*20 a week). An age allowance
(between £2-65 and £8-20 a week) is payable to disabled pensioners who are
aged 65 or over and whose assessment is 40 per cent or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and war orphans. The standard rate of
pension for widows of private soldiers is £30-20 a week, with additional allow¬
ances for their children and, in certain cases, a rent allowance (up to £11*50 a
week). There is an additional allowance of £2*95 for widows aged 65 which is
increased to £5*90 at the age of 70. Parents or other relatives who were dependent
on a person whose death resulted from service in the Forces may receive pensions
if they are in financial need.
The Department of Health and Social Security maintains a welfare service
for war pensioners, war widows and war orphans. It works in close co-operation
with many voluntary and ex-Service organisations who give financial aid and
personal help to disabled ex-Service men and women and their families.
Social security benefits (other than child, maternity, unemployment, sickness,
invalidity, injury or disablement benefit) are included in the taxable income
on which income tax is assessed. On the other hand various income tax reliefs
and exemptions are allowed on account of age or liability for the support of
dependants. Supplementary benefit, family income supplement, attendance
allowances and war disability pensions including supplementary allowances,
war widows’ pensions and allowances for children are not taxable.
In addition to payments provided under the social security legislation, there are
a number of other benefits for which people with low incomes may be eligible.
These include legal aid and assistance (see p 123), rent rebates and allowances
(see p 187), rate rebates (see p 156), exemption from health service charges (see
p 127) and free school meals (see p 156).
VOLUNTARY SERVICES
The State services are complemented by those provided by voluntary organi¬
sations and by individual volunteers. Voluntary organisations, especially the
churches, pioneered the development of many social services by providing
schools, hospitals, clinics, dispensaries and social and recreational clubs. How¬
ever, these facilities were not uniformly spread throughout the country and
did not cover everyone in need. Gradually the State accepted responsibility for
the major services by developing a comprehensive structure to ensure a minimum
standard of living and well-being for the population.
State and voluntary social services work in co-operation. Central and local
government make grants to the voluntary agencies. Public authorities plan
and carry out their duties taking account of the work of voluntary organisations.
SOCIAL WELFARE
H5
Voluntary
Organisations
Local authorities and voluntary agencies provide residential care for elderly,
disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped people and for children. It has
been estimated that about 5 million people take part in some voluntary work
during the course of a year.
Co-ordination of government interests in voluntary social service throughout
Britain is the responsibility of the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit.
Many voluntary organisations are registered charities, and in England and
Wales the Charity Commission, a government agency, gives free advice to
trustees of charities, making schemes to modify their purposes or facilitate their
administration when necessary. It maintains central and local registers of
charities which are open to public inspection, and it investigates and checks
abuses, though it has no power to act in the administration of a charity.
There are thousands of voluntary organisations ranging from national bodies
to small individual local groups. Most are members of larger associations or
are represented on local or national co-ordinating councils or committees.
Some are chiefly concerned with giving personal service, others in the formation
of public opinion and exchange of information. Some carry out both functions.
They may be staffed by both professional and voluntary workers.
The main voluntary body in England which aims to provide central links
between voluntary organisations and official bodies is the National Council of
Social Service which works to extend the involvement of voluntary organisations
in dealing with social issues, to protect the interests and independence of volun¬
tary agencies, and to provide them with a range of advice, information and other
services. There are also the Scottish Council of Social Service, the Council for
Social Service for Wales and the Northern Ireland Council of Social Service,
which perform similar functions.
Specialist voluntary organisations concerned with personal and family
problems include the family casework agencies like the Family Welfare Associa¬
tion, Family Service Units, and the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children; marriage guidance centres affiliated to the National
Marriage Guidance Council; the National Council of Voluntary Child Care
Organisations; the National Council for One Parent Families; Child Poverty
Action Group and the Claimants’ Union, both of which provide expert advice
on social security benefits; and the Samaritans, who help the lonely, the
depressed and the suicidal.
Community service of many kinds is given by young people; this is often
channelled through national and local organisations such as Community Service
Volunteers, Task Force, Scouts and Girl Guides.
Voluntary service to the sick and disabled is given by—among others—the
British Red Cross Society, St. John Ambulance, the Women’s Royal Voluntary
Service and the Leagues of Hospital Friends. Societies which help people with
particular disabilities and difficulties include the Royal National Institute for the
Blind, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf, MIND (National Association
for Mental Health), the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children,
the Spastics Society, Alcoholics Anonymous, Age Concern, Help the Aged and
their equivalents in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
National organisations whose work is specifically religious in inspiration
include the Salvation Army, the Church Army, Toe H, the Committee on Social
Service of the Church of Scotland, the Church of England Children’s Society,
the Church of England Council for Social Aid, the Young Men’s Christian
Association, the Young Women’s Christian Association, the Catholic Marriage
Advisory Council and the Jewish Welfare Board.

A wide range of voluntary personal service is given by the Women’s Royal
Voluntary Service, which brings ‘meals on wheels’ to housebound invalids and
old people, provides flatlets and residential clubs for the elderly, helps with
family problems and assists in hospitals and clinics, as well as doing relief work
in emergencies.
Some 825 Citizens Advice Bureaux give explanation and advice to citizens
who are in doubt about their rights or who do not know about the State or
voluntary services available. There are law centres (see p 123) and housing
advisory centres in some areas.
The Volunteer Centre is a national voluntary organisation and a centre for
information and research on voluntary work, established with the aid of a govern¬
ment grant. There are many full-time and part-time local volunteer bureaux.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975, one of the most comprehensive on this
subject in the world, makes discrimination between men and women unlawful
in employment, education, training and the provision of housing, goods, facilities
and services. Discriminatory advertisements which breach the Act are also
unlawful. The Act applies to both direct and indirect sex discrimination: direct
discrimination is treating one person less favourably than another on the grounds
of his or her sex; indirect discrimination is applying a condition or requirement
which, though apparently neutral, in effect acts significantly to the disadvantage
of one sex and cannot be justified on its merits. Northern Ireland has similar
legislation.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970 (and corresponding legislation in Northern
Ireland), women are entitled to equal pay with men when doing work that is
the same or broadly similar or work which has been given an equal value under
a job evaluation scheme.
The Equal Opportunities Commission assists in the enforcement of both
Acts and promotes equal opportunities between the sexes. There is a separate
commission in Northern Ireland.
Employers must not discriminate against a man or woman because of his or
her sex. This applies to recruitment, promotion, the provision of benefits,
dismissals and training. It is also unlawful for employers to discriminate against
a person on grounds of marriage. There are a limited number of exceptions
including employment in private households and employment in jobs where a
person’s sex is a ‘genuine occupational qualification’, such as acting. Employers
of not more than five people are exempt from the Act.
Co-educational schools, colleges and universities may not discriminate in
the provision of facilities or in their admissions. Single-sex establishments are
permissible, however, and there are arrangements for such institutions to move
gradually towards co-education if they wish.
It is unlawful to discriminate against a man or a woman in the sale or letting
of land, houses, flats and business premises. The law applies equally to public
and private housing, furnished and unfurnished. The Act does not apply to
lettings in a small dwelling occupied by the landlord or a near relative.
Discrimination is also unlawful in the provision of goods, facilities and
services. For example, banks, building societies or finance companies' must not
refuse to give credit, mortgages or loans to women on terms that would
be applied to men. Exceptions include services provided in certain special

care establishments such as hospitals; places used for religious purposes where
religious susceptibilities would be offended; places where it is necessary to
preserve decency or privacy; competitive sports in which for reasons of physique
women would be at a disadvantage; and life insurance and similar matters
where risk is assessed on reliable actuarial or other data.
It is unlawful to publish or place advertisements which contravene the Sex
Discrimination Act whether for jobs, goods, facilities or services.
Complaints of discrimination may be brought before the county courts in
England and Wales or the sheriff courts in Scotland, except for complaints
concerning employment, which are dealt with by industrial tribunals (see p 330).
Complaints concerning State educational establishments must first be made to
the relevant Secretary of State before they can be brought before a court. Only
the Equal Opportunities Commission is responsible for handling complaints
about discriminatory advertisements and can bring proceedings in matters
concerning advertising. Where necessary, legal advice or assistance, or legal aid
if the case is taken to court, are available for complainants with low incomes
(see p 123). Legal aid is not available for industrial tribunal cases but applicants
can receive advice and assistance.
The Equal Opportunities Commission helps to enforce the Sex Discrimination
Act and the Equal Pay Act. Its aims are to eliminate sex discrimination and to
promote equal opportunities. The Commission advises people of their rights
under both Acts, and in certain circumstances, may give financial help or
assist individuals to prepare and conduct a case before a court or tribunal. It
may also attempt to secure a settlement. The Commission has power to conduct
formal investigations and, if satisfied that practices are unlawful, can issue
non-discrimination notices requiring discriminatory practices to stop. For
certain formal investigations, the Commission has the power to require a person
to give information and to attend hearings to give evidence. In addition it keeps
the workings of the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts under review and
may submit proposals for amending them to the Home Secretary and the
Secretary of State for Employment respectively.
RACE RELATIONS
After the 1950s considerable numbers of people entered Britain from Common¬
wealth countries in the West Indies, Asia and Africa to settle and take up employ¬
ment, and they make an important contribution to the economy and the public
services. In 1977 the population of New Commonwealth1 and Pakistani ethnic
origin was estimated at some i-8 million (about 3-4 per cent of the total popu¬
lation) of whom 40 per cent were born in Britain. Nearly three-quarters live in
the south-east and the west Midlands. Although, as Commonwealth citizens,
they have full political and civic rights, many suffer from social and economic
disadvantages. This can partly be attributed to the fact that many initially lack
the skills needed in an industrial society and occupy low-status jobs in poor
environments of the older towns. Another factor, the extent of which is difficult
to determine, is that of racial discrimination.
The difficulties experienced by residents of the older inner city areas are being
alleviated by continuous social programmes which benefit the whole community
and others which are directed at areas of special social need. Additional

Commission for
Racial Equality
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
teachers have been appointed to schools with ethnic minorities and government
grants are available to local authorities with substantial ethnic minority groups
towards the salaries of extra staff, such as interpreters, health visitors and helpers
in schools and community homes. Language teaching is recognised to be of
prime importance in schools and schemes arranged for adults include classes at
their place of work and language groups run by voluntary organisations. The
welfare of ethnic minorities and good relations between minorities and the local
community are promoted by community relations councils and other voluntary
bodies.
A major report published in 1976, while showing that many members of
minority groups were at a disadvantage in terms of the level of their jobs or
the quality of their housing, found that minorities did not regard racial dis¬
crimination as their main difficulty in making a life in Britain but saw themselves
as relative newcomers in a country where prices were rising and jobs hard to
get. Only a small proportion of Asians and West Indians believed that they had
personally encountered discrimination. Policies for promoting equality of
opportunity among ethnic minorities are pursued against a background of
legislation designed to protect them from discrimination.
The Race Relations Act 1976 makes discrimination unlawful on grounds of
colour, race or ethnic or national origin in the provision of goods, facilities and
services, in employment, training and related matters, in education, in housing
and in advertising. It strengthened the previous legislation passed in 1968 which,
in turn, widened the scope of the first race relations legislation enacted in 1965.
The 1976 Act brought the law against racial discrimination into line with that
against sex discrimination (see above), and gave complainants direct access to
civil courts and, in the case of employment complaints, to industrial tribunals.
Complaints concerning educational establishments are made first to the appropri¬
ate education minister. The remedies available from the courts are damages, a
declaration of rights or an injunction. Industrial tribunals are also able to declare
the rights of parties, make recommendations or award compensation. Legal aid
(see p 123) is available to complainants with low incomes.
The 1976 Act also strengthened the criminal law on incitement to racial hatred.
A prosecution made under the Act may only be brought in England and Wales
by, or with the consent of, the Attorney General.
The Commission for Racial Equality works towards the elimination of dis¬
crimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between
different racial groups. It has powers to investigate unlawful discriminatory
practices and to issue non-discrimination notices, enforceable in the courts,
requiring that such practices should cease. The Commission has sole respon¬
sibility for those contraventions of the 1976 Act which do not result in a particular
person being discriminated against, for example, discriminatory advertisements
and instructions; it may also assist individuals with their complaints. It has an
important educational role and has power to issue codes of practice in
employment.
The Commission supports and co-ordinates the work of nearly 100 local
community relations councils operating in areas with significant minority
groups; their purpose is to promote harmonious community relations. It makes
grants towards the salaries of community relations officers and towards special
projects which help to improve community relations or to assist members of the
ethnic minorites. Particular encouragement is given to self-help schemes run by
members of the minority communities.

Priorities
Administration
British education aims to develop individual abilities to the full and to shape
those abilities for the benefit of society as a whole. Compulsory schooling takes
place between the ages of five and 16, although some provision is made for
children under five and many pupils remain at school beyond the minimum
leaving age. Post-school education (mainly at universities, polytechnics and
further education colleges) is organised flexibly to provide a wide range of
opportunities for academic and vocational education and continuing study
throughout life.
Most expenditure on education comes from public funds; some £8,660
million in 1978 which represented 6-i per cent of the gross national product.
Most of the money is spent by local education authorities.
Following more than two decades of substantial innovation and change, which
have affected both school and post-school education, and of expansion of
numbers, particularly of students in higher education, the Government is giving
particular emphasis to improving the quality of education at all levels. Its
policies involve increasing parental choice; allowing local education authorities
to organise the publicly-maintained schools in their areas according to local
wishes and to take up places for pupils at independent schools where appro¬
priate; and plans to assist less well-off parents whose children would benefit
from attendance at certain non-maintained schools.
The fall in the birth rate (see p 8) lasting more than a decade has caused the
number of primary school children to decrease sharply, and over the next few
years the secondary schools will face a similar decline. The trend is having its
effect on teacher-training programmes (see p 159), and the development of the
higher education system in the 1990s is being discussed in this context.
The Government is also encouraging further links, especially locally, between
schools and industry, to try to ensure that pupils grow up with a basic under¬
standing of the economy and the activities which are necessary for the creation
of the country’s wealth, and to encourage more of the able pupils to consider and
prepare for careers in productive industry. Many organisations already work to
improve liaison between school and industry; higher education courses are being
developed with a strong orientation towards industry; and a national scholar¬
ships scheme for engineering students has been established.
Educational responsibilities are devolved in varying degrees to ministers of the
four countries of Britain. The Secretary of State for Education and Science is
responsible for all aspects of education in England, and for the Government’s
relations with and support for universities throughout Great Britain. (He is
also responsible for civil science, p 375). The Secretaries of State for Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland have full educational responsibilities in their
countries except that the Secretaries of State for Wales and Scotland are con¬
sulted about university education but are not responsible for it.
Administration of publicly provided schools and further education is
150 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
decentralised. Responsibilities are divided between the central government
departments (the Department of Education and Science, the Welsh Office, the
Scottish Education Department, and the Department of Education for Northern
Ireland), local education authorities (education and library boards in Northern
Ireland), and various voluntary organisations. The relationship between these
bodies is based on consultation and co-operation.
Local education authorities are responsible for the provision of school
education and most post-school education outside the universities, and provide
grants to students proceeding to higher education (including universities). They
employ the teachers and other staff, provide and maintain the buildings, supply
equipment and materials and decide local policy. In Scotland the central
institutions which provide most vocational further education to degree level, and
colleges of education which provide teacher training, are administered by
independent governing bodies. Three of the central institutions are financed by
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland; all the remaining
central institutions and all the colleges of education are financed directly by
the Scottish Education Department which also pays grants to students on
advanced courses. In Northern Ireland the Ulster Polytechnic (an institution of
higher education) is likewise administered by an independent board of governors
and is financed directly by the Department of Education for Northern Ireland.
Colleges of education are controlled by the Department or voluntary agencies.
Universities are autonomous and their governing bodies are appointed
according to the terms of their individual charters or statutory provisions. The
Government exercises its responsibilities in relation to the universities and
provides financial help to them through the University Grants Committee
(see p 157).
SCHOOLS Parents are required by law to see that their children receive efficient full-time
education, at school or elsewhere, between the ages of 5 and 16.
Over 11 million children attend Britain’s 38,000 schools. Most receive free
education financed from public funds, but a small proportion (very roughly
four per cent) attend schools wholly independent of public financial support.
Boys and girls are taught together in most primary schools and in an increasing
number of secondary schools. Over 80 per cent of pupils in maintained secondary
schools in England and Wales and over 50 per cent in Northern Ireland attend
mixed schools. In Scotland nearly all secondary schools are mixed. Most of the
independent schools for younger children are co-educational, but of those
providing secondary education the majority are single-sex.
Management Schools supported from public funds are of two main kinds in England and
Wales: county schools and voluntary schools. County schools are provided and
maintained by local education authorities wholly out of public funds. Voluntary
schools have mostly been established by religious denominations and receive
varying amounts of public finance according to type (‘aided’, ‘controlled’ and
‘special agreement’). Nearly a third of the 30,470 schools maintained by local
education authorities in England and Wales are voluntary schools: some 5,900
are Church of England, 2,660 are Roman Catholic, and 370 belong to other
groups and religious denominations. Each publicly maintained school has a
body of managers or governors, some or all of whom are appointed by the local
education authority. Legislation before Parliament would provide for the wider
representation of parents and teachers on school governing bodies. It is pro¬
posed that all schools should have at least two parent and two teacher governors
who would in general be elected by parents and teachers. In Scotland most

of the schools supported from public funds are provided by education authorities
and are known as public schools (in England this term is used for a type of
independent school, see p 152).
In Northern Ireland there are two main categories of school: voluntary
schools which are mainly, though not exclusively, under Roman Catholic
management receiving grants of up to 85 per cent of capital costs and up to
100 per cent of running costs; and controlled schools owned and managed by
the Area Education and Library Boards and having all their expenditure met
from public funds. Government policy is to encourage integration between
Protestant and Roman Catholic school education where there is a local desire
for it, but it is not the intention to enforce integrated education against the
wishes of local communities.
In England and Wales no fees are charged to parents of children attending
maintained schools, and books and equipment are free. In Scotland, education
authorities may charge fees where this can be done without prejudice to the
adequate provision of free school education (although no authorities make use
of this power).
In Northern Ireland no fees are charged to parents of children attending grant-
aided schools, with the exception of grammar schools, where a small proportion
of pupils are admitted on a fee-paying basis.
Successive Governments have expanded nursery education within the con¬
straints of limited resources, and by 1978 the number of children in nursery
schools or nursery classes in England had risen to over 200,000. In addition
about 215,000 children under five were attending infants’ classes in primary
schools. This means that over half of all four-year-olds and about 15 per cent of
all three-year-olds were receiving education in publicly-maintained schools. In
addition many children attend informal pre-school playgroups organised by
parents and voluntary bodies.
Compulsory education begins at five when children in England and Wales
go to infant schools or departments; at seven they go on to junior schools or
departments. The usual age of transfer from primary to secondary schools is 11
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but a number of local authorities in
England have established ‘first’ schools for pupils aged 5 to 8 or 10 and ‘middle’
schools covering various age ranges between 9 and 14. In Scotland, the primary
schools take children from 5 to 12, normally having infant classes for children
under 7, although in a few areas there are separate infant schools.
The publicly maintained system of education aims to give all children an educa¬
tion suited to their particular abilities. Over 80 per cent of the maintained
secondary school population in England and Wales attend some 3,600 compre¬
hensive schools which take pupils without reference to ability or aptitude and
provide a wide range of secondary education for all or most of the children of
a district. They can be organised in a number of ways including schools that
take the full secondary school age-range from 11 to 18; middle schools whose
pupils move on to senior comprehensive schools at 12, 13 or 14, leaving at 16 or
18; and schools with an age-range of 11 or 12 to 16 combined with a sixth-
form or ‘tertiary’ college for pupils over 16. Most of the remaining children
receive their secondary education in ‘grammar’ and ‘secondary modern’ schools
to which they are allocated after selection procedures at the age of 11; in 1978
there were 320 grammar schools in England and Wales and 671 secondary
modern schools. Legislation passed in July 1979 removed the compulsion on
!52

local education authorities to reorganise their schools on comprehensive lines.
A Bill before Parliament would ensure that parents’ wishes are taken into account
as fully as possible in the choice of schools for their children, that parents receive
full information about the schools available, and that they have open to them an
effective channel of appeal at a local level.
In the past a small number of selective and otherwise independent grammar
schools have received direct grant payments from central government funds in
return for providing places for certain more able children. The system was being
phased out but the Government which took office in May 1979 has introduced
legislation to establish an assisted places scheme which would provide help for
parents through an income-related grant towards fees and would differ from the
direct grant scheme in a number of important respects: for example, it would
ensure a better geographical spread of opportunity. The purpose would be to
allow such children the opportunity to benefit from the type of education provided
in cases where their parents could not afford the fees.
Secondary education in Scotland is almost completely organised according to
the comprehensive principle and virtually all pupils in education authority
secondary schools are in schools with a non-selective intake. The majority of
schools are six-year comprehensive schools. Because of local circumstances
there are some comprehensive schools at which courses may extend to four years
or less; pupils may transfer at the end of their second or fourth years to a six-year
comprehensive school.
Northern Ireland secondary education is organised largely along selective lines.
An invitation previously extended to the education and library boards to plan
a restructuring along comprehensive lines has been withdrawn.
Independent schools receive no grants from public funds but all are open to
inspection and must register with the appropriate government education
department which has power to require them to remedy any objectionable
features in their premises, accommodation or instruction and to exclude any
person regarded as unsuitable to teach in or to be the proprietor of a school. In
default, the appropriate Secretary of State can, in effect, close a school, but
schools have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal against any of the
requirements. There are about 2,300 registered independent schools.
Independent schools cater for pupils of all ages. The largest and most important
of them are the public schools,1 which accept pupils at about 12 or 13 years of
age usually on the basis of a fairly demanding examination. There are about
460 public schools in England and Wales, most of them single-sex (about half
of them for girls) and at least partly boarding; but there are some co-educational
schools, and certain boys’ schools have recently begun to admit girls direct to
their top forms. Combined tuition and boarding fees in the public schools are
on average £2,100 a year, but some of this may be remitted for children winning
competitive scholarships. Local education authorities in England and Wales
may assist with the payment of fees for children at independent and other non-
maintained schools; or they may take a specified number of places at such schools
for pupils winning competitive scholarships. A number of preparatory schools,
1 ‘Public schools’ are usually taken to mean those schools in membership of the Head¬
masters’ Conference, the Governing Bodies Association or the Governing Bodies of Girls’
Schools Association. They should not be confused with the State-supported public
schools in Scotland.

day and boarding, co-educational and single-sex, prepare children for entry to
the public schools.
Special education is provided for children who require it because of physical or
mental disability either in ordinary schools or special schools (including hospital
schools). It has long been government policy to send as few handicapped
children as possible to special schools, and a law yet to be brought into effect
in England and Wales provides for such children to be educated in ordinary
schools whenever practicable and compatible with efficient teaching. There are,
however, some 1,800 separate special schools (both day and boarding) for a
number of categories of disability. These are the blind, partially sighted, deaf,
partially hearing, delicate, educationally subnormal (mentally handicapped in
Scotland), epileptic, maladjusted, physically handicapped, autistic and those
suffering from speech defects. There is no separate category for the delicate in
Scotland. As many children have multiple handicaps, there is a growing tendency
to relate educational provision to an assessment of overall needs.
A new framework of special education, based on the concept of special
educational need, was recommended by the Warnock Committee in 1978 (see
Bibliography). It would cover not only children with disabilities of mind
or body but also those who have significant difficulties in learning, many of
whom are at present the concern of remedial services, as well as those with
emotional and behavioural disorders. The Committee’s recommendations have
been widely discussed and are being reviewed by the Government.
Teachers in publicly maintained schools are appointed by local education
authorities or schools, governing bodies or managers. There are more than
550,000 teachers (including the full-time equivalent of part-time teachers) in
publicly maintained and assisted schools in Britain and the pupil/teacher ratio
is about 20 to 1. Teachers must hold qualifications approved by the appropriate
education department. Their salaries are determined by nationally negotiated
scales, taking account of qualifications, responsibilities and experience.
In England and Wales the secular curriculum in maintained schools is the
responsibility of the local education authority, or, in the case of secondary
schools, of the schools’ governors. In practice, responsibility is largely devolved
upon head teachers and their staff. In Wales, the Welsh language is taught and
is used as either the main or secondary medium of teaching in some schools.
Her Majesty’s Inspectors of Schools are responsible to the Secretary of State for
Education and Science and the Secretary of State for Wales for the inspection of
all schools, including independent schools. They review and report on the
content and value of the education provided and advise local education author¬
ities, schools and the Government. Local education authorities also employ
inspectors or advisers to guide them on maintained schools. Institutions con¬
cerned with the education and training of teachers are additional sources of
advice. Curriculum materials and further guidance and encouragement for
school-based research and development is available to teachers through the
Schools Council for Curriculum and Examinations. The Council, an independent
body representative of all educational interests, acts as an advisory body and
sponsors and carries out research and development work on curricula, teaching
methods and examinations in primary and secondary schools. The Schools
Committee for Wales carries out similar activities in Wales. In many cases there
are Teachers’ Centres (some 500 in England and Wales) at which teachers meet
for curriculum development work, discussion and in-service training.

In Scotland the function of Her Majesty’s Inspectors is in general the same
as in England and Wales; the content and balance of the curriculum is kept under
continuous review by the Consultative Committee on the Curriculum. Provision
is made, where appropriate, for the teaching of Gaelic. Northern Ireland has a
Schools Curriculum Committee which works in close liaison with the Schools
Council; the Inspectorate of the Department of Education helps and advises
teachers and inspects and evaluates the work of all schools.
In England and Wales by law all children in county or voluntary schools receive
religious instruction and take part in a daily corporate act of worship unless their
parents choose otherwise. In county schools, and sometimes in voluntary
schools, religious instruction of a non-denominational character is given which
may include the study of comparative religions. In all kinds of voluntary school
there is opportunity for denominational instruction. In Scotland, subject to
safeguards for the individual conscience, religious instruction must be given,
but the content is determined by education authorities and by the schools
themselves. Roman Catholic children generally have their own schools. In
controlled schools in Northern Ireland clergy have a right of access which may
be used for denominational instruction; in voluntary schools corporate worship
and religious education are controlled by the management authorities.
The content, balance and breadth of the school curriculum, the extent to which
it meets national needs, and the question of educational standards have been the
subject of continuing public interest in recent years. A number of initiatives have
been taken, by the Government and others, to stimulate discussion and review.
There is a general concern that each school’s curriculum should meet the
needs of the individual and of modern Britain, and that there should be a
coherent and soundly-based means of assessment for individual pupils, for
schools, and for the educational system as a whole. The period of rapid change
and experiment in the school curriculum and teaching methods has given way
to one of re-appraisal. The new methods (such as the child-centred approach,
mixed-ability teaching and integrated and new subjects) have become a
standard part of teaching practice in some schools, while others have retained
traditional approaches and many a mixture of the two.
The Assessment of Performance Unit of the Department of Education and
Science, which promotes the development of methods of assessing and monitor¬
ing the performance of children at school, has commissioned research teams to
develop tests suitable for national monitoring in English language, mathematics
and science. The first national survey of mathematics performance involved
samples of 13,000 primary and 13,000 secondary school children. Language
monitoring began in 1979 anc^ being followed by science monitoring in 1980.
At the same time the Unit is being asked to devise tests to set national standards
in reading, writing and arithmetic.
In the majority of schools, teachers and pupils make use of a range of educational
aids to assist the processes of teaching and learning. In addition to printed
resources, these also include audio-visual aids of every kind which may be
commercially made or produced in a resource centre, either within the school or
in one serving all the schools in a local education authority’s area. Educational
broadcasting is of major importance. Almost all the schools are able to receive
radio and television programmes. Flexibility in use is increased when these are
recorded; most educational radio programmes are used in this way and an
increasing number of educational television programmes are also used in

recorded form. In addition the British Broadcasting Corporation produces a
large number of radiovision programmes which, in effect, are low cost tape/slide
units. Teachers’ notes and pupils’ pamphlets accompany many broadcast series.
Each year more than 500 hours of school radio and 600 hours of school tele¬
vision are transmitted by the BBC and the Independent Broadcasting Authority.
The Council for Educational Technology for the United Kingdom and the
Educational Foundation for Visual Aids, among their other functions, advise
those connected with education on the use of audio-visual aids. In Scotland this
function is undertaken by the Scottish Council for Educational Technology.
Computers are increasingly used to assist learning, to plan timetables, and in
the management of courses.
Ihere is no national school-leaving examination in England and Wales, but
secondary school pupils may attempt examinations, in various subjects, leading
to the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) or the General Certificate of
Education (GCE). Both the CSE and the GCE Ordinary ('O’) level are designed
for pupils completing five years of secondary schooling and are normally taken
at the age of 16. The GCE Advanced (‘A’) level is normally taken after a further
two years study. The CSE is controlled by 14 regional examining boards while
the GCE examinations are conducted by eight independent examining boards,
most of them connected with a university. Entries for GCE examinations are
accepted from candidates at further education establishments and from candi¬
dates entering privately.
The highest grade in the CSE (grade 1) is widely accepted as being of the
same standard as at least grade C at GCE 'O’ level and these are the qualifying
grades for entry to further education and training. The ‘A’ level examination
is the standard for entrance to higher education, university and to many forms
of professional training. The examination system has been widely discussed for
some years by the Schools Council and others and among suggestions for change
is the introduction of an additional examination, the Certificate of Extended
Education (CEE), to be taken after a one-year course by young people who stay
on in full-time education after 16 but for whom ‘A’ levels are not suited. The
Government is to review the whole examination system (including the proposed
CEE) in the light of further consultations and advice, with a special regard to the
maintenance of standards.
In Scotland examinations are conducted by the Scottish Certificate of Educa¬
tion Examination Board. School pupils in the fourth year of secondary courses
sit an examination at 16 years for the Ordinary grade of the Scottish Certificate
of Education, and pupils in the fifth or sixth year are presented for the Higher
grade. Passes at the Higher grade are the basis for entry to university or pro¬
fessional training. For those who have completed their main studies at the
Higher grade but wish to continue their studies in particular subjects there is a
Certificate of Sixth Year Studies. Proposals have been made for the development
of courses suitable for less able pupils who do not take or achieve a low grade in
the O grade examination as well as courses more challenging than ‘O’ grade
for particularly able pupils.
^ In Northern Ireland candidates may take the Northern Ireland General
Certificate of Education or the Northern Ireland Certificate of Secondary
Education, which are equivalent to those examinations in England and Wales.
I he International Baccalaureate, which is offered to sixth formers by several
educational institutions in Britain, leads either to a diploma, or to separate
subject certificates, the latter being recognised for admission to higher education
in Britain and many other countries.

Physical education, including organised games, is part of the curriculum of all
schools. Those receiving financial assistance from public funds must have the
use of a playing field, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium.
The Department of Health and Social Security is responsible for the medical
inspection of school children and for advice and treatment of specific medical
and dental problems associated with children of school age.
Local education authorities must provide free school milk, normally one-
third of a pint (0-19 litre), on each school day, for all pupils in maintained special
schools, pupils up to seven years in other maintained schools, and, on health
grounds, to pupils up to eleven. They have discretionary powers to provide
free milk for all other junior pupils in maintained schools. The authorities must
also provide for all day pupils in maintained schools a midday meal at a sub¬
sidised charge (which is remitted in cases of need). Under certain conditions the
authorities must provide free school transport, and they have discretionary
powers to assist financially in the provision of transport for pupils between their
home and school. Legislative proposals before Parliament would relax the
obligation on authorities to provide school milk, meals and free transport.
Local education authorities and voluntary bodies (in Scotland education
authorities) are responsible, under the general supervision of the central depart¬
ments, for providing the schools and other buildings needed for public education
in their areas. The central departments determine the maximum size of the
authorities’ individual programmes in the light of national priorities; they also
offer guidance to authorities in various ways.
Since 1945 an extensive school building programme has been carried out
resulting in the completion of about 16,300 new schools in Britain, together with
extensions, alterations and remodelling of existing schools; over 9 million new
places have been provided.
Grants of up to 85 per cent of the approved cost are normally available from
the Department of Education and Science or the Welsh Office for the building
of new voluntary aided schools and for alterations and external repairs to existing
aided schools. In Northern Ireland capital grants of 85 per cent are available
for voluntary schools managed by maintained school committees and voluntary
grammar schools which have entered into an agreement under statutory
provisions.
The school building programme has provided for new ideas and methods in
design and construction. Industrialised building techniques have been widely
adopted. New schools are designed to be light, airy and colourful as well as to
have enough teaching area and space for auxiliary activities and outdoor games.
Space is being used more flexibly, particularly in primary schools to meet the
needs of new teaching methods.
Education for those who have left school is organised very flexibly. It is available
to everyone above school-leaving age, is provided at all levels and may be
part-time or full-time, vocational or non-vocational.
More than a third of young people receive some form of post-school education
compared with a fifth in 1965. Many courses lead to recognised qualifications,
varying from degrees and professional qualifications through technician level to
qualifications similar to those obtained before leaving school. Further education
is a broad term usually taken to refer to all post-school education outside the
universities. Higher education (postgraduate, first-degree and similar level
work) is provided at universities and on advanced courses at polytechnics and
other establishments of higher and further education. Adults of every age make

extensive use of facilities for the educational and cultural leisure activities
included under the term ‘adult education’ (see p 161).
The principal institutions of post-school education are the 45 universities (see
p 158); the 30 polytechnics in England and Wales and the 14 Scottish central
institutions, in which advanced (or higher) courses outside the universities are
increasingly being concentrated; the Ulster Polytechnic in Northern Ireland;
and well over 600 other colleges which are maintained or assisted from public
funds, some of which provide a very wide range of courses, while others con¬
centrate on particular subjects. These colleges include the ‘liberal arts’ colleges
and institutions of higher education in England and Wales into which the former
colleges of education (for teacher training) have been assimilated. All these
institutions offer courses leading to recognised qualifications, while their premises
as well as school and other premises are often also used for adult education.
Apart from the universities, most establishments of post-school education
are maintained and administered by the local education authorities. The
Scottish central institutions, however, the Scottish colleges of education and
the Ulster Polytechnic do not come under the control of the education authorities,
but are managed by independent governing bodies, representative of the
authorities and other appropriate interests.
In addition, there are many independent specialist establishments, such as
secretarial colleges, correspondence colleges and colleges teaching English as a
foreign language; a number of voluntary bodies and private undertakings
providing cultural and general education, sometimes with financial or other
assistance from local education authorities; and a large number of other
education and training schemes run by public or private organisations.
Most establishments for post-school education are either maintained or assisted
from public funds. Where industrial training is provided by a college, the
charges are the responsibility of the employer, and broadly reflect the economic
cost of provision.
Although largely dependent on public funds, the universities are guaranteed
as autonomous institutions by a special financial arrangement. The University
Grants Committee is appointed by the Secretary of State for Education and
Science to advise on State aid to the universities; its members are drawn from
the academic and business worlds. This body acts as a link and buffer between
the Government from which it receives a block grant and the universities to
which it allocates this grant. So, although the Government is responsible for
financing over 90 per cent of universities’ expenditure (universities or colleges
within universities may have their own investments, endowments and budgets),
it does not control their work or teaching. The Open University (see p 159) is
financed directly by the Department of Education and Science and in Northern
Ireland government grants are made direct to the universities by the Depart¬
ment of Education on the advice of the University Grants Committee.
Well over 839,000 students take full-time and sandwich courses (courses where
substantial periods of full-time study alternate with periods of supervised experi¬
ence on a relevant job) at universities and other major establishments of further
education in Britain (1976-77 figures). Of these about 279,000 are at universities
while another 245,000 follow advanced courses outside universities, at colleges
of further and higher education, polytechnics and Scottish central institutions.
More than 314,000 take non-advanced courses, most of them studying for
recognised vocational or educational qualifications.

Additionally, there are over 3-3 million part-time students, over 600,000 of
whom are released by their employers for further education during working
hours. Many of the remainder take part in adult education classes (see p 161).
Many full-time students are helped by awards from public funds. These awards
are mandatory for most students taking first-degree and other comparable
courses who qualify under national rules. (Grants for other courses may be
given at the discretion of a local education authority.) They are assessed to cover
tuition fees and a maintenance grant, but where parents can afford to contribute
towards the cost this is taken into account. In England and Wales these awards
are made by local education authorities up to first-degree level; in Scotland by
the Scottish Education Department; and in Northern Ireland by the education
and library boards. Grants for postgraduate study and research are offered by the
education departments and the research councils. In all, about 90 per cent of
full-time students on advanced courses receive help from public funds. Some
scholarships are available from endowments and from particular industries or
companies.
The provision for higher education has almost tripled in size since i960. It
caters for about 500,000 full-time and sandwich students and about 250,000
part-time students through a variety of courses and in a variety of institutions.
More than 12 per cent of 18-year-olds enter courses of higher education. This
expansion has been achieved by creating ten new universities and by developing
a number of colleges into universities; by forming 30 polytechnics specialising
in advanced work out of further education colleges; and by expanding the size of
all these institutions. Colleges of education which specialised in training
teachers were expanded rapidly to cope with the rising numbers of pupils in
schools but faced with the prospect of a fall in numbers (due to a fall in the
birthrate) some have been closed while many have been amalgamated with
other colleges, leading in some cases to the development of institutes or colleges
of higher education providing a range of courses.
The number of students taking full-time and sandwich courses (excluding
teacher training) is evenly divided between science-based and arts-based courses;
although this is not a matter for explicit government policy, it has been the subject
of much public discussion.
There are 45 universities in Britain, including the Open University, compared
with 17 in 1945.
The English universities are: Aston (Birmingham), Bath, Birmingham,
Bradford, Bristol, Brunei (London), Cambridge, City (London), Durham,
East Anglia, Essex, Exeter, Hull, Keele, Kent at Canterbury, Lancaster, Leeds,
Leicester, Liverpool, London, Loughborough, Manchester, Newcastle upon
Tyne, Nottingham, Oxford, Reading, Salford, Sheffield, Southampton, Surrey,
Sussex, Warwick, and York. The London Graduate School of Business Studies
and the Manchester Business School also have university status. The federated
University of Wales includes five university colleges, the Welsh National
School of Medicine, and the University of Wales Institute of Science and
Technology. The Scottish universities are: Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Heriot-Watt (Edinburgh), St. Andrews, Stirling, and Strathclyde
(Glasgow). In Northern Ireland there are the Queen’s University of Belfast, and
the New University of Ulster in Coleraine.
The universities of Oxford and Cambridge date from the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and the Scottish universities of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
EDUCATION I59
Aberdeen and Edinburgh from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. All the
other universities were founded in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries.
Admission to universities is by examination or by selection. Prospective
candidates for nearly all the universities apply for places through the Universities
Central Council on Admissions. The only students to apply directly are
applicants to the Open University and British candidates who apply only to the
universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen and Strathclyde.
Most students at universities are undergraduates: in 1977-78 there were
about 280,525 full-time university students in Britain, including over 48,871
postgraduates. Just under a half lived in colleges and halls of residence, over
one-third were in privately rented accommodation, and the remainder lived at
home. There were about 32,209 full-time university teachers paid wholly from
university funds. The ratio of staff to students was about one to eight or nine,
one of the most favourable in the world.
Except at the Open University, first-degree courses are mainly full-time and
usually last three or four years, though medical and veterinary courses may
require five or six. In spite of the extension of facilities for obtaining a degree in
other ways the majority of students on full-time first-degree courses are at
universities (the non-university sector offers a variety of other higher-education
courses besides degrees).
Actual degree titles vary according to the practice of each university; in
England and Wales the commonest titles for a first degree are Bachelor of Arts
(BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) and for a second degree Master of Arts
(MA), Master of Science (MSc), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD); while in Scotland
Master is used for a first degree. On the other hand, uniformity of standards
between universities is promoted by the practice of employing outside examiners
for all university examinations, and the general pattern of teaching (a com¬
bination of lectures, small group seminars or tutorials with practical classes
where necessary) is fairly similar throughout Britain.
In addition to the universities, there is the University College at Buckingham
which opened in 1976 and which receives no assistance from public funds. It
does not yet award degrees, but its Licence has been accepted as the equivalent
of a degree by relevant professional bodies and by other universities for admission
to postgraduate studies.
The Open University is a non-residential university which provides part-time
degree and other courses, using a combination of television and radio broad¬
casts, correspondence courses and summer schools, together with a network of
viewing and listening centres. No formal academic qualifications are required to
register for these courses, but the standards of its degrees are the same as those
of other universities. The university’s first degree, the BA (Open), is a general
degree awarded on a system of credits for each course completed; the average
amount of study needed for a full course is estimated at 12 to 14 hours a week.
The first courses began in 1971, and in 1979 some 75,040 undergraduate and
over 7,000 associate students were following courses. About 5,322 people a year
obtain degrees from the Open University—about 1 in 14 of the total for Britain.
The university also has a consultancy service to make its advice and facilities
available on a fee-paying but non-profit-making basis to bodies throughout the
world.
Teacher Training In order to teach in a maintained school in England and Wales all new entrants
to teaching must generally have taken a course of professional teacher training.
From 1980 onwards the most usual route to a teaching qualification will, for
The Open
University
l6o BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
non-graduates, be by way of a three- or four-year course leading to the Bachelor
of Education degree; for graduates it will be by way of a one-year postgraduate
Certificate of Education course. Teacher training is being integrated with the
rest of higher education with training places concentrated in polytechnics,
institutes or colleges of higher education and universities.
In response to the change in demand for newly trained teachers, caused by
restrictions on public expenditure and the decline in the size of the school
population, the number of teacher-training places planned for 1981 has been
considerably cut.
In Scotland all teachers in education authority and grant-aided schools must
be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. All teachers of
academic subjects in Scottish secondary schools must be graduates.
Teacher training capacity in Scotland has also been reduced because of
demographic trends but is being maintained in the ten separate colleges estab¬
lished for this purpose. Courses in colleges of education lead to the award of a
Teaching Qualification (Primary Education) or a Teaching Qualification
(Secondary Education). Graduates and holders of specialist diplomas undergo
a one-year course; courses in practical and aesthetic subjects for non-graduates
extend to two, three or four years. Most Scottish colleges of education also offer
four-year courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Education.
In Northern Ireland teacher training takes place in the two university educa¬
tion departments, three colleges of education, the Ulster Polytechnic and one
technical college. The principal courses are three-year (certificate) and four-
year (Bachelor of Education) but there are also one-year courses for graduates or
holders of other appropriate qualifications.
Increased importance is being given to the continued professional education
of practising teachers in Britain, and local authorities, universities and colleges
provide a variety of in-service courses.
Other Advanced In 1977-78 about 339,000 students, including part-time students, were taking
Courses advanced courses other than in universities in a wide variety of subjects, includ¬
ing architecture, art and design, catering, engineering, natural sciences, social
work and business and management studies and teacher training. An increasing
proportion of the students were taking courses leading to the awards of the
Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA). The Council has power to
award degrees and other academic qualifications, comparable in standard with
those granted by universities, to students who successfully complete approved
courses of study in establishments which do not have the power to award their
own degrees. The courses range from science and technology to the arts, social
studies, business studies and law, but the proportion of technological, business
or other broadly vocational courses is much higher than in universities.
In England and Wales a major contribution to higher education provision is
being made by 30 major national institutions named ‘polytechnics’. These
provide all types of courses (full-time, sandwich and part-time) on a wide range
of subjects at all levels, though the trend is towards a concentration on advanced
work. In Scotland similar provision is made in 14 central institutions and a few
further education colleges managed by education authorities, though there is a
tendency for the Scottish establishments to specialise more by subjects than do
the English polytechnics. In Northern Ireland such higher education provision
is concentrated within the Ulster Polytechnic.
The institutes and colleges of higher education, formed as the result of the
integration of teacher training with the rest of further education, account for a
significant proportion of higher education students, and some other further
EDUCATION

education colleges have some higher education courses, usually of a specialised
nature.
The British education systems offer facilities for obtaining all types of vocational
education and training, to both school leavers and adults, and are notable for
providing alternative routes to higher qualifications for those who have found
themselves unable to continue full-time education after leaving school.
Many broadly vocational educational courses are available at the polytechnics
and the 600 or so further and higher education colleges. Some university courses
have always had close links with certain industries and professions and these
links have grown.
There is a wide variety of courses for people in various trades and occupations,
leading to nationally recognised qualifications at the end of courses of up to five
years. At technician level the Technician Education Council (TEC) has responsi¬
bility for developing a unified system of courses in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland and courses leading to TEC certificates and diplomas and higher
certificates and diplomas are replacing those formerly available. (TEC higher
diplomas approach the standard of a pass degree.) A similar council has been
established in Scotland.
Many further education colleges offer courses in shorthand, typing, book¬
keeping, and office studies. More advanced business studies are generally
available in polytechnics and some other colleges. The further education sector
makes a major contribution to management education at all levels (for example,
courses for the postgraduate Diploma in Management Studies for those with
experience of the work are run by about 75 colleges) and this work in England
and Wales is co-ordinated by 12 regional management centres.
Much business education is related to the specialised examination require¬
ments of various professional bodies, and courses leading to them are provided
in many colleges, although numbers of candidates seeking such qualifications do
so through correspondence courses. There is a Business Education Council with
the same functions as the Technician Education Council (see above) in relation
to courses of business education. In Scotland, similar courses lead to the
Scottish National Certificate, the Scottish Higher National Certificate and the
Scottish National Diploma in Business Studies, awarded by the Scottish
Business Education Council.
There is increasing recognition that school and even immediately post-school
education cannot provide for everyone’s needs throughout life, and growing
emphasis is put on opportunities for adults to return to both general and voca¬
tional education and training. The success of the adult literacy campaign, for
example, has given rise to greater interest in basic education for adults and its
continuation into further opportunities for education throughout life.
‘Adult education’ is generally taken to mean courses of post-school education
outside the main areas of higher, professional and technical education. Courses
are provided by local education authorities, certain residential colleges, the adult
education (‘extra-mural’) departments of universities and various voluntary and
statutory bodies.
A major part of adult education is financed by local education authorities and
provided mainly in their establishments, including schools used for adult
evening classes and in some cases in ‘community schools’ which provide educa¬
tional, social and cultural opportunities for the wider community. Most of the
courses are part time. In addition local authorities maintain or aid most of the
short-term residential colleges or centres, of which there are 45 in England and
162 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Wales, and which provide courses varying in length between a weekend and a
fortnight. Many of the courses are practical, but there are widespread opportuni¬
ties for academic study.
Long-term residential colleges (eight in England and Wales, one in Scotland)
which are grant-aided by the central government departments, provide courses
of one or two years, some of which lead to a diploma. The colleges aim to
provide a liberal education and do not apply academic entry tests. Most students
admitted to them are entitled to full maintenance grants.
The adult education departments of the universities and the Workers’
Educational Association (WEA), the largest of the recognised voluntary bodies,
provide extended part-time courses of more academic studies, though recently
the number of short courses organised for special (including vocational) interests
has increased. Often the WEA provides the organisation and the teaching is
provided by the university departments.
There are a large number of other organisations, both national and local,
which provide many kinds of education and training. Several non-political
bodies, such as the National Federation of Women’s Institutes and the National
Council of Young Men’s Christian Associations, receive government grants;
others are commercially or privately financed. Some are open to the public as a
whole, others to a particular group, such as the disabled or the unemployed, or
the employees or members of an organisation.
The National Institute of Adult Education provides a national centre of
information, research and publication for adult education, as well as a channel
of co-operation and consultation for the many interested organisations in
England and Wales. It is mainly financed by contributions from local education
authorities and assisted by a grant from the Department of Education and
Science. The Institute has a government-funded Adult Literacy Unit to act
as a focus for adult literacy work, to commission special projects of relevance to
local authorities, and to assist voluntary projects promoting literacy. The
Scottish Institute of Adult Education is the Institute’s Scottish counterpart.
Teaching The general pattern of teaching and learning on full-time courses at universities
Methods and colleges remains a mixture of lectures, prescribed or suggested reading,
seminars or tutorials, exercises and tests, and, where appropriate, practical work.
Modern educational aids including computers, language laboratories, radio and
television for both teaching and research are widely available at most universities,
polytechnics and colleges.
Radio and television programmes, both specifically educational and general,
are important media for continuing education and are often linked to a range of
supplementary publications, courses and activities. BBC radio study pro¬
grammes are transmitted in half-hour sessions late at night on weekdays and in
a four-hour session on Sunday afternoons. Educational television programmes
are shown on Saturday and Sunday mornings, during the day on weekdays with
some early and late evening transmissions. Both the BBC and independent
television provide programmes which range from basic education and pro¬
gressive vocational training to domestic, social and craft skills. The BBC also
works with the Open University (see p 159), producing and broadcasting radio
and television programmes as part of the courses.
EDUCATIONAL
RESEARCH
Research into the theory and practice of education and the organisation of
educational services is supported financially by the central government educa¬
tion departments, local education authorities, philanthropic organisations,
universities and teachers’ associations. Some research is also sponsored at

EDUCATIONAL
LINKS
OVERSEAS
Educational
Exchanges
163
further education institutions and by a few independent organisations. The
Schools Council and the Social Science Research Council are important channels
for government support.
The major institute undertaking research in education, outside the universi¬
ties, is the National Foundation for Educational Research in England and Wales,
an autonomous body which derives its income mainly from funds received from
research projects and from corporate members, including local education
authorities, teachers’ organisations and universities. It also receives an annual
grant from the Department of Education and Science. There are also the
Scottish Council for Research in Education and the Northern Ireland Council
for Educational Research.
The interchange of ideas and the movement of people between different
countries is an important part of education. School children, students, teachers
and experts come to Britain from overseas to study and many British people
also work and train overseas. Many of the opportunities for such movement are
the result of international co-operation at government level within the European
Community and within the Commonwealth and also of educational schemes,
courses and professional contacts organised by a number of official and voluntary
organisations in Britain. The British aid programme also encourages links
between educational institutions in Britain and in developing countries.
British membership of the European Community is creating closer ties with
other countries. Both in schools and in the colleges and universities there has
been an expansion of interest in European studies and languages. Post-to-post
exchanges of teachers have been encouraged and exchanges take place between
school children and students within the Community. Britain has adhered to the
Statute of the European Schools (nine of which have been established throughout
the Community including one at Culham, Oxfordshire) to provide school educa¬
tion for children of people employed in the European Community institutions.
Three aspects of education being given particular attention within the
Community are foreign language learning, the language and other educational
needs of migrants and their children, and the relationship between education
and working life. In addition, studies are being made of policies of admission to
higher education in member countries.
I he promotion of cultural and educational relations with other countries is a
major concern of the British Council (see p 69) and it plays an important part
in the management of the British aid programme to education. It recruits
teachers for work overseas, organises short visits overseas by British experts and
encourages cultural exchange visits. The Council is also responsible for a variety
of schemes to promote academic interchange including the Academic Links
Scheme between universities and higher education institutions in Britain and
Europe; the Commonwealth University Interchange Scheme; the Academic
Interchange with Europe Scheme; the Young Research Workers Interchange
Scheme; and a number of schemes to encourage exchange between Britain and
individual countries overseas.
The Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges is an independent
foundation financed by the Government which has considerable experience over
the whole range of educational travel and exchange. It is responsible, with the
League for the Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers, for the schemes for the
exchange and interchange of teachers with a number of foreign and Common¬
wealth countries; and for the linking of British schools and local education
authorities and their overseas counterparts. The resulting visits and exchanges
164

have been largely related to the teaching of modern languages, but other areas
of the curriculum have been involved. The Bureau’s publications include a
series of annual guides on visits to other countries for students and teachers and
a journal published each term, called Educational Exchange.
The Inter-University Council for Higher Education Overseas, funded from
the official aid programme, encourages co-operation between universities in
developing countries and in Britain. It assists with staff recruitment, secondment
of staff from British universities, inter-departmental/faculty link schemes, local
staff development, short-term teaching and advisory visits and general con¬
sultative services. The Technical Education and Training Organisation for
Overseas Countries, an agency of the British aid programme, recruits teachers
for work in technical education institutions overseas.
The Association of Commonwealth Universities promotes co-operation
between 222 member universities in 28 Commonwealth countries. It organises
meetings of various kinds, provides information (see below) and academic
appointments services; administers the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan in Britain; and generally promotes the movement of academic
and administrative staff and of students from one country to another.
The Commonwealth Education Liaison Committee supplements normal direct
dealings on education between the countries of the Commonwealth. The United
Kingdom Council for Overseas Student Affairs is an independent body serving
overseas students and organisations and individuals concerned in student affairs.
Students come to Britain from countries throughout the world to study at
universities or other educational institutions or for professional training. In the
academic year 1977-78 there were about 123,760 overseas students in Britain of
whom about 35,890 were at universities, another 50,220 were at further education
colleges and the remainder learning English or training as teachers, nurses, for
the law, banking and accountancy, or in industry. About 43 per cent of all
overseas students were from the Commonwealth and 79 per cent were from
developing countries.
Many of those who come to Britain do so for advanced training. Of the
50,300 students enrolled for full-time postgraduate study or research at British
universities in 1977, 37 per cent came from overseas. Of those working for a
master’s degree 46 per cent came from overseas and of those working for a
doctorate 34 per cent.
The majority of overseas students pay their own fees and expenses or hold
awards from their own governments. In addition, over 13,000 overseas students
were fully supported in 1978 under British technical co-operation with develop¬
ing countries.
A range of public and private scholarships and fellowships are available to
students from overseas (and to British students who want to study overseas).
Among the best known are the British Council Scholarships, the Commonwealth
Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, the Marshall Scholarships and the inde¬
pendently funded Rhodes Scholarship, and the Churchill Scholarships for men
and women in all walks of life. Many British universities and colleges offer
scholarships for which graduates of any nationality are eligible. (The British
Council and the Association of Commonwealth Universities are involved in the
selection of British students for awards offered by many overseas countries.)
The Atlantic College at St Donat’s, south Wales (one of the colleges of the
United World Colleges), provides two-year residential courses for overseas
students prior to their entering university.
The Association of Commonwealth Universities publishes four handbooks

(see Bibliography) which contain information about sources of financial aid

graduates to study or do research overseas).
The continuing increase in interest in English as a foreign language is reflected
in the growth of the number of private language schools and the greater pro¬
portion of these recognised as efficient after inspection by the Department of
Education and Science in collaboration with the British Council. Much of this
demand is for English needed for specific educational or vocational purposes. At
the same time the British Council has greatly expanded the volume of its own
teaching of English overseas by opening new centres in many countries and
extending existing ones. Publications and other material relating to English
language teaching have also increased in number and are now a large component
in publishers’ lists and constitute a major export.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service provides a worldwide
facility for the individual learner in his or her own home.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The aim of the youth service is to promote the social and informal education
of young people by offering them opportunities in their leisure time to mix
socially and to develop and enlarge their range of interests. The service is
provided by a partnership between public authorities and a large variety of
voluntary organisations. Membership of groups is voluntary and there is no
attempt to create anything in the nature of a national youth movement.
The youth service forms part of the education system. Government education
departments formulate broad policy objectives for the service and encourage their
achievement through financial assistance and advice. They assist national and
local voluntary youth organisations through grants towards administrative and
building costs. The Scottish Education Department is advised by the Scottish
Council for Community Education while in Northern Ireland the advisory body
is the Youth Committee for Northern Ireland.
Local education authorities (education and library boards in Northern
Ireland) are responsible for local administration of the youth service. Authorities
provide and run their own youth clubs and centres (some of which are
residential) which may be purpose-built or associated with schools. They also
assist local voluntary youth groups by lending premises and equipment and by
contributing to their capital and running costs. Many authorities have appointed
youth committees on which official and voluntary bodies are represented, and
employ youth organisers to co-ordinate youth work and to arrange in-service
training. In Scotland these committees and organisers are normally concerned
with services for both young people and adults.
Although there are many local education authority youth clubs and centres,
national voluntary organisations still promote the largest share of youth activities
through local groups which raise most of their day-to-day running expenses by
their own efforts. These have an estimated combined membership of over 6
million. They vary greatly in character, some concentrating on social and
recreational pursuits, others on educational or religious activities. Most of the
national organisations in England are members of the National Council of
Voluntary Youth Services, a consultative body which takes action only in the
name and with the consent of its member bodies. The Council has 65 national
l66 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
organisations and 47 local co-ordinating bodies as members. In Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland there are similar representative bodies.
Among the largest of the voluntary youth organisations in membership of
the National Council are the Scout and Girl Guides Associations (with about
600,000 and 800,000 members), the National Association of Youth Clubs
(about 500,000), the National Association of Boys’ Clubs (some 170,000) and
the Youth Hostels Association (about 280,000). The three pre-service organisa¬
tions (the Combined Cadet Force, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps)
are also members. They are financially assisted by the Ministry of Defence and
combine social, educational and physical development with training for possible
entry to the armed forces.
Training of There are some 4,000 full-time youth workers in Britain and these are sup-
Youth Workers ported by many thousands of part-time workers, many of them unpaid. Part-
time workers usually have no professional qualification in youth work but some
have allied qualifications, for instance as teachers, and a large number attend
short courses and conferences on youth work. Qualified school teachers are
recognised as qualified youth workers.
In England and Wales, there is a basic two-year training for youth and
community workers. Provided at certain universities and higher education
colleges, the course leads to the status of a qualified youth and community worker.
In addition a number of teacher training colleges provide a study of youth work
as a principal or subsidiary subject within teacher-training courses. In Scotland
one- and three-year courses are provided at certain colleges of education and in
Northern Ireland courses are provided by the Ulster Polytechnic.
Other The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme, which operates through bodies such
Organisations as local authorities, schools, youth organisations and industrial firms, is designed
Concerned with as a challenge to young people from Britain and other Commonwealth countries
Young People to reach certain standards in leisure-time activities with the voluntary assistance
of adults.
A substantial sum of money is awarded by the many grant-giving foundations
and trusts each year for activities involving young people.
The Royal Jubilee Trusts, formed in 1978 from King George’s Jubilee Trust
(started in 1935 at the time of the Silver Jubilee of King George V) and the
Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust (which arose from the 1977 Queen’s Silver Jubilee
Appeal) exist to support work involving young people aged 8 to 18 (King
George’s Jubilee Trust) and young people up to the age of 25 involved in
community service work (the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Trust). King George’s
Jubilee Trust has distributed over £3-5 million since 1935 and the Queen’s
Silver Jubilee Trust over £600,000 since May 1978.
Community Thousands of young people voluntarily take part in community service designed to
Service by assist those in need, including the elderly and the disabled. Organisations providing
Young People opportunities for community service such as International Voluntary Service, Task
Force and Community Service Volunteers receive grants from the Government.
Many schools also organise community service activities as part of the curriculum.
The Community Projects Foundation is an independent body which advises
interested organisations in England and Wales on methods of involving young
people in providing service to the community. The Foundation is grant-aided
by the Government and employs teams of young people who are available on
request to assist such bodies as local authorities, voluntary organisations and
hospital boards in promoting voluntary service.
8 Planningandtbe
Environment
By comprehensive land-use planning and development control Britain has had
considerable success in resolving the conflicting demands of industry, com¬
merce, housing, transport, agriculture and recreation and in reducing environ¬
mental pollution. There is no ‘national plan’ for urban and land development,
but there is a statutory system of land-use planning applying over the whole
country and to virtually every kind of development, and there are laws dealing
specifically with environmental health and the control of pollution. All develop¬
ment requires local ‘planning permission’, and applications for permission are
dealt with in the light of ‘development plans’ which set out strategies for each
area on such matters as housing, transport, industry and open land. The under-
lying approach is to identify people’s needs and possible ways of meeting them,
and there is a growing move away from narrow land-use allocation towards
broader strategic planning recognising the community’s social and economic
goals.
The system of land-use planning in Great Britain involves a centralised
structure under the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Wales and Scot¬
land, and compulsory planning duties for local planning authorities. The
Department of the Environment brings together the major responsibilities in
England for land-use planning, housing and construction, countryside policy
and environmental protection. The Welsh Office and the Scottish Development
Department have broadly equivalent responsibilities. Large-scale planning in
England and Wales is primarily the responsibility of the county councils and
the Greater London Council while district councils and the councils of the
London boroughs and the City of London are responsible for most local plans
and development control, the main housing functions and many other environ¬
mental health matters. In certain areas of planning, the two types of authority
exercise concurrent powers. In Scotland, planning functions are undertaken by
regional and district councils whose responsibilities are divided on a basis
broadly similar to that in England and Wales. In the more rural regions and
islands areas, all planning responsibilities are carried out by the regional and
islands councils respectively.
In Northern Ireland the Department of the Environment for Northern
Ireland is responsible for planning matters through its local offices which work
closely with the district councils. The councils have local environmental health
responsibilities.
Special provisions, in addition to the general town and country planning
measures, control the location of major industry (see p 221). General problems
of industrial development are dealt with jointly by a number of government
departments, but each development scheme, as a rule, requires the local planning
authority’s consent. Financial incentives from the Government encourage the
location of industry in particular areas.
168
Development
Plans and
Development
Control
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Throughout Britain voluntary organisations take an active interest in planning,
conservation and the control of pollution.
The development plan system in England and Wales involves ‘structure’ and
‘local’ plans. Structure plans are prepared by county planning authorities and
require ministerial approval. They set out broad policies for the development
and other use of land (including measures for the improvement of the physical
environment and traffic management) and indicate ‘action areas’ where compre¬
hensive development or improvement is expected to start within a specified
period. Local plans, which have to conform generally with the structure plan,
contain detailed proposals including plans for ‘action areas’ and are normally
prepared by district councils, though sometimes by county councils. Local plans
are adopted by the planning authorities without being subject to ministerial
approval unless the Secretary of State calls in a plan for his own decision. All
plans are under continuous review and may be altered from time to time.
Scotland has a similar planning system which can include however, the pro¬
duction of a regional report by regional and island authorities, outlining their
broad priorities and policies. In Northern Ireland there is a single-tier system;
plans are prepared by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
Members of the public and interested organisations are given an opportunity
to express their views on the planning of their areas during the formative stages
of the structure and local plans. The local planning authorities must ensure
adequate publicity for matters proposed for inclusion in the plans; representa¬
tions may be made about them to the authorities. These opportunities for public
participation are additional to provisions for objecting to prepared plans. In the
case of structure plans the Secretary of State holds an examination in public of
matters on which he requires more information in order to reach a decision. In
the case of local plans objectors have a right to be heard, and a public local
inquiry is normally held by the planning authorities for this purpose.
Where specific proposals for development differ substantially from the
intentions of a development plan, they must be publicised locally. Other schemes
affecting a large number of people are usually advertised by the local planning
authority and applications seeking permission for certain types of development
must also be advertised. The applicant has a right of appeal to the appropriate
Secretary of State if planning permission is refused or granted subject to condi¬
tions. Most appeals are transferred for decision to inspectors (in Scotland
reporters) appointed by the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State can direct that a planning application be referred to
him for decision. This power is exercised sparingly and usually only in respect
of proposals of national or regional importance. The applicant has the right to
be heard by a person appointed by the Secretary of State and a public inquiry
is normally held for this purpose. In the case of development schemes of national
or regional importance or of a technical or scientific nature, and if an ordinary
inquiry is inadequate for the purpose, the ministers responsible may decide to
set up planning inquiry commissions to carry out investigations and hold
inquiries locally. Where highway development is proposed, the government
minister concerned can hold such inquiries as he considers appropriate.
Similar provision is made in Northern Ireland for public participation in the
planning process and for the hearing of objections. There is a right of appeal to
an independent Planning Appeals Commission.

planning in England, which is carried out with the help of the Regional Economic

Planning Boards. There is a board in each of the eight economic planning regions:
Northern, Yorkshire and Humberside, East Midlands, East Anglia, South East,
South West, West Midlands and North West. The boards consist of senior
officials in the regions of the government departments concerned with aspects of
regional planning; they co-ordinate the regional work of departments.
Scotland has an Economic Council, which is the main source of advice and
consultation on all matters affecting economic development, and an Economic
Planning Board which has produced national planning guidelines indicating land
use issues of concern to the Secretary of State; Northern Ireland has an Economic
Council.
New Towns The new towns represent one of the most successful achievements of recent
British planning. The policy behind their creation was mainly one of encouraging
the gradual dispersal of industry and population from congested cities to new
areas, planned in advance to become self-contained towns with services and
amenities within convenient distance of the whole community. Since 1946,
32 new towns have been designated, and nearly a million people have gone to
live in them.
A government review of the new towns policy, undertaken against a back¬
ground of substantial reductions in population forecasts and a need to pay more
attention to the regeneration of declining inner city areas (see p 171), has led to a
reduction in the long-term target populations of some towns. The momentum
of new town development is to be substantially maintained, however, over the
next few years.
Of the 32 new towns, most of which had as a nucleus an existing town or
village, 21 are in England, 2 in Wales, 5 in Scotland and 4 in Northern Ireland.
The planning and growth of each new town is supervised by a government-
appointed development corporation which is given general powers to acquire,
by compulsory purchase if necessary, land or property needed for the provision
of houses, factories and other buildings and for roads and essential services.
In England four of the substantially completed new towns are the responsibi¬
lity of the Commission for the New Towns, a government-appointed agency.
Target dates for the dissolution of a further eight new towns development
corporations by the early 1980s have been announced. Housing and related
assets in the Commission towns and six other first generation new towns were
transferred to the district councils concerned in April 1978. In Wales respon¬
sibility for one of the two new towns has been taken over by the Development
Board for Rural Wales. In Northern Ireland, development of the new towns
has been incorporated in a new District Towns Strategy which is the respon¬
sibility of the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland.
The capital cost is advanced from public funds and is repayable over 60 years.
Parliament has approved a fund to provide for advances to the development
corporations, which, for Great Britain, stands at £3,250 million, of which
£2,570 million had been advanced by the end of 1978. The Government plans
substantial disposals of the completed assets of the new towns in order to release
resources for investment and to reduce the involvement of the public sector.
The new towns have a total population of over 2 million. Young people form
a somewhat higher proportion than in the population of the country as a whole.
Several of the more developed towns are becoming regional centres and, as the
populations grow large enough to give the necessary support, offices, hotels and
department stores, as well as art centres and full entertainment and recreational
facilities, are gradually being provided. The new towns programme has included
the expansion of large existing towns such as Northampton, Peterborough and
Inner City
Policies

Warrington; this has the advantage, among others, that many facilities are
already available.
Town development (or ‘expanding town’) schemes involve the transfer of
people and industry from overcrowded areas to existing towns suitable for
expansion; these are arranged directly between the local authorities of the towns
concerned. The same consideration which led to the review of the new towns
has made it necessary to review all outstanding town development schemes, as a
result of which many are being curtailed. Most of the towns expanded under
town development schemes (for example, Aylesbury, Basingstoke, Swindon and
Thetford) are well established and are providing homes, jobs and amenities for
people from large cities.
Revitalising the inner areas of many towns and cities presents one of the most
important challenges to modern British planning. Past policies have produced
many successes (most of the slums have been replaced, much old housing has
been improved and the clean air legislation has enhanced the general environ¬
ment and public health) but old problems of poor housing, and in some areas
congestion, have still to be overcome. In many areas they have been joined by
problems of high unemployment, decay and dereliction and unbalanced popula¬
tion structures with relatively high proportions of the elderly and the dis¬
advantaged. The extent of these problems varies from place to place, and the
inter-relationship between them is complex. Government policy is not to seek a
universal solution but to work out for each city the package of measures that is
most likely to improve conditions.
Greater resources and priority have been given to the inner city areas. The
Inner Urban Areas Act 1978 gave powers to selected inner city local authorities
to support the creation of new employment opportunities and to improve the
environment of industrial areas. The urban aid programme has been increased
from a 1977-78 level in England and Wales of under £30 million a year to
£140 million a year in 1979-80 (in Scotland from about £7 million a year to
£21 million a year by 1980-81). The programme traditionally complemented
the work of major social programmes by providing extra facilities which would
otherwise not have been available, such as day nurseries, centres for the elderly
and language classes for immigrants, but has been recast so as to cover industrial,
commercial, environmental and recreational provision as well. The urban
programme represents only a small part of the central assistance to urban, and
other, local authorities. The main contribution is through the annual ‘rate
support’ grant, transport supplementary grant (in England and Wales only),
housing subsidy and other programmes. The Government also provided j£ioo
million for inner city construction work between 1977 and 1979.
A co-ordinated ‘partnership’ approach has been adopted in seven English
areas whereby central and local government work together to tackle places
where the problems are greatest. Each partnership has a three-year action
programme rolled forward annually, which is based on the needs of the area and
its particular priorities. Partnerships receive allocations of urban programme
resources ranging from ^7 million to £20 million a year. To meet the particular
problems and opportunities of the London docklands and the Merseyside dock
area the Government intends to set up urban development corporations, to be
modelled on the New Town Development Corporations. Elsewhere in England
15 areas have been identified where the problems are on a slightly smaller scale
but still merit special attention. These areas prepare their own inner city
programmes and like the partnerships receive special allocations of urban
programme resources. Additional resources are also made available to a further

14 English and five Welsh districts designated under the Inner Urban Areas
Act.
In Scotland a major urban renewal exercise in Glasgow to regenerate the city’s
east end is organised on somewhat similar lines to the partnership areas in
England, and a further eight Scottish districts have been designated under the
Inner Urban Areas Act. In Northern Ireland a special effort is being made to
tackle Belfast’s inner city problems.
Lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest are compiled, as
required by the planning Acts, by the Secretary of State for the Environment
and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales; nearly 290,000 buildings are
already listed. It is an offence to demolish or alter the character of any listed
building without special consent from the local planning authority or the
appropriate Secretary of State; where consent is given to demolish a building,
the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (for England) and similar
bodies for Scotland and Wales have an opportunity to make a photographic
record of the building. Emergency ‘building preservation notices’ can be served
by the local planning authority to protect buildings not yet listed.
The respective Secretaries of State (on the recommendation of the appropriate
Historic Buildings Council) can make grants and loans for the repair or main¬
tenance of buildings (or groups of buildings) of outstanding interest, and local
authorities can make grants and loans for any building of architectural or
historic interest even if it is not listed. A Government-sponsored Architectural
Heritage Fund provides loans for local historic buildings trusts.
Local planning authorities have designated for special protection over 4,000
‘conservation areas’ of particular architectural or historic interest. Grants and
loans are available for works for the preservation or enhancement of outstanding
conservation areas.
The Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales are
responsible for the maintenance of royal parks and palaces and for the protection
of ancient monuments of which about 800 are in their care. The Ancient Monu¬
ment Boards recommend which monuments are considered to be of national
importance and therefore worthy of preservation.
In Northern Ireland 144 historic monuments are maintained and protected by
the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, which acts on the
advice of the Historic Buildings Council in listing buildings of special archi¬
tectural or historic interest, paying grants for their repair and maintenance and
designating conservation areas.
The local planning authorities have power to protect trees and woodlands in
the interest of amenity by means of tree preservation orders. When granting
planning permission for development, a local planning authority must, where
appropriate, impose conditions to secure the preservation or planting of trees.
Landowners are generally required to replace ‘preserved’ trees, which die or
are removed or destroyed in contravention of a preservation order.
In order to restrict the further sprawl of large built-up areas, to prevent
adjacent towns merging into one another, and in some cases to preserve the
character of a town and the amenities of the countryside, ‘green belts’ (areas
where it is intended that the land should be left open and free from building
development and where people can seek recreation) have been established or
proposed on the fringes of certain urban areas. Much of London’s green belt,
for example, is agricultural land or woodland, some of which can be used for

recreation. There are also areas specifically for recreational use, such as country
parks, public open spaces, playing fields and golf courses.
The maritime local planning authorities are responsible for planning land use
at the coast providing, for example, recreational facilities and amenities for
holidaymakers and local residents; at the same time they attempt to safeguard
and enhance the coast’s natural attractions and preserve coastal areas of scientific
interest.
A comprehensive study of the coastline of England and Wales, undertaken by
the Countryside Commission in 1966-70, recommended that certain stretches of
undeveloped coast of particular scenic beauty should be treated as heritage coast.
There is a practical programme aimed at the designation of 42 such coasts which
together would cover over 1,300 kilometres (808 miles), some 40 per cent of the
undeveloped coastline. Jointly with local authorities, the Commission has defined
33 of these coasts so far, protecting just over 1,000 kilometres (621 miles).
In 1965 the National Trust (see p 182) launched its Enterprise Neptune
campaign to raise funds for the nation to acquire stretches of coastline of great
natural beauty and recreational value. More than £3 million has been raised
so far and as a result the Trust has under its protection 622 kilometres (387
miles) of coastline in England and Wales. Some 127 kilometres (79 miles) of
coast in Scotland are protected by conservation agreements with the National
Trust for Scotland. In Northern Ireland 56 kilometres (35 miles) of coast and
coastal path have been acquired.
In exceptional cases economic arguments override conservation; the develop¬
ment needs of North Sea oil and gas are making a major impact on remote and
unspoiled coastal areas in Scotland, for instance, but planning guidelines drawn
up by the Scottish Development Department aim to ensure that oil-related
activities are sited so as to make the best use of existing labour and infra¬
structure and to minimise the effect on the coastline. Provision has also been
made for funds to be set aside for the restoration of sites once there is no further
need for them.
The protection of the coastline against erosion, for which the Department
of the Environment, the Welsh Office and the Scottish Office are centrally
responsible in Great Britain, presents difficult engineering problems and heavy
costs for the maritime local authorities. All sizeable coast protection schemes
drawn up by the authorities under the Coast Protection Act 1949 are in¬
vestigated by government engineering staff. Substantial grants from central
funds (up to a maximum of 79 per cent) may be made to the authorities. Pro¬
tection against sea flooding where there is no question of erosion is the
responsibility of the water authorities (see pp 274 and 285). To help to prevent
the pollution of the sea and coastline, international conventions restrict the
discharge of oil into the sea (see p 179).
The display of outdoor advertisements is controlled by planning legislation.
General consents have been issued for certain classes of advertisement but these
can be withdrawn in particular cases where there is a serious threat to amenity or
public safety. Consent for advertisements outside these classes must be sought
from the local planning authority. Rural areas and urban areas requiring special
protection can be designated as areas of special control which may impose more
restrictive standards.
Two Countryside Commissions (one for England and Wales, the other for
Scotland) are responsible for encouraging and promoting measures to conserve
174 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and enhance the natural beauty and amenity of the countryside and for en¬
couraging the development of facilities for open-air recreation in the countryside.
These include the provision by local authorities (sometimes in association with
other bodies) and private individuals of country parks within easy reach of
towns; the establishment of camping sites and picnic areas; and the increased
use of reservoirs, canals and other waterways for bathing, sailing and other
activities. Some 150 country parks and 200 picnic sites have been recognised in
England and Wales by the Countryside Commission. In Scotland a large number
of local authority schemes for the provision of a variety of countryside facilities
have been approved for grant aid. The Commissions may undertake research
projects and experimental schemes, working in consultation with local authorities
and such bodies as the Nature Conservancy Council (see p 175) and the Sports
Councils (see p 421). In England and Wales, the Countryside Commission may
give financial assistance to public bodies and individuals carrying out countryside
recreation and amenity projects. Attention is increasingly being given to
techniques of countryside management to supplement the statutory planning
controls.
National Parks
and Areas of
Outstanding
Natural Beauty
The Countryside Commission (for England and Wales) is empowered to
designate, for confirmation by the appropriate minister, national parks and
‘areas of outstanding natural beauty’ and to make proposals for the creation of
long-distance footpaths and bridleways. Ten national parks have been estab¬
lished: Northumberland, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, the North
York Moors and the Peak District in northern England; Snowdonia, the
Pembrokeshire Coast and the Brecon Beacons in Wales; Exmoor and Dart¬
moor in south-west England. They cover some 13,600 sq km (5,250 square
miles), or 9 per cent of the area of England and Wales. Administration is the
responsibility of special committees or planning boards which carry out all or
most of the planning functions. Some 33 areas of outstanding natural beauty have
been designated, covering some 14,500 sq km (5,600 square miles).
The land in these designated areas generally remains privately owned, but
agreements or orders to secure additional public access may be made by local
authorities. Steps are taken to preserve and enhance the landscape’s natural
beauty by high standards of development control, and by positive measures,
for which grants are available, such as tree planting and preservation, and the
removal of eyesores. In the national parks, other measures for the benefit of the
public include the provision of car parks, camping and caravan areas, and
information centres. All national parks and some other designated areas have
warden services. Most local authority expenditure on national parks is met by
central government grants. Some 2,528 km (1,580 miles) of long-distance
footpaths and bridleways have been approved. Large stretches of these paths are
already public rights of way.
In Northern Ireland the Ulster Countryside Committee advises on the
preservation of amenities and the designation of areas of outstanding natural
beauty. Eight areas of outstanding natural beauty have been designated and six
areas are being managed as country parks.
Although there are no national parks in Scotland, there are five national
park direction areas, in which all except minor planning applications are subject
to scrutiny by the Secretary of State. The areas are: Loch Lomond—Trossachs;
Glen Affric-Glen Cannich-Strathfarrar; Ben Nevis-Glen Coe-Black Mount;
the Cairngorms; and Loch Torridon-Loch Maree-Little Loch Broom.
Ministerial supervision, with the advice of the Countryside Commission for
Scotland, is exercised over planning permission in ‘areas of special planning

control’ which are areas of particular beauty, designated by the Secretary of
State. One such area forms part of the Pentland Hills to the south of Edin¬
burgh. Over 98 per cent of the land in Scotland has been designated as country¬
side within the jurisdiction of the Countryside Commission for Scotland.
The Forestry Commission (see p 291) has formed, and opened to the public,
seven forest parks in some of the finest country in Great Britain: Argyll,
Galloway, Glen More and the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park in Scotland; the
Forest of Dean and the Wye valley woods on the borders of England and
Wales; Snowdonia in Wales; and the Border Forest Park on the borders of
England and Scotland. They cover some 243,000 hectares (600,000 acres), and
camping and other recreational facilities are provided in all of them. The
historic New Forest, in Hampshire, although not a forest park, is also open to
the public. The Forestry Commission and Hampshire County Council jointly
manage the Queen Elizabeth County Park in Hampshire. In addition the
Forestry Commission welcomes the public to much of the land under its
management. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture has estab¬
lished six forest parks (Tollymore, Castlewellan, Gortin Glen, Drum Manor,
Gosford and Glenariff) and there are also forest scenic drives and many
recreational facilities in these and other forests.
County councils in England and Wales are required to prepare definitive maps
showing all public rights of way (footpaths and bridleways), which must be
kept free of obstruction. If a path is not shown on the map, a private citizen may
claim that it is a public right of way if it has been used and regarded as such
without hindrance for at least 20 years. Public footpaths are maintained by local
authorities who must also provide signposts and supervise landowners’ duties to
repair stiles and gates. Local authorities in Great Britain can create paths, close
existing paths no longer needed for public use and divert paths to secure either a
shorter route or the efficient use of land. Local planning authorities can also
convert minor roads into footpaths or bridleways to improve the amenities of
their area.
I here is no automatic right of public access to open country, although many
landowners permit such access more or less freely. Local planning authorities
can secure access by means of agreements with landowners; if agreements
cannot be obtained, authorities may acquire land or make orders for public
access. Similar powers cover Scotland.
Common land, a large proportion of which is open to the public, totals an
estimated 600,000 hectares (1-5 million acres) in England and Wales. (There is
no common land in Scotland or Northern Ireland.) This land is usually privately
owned, but people other than the owner have various rights on or over it, for
example, of pasture for farm animals. Commons are protected by law and
cannot be built on or enclosed without the consent of the Secretaries of State
for the Environment or Wales. The Commons Registration Act 1965 provided
for the registration of all commons and village greens. Under the Countryside
Act 1968 local authorities can provide facilities for enjoyment on any common
land to which the public has access.
The official body responsible for nature conservation in Great Britain is the
Nature Conservancy Council which has the functions of establishing, main¬
taining and managing nature reserves, advising ministers, providing general
information and advice, and commissioning or supporting research. There are
some 164 national nature reserves covering nearly 127,500 hectares (over 314,500
176 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
acres). Some 3,600 sites of special scientific interest have been scheduled
because of their flora, fauna or geological or physiographical features.
About 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of Forestry Commission land are managed
as areas in which nature conservation is the main object. Local authorities have
declared more than 50 nature reserves, and voluntary organisations, which play
an important part in protecting wildlife, have established over 1,000 reserves.
In Northern Ireland the Nature Reserves Committee advises on the designa¬
tion of nature reserves and areas of scientific interest.
Land Derelict land, often concentrated in places associated with nineteenth century
Reclamation industrial development, presents special problems to planners. With central
government grants to help to meet the cost of local authority clearance schemes,
however, it is improved in a number of ways. Waste land has been turned to
farming or forestry use, as well as into sites for industry, housing, schools, roads
and recreational areas. Disused excavations have been filled with water and
equipped for water sports. Sometimes where removal of waste heaps is not
practicable, they have been made more pleasing to the eye by, for example,
covering with vegetation.
The Department of the Environment and the Scottish and Welsh Develop¬
ment Agencies provide central advice and information, and in Northern Ireland
grants are paid to landowners who restore or improve the appearance of derelict
sites.
Planning controls to prevent the spread of dereliction require that, when
permission is granted for mineral working, various measures must be taken to
minimise the disturbance caused by the work and to secure whatever restoration
is practicable, either progressively or when working ceases. The use of land for
disposal of waste materials is also subject to conditions restricting height or
requiring treatment on completion.
CONTROL OF POLLUTION
Government measures to control environmental pollution, in which industry
and voluntary organisations co-operate, are long established, and are seen as
complementary to the planning system and the various measures to conserve
amenities and the country’s heritage.
Administration Responsibility for the control of pollution is shared by various central govern¬
ment departments, local and water authorities and statutory agencies. Industry
co-operates with these authorities and voluntary organisations help to focus
public interest on the process of control. An independent standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution advises the Government on national
and international matters concerning the pollution of the environment, on the
adequacy of research and on the future possibilities of danger to the environ¬
ment. The Secretary of State for the Environment has a co-ordinating role
concerning pollution matters as a whole, exercised through a Central Directorate
on Environmental Pollution within his department. An independent Standing
Commission on Energy and the Environment provides the Government with
advice on the inter-action of energy policies and the environment.
Specific responsibilities of the Department of the Environment in England
include air pollution control, fresh water pollution control, waste disposal,
control of civil radioactive wastes (jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food), of oil and chemicals on beaches and of noise other than
aircraft noise, traffic noise and noise at work. Most of these responsibilities in

The Control of
Pollution Act
r974
The Land
Scotland are exercised by the Scottish Development Department, in Wales by
the Welsh Office and in Northern Ireland by the Department of the Environ¬
ment for Northern Ireland.
The Department of Trade is responsible for the control of oil pollution at sea
(other than from offshore operations) and its clearance, and for the control of
aircraft noise. The Department of Transport is responsible for policies for the
control of traffic noise. The Department of Energy is responsible for the control
of pollution arising from the exploration for, and exploitation of oil. The Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland, the Northern Ireland Departments of Agriculture and the
Environment (together with the Health and Safety Executive) are responsible
for the control of agricultural chemicals such as pesticides, for the protection of
fisheries from pollution and for the prevention of food contamination. The
protection of the health of employees at work (see p 333) is the responsibility
of the Department of Employment and is controlled by the Factory Inspectorate
which forms part of the Health and Safety Executive; in Northern Ireland it is
the responsibility of the Department of Manpower Services. Other departments
such as the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health
and Social Security and the Scottish Home and Health Department have an
interest in health aspects of pollution control.
Local authorities are responsible for matters such as collection and disposal
of domestic wastes; control of air pollution from domestic and certain industrial
premises and noise abatement measures. Sewerage and sewage treatment and
disposal are the responsibilities of water authorities in England and Wales, of
local authorities in Scotland and of the Department of the Environment in
Northern Ireland. The regional water authorities in England, the Welsh
National Water Development Authority, the river purification authorities and
islands councils in Scotland and the Department of the Environment for
Northern Ireland are responsible for control of water pollution.
The European Community has adopted a Community Environment Pro¬
gramme as a result of which a number of measures for Community action are
being developed.
The Control of Pollution Act 1974, which applies to Great Britain, constitutes
the first comprehensive attempt to tackle pollution problems in different (but
related) government areas. It extends a wide range of new powers and duties to
local and water authorities, increases the existing powers to deal with controlled
wastes, air and water pollution and noise, and contains important provisions on
the release of information to the public on environmental conditions. In par¬
ticular the provisions dealing with waste on land institute a new system for the
comprehensive planning of regulation of waste disposal operations so as to
ensure that disposal is carried out to satisfactory standards and that the best use
is made of waste materials. The Act also increases the penalties for a large
number of pollution offences. It is being implemented in stages, and most of it
is in operation. Similar legislation applies in Northern Ireland.
The main risks of land pollution lie in the indiscriminate dumping of waste
materials on land, careless dispersal of pesticides and chemicals, fall-out of
materials from the atmosphere and the deposition of materials from floodwater.
The application of sewage sludge on farms, too, involves risks as well as benefits
to the land.
The Control of Pollution Act lays a duty on waste disposal authorities (county
councils and the Greater London Council in England, for example) to ensure
178

that there are adequate arrangements to dispose of controlled wastes and to
draw up and revise periodically a waste disposal plan. It also establishes a
licensing system for all waste disposal sites, treatment plants and storage
facilities receiving controlled wastes. In addition it provides for a more intensive
control system for certain specially hazardous or difficult wastes.
The Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme (PSPS) is a scheme through which
pesticides are cleared for safety before being marketed. Clearance is not given
unless the Government, advised by the Advisory Committee on Pesticides, is
satisfied that a product can be used without risk to people, livestock and
domestic animals, and with minimum harm to wildlife, provided recommended
precautions are taken. The scheme is being extended to include non-agricultural
use of pesticides. The British Agrochemical Supply Industry Scheme (BASIS),
an independent registration scheme for distributors of crop protection products,
ensures that distributors sell only products which have been cleared through
the PSPS.
Under the Litter Act 1958 it was made an offence to leave litter on land in the
open air to which the public have free access. The Dangerous Litter Act 1971
increased the maximum fine from £10 to £100. Under the Refuse Disposal
(Amenity) Act 1978 the deliberate dumping of rubbish carries a similar maxi¬
mum fine with the possibility of a £200 fine and three months’ imprisonment for
subsequent offences.
The Government encourages the reclamation and recycling of waste materials
wherever this is practicable and economic in order to reduce imports and waste
disposal costs and to help to conserve natural resources. Industry already makes
considerable use of reclaimed waste material such as metals, paper and textiles.
Local authorities collect about 200,000 tonnes of waste paper annually and about
100,000 tonnes of ferrous scrap. Waste disposal authorities are required under
the Control of Pollution Act to take full account of opportunities for waste
reclamation in drawing up their waste disposal plans. Voluntary organisations
also organise collections of waste material.
The Government has set up a Waste Management Advisory Council and
launched a National Anti-Waste Programme to co-ordinate policy and promote
opportunities for reclamation and recycling through education and advice.
Extensive Government-supported research and development in this area is in
progress. The Department of the Environment is providing financial and
technical help to South Yorkshire and Tyne and Wear County Councils for
full-scale prototype plants for the mechanical sorting of household refuse at
Doncaster and Byker. The first of these came into operation in 1979, and the
second is expected to become operational early in 1980. In addition Britain par¬
ticipates in discussion on waste reclamation and recycling in the European
Community, the OECD and the Economic Commission for Europe.
Discharges of polluting matter into rivers, lakes, estuaries and some coastal
waters are controlled by law. The Control of Pollution Act contains a number
of provisions that will considerably strengthen existing legislation: for example,
part of the Act extends powers to control pollution of all inland water, including
specific underground waters, and tidal coastal water up to the three-mile
(4-8 km) limit. The main provisions of the Act should have been fully imple¬
mented by the end of 1979. There has been a steady and significant improve¬
ment in water quality. The level of pollution in the tidal Thames, for example,
has been reduced to a quarter of the 1950s’ level—some 97 kinds of fish have been
identified there since 1964.
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT
Marine
Pollution

More than 90 per cent of the British population is provided with main
drainage, and public authority sewage treatment works serve over four-fifths of
the population—a very high proportion by international standards.
Control of marine pollution from ships is based largely on international con¬
ventions drawn up under the auspices of the Inter-Governmental Maritime
Consultative Organisation, a United Nations agency with headquarters in
London, and implemented for British ships by domestic legislation. The
Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971, which gave effect to the International
Convention for the Prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Oil 1954, as
amended in 1962 and 1969, makes it an offence for ships of any nationality to
discharge any oil into British territorial waters and for British registered ships
to discharge persistent oil anywhere at sea, except in accordance with very
stringent regulations. Further amendments to the convention, made in 1971 but
not yet in force, relate to the design of tankers and are aimed at reducing the
volume of oil that could escape in the event of an accident. The International
Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 (as modified by the
1978 Protocol) will, when in force, replace the 1954 convention by more
stringent requirements and will eventually regulate pollution by chemicals,
sewage and garbage as well as by oil.
The Department of Trade has developed a nationwide organisation using the
resources of its Coastguard and Marine Survey Services, to deal with oil spills at
sea which threaten to cause coastal pollution or are likely to endanger wildlife.
If necessary, action is taken to clear the oil by using low toxicity dispersant and
spraying equipment. Central government and local authorities have con¬
tingency plans under review for dealing with oil and chemical pollution of
beaches and in inshore waters. Following several oil tanker disasters off the
coasts of Britain and France in 1978, the Government increased expenditure on
contingency arrangements. This included the setting up in 1979 of a Marine
Pollution Control Unit within the Department to co-ordinate contingency
arrangements and take charge of operations to deal with pollution at sea.
The development of the offshore oil industry has brought an increased risk of
oil pollution in the North Sea. Offshore operators are required to ensure that oil
does not escape into the sea and are also expected to have contingency plans for
dealing with oil spills. Not all traces of oil can be removed from water separated
from crude oil before its discharge from production platforms into the sea, and
these discharges from offshore installations are normally granted exemption
from the 1971 Act subject to strict controls laid down by the Department of
Energy. The Department of the Environment, the Welsh Office, the Scottish
Development Department and the Northern Ireland Department of the En¬
vironment have powers to grant exemptions subject to similar controls for dis¬
charges from land-based sources.
The loading of wastes for dumping at sea by means of vehicles, ships, aircraft,
hovercraft, marine platforms and conveyor belts is controlled by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Welsh Office, the Department of Agri¬
culture and Fisheries for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Department of the
Environment through the Dumping at Sea Act 1974 which gave statutory
backing to the voluntary arrangements which had operated for several years. A
licence has to be obtained for the permanent deposit of any substance or article
into tidal waters and the sea. Dumping at sea is permitted on the basis of the
scientific criteria set out in the annexes to the Oslo Convention (International
Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and
Aircraft 1972) and the London Convention on the Prevention of Marine
l8o BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Pollution by Dumping Wastes and Other Matter 1972. The 1974 Act does not
however control discharges of liquid effluent from pipelines, which are covered
by the Control of Pollution Act, nor discharges incidental to or derived from the
normal operation of a ship, aircraft, vehicle, hovercraft or marine structure.
Clean Air Responsibility for clean air rests primarily with local authorities. Under the
provisions of the Clean Air Acts 1956 and 1968 they may declare ‘smoke control
areas’ within which the emission of smoke from chimneys constitutes an offence.
Over half the premises in the conurbations are now covered by smoke control
orders. Emissions from most industrial premises are also subject to the control
of local authorities under the Clean Air Acts. The emission of dark smoke from
any trade or industrial premises or from the chimney of any building is in
general prohibited, and new furnaces must be capable as far as practicable of
smokeless operation. The height of the chimney serving a new furnace must
generally be approved by the local authority, and approved grit and dust
arrestment plant has to be installed. Regulations have been made which prescribe
specific limits to the quantities of grit and dust which may be emitted from
certain furnaces. Industrial premises that give rise to particularly offensive or
dangerous emissions are, in England and Wales, under the control of the Alkali
and Clean Air Inspectorate of the Health and Safety Executive. The Inspectorate
requires the best practicable means to be used to prevent or abate emissions.
Controls are also in force on emissions from motor vehicles, such as the maxi¬
mum permitted lead content of petrol which was reduced from 0-84 grammes
per litre in 1973 to 0-45 grammes per litre at the beginning of 1978 (and is to be
reduced further to 0-40 grammes from 1 January 1981).
Notable progress has been made towards the achievement of cleaner air and
a better environment, especially in the last 20 years or so. Total emissions and
average concentration of smoke in the air have fallen by nearly 80 per cent since
i960. The domestic smoke control programme has been particularly important
in achieving this result. London no longer experiences the dense smoke-laden
‘smogs’ of the 1950s and in central London winter sunshine has been increasing
since the 1940s when average hours a day were about 40 per cent less than at
Kew in outer London; the levels are now virtually the same. Similar improve¬
ment has been achieved in other cities including Glasgow and Sheffield. Control
measures have reduced urban ground-level concentrations of sulphur dioxide in
Britain by 40 per cent in the last ten years.
Noise Local authorities enforce noise control and must inspect their areas for noise
nuisances and act to secure abatement. The Control of Pollution Act 1974
improved and strengthened local authorities’ existing powers and enabled them
to set up ‘noise abatement zones’ within which they can require levels of noise
from scheduled buildings to be held constant or reduced, and within which
these levels of noise may not be increased without the local authorities per¬
mission. The Act contains special provisions to control noise from construction
and demolition sites.
Transport is one of the main offenders in noise pollution, and British measures,
like those of other countries, aim to tackle the problem, first by reducing noise
at source, by insisting that aircraft and motor vehicles should be made quieter,
and secondly by protecting people from its effects. As part of this process, grants
have been made towards the sound-proofing of some rooms in houses subject
to loud aircraft noise. Highway authorities have a duty or power, depending on
circumstances, to carry out, or make grants in respect of the insulation of homes
which are subject to noise increased by a specified level because of new or
Radioactivity
PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT l8l
improved roads first opened to traffic after 16 October 1969. Noise insulation
may also be provided where construction work for new roads is likely seriously
to affect nearby homes.
The control of aircraft noise is provided for in a number of statutes relating
to civil aviation. Measures taken to abate noise include the insulation of homes
against noise—for which the major airport owners have provided grants—and
the progressive introduction of quieter aircraft.
Aircraft landing or taking off in Britain must be ‘noise certificated’ in accord¬
ance with noise standards which have been internationally agreed and are kept
under review by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The
latest of these became applicable in August 1978. They require noise levels of
newly designed subsonic jet aircraft to be significantly lower than those of
aircraft meeting the previous standards, given effect in Britain in 1970, and
much lower than those of aircraft not required to meet noise certification
standards because they were designed before 1969. The ICAO has also applied
standards to propeller-driven aircraft, and is examining the possibility of
setting standards for civil helicopter noise and for noise from future supersonic
transport aircraft.
The use of non-noise-certificated subsonic jets acquired by British operators
after September 1978 has been prohibited and the use of all such subsonic jets
on the United Kingdom Register of Civil Aircraft is to be prohibited from
1 January 1986.
All these measures are expected to reduce substantially the noise nuisance to
people living near British airports.
In the United Kingdom radiation exposure of the population resulting from
industrial and other processes represents only a small fraction of that to which
the population is exposed from the natural environment. Nevertheless, that
fraction is subject to stringent control because of possible effects on health or
longer-term genetic effects. Under the Radioactive Substances Act i960 users
of radioactive materials other than those subject to licence under the Nuclear
Installations Act (see below) must be registered by the appropriate department,
and authorisation is also required for the disposal of radioactive waste, with
exemption for very minor uses and disposals. The Health and Safety Executive,
through its Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, is the authority concerned with
the granting of nuclear site licences for commercial nuclear installations. No
such installation may be constructed or operated without a licence granted by the
Executive.
The Government is carrying out a review of the existing arrangements for the
control of radioactive waste. Various methods are used for disposing of such
waste. Most low-level solid waste is buried; intermediate-level solid waste is
mostly stored, with some disposed of at sea; and highly radioactive liquid waste
is at present stored in tanks while research proceeds on methods of disposal. One
such method under investigation is the ‘Harvest’ process for converting this
waste into a solid insoluble glass which would be contained in stainless steel
cylinders and might be buried in stable geological formations. The process was
developed by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority which, in col¬
laboration with the Institute of Geological Sciences, is participating in a pro¬
gramme of the European Atomic Energy Community to study different types of
formation which might be suitable for radioactive waste disposal.
The National Radiological Protection Board established under the Radio¬
logical Protection Act 1970 provides an authoritative point of reference on
radiological protection and represents British interests internationally.

VOLUNTARY ORGANISATIONS
Voluntary organisations are particularly active in ensuring that proposed
changes in the use of land take full account of the interests of the public and
considerations of amenity. The National Trust for England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, founded in 1895, is the largest private landowner in Britain and has
775,000 members. For the benefit of the public it owns 167,000 hectares (412,000
acres) of land and protects from harmful development a further 30,000 hectares
(74,000 acres). It owns 236 historic buildings and large stretches of coastline.
Properties in Scotland covering some 33,200 hectares (82,000 acres) are pro¬
tected by the National Trust for Scotland, an independent body founded in
1931, which has over 82,000 members.
The Town and Country Planning Association, founded in 1899, seeks to
improve the qualities of land use and planning and operates a planning aid
service for local amenity groups; while the Royal Town Planning Institute
encourages high standards in town planning. The Civic Trust, established in
1957, encourages the protection and improvement of the environment, high
standards in architecture and planning and has been closely associated with the
drafting of conservation legislation. It supports and advises over 1,250 local
amenity societies. Associate trusts are linked with the Civic Trust in the north¬
east and north-west of England, Scotland and Wales.
Other voluntary societies concerned with amenity in town and country
include: the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Council for the
Protection of Rural Wales, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland
and the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside; the National
Association for Environmental Education; the Keep Britain Tidy Group; the
Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society and the Scottish
Rights of Way Society; the Ramblers’ Association; the Society for the Pro¬
tection of Ancient Buildings and the Ancient Monuments Society; the Georgian
Group and the Scottish Georgian Society; the Saltire Society (which encourages
the preservation of the architectural heritage in Scotland) and the Ulster
Architectural Heritage Society; the Victorian Society; the Pilgrim Trust; the
Council for British Archaeology; the Historic Churches Preservation Trust; the
Council for National Parks; the Prince of Wales’s Committee (which promotes
environmental improvements in Wales); the Inland Waterways Association;
Friends of the Earth; the Conservation Society; the Noise Abatement Society;
and the National Society for Clean Air.
Among a large number of voluntary bodies concerned with nature conserva¬
tion are the Society for the Promotion of Nature Conservation, the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Council
for Nature.
The Committee for Environmental Conservation, comprising many of the
main voluntary organisations, acts as a liaison body and is concerned with
broader questions of amenity than those covered by individual societies.
9 Housing
Housing
Characteristics
A central aim of housing policy is a home for all households at a price within
their means. Others include a better balance between new building and renova¬
tion with social as well as financial costs taken into account; reasonable stability
in household housing costs; attention to the needs of people with special
problems such as the elderly, the disabled and the handicapped; increased scope
for mobility; easier means for people to obtain the type of tenure they want; and
the safeguarding of tenants’ independence.
Although some households still live in unsatisfactory conditions, the pro¬
portion of the total is relatively small, and the Government believes that it no
longer makes sense to consider housing problems in national totals; attention
and resources are therefore being directed more selectively to the areas, often in
inner cities, with the most pressing needs. A system of local strategies and
investment programmes has been instituted as a means by which local authorities
can, in consultation with local bodies concerned, plan comprehensively for
development in both public and private sectors.
Public expenditure provision for housing stood at nearly £5,200 million in
1978-79.
There are over 21 million dwellings, houses being much more common than
flats (the ratio is roughly four to one). Nationally the number of dwellings is
slightly larger than the number of households, but there continue to be shortages
in certain areas and, because of changing social habits, the houses available are
not always of the type in demand.
More than two families in every five live in a post-1945 home, but there
remain a large number of old dwellings, some of which have been kept in good
repair and modernised, but many others of which (particularly in the centres
of cities) are unsatisfactory by modern standards.
Throughout this century pressure on housing accommodation has been
increased more by the rapid rise in the number of separate households than
by the increase in the population. While the number of people has increased
by about two-fifths, the number of households has more than doubled. Families
are smaller, there has been a substantial reduction in the sharing of homes by
different generations of the same family and there has been an increase in the
number of one-person households. The National Dwelling and Housing Survey
(results only for England so far; see Bibliography), showed a fall, from
800,000 to 500,000, in the number of households sharing a dwelling between
1971 and 1977-78, a halving, from 2-8 million to 1-4 million, in the number
of households without exclusive use of at least one basic amenity, such as a
bath, and a fall of two-thirds, from 219,000 to 73,000, in the number of over¬
crowded households.
Over half of all dwellings are owned by their occupiers, nearly a third are
rented from public housing authorities, and most of the remainder are rented
from private landlords. There are variations, however, in the distribution of
tenure between different parts of the country; in Scotland more than half the
184

Development

Ownership
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
dwellings are rented from public authorities. Private rented accommodation is
generally more common in the central parts of large towns, while owner-
occupation is more frequent in outer suburbs and in country areas.
New house construction is undertaken, on a roughly equal scale, by both
public and private sectors, and in addition about 10 per cent of new building
is carried out by voluntary housing associations and societies. Public authorities
provide dwellings mainly for renting while private interests build mainly for
sale to owner-occupiers. There is very little building of private dwellings to rent.
Responsibility for formulating housing policy and supervising the housing
programme in Great Britain is borne by the Secretary of State for the Environ¬
ment in England and by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. (For
Northern Ireland see p 189.)
Most of the public housing is provided by 459 local housing authorities,
which are responsible for ensuring that the supply of housing in their areas is
adequate. The authorities are: in England and Wales (outside London) the
district councils; in London, the Greater London Council, the London borough
councils and the Common Council of the City of London; and in Scotland, the
district and islands councils. Other public housing authorities are the new town
authorities, the Scottish Special Housing Association which supplements build¬
ing by local authorities in Scotland, and the Development Board for Rural
Wales. Subsidies are made available to the authorities to assist them with
housing costs, and guidance is given on design and layout.
The construction or structural alteration of housing in both the public and
private sectors is subject to the Building Regulations in England (except inner
London) and Wales. The regulations, which are made by the Secretary of State
for the Environment, have the force of law. They are enforced by the local
authorities and are made primarily for the health and safety of people in and
around the buildings, although they also include requirements for the conserva¬
tion of energy. Different systems with the same aims are operated in inner
London, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Local authorities are involved in many other aspects of housing policy, such
as the payment of house renovation grants and the implementation of housing
renewal programmes. A growing number are establishing housing advisory
centres to provide information on most aspects of housing.
Research into building materials and techniques, as well as into the social,
economic and design aspects of housing, is undertaken within the Department
of the Environment. It is carried out by the Building Research Establishment of
the Department’s research directorate as well as by the directorates of economics,
statistics and housing development. The Research and Development Group of
the Scottish Development Department also undertakes research. Sponsored
work is carried out by universities, polytechnics, market research firms and the
Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, and local authorities may also have
housing research programmes.
The Government is advised on the need for, and application of, research and
development by the Construction and Housing Research Advisory Council.
Advice on ways of increasing productivity in house-building is also provided by
the National Building Agency.
The number of people owning their own houses has more than doubled in the
last 20 years, and the 11 million owner-occupied dwellings in Britain account
for over half of the total housing stock.
HOUSING
i85
Mortgage Loans Loans to enable people to buy their own houses are available from various
sources, including building societies, insurance companies, industrial and
provident societies, local authorities and banks.
Building societies (see also p 356) are by far the largest sources of such
funds; their share of the market being over 90 per cent. They do not build
houses themselves but lend money upon security by way of a mortgage on the
home bought for owner-occupation. They usually advance up to 80 per cent
of their valuation of a property but it is possible to borrow up to 100 per cent
with the help of an appropriate insurance guarantee. Loans are normally repay¬
able over periods of 20 or 25 years (up to 30 or 35 years in certain circumstances)
by equal monthly instalments to cover capital and interest. The average price
in Britain of all houses bought with a building society mortgage in 1978 was
about £15,674. In 1978 the societies advanced some £8,734 million.
Owner-occupiers are entitled to tax relief on their mortgage interest payments
arising on up to £25,000 of their mortgages (on one house only) and in 1978-79
this amounted to about £1,110 million. An alternative form of assistance is the
option mortgage scheme, designed to help those with smaller incomes. It allows
the borrower to receive, instead of tax relief, a subsidy which has the effect of
reducing the rate of interest on the loan. Assistance under this scheme in Great
Britain amounted in 1978—79 to £148 million. There is an associated guarantee
scheme under which mortgage loans of up to 100 per cent of the valuation of a
house (not exceeding £14,000) may be made to option borrowers. Other ways of
helping people with lower incomes to become owner-occupiers include a
scheme which allows those buying homes for the first time, subject to certain
conditions, to defer part of their mortgage payments that would normally be
due in the early years until later in the mortgage term, and shared ownership
schemes, under which the occupant purchases a part share of his or her home,
paying rent on the remaining share. From 1 December 1980 a first-time
home buyer who has saved under the new home loan scheme (set up by the
Home Purchase Assistance and Housing Corporation Guarantee Act 1978) and
is buying a home in the lower-price range, will receive a tax-free cash bonus
°f ^4°~£110 and a loan of £600, interest free for the first five years and
then repayable over the remaining life of the mortgage.
Building For building in the private sector the National House Building Council sets
Standards standards and enforces them by inspection and certification. Almost all new
private houses are covered by the Council’s insurance scheme which provides
ten-year protection against major structural defects. Two-year protection is also
given against faulty workmanship. Most lenders will not grant mortgages on a
new house unless it is covered by a Council certificate.
Public Sector Public housing authorities own nearly seven million houses and flats. The
Housing number of homes owned by each authority varies widely, several of the larger
authorities having a stock of well over 100,000.
Local authorities meet the capital costs of new house construction and of
modernisation of their existing stock by raising loans on the open market or by
borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board. Current expenditure, including
maintenance and management costs and loan interest and repayments, is met
from rents, supplemented by subsidies from the Government and, where
required to balance housing revenue accounts, from the rates. Local authorities
are required to charge their tenants reasonable rents (which keep a balance
between the interests of tenants and ratepayers) without making a profit.
Subsidies for public housing in Great Britain during 1978-79 are expected to
186
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
total some £2,000 million (including rent rebates payable to poorer tenants to
assist in meeting rents of accommodation suited to their needs). Supplementary
subsidies assist local authorities with slum clearance.
In selecting tenants for new or vacant dwellings, local authorities normally
give preference to families living in overcrowded or unsatisfactory conditions,
but they are free to allocate homes according to their own schemes. Authorities
normally establish waiting lists, and some require applicants to fulfil residence
qualifications before they are accepted on waiting lists.
Local authorities have a statutory duty to secure that accommodation (not
necessarily an authority house) is available for homeless people who have
dependent children or are vulnerable on grounds such as age or disability.
Most building is undertaken by private firms under contract although a
number of authorities employ direct labour to build houses. Some authorities
work in consortia to make the best use of experience and technical information,
and to initiate research and development projects.
Dwellings are constructed to meet the needs of different sizes of household.
More than a quarter are of the single-bedroom type suitable for smaller house¬
holds including the elderly, but the majority are designed for families and
have two or three bedrooms, one or two living-rooms and a kitchen, bathroom
and lavatory.
Sheltered accommodation (with an alarm system and resident warden) is
provided for elderly people who need this degree of support. Increasing im¬
portance is also being placed on the housing needs of physically handicapped
people, and a small but growing proportion of the new housing stock is suitable
for them. Also receiving attention are the needs of other ‘disadvantaged’ groups
such as one-parent families, the mentally handicapped, the ex-mentally ill and
women who have suffered from violence within the family.
As part of the Government’s policy to achieve a higher level of owner occupa¬
tion, local authorities have been empowered to sell council houses and flats to
tenants at discounts ranging from 30 per cent (for tenants of under three years’
occupancy) to 50 per cent (for tenants of 20 or more years’ occupancy); authori¬
ties may also sell unoccupied dwellings to non-tenants at up to 30 per cent
discount. In all cases where dwellings are sold at a discount there is a safe¬
guard on resale, which gives a local authority the right to buy back at the sale
price if the purchaser wishes to move within a period of five or eight years,
depending on the circumstances. The Government intends to introduce legis¬
lation which will give all council tenants the right to buy their homes.
Public housing is built to a high minimum standard. In England and Wales,
for example, some 98-9 per cent of the new houses built for local authorities in
1977 had central heating and the average floor area of houses to accommodate
five people was 90 square metres (964 square feet).
Local authorities are being encouraged to take a broad view of their respon¬
sibilities for housing management and to consider the wider social and economic
consequences of their housing policies. The aim is for them to develop a compre¬
hensive housing service, taking full account of people’s needs and preferences,
making the best use of all the resources available in both public and private
sectors, and adopting a flexible view of the way the housing stock is used. A
high standard of skill and organisation is needed to meet this objective, and
emphasis is being given to improved training for all grades of housing staff. The
Housing Consultative Council for England considers all major issues of concern
to the Secretary of State for the Environment and local authorities in the fulfil¬
ment of their housing responsibilities. In Wales the Welsh Housing Consultative
Committee undertakes a similar function. A Housing Services Advisory Group,
HOUSING
187
composed of central and local government officials, elected councillors and other
housing experts, has been set up to advise English local authorities on good
professional practice in housing management and maintenance through the
production of reports on housing topics. A small Housing Services Advisory
Unit, consisting of three professional advisers has also been created within the
Department of the Environment to stimulate an exchange of ideas and informa¬
tion on good management practice with local authorities and to provide advice
on policy within the Department.
Privately
Rented
Housing
Housing
Associations
During the last quarter of a century there has been a steady decline in the
number of rented dwellings available from private landlords (including tied
accommodation) from over 50 per cent of the housing stock to about 12 per
cent (2'6 million). Major factors have been the increased demand for owner-
occupation, the greater availability of public rented housing, and the operation
of rent restriction. Privately rented dwellings form a high proportion of the older
housing, most landlords being individuals with limited holdings; some rented
housing is provided by larger property owners, including property companies.
Most privately rented dwellings are subject to rent restriction. Tenants have
a wide degree of security of tenure, and may not be evicted without a court
order. Harassment of residential occupiers is a criminal offence. To increase the
availability of privately rented property the Government proposes to legislate for
a new system of shorthold lettings, under which tenants would have security of
tenure for an agreed period, but not for life; existing lettings would not be
affected by the new legislation. Tenants with incomes up to average levels are
eligible for assistance with their rent under a national scheme of rent allowances
which is operated by local authorities and financed mainly by government
subsidies.
There are three forms of rent restriction: control, regulation and the fixing
of a reasonable rent by a rent tribunal. Controlled rents (which apply to dwellings
of low rateable value where the tenant has lived continuously since before 1957)
are fixed, and may be increased only to an extent which reflects expenditure by
the landlord on improvements and repairs. However, if a controlled dwelling
reaches a satisfactory standard of amenity, the landlord may transfer it to the
alternative system of rent regulation, which applies generally to privately rented
accommodation, other than in the luxury class, except for accommodation where
the landlord lives on the same premises. In a regulated tenancy a ‘fair rent’ is
fixed by independent rent officers, at the request of the landlord, the tenant, or
both, if the rent officer s decision is objected to by the landlord or the tenant, it
is referred to a rent assessment committee. Once fixed, the rent is registered and
not normally reviewed for at least three years.
The third form of rent restriction applies to tenants with resident landlords
and tenants of a few other types of furnished accommodation who may refer
their tenancy agreements to a rent tribunal for determination of a reasonable
rent. Tribunals may grant tenants security of tenure for up to six months with
a possibility of further periods.
Housing associations extend the choice of housing (which for most people is
between owner-occupying or renting from a public authority or a private
landlord) by providing an increasing amount of accommodation available for
rent through new building or the rehabilitation of older property. The associa¬
tions normally cater for people who would otherwise look to a local authority for
a home. In addition to normal family housing, they provide particularly for the
special needs of elderly, disabled and single people.

Improving
Older Houses
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Since the early 1960s the Government has encouraged the growth of these
non-profit-making associations which between them own nearly 340,000 dwell¬
ings. The National Federation of Housing Associations has 2,000 associations as
its members, and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations covers 140
associations in Scotland.
Rented housing schemes carried out by housing associations qualify for a
government grant but only if the association is registered with the Housing
Corporation, a statutory body set up by the Government. The Corporation’s
register contains details of more than 2,700 associations. Rented dwellings
owrned by housing associations come within the fair rent and rent allowance
arrangements.
Alternative forms of tenure on local authority estates and within the housing
association sector are being encouraged in order to give occupiers a greater
stake in the ownership or management of their homes. The Housing Corporation
is engaged in a pilot programme including co-ownership and community
leasehold schemes.
Modernisation and conversion of sub-standard housing, with the help of grants
from public funds, has increasingly been encouraged as an alternative to clearing
and rebuilding and as a way of preserving established communities and of making
more economic use of resources. This policy of improvement rather than re¬
development has been reinforced by the Government’s decision to give priority
to inner city regeneration.
Renovation grants paid to owners to improve over 2-6 million homes were
approved in Great Britain between 1967 and 1978*
There are four types of renovation grant: improvement grants, for carrying
out improvements to a high standard or for conversion into flats; intermediate
grants, for the provision of standard amenities and associated repairs; special
grants (not available in Scotland) for providing standard amenities in houses of
multiple occupation; and repairs grants.
Declaring ‘general improvement areas’ and ‘housing action areas enables
local authorities in England and Wales to tackle the improvement of whole
areas of older housing systematically. General improvement areas (of which there
are about 1,130) consist of fundamentally sound houses and a stable population.
Owners who improve their dwelling may receive a grant of up to 60 per cent of
the eligible costs. Housing action areas (about 35°) are characterised by
particularly poor housing and bad physical conditions combined with social
stress. Local authorities have special powers to bring about an improvement in
living conditions for the benefit of residents within a five-year period. Grants
to owners may range up to 90 per cent of the eligible costs in cases of hardship.
In both types of area, grants for repairs may also be made; and government
financial aid for environmental improvement, together with a contribution of 90
per cent of each grant, is available to local authorities. Elsewhere, the first three
types of renovation grant, covering up to 50 per cent of eligible costs, may be
made to owners, local authorities receiving 75 per cent of the grant from the
government.
In Scotland, the term ‘general improvement area’ is not used; ‘housing action
area’ powers are available for areas in which at least half the houses fail to meet
prescribed physical standards and there is no time limit on the period within
which improvement must be carried out. Outside housing action areas in
Scotland local authorities have power to require the improvement of houses
below the statutory tolerable standard, or lacking a bathroom, by improvement
orders and grants payable at 75 per cent of eligible costs.

Slum
Clearance

189
In urban areas of Britain slum clearance and redevelopment have been major
features of housing policy. Since the mid-1950s about 3-3 million people have
been rehoused in England and Wales as a result of slum clearance programmes.
Clearance of large areas of ‘irredeemable’ slums is now almost at an end and
greater emphasis is placed on renewal and modernisation wherever possible.
Local authorities receive special financial assistance from the Government.
Housing authorities are obliged to see that other accommodation exists, or
can be provided by them, for people displaced by slum clearance. Owners of
land compulsorily acquired during slum clearance programmes receive as
compensation either the full market value or, if the land consists of unfit houses,
a sum based on the value of the cleared site; additional payments are, however,
made to most owner-occupiers of unfit houses to bring their compensation up
to market value.
Redevelopment of the slums has presented many problems. Most of the
areas were seriously overcrowded; but while they usually lacked social facilities
they had the advantage of already being provided with the basic utilities, jobs
were usually available in the vicinity and town centre facilities were not far away.
The aim in carrying out slum clearance was thus to house as many people as
possible on the cleared sites. This was most easily achieved if fairly large areas
were cleared and high-rise flats built. The results in many areas are now seen as
less than satisfactory in spite of the high standard of many of the homes them¬
selves. The main criticisms of multi-storey flats are that they are inhuman in
scale and unsuitable for families with young children because of the lack of
convenient play space. The need to build to a reasonably high density in inner
city areas still exists, but is now being met by carefully grouped low-rise blocks,
including individual houses wherever possible.
The Northern Ireland Department of the Environment is responsible for housing
policy in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive for the
provision and management of public authority housing and for dealing with
unfit dwellings whether publicly or privately owned.
Northern Ireland has a major problem of unfit and derelict housing, especially
in Belfast, and the situation has been made worse by civil disturbance. In view
of this several recent changes have been made in housing policy including a
greater concentration on maintaining and improving the existing dwelling stock
and a major attack on housing problems in Belfast. The concept of housing action
areas has been developed to facilitate concerted action in designated areas. A
five-year programme for the rehabilitation of Belfast began in 1977. Action has
also been taken to stimulate the voluntary housing movement and with the
encouragement of the Department in conjunction with the Northern Ireland
Federation of Housing Associations, registered housing associations are under¬
taking a large programme of schemes for groups such as the elderly and disabled
and are also playing a significant part in the rehabilitation of older dwellings
especially in Belfast.
In the private rented sector the Rent (Northern Ireland) Order 1978 came into
operation on 1 October 1978 repealing the Rent Restriction Acts of Northern
Ireland and replacing them with a single statute designed to safeguard tenants’
rights while providing landlords with sufficient rental income to maintain their
property in good condition. Under the Order landlords are empowered to
increase the rents of certain properties meeting a specified standard of physical
condition to a level comparable with those charged by the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive.
Another trend in housing policy is the attempt to widen housing options
190
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
available to families, particularly those who wish to own their own homes. The
Option Mortgage Scheme is in operation and the Home Loan Scheme for first¬
time buyers has been extended to Northern Ireland. The concept of shared
ownership (see p 185) is being developed in the public sector by the Northern
Ireland Housing Executive and in the private sector by a housing association
known as the Northern Ireland Co-Ownership Housing Association. The
Northern Ireland Housing Executive is continuing with its policy of offering
dwellings for sale to existing tenants in areas where housing need has been met.
10 The Churches
The Church of
England
Everyone in Britain has the right of religious freedom (in teaching, worship
and observance) without interference from the community or the State. Churches
and religious societies may own property, conduct schools, and propagate their
beliefs in speech and writing. There is no religious or denominational bar to the
holding of public office.
Clergy of the established churches of England and Scotland work in services
administered by the State, such as the armed forces, national hospitals and
prisons, and are paid a salary by the State. Clergy of other denominations are
also appointed. Voluntary schools provided by any religious denomination may
be wholly or partly maintained from public funds.
There is no precise or uniform information about the number of church
adherents since no inquiries are made about religious beliefs in censuses1 or
other official returns, and each church adopts its own criteria in counting its
members. Membership figures in this chapter are therefore approximate.
The established Church of England’s relationship with the State is one of
mutual obligation—privileges accorded to the Church balanced by certain
duties which it must fulfil. The Sovereign must always be a member of the
Church, and promises to uphold it; Church of England archbishops, bishops
and deans are appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister;
all clergy take an oath of allegiance to the Crown. The Church can regulate
its own worship. The two archbishops (of Canterbury and York), the bishops
of London, Durham and Winchester, and 21 other bishops (according to their
seniority as diocesan bishops) sit in the House of Lords. Clergy of the Church
(together with those of the Church of Scotland, the Church of Ireland and the
Roman Catholic Church) are not allowed to sit in the House of Commons.
The Church has two provinces: Canterbury, comprising 29 dioceses, and
York, 14 dioceses. The dioceses are divided into parishes, of which there are
some 13,860. The Archbishop of Canterbury is ‘Primate of All England’, and
the Archbishop of York ‘Primate of England’. Of the population born and
resident in the two provinces (roughly 46 million), about 53 per cent are baptised
into the Church and some 19 per cent are confirmed members.
The central governing body, the General Synod, has both spiritual authority
and legislative and administrative powers; and bishops, clergy and lay members
are involved in decisions. Certain important issues must be referred for the
approval of the dioceses before being decided by the Synod. Lay members are
associated with church government in the parishes through the ancient office of
churchwarden and the modern parochial church councils.
The General Synod is the centre of an administrative system dealing with
such matters as education, inter-church relations, social questions, recruitment
and training for the ministry, church work at home and overseas and the care
of church buildings, particularly those of historic and architectural interest.
1 In Northern Ireland, recent full censuses have contained an optional question about
people s religious professions.
ig2 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The Synod is also concerned with church schools; church colleges of education;
theological colleges; and establishments for training women in pastoral work.
The Church has its own courts whose jurisdiction today extends only to
matters of purely ecclesiastical concern.
Church finance is administered locally by the parishes and the dioceses,
with contributions to a central fund for the maintenance of central services,
including capital expenditure on training and theological colleges and grants
for training candidates for ordination. The State makes no direct financial
contribution to church expenses. The Church’s endowment income is mainly
administered by the Church Commissioners, the body largely responsible for
the payment of clergy stipends and pensions.
The Anglican The Anglican Communion comprises 25 autonomous provinces in Britain and
Communion overseas and three regional councils overseas with a total membership of about
67 million. In the British Isles, there are four provinces: the Church of England
(established), the Church in Wales, the Episcopal Church in Scotland, and the
Church of Ireland.
Every ten years (the last meeting was in 1978), the Lambeth Conference
meets for unofficial consultation among all Anglican bishops: presided over
by the Archbishop of Canterbury, it has no executive authority, but enjoys
great prestige, and its findings on doctrine, discipline, relations with other com¬
munions, and attitudes to political and social questions are widely studied.
The Anglican Consultative Council—an assembly of laymen and clergy as well
as bishops which meets every two or three years—is designed to provide con¬
sultations within the Anglican Communion and to serve as an instrument of
common action. The Council last met in 1979.
The Church of The Church of Scotland has a presbyterian form of government. It status as
Scotland the national church derives from the Treaty of Union 1707 and the Church of
Scotland Act 1921 which confirmed its complete freedom in all spiritual matters.
It appoints its own officers, and its decisions on questions of doctrine and
discipline are not subject to parliamentary discussion or modification.
All ministers have equal status, each of some 1,850 churches being governed
locally by the Kirk Session, consisting of the minister and the elected elders
of the church; above the Kirk Session is the Court of the Presbytery, then the
Court of the Synod, and finally the General Assembly, consisting of elected
ministers and elders, which meets annually under the presidency of an elected
moderator who serves for one year. The Sovereign is represented at the General
Assembly by the Lord High Commissioner.
The training for the ministry (to which women may be admitted) has given
the Church a high reputation for scholarship and has in turn influenced the
standard of education in Scotland. The adult communicant membership of the
Church of Scotland is estimated at over 1 million.
The Free The phrase ‘Free Churches’ is commonly used to describe the nonconformist
Churches churches of England and Wales (which dissent from certain practices of the
established church and, generally speaking, have distinctive convictions regard¬
ing organisation and worship) and Protestant churches in other parts of Britain
(apart from the established Church of Scotland). Certain other churches and
religious associations have links with the main Free Churches.
The Methodist Church, the largest of the Free Churches with nearly 517,000
adult full members, originated in the eighteenth century following the evangelical
revival by John Wesley, and is based on a 1932 union of most of the separate

m
The Roman
Catholic
Church
Methodist Churches. The Methodist Churches which did not join the union
include the Independent Methodists (5,100 members) and the Wesleyan Reform
Union (with some 4,000 members).
The Baptists are nearly all grouped in associations of churches, most of which
belong to the Baptist Union of Great Britain and Ireland (formed in 1813), with
a total membership of about 178,000; in addition there are separate Baptist
Unions for Scotland, Wales and Ireland and other Baptist churches.
The United Reformed Church, with some 162,000 members, was formed
in 1972 when the Congregational Church in England and Wales (the oldest
community of dissenters in Britain) and the Presbyterian Church of England
merged—the first transdenominational union of churches in Britain since the
Reformation in the sixteenth century.
Among the other Free Churches are the Presbyterian Church in Ireland
(with some 124,000 regular communicants in Northern Ireland); the Presbyterian
(or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales, which arose from the revivalist
movement led in 1735 by Howell Harris and now numbers about 89,000; the
Union of Welsh Independents; the Free Church of Scotland; the United Free
Church of Scotland; the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed
Presbyterian Church of Scotland; the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland;
and the Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.
Other Protestant denominations include: the Unitarian and Free Christian
Churches; the Churches of Christ (known also in the United States of America
as Disciples of Christ), which have been an organised community in Britain
since early in the nineteenth century; the British Province of the Moravian
Church, which is an international missionary church; the Free Church of
England (or Reformed Episcopal Church), which was formed in 1844 as a
direct result of the Oxford Movement; and the Congregational Federation,
formed from Congregational churches which did not enter the United Reformed
Church.
The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), with about 20,000 members in
Britain and over 400 places for worship, came into being in the middle of the
seventeenth century under the leadership of George Fox and works for peace
and the relief of suffering in many parts of the world.
The Salvation Army, founded in Britain in 1865, has since spread to 83 other
countries and has a strength of about 2-5 million. Within Britain it has some
100,000 active members operating from more than 1,000 centres of worship.
Believing in a very practical expression of Christian concern, the Salvation
Army has 187 centres to help people in need.
There are also a number of other religious organisations with churches or
assemblies in Britain, including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (the Mormon Church); and the Christian Scientists with some 300 branch
churches and societies in the British Isles.
The Roman Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales, which became temporarily
extinct during the sixteenth century, was restored in 1850; the Scottish hierarchy
became extinct in the early seventeenth century and was restored in 1878. There
are now 6 Roman Catholic provinces in Great Britain, each under an archbishop,
26 episcopal dioceses, and some 3,000 parishes. In Northern Ireland, there are
9 dioceses, some of which have territory partly in the Irish Republic. It is
estimated that there are some 5 million adherents (including children) to the
Roman Catholic faith in the whole of Britain.
The Roman Catholic Church attaches great importance to the education of
its children and requires its members to try to bring up their children in the

Catholic faith. Many schools for Catholic children are staffed by members of
the religious orders who also undertake other social work such as nursing, child
care, and the conduct of homes for old people.
Jews first settled in England at the time of the Norman conquest, but the
community in Britain dates from 1656; consisting of some 410,000 people,
including both Sephardi (originally from Spain and Portugal) and Ashkenazi
(from Germany and Eastern Europe), it has become one of the largest groups
of Jews in Europe. The community is divided into two schools of thought—the
Orthodox, to which about 80 per cent of practising Jews belong; and the Reform,
which originated in 1840 and was followed in 1901 by the Liberal Jewish move¬
ment. The Chief Rabbi is the head of the largest group (Ashkenazi) within
Orthodox Jewry; the Haham is the head of the Sephardi group. Jewish congrega¬
tions in Britain number about 450. Jewish denominational schools are attended
by about one in five Jewish children.
Immigrants to Britain from Commonwealth and foreign countries have estab¬
lished centres of worship, especially in London, for their own communities.
Among the Christian communities represented are Orthodox, Lutheran and
Reformed Churches of various European countries and the Armenian Church.
The principal non-Christian communities in Britain, apart from the Jews, are
the Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs. For the many Muslims in Britain
there are mosques or Islamic centres in London, Birmingham, Manchester,
Cardiff, Glasgow and in many other large cities. The community’s headquarters
are at the London Central Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre.
The Buddhist Society, with headquarters in London and centres in most other
large towns and many universities, publishes and makes known the principles
of Buddhism and encourages their study and practice. It adheres to no one
school of Buddhism. There are other centres for Buddhism, and also many
centres of eastern philosophy and religion among immigrant communities.
The British Council of Churches, with representatives or observers from all
the main Christian churches in the British Isles, facilitates common action and
seeks to further Christian unity. It works through five divisions: Christian
Aid (which has a separate constitution); Conference for World Mission;
Ecumenical Affairs; Community Affairs; and International Affairs.
The Free Church Federal Council (which has a concordat with the British
Council of Churches) comprises most of the Free Churches in England and
Wales. It promotes unity and joint action among the Free Churches and is a
channel for communication with central and local government.
The permanent Anglican-Roman Catholic Commission explores points of
possible unity between the two communions.
The Anglican and the main Free Churches in the British Isles also participate
in the World Council of Churches (of which the British Council of Churches
is an associated national council) which links together some 290 churches in
over 80 countries for co-operation and the study of common problems. The
Council of Christians and Jews works for better understanding among members
of the two religions and deals with problems in the social field.
The New English Bible, a modern English translation, completed in 1970,
is the result of co-operation among many Christian churches.
The Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969 enables agreements to be made
by two or more churches for the sharing of church buildings.
Britain’s economy is more dependent on exports than that of any other industrial
nation of comparable size. Exports of goods and services represent about one-
third of gross domestic product, a higher proportion than in the Federal Repub¬
lic of Germany or France and considerably higher than in the United States or
Japan. Manufacturing industry accounts for about 29 per cent of total domestic
output and services1 for 60 per cent.
Britain ranks fifth in world trade (after the United States, the Federal Republic
of Germany, Japan and France), and accounts for 6 per cent of total world trade.
It takes around 6 to 7 per cent of the world’s exports of primary products (exclud-
ingfood) and contributes just over 9 per cent to the main manufacturing countries’
exports of manufactured goods. It is one of the world’s largest importers of
agricultural products, raw materials and semi-manufactures, and is among the
largest exporters of aerospace products, motor vehicles, electrical equipment,
finished textiles, and most types of machinery. It is also a growing oil
exporter.
The economy is mixed, with both private and State-owned (nationalised)
industries (see p 218), private industry predominating.
With the discovery and exploitation of North Sea oil and gas, Britain is expected
to achieve net self-sufficiency in oil and gas in 1980 with substantial benefits to
the balance of payments through the reduction of oil imports. The potential
balance of payments effect of British production of oil and gas in 1980 has been
estimated at about ,£6,800 million (1978 prices), rising to nearly £9,000 million
by the mid-1980s. Other economic effects of the offshore oil industry include the
revenues accruing to the Government through taxation, the new jobs created,
and the stimulus provided for the development and sales of highly specialised
equipment and services. At constant 1978 prices gross national product arising
within the sector is expected to increase from £4,500 million in 1980 to /6 000
million by 1985.
A high level of agricultural productivity enables Britain to provide just over
half the food it needs from its own soil, although only 27 per cent of the
employed labour force are engaged in agriculture—a lower proportion than in
any other major industrial country.
Britain earns overseas currency by exports of (mainly) manufactured goods
and by invisible transactions—when earnings on overseas investment, travel,
civil aviation, shipping, and financial, banking, insurance and other services are
higher than payments for import of these services. It accounts for some 9 per
cent of world invisible receipts (excluding government transactions), more than
any country except the United States.
The significant contribution made to export earnings by invisibles is in large
measure a reflection of Britain’s position as a major financial centre. Its banks,
insurance underwriters and brokers and other financial institutions provide
Services in this context cover transport, communications, distributive trades, insurance
banking, finance and business services, ownership of dwellings, public administration and
defence, public health and education, and other services.

worldwide financial services. The City of London contains perhaps the most
comprehensive and advanced capital market in the world.
The main economic adjustments consequent upon Britain’s membership of
the European Community are set out in Chapter 3 and other relevant
chapters.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
As a result of the ‘Industrial Revolution’ during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries (when a series of inventions led to a complete change in the character
of production), Britain emerged as the first great industrial nation and as a
pioneer of new methods in transport, communications and technology. It
occupied a leading position as world manufacturer, merchant, carrier, banker
and investor, and its fast-growing economy supported a rapidly increasing
population. In the period from 1870 to 1890 British industry had a clear though
declining lead over that of other countries. Between 1890 and 1914, industrial
competition from Europe and North America grew, but its effects on Britain’s
export industries, particularly cotton textiles and coal, were offset by a number
of factors including the rise in world trade and the returns on Britain’s large
overseas investments.
Following the first world war Britain’s older industries met increasing com¬
petition, for example, in coal and iron and steel from other European countries
and in textiles from some eastern countries where labour was cheaper. The
difficulties were increased by the world economic depression which began in
1929 and the associated attempts by many countries to reduce imports. The
result in Britain, as in many other countries, was heavy unemployment.
After 1932 levels of production and employment rose. The decade saw a
strong expansion in the vehicles, electrical, chemical and aircraft industries,
while the construction of 3 million houses brought about a large growth in the
building and ancillary industries.
During the second world war (1939-45) rapid and far-reaching re-orientation
of the economy towards the war effort was secured by central planning. The
Government involvement in the economy which this implied has remained, in
a modified form, a permanent feature of the British economic system.
In spite of generous aid from the United States and Canada, the war ran
down British domestic capital by about £3,000 million, through shipping losses,
bomb damage, and arrears of industrial maintenance and replacements. Some
£1,000 million worth of overseas investments were sold, nearly half in North
America, and new external debts of £3,000 million were accumulated, while
exports were greatly reduced.
After the war rationing and other controls were relaxed gradually as civil
production expanded and trade recovered. The period after 1945 was one
rising production and, until 1970, a low level of unemployment (generally 2-5
per cent or lower); but economic growth, which averaged 2 to 3 per cent up to
1971, was slower than in most other western European countries. There were
also certain persistent economic problems, particularly the periodic difficulties
with the balance of payments. In spite of the contribution from invisibles, there
were substantial deficits on current account in a number of years.
In the 1960s successive governments sought to deal with these problems in
a number of ways, sometimes restraining the growth in home demand and
implementing policies designed to hold down rises in incomes and prices.
Following the devaluation of sterling in 1967, from $2-80 to$2'40=£i, exports

recovered, leading to a substantial surplus on visible trade and a record current
account surplus in 1971.
In 1973, the economy achieved an annual growth rate of about 6 per cent.
However, with, among other things, general inflation and the abrupt increase in
the prices of commodities in 1972 and 1973, particularly of oil in late 1973, the
world economy entered a phase of recession. At the same time, the very large
balance of payments surpluses of the oil-producing countries following the
rise in oil prices gave rise to a corresponding deficit for the oil-importing
countries collectively, which could not quickly be eliminated. Although some
recovery from this recession was evident from about 1976, it proved to be weak,
especially in Britain.
Economic growth in the industrialised countries continued slowly in 1978:
growth in gross national product in the member countries of the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development as a whole was probably under
4 per cent. For most countries unemployment remained high by post-1945
standards, while inflation continued to be a constraint on domestic policies.
Estimates of world trade in manufactures suggest growth of just over 3 per cent,
compared with an historical trend of about 9 per cent.
Output in Britain rose relatively rapidly in early 1978 but slowed down in
the latter half of the year, gross domestic product for the whole year rising by
3 per cent over 1977. Provisional output-based estimates for the first two
quarters of 1979 showed that output actually fell in the first quarter, mainly
reflecting the loss of output as a result of industrial disputes and severe winter
weather. A large part of this output was recouped in the second quarter. The
North Sea oil and gas sector was responsible for much of the growth in output in
1978 and this sector is continuing to increase in importance to the economy,
especially with the developments in the oil market. By the fourth quarter of 1978
oil and gas production was accounting for 7 per cent of industrial production
(at 1975 prices), compared with 4 per cent a year earlier. In 1978 the value of
oil and gas sales from the UK Continental Shelf (with gas valued at oil equiva¬
lent import prices) plus identifiable balance of payments current account
items (net) is estimated to have amounted to between ,£3,500 million and
£3 >75° million.
Real incomes increased substantially in Britain in 1978 as gross earnings rose
faster than prices. Together with income tax reductions during the year, this
meant that real personal disposable income was 8 per cent higher in the second
half of 1978 than in the corresponding period of 1977. As a result consumers’
spending rose in volume terms by almost 6 per cent over the same period, and
this high rate continued into 1979.
Total fixed investment rose by some 275 per cent between 1977 and 1978 in
real terms, although investment by manufacturing industry alone rose by some
8 per cent. A recent development has been the growth in leasing, and leased
assets now represent some 10 per cent of total investment for manufacturing
industry.
The volume of exports of goods increased by about 3-5 per cent in 1978,
compared with about 8-5 per cent in 1977. Within the 1978 total, exports of
fuels increased by 26 per cent, but exports of manufactures rose by only 2 per
cent. The volume of imports of goods grew by 5 per cent in the year but, within
this, imports of manufactures rose by 13-5 per cent, indicating that much of
the rise in consumer demand was met by imports.
In December 1978 unemployment in Britain (seasonally adjusted and exclud¬
ing school leavers) was some 100,000 below the peak level of November 1977,
198
Economic
Policy
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
having shown a slow but steady decline throughout 1978. Adult unemployment
increased in early 1979 as a result of bad weather and transport disputes but
then fell back steadily so that by September the level was 57,000 lower than in
December 1978.
In recent years successive Governments have adopted policies to control, on a
statutory or voluntary basis, wages or prices or both. These policies have served
to reduce inflation for a time, but have failed to achieve a lasting effect. Accord¬
ingly, in a radical departure from the approach of its predecessor, the Govern¬
ment elected in May 1979 introduced a Budget aimed at stimulating production,
not through the management of market demand but through the provision of
incentives to encourage output and innovation within a framework of greater
economic freedom for the individual. This it aims to do by controlling inflation
through the pursuit of firm monetary and fiscal policies, by reducing direct
taxation (see p 345) and by restricting public expenditure. It also intends to
pursue more effective competition and fair pricing policies. The Government
recognises that these policies will take time to achieve their object: indeed the
switch from direct to indirect taxation has had the effect of increasing the
retail prices index. However, the Government believes that these policies will
in the longer term achieve a lasting reduction in the rate of inflation.
Control of monetary growth is central to the Government’s policies for bring¬
ing down the rate of inflation. By progressively reducing the public sector
borrowing requirement (PSBR) and public expenditure, the Government
intends to shift the emphasis of monetary restraint away from the private sector
and on to the public sector. In his June 1979 Budget, however, the Chancellor’s
immediate action included a rise in the minimum lending rate, to bring money
supply growth under control. The Government aims to reduce the PSBR
from 5-5 per cent of GDP in 1978-79 to under 4*5 per cent in 1979-80 (£8,250
million). Public expenditure in 1980-81 is to be stabilised at some £69,800
million (at 1979 prices), approximately the same as the expected outturn in
1979-80. Increases in planned expenditure on defence, law and order and social
security will be offset by reductions in expenditure on other services.
Since 1976 Governments have announced specific objectives for the growth
of the monetary aggregates. For the 10 months to mid-April 1980 the Chancellor
announced in his June 1979 Budget a target range of 7-11 per cent at an annual
rate for the growth of the sterling M3 (which comprises all UK residents’
sterling bank deposits, of both public and private sectors, plus notes and coins
in circulation with the general public). This target is subject to reassessment
after six months, in the light of developments in the economy generally, when it
will be rolled forward to cover the succeeding 12-month period.
ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
The Government’s policies are carried out by the main departments with
economic responsibilities on a national scale: the Treasury, the Departments of
Trade, Industry, Employment, Energy, the Environment, and Transport and
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Other specialist bodies advise
on specific aspects of economic policy and include the National Economic
Development Council, which brings together representatives of government,
management and trade unions under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister,
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (on action to prevent the abuse of
monopoly power, see p 223) and the Office of Manpower Economics, an
independent non-statutory body (see p 333).

On matters of major public policy such as the broad economic strategy, and
problems such as inflation, the Government makes known its purposes, and
keeps in touch with developments throughout the economy, by means of
informal and continuous links with the chief industrial, financial, labour and
other interests. Final responsibility for the broad lines of economic policy rests
with the Cabinet. For regional economic planning see Chapter 8.
In Britain’s mixed economy, direct State intervention in industry and commerce
(as well as in social, cultural and other affairs) has often been effected through
special public corporations set up, usually by statute, to deal with a particular
activity. Though not part of a government department, the corporations are
under varying degrees of public control. The major nationalised industries are
the National Coal Board, British Gas, the electricity industry and the British
National Oil Corporation; the British Steel Corporation, British Aerospace and
British Shipbuilders; the Post Office; British Rail, the National Freight Corpora¬
tion, the National Bus Company and British Airways. The more recently
established nationalised industries include British Shipbuilders, British Aero¬
space and the British National Oil Corporation through which the Government
exercises its participation rights in the exploitation of Britain’s offshore oil
resources. These industries and services, which together employ about 8 per
cent of all employees, are described in their relevant sections. The public sector
as a whole employs a little over a quarter of the working population.
The Government intends to reduce the extent of State-ownership of industry
and increase competition by selling off some assets, giving opportunities for
employees to participate where appropriate.
NATIONAL INCOME AND EXPENDITURE
The following sections sketch briefly the structure and disposal of Britain’s
national income in recent years.
In 1978 Britain’s gross national product at factor cost (the measure of the total
value of goods and services produced at home and net income from abroad) is
estimated to have amounted to nearly £143,000 million. After allowing for price
changes, the increase over the ten years since 1968 was 23 per cent.
Over a quarter of total output can be attributed to manufacturing industry,
rather less than a decade ago. Expanding industry groups in recent years (in
relation to the economy as a whole) have been mining and quarrying (reflecting
the contribution of North Sea oil and gas), and services including communica¬
tions, public administration and health and educational services. Table 7
summarises the contribution of each group.
Table 8 shows the distribution of total supplies of goods and services in 1968,
1973 and 1978 at 1975 market prices.
The main trends since 1968 are a fall in the proportion of total available output
devoted to personal consumption and a significant rise in the proportion devoted
to exports.
Personal incomes before tax at current prices rose rapidly and fairly steadily
from £36,501 million in 1968 to £i43>213 naillion in 197^' Real personal dispos¬
able income was nearly 7 per cent higher in 1978 than in 1977.
Consumer expenditure amounted to 67 per cent of total pre-tax income in
1978 compared with 75 per cent in 1968. The difference is accounted for by a

1968). The three other main sources of personal income were self-employment
(9 per cent), income from rent, dividends and interest (10 per cent), and grants
from general government (12 per cent).
The combined effect of all taxation and transfer payments and benefits in kind
is to redistribute income on more egalitarian lines. According to studies by the
Central Statistical Office, the effect in 1977 was to raise the share of the poorest
fifth of households from 1 per cent of total original income to 9 per cent of all
final income. This group contains 12 per cent of the population and consists
mainly of retired people, dependent on State pensions. The share of the richest
fifth fell from 44 per cent to 35 per cent.
A rise in the volume of consumers’ spending has been accompanied, in Britain
as in other advanced industrial countries, by changes in its pattern.
Table 9 shows the amounts and proportions of consumers’ expenditure at
current prices in 1968 and 1978. Over this period the proportions spent on
food, tobacco, and clothing and footwear fell while the proportions spent on
alcoholic drink, housing and cars and motorcycles rose. At constant (1975)
prices consumers’ expenditure increased by almost 5-5 per cent between 1977
and 1978.

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Current expenditure on goods and services by the central Government and
local authorities rose by about 23 per cent at 1975 market prices over the period
1968 to 1978 when it amounted to about 20 per cent of the gross domestic
product (at current prices). I he main cause of this increase was the growth
over the period of the social services, especially education and the National Health
Service. In the same period defence accounted for a declining share of general
government expenditure on goods and services (23 per cent in 1978 compared
with 32 per cent in 1968 and 48 per cent in 1953).
In addition to their expenditure on goods and services, public authorities
transfer large sums to other sectors, mainly the personal sector, by way of
national insurance and other social security benefits, grants, and interest and
subsidies (see pp 139 and 185). The Government also makes grants to local
authorities to finance about 60 per cent of their current expenditure.
Cuts in the Government’s expenditure plans totalling about £4,000 million
were announced in the June 1979 Budget for the year 1979-80 (with some
increases in social security and defence spending).
Gross domestic fixed capital formation (total fixed investment) represents about
20 per cent of the gross domestic product at factor cost. The total value of fixed
assets in Britain, valued at constant replacement cost, is estimated to have
increased by 40 per cent between 1968 and 197^ when their current replacement
value, net of depreciation, was some £500,000 million, of which about two-thirds
was accounted for by buildings and one-third by plant and machinery, and
vehicles.
Within the total of gross domestic fixed capital formation in 1978 (£20,485
million compared with a peak of £21,111 million in 1973 at constant 1975
prices) private sector investment accounted for 66-8 per cent (57-9 per cent in
1973). general government for 16-5 per cent (27-3 per cent) and public corpora¬
tions for 16-7 per cent (14-8 per cent). The approximate shares of industry groups
in total fixed investment in 1978 were (1973 figures in brackets): manufacturing,
19 per cent (16 per cent), gas, electricity and water, 5 per cent (6 per cent),
petroleum and natural gas 8 per cent (1 per cent), transport and communications,
9 per cent (13 per cent), distributive trades, 6 per cent (5 per cent), dwellings,
19 per cent (20 per cent), social and other public services, 11 per cent (18 per
cent), and other industries, 23 per cent (21 per cent). There is a marked cyclical
pattern in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry ; it was at a peak
in 1970 and 1974, fell in 1975 and 1976 but increased considerably in 1977 and
1978- Among the trends in recent years has been the increase in investment in
North Sea oil and gas equipment which reached a peak in 1976.
THE EXTERNAL POSITION
In the years following devaluation in 1967 exports of goods and services increased
rapidly in real terms. Helped by a record surplus on current transactions of
£i>i5° million in 1971, and by massive capital inflows, the reserves stood at the
high level of just over £2,740 million by the end of May 1972, after the repay¬
ment of all official short- and medium-term debt.
In 1972 the trade balance began to deteriorate. The marked worsening of
Britain’s visible trade balance in 1973 and 1974 was much influenced by the
increases in world commodity prices, especially oil prices. By 1974 the terms
of trade, which were also affected by a fall in the sterling exchange rate, were
23 per cent lower than in I his was partly offset by a growing volume of
exports relative to imports. Between 1973 anfi W77 the volume of exports

increased by about 22 per cent while the volume of imports decreased by about
1 per cent. The improved competitive position of British exports, resulting
from the floating of the pound in June 1972, contributed to this, while imports
were held down in part by the low level of domestic demand. In 1975 and 1976
the deficit on current account was reduced substantially.
There was a marked improvement in 1977, largely as a result of growing

tourists in Britain, plus
production of North Sea oil. This led to a further reduction in the visible trade
deficit in 1978. There were surpluses on current account in both 1977 and 1978.
For details of overseas trade and payments see Chapter 19.
In 1971, a general international realignment of exchange rates was agreed at a
meeting held in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, in which all the
main currencies were in effect revalued against the dollar. (The rates of ex¬
change fixed in that agreement are called Smithsonian parities.) As part of this
realignment, the sterling rate for the dollar moved up by just over 8 J per cent,
the new middle rate being $2-60571 compared with the old par value of $2-40.
In June 1972 sterling was allowed to float. Sterling came under severe pressure
in 1976- Increased confidence in sterling throughout 1977 was shown by rises
in the official reserves to record levels and by upwards pressure on the exchange
rate. In October 1977 fhe Bank of England’s intervention policy was changed
and the pound allowed to appreciate on the foreign exchange markets. For the
next year the sterling-dollar exchange rate fluctuated within the range of £1 =
$1-79 to about $2, and has since risen fairly steadily. At the beginning of Sep¬
tember 1979 the effective rate was 71-5 (December 1971 =100) and the market
rate £1 = $2-25.
Britain incurred large overseas debts to finance balance of payments deficits
in the years i973_7^- consequence total official foreign borrowing outstanding
rose to $25,200 million by the end of 1977 (compared with some $5,000 million
at the end of 1972, largely accounted for by long-term post-war debts). By the
204
International
Monetary
Developments
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
end of 1977, however, the improvement in the external position enabled policy
to be directed towards reducing the total debt outstanding and the concentration
of debt due to be repaid in 1979-84. This has been done by a combination of
early repayments of debt and taking out new borrowing to refinance existing
debt due to mature during the period. During 1978 the Government and the
public sector repaid $4,600 million of overseas debt ($3,600 million ahead of
schedule), including $2,000 million to the International Monetary Fund.
Further early repayments to the IMF in early 1979 effectively extinguished
Britain’s debt to the IMF, apart from the oil facility of some $1,200 million
which was drawn in 1976 and is being repaid in 16 equal instalments over the
period 1979-83.
At the end of March 1979 the reserves were officially revalued to bring their
published value more closely in line with their market worth by valuing non¬
dollar reserves on a market-related basis. Revaluation increased the value of the
reserves to $22,000 million at the end of March. At the end of August the reserves
stood at $23,305 million.
The European Community established a European Monetary System in
March 1979 (see p 74), one of the main elements of which is an exchange rate
and foreign exchange market intervention mechanism between the currencies
of the member countries. Britain has participated in the system as a whole
from the outset and has swapped 20 per cent of its gold and dollar reserve
in exchange for European Currency Units (ECUs). The Government is
considering the question of Britain’s participation in the exchange rate
arrangements.
A second set of amendments to the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) entered into force on 1 April 1978. (The first amend¬
ments were made in 1969 when the Special Drawing Right—SDR—was
established.) They bring the articles up to date and provide for necessary
flexibility. The amendments were drawn up under the guidance of the Interim
Committee, which succeeded the Committee of Twenty in 1974.
Members undertake a general obligation to collaborate with the IMF and
with other members in order to ensure orderly exchange arrangements and to
promote a stable system of exchange rates. Under the new provisions the
Fund will be able to determine that, in accordance with specified criteria, inter¬
national economic conditions permit the introduction of a system based on
stable but adjustable par values. Each member will then be able, though not
bound, to establish a par value. The amendments provided for a gradual re¬
duction in the role of gold in the international monetary system. The function of
gold as the unit of value of the SDR has been eliminated, the official price has
been abolished and members are free to deal in gold in the market and among
themselves without reference to any official price, and obligatory payments in
gold by members to the Fund and by the Fund to members have been abrogated.
The IMF’s gold holdings are being reduced; one-sixth is being returned to
members, and a further sixth is being auctioned (the final auctions being in
May 1980), the major proportion of the proceeds from the auctions being dis¬
bursed through a trust fund, set up to provide medium-term balance of payments
support to the poorest developing countries. Changes have been made in the
role of the SDR in order to enhance its status as an international reserve asset.
The amendment also provides for changes in the organisation of the Fund and in
its financial operations.
The IMF set up borrowing arrangements (known as the oil facility) in 1974
and on a larger and more liberal scale in 1975, through which countries were able
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY 205
to draw on funds lent mainly by the oil-producers. The facility was fully drawn
and creditors will be repaid by 1983.
An extended facility for medium-term assistance to members with special
balance of payments problems caused by structural economic changes was also
introduced in 1974. A supplementary financing facility entered into force in
February 1979, to provide financial assistance to members whose payments
imbalances were large in relation to their economies and to their quotas in the
Fund.
The entry into force of the Second Amendment of the IMF’s articles on 1
April 1978 enabled the implementation of increases under the Sixth General
Review of Quotas. As a result, total Fund quotas were raised from SDR 29,000
million to SDR 39,000 million.
The production industries (mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction,
and gas, electricity and water), together with the distributive trades and trans¬
port and communications, account for some 60 per cent of Britain’s gross
domestic product (see Table 7 on p 200) and for about 55 per cent of total
employment. Financial and business services, professional and scientific services
(excluding public health and education services) and the various service trades
(such as catering, entertainment, and personal and household services) con¬
tribute a further 21 per cent of gross domestic product.
This chapter describes some of the general features of industrial activity, such
as the forms of enterprise and trends in production, productivity and invest¬
ment, and the geographical distribution of industry. It also describes government
measures to stimulate or, where necessary, regulate industrial activity. The
chapters following cover the main areas of industrial and commercial activity.
ORGANISATION AND PRODUCTION
The forms of industrial organisation and the pattern of ownership and control
are varied. Personal, corporate, co-operative and public enterprise all assume a
number of different forms, and all are important in the economy.
Limited liability companies are the commonest form of corporate enterprise
and may be either public (which usually means that shares in them can be bought
and sold on a stock exchange) or private.1 Public companies (of which there were
16,092 in Britain at the end of 1978) tend to be large, while the great majority of
private companies (685,800 at the end of 1978) are small. British company law is
being reviewed in the light of European Community legislation.
Most of the energy, transport and communications industries are in public
sector ownership. Most manufacturing (with the exceptions of steel, aerospace
and shipbuilding) is in the hands of private enterprise, as are the construction
and distributive industries. (See also p 199.)
The largest organisations in terms of numbers employed are public sector
corporations such as the Post Office (401,000) and the National Coal Board
(303,000) and companies such as BL, formerly British Leyland, (195,000),
General Electric Company (192,000) and Imperial Chemical Industries (154,000).
The largest companies in terms of capital employed (net assets) are British Petro¬
leum (over £5,500 million) and Shell Transport and Trading (£5,000 million).
Altogether more than 70 companies registered in Britain each have net assets
over £250 million; in terms of annual sales four of the top 20 industrial groups
in Europe are British.
Merging and regrouping have continued as the effort to reduce overheads has
intensified and, in many branches of industry, profitable operation has become
1 Apart from the buying and selling of shares, the main difference between a public and
private company is that there are regulations governing the number of shareholders that
each may have. Legislation is expected to be enacted by 1980 defining public and private
companies in a different way (mainly on the basis of asset size) in accordance with a
European Community directive.
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY

dependent on concentration and economies of scale. Larger units of control have
been established in almost all the leading industries and in some a small number
of big companies and their subsidiaries are responsible for a great proportion of
total production. Examples are oil refining, non-ferrous metal smelting, motor
vehicles and aircraft, heavy electrical engineering, electronics, machine tools,
brewing, textiles, basic chemicals, tobacco and magazine publishing. Shares in
these companies are, however, usually distributed among many holders or are
held by insurance companies or pension funds representing a broad cross-section
of the community, and it is rare for a few holders to have a controlling interest
other than in the case of private companies.
Alongside these large organisations are many hundreds of thousands of small
firms playing an essential part in the economy.
Voluntary associations are formed by private enterprises for a number of
different purposes, including the provision of common services, the exchange of
information and representation of their members’ point of view; the regulation
of trading practices; and negotiation with trade unions on wages and conditions
of work. These associations cover, with varying completeness, most of British
industry. Trade associations, concerned mainly with representation to the
Government, the provision of common services and the regulation of trading
practices, are normally composed of firms manufacturing (and/or retailing) a
particular product or group of products. Employers’ organisations which deal
with employment matters usually consist of firms engaged in the same type of
operation or manufacturing process. In an industrial sector concerned wholly
with an allied group of products, a single association may undertake all the
required functions. The national employers’ organisations are usually concerned
with negotiation of wages and conditions of work (see p 329).
The central body representing British business and industry nationally is the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI), recognised by the Government as a
channel for consultation between government departments and representatives
of both the private and the public sector employers as a whole. The CBI
membership consists of nearly 4,500 parent companies and between 11,000 and
12,000 subsidiaries and about 300 employers’ organisations and trade and
commercial associations and the majority of the nationalised industries. For
its members it acts as an advisory and consultative body providing them with
information and statistics, ascertaining their collective views and representing
them nationally to the Government and the public and also internationally (see
p 329). CBI representatives sit on the National Economic Development Council,
the Manpower Services Commission, the Health and Safety Commission, the
Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service and other official advisory
committees and voluntary bodies concerned with matters affecting industry.
In matters of common concern the CBI often acts jointly with the chambers
of commerce. These are open to all kinds of producers and traders and exist to
promote the interests of local, regional and national industry and commerce.
Most chambers provide export facilities, including the sponsorship of outward
trade missions and visits. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce,
founded in i860, is the co-ordinating body to which about 85 local chambers are
affiliated, together with 21 British Chambers of Commerce operating in Europe
and elsewhere. These chambers have a membership of about 50,000 firms. In
Scotland there is an additional central organisation, the Association of Scottish
Chambers of Commerce, and in Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to which local chambers are affiliated.
Other voluntary associations include industrial development associations for
208

particular areas or regions, which are sponsored by trade associations, in¬
dividual firms and local authorities. Four of these bodies (the North of England
Development Council, the North West Industrial Development Association, the
Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association and the Devon and
Cornwall Development Bureau) receive government grants, while the Scottish
Council for Development and the Development Corporation for Wales receive
grants from the Scottish and Welsh development agencies respectively.
Though industrial production in general has been affected by the world recession
in industry, it has risen over the depressed levels of 1975 (see Table 10), as
measured by the index of industrial production. Mining and quarrying output
has risen sharply owing to increased production of North Sea oil and gas.
Growth of manufacturing output has been more gradual; the 1978 level repre¬
sents an increase in output of more than 60 per cent over the previous 20 years.
The index of output in individual sectors of manufacturing is shown on p 228.

The improvement of productivity, which by international standards has shown
a relatively slow rate of growth in Britain, is recognised as being of prime
importance for the economy. Productivity, as measured by output per head,
increased by 12-6 per cent in all production industries between 1975 and 1978
(see Table 11). In manufacturing the increase was 6-4 per cent and in mining and
quarrying 139 per cent. Both the long-term and the short-term growth of
productivity are influenced by such factors as the rate of capital investment,
management, advances in products, machinery processes and methods of work,
sales promotion and labour. Over the last decade the size of the labour force
employed in industry has fallen steadily.
The improvement of productivity rests mainly with the management and the
workforce in individual enterprises. Support for their efforts is provided by the
Department of Industry. It assists the introduction of advanced machinery and
techniques into industry, provides technical advisory services and sponsors the
Computer-Aided Design Centre and the National Computing Centre. It is
concerned directly with research into such factors as productivity measurement
techniques, group technology and production engineering. The Department of
Employment advises firms on aspects of productivity connected with man¬
power utilisation, job satisfaction and industrial relations. Many educational
establishments also provide advice and assistance.
Within industry, employers’ organisations often provide technical assistance
and support schemes of vocational education and training, as do many trade
unions. The British Council of Productivity Associations is one of many bodies,
both public and private, concerned with various aspects of productivity. The

Productivity is particularly dependent on the quantity and efficiency of the
capital assets which the labour force has at its disposal. Details of investment
in the period i973-7^ are contained in Table 12. Investment in manufacturing
industries is described in more detail on p 227.

Part of the investment in plant and machinery is associated with the intro¬
duction of new techniques and equipment. The process of automation (see
below) is changing the pattern and organisation of many industries and has
brought substantial increases in production and efficiency. Much investment,
however, still consists of replacements, additions and improvements of a more
traditional kind. Industrial technologies of plant maintenance, materials hand¬
ling, lubrication and corrosion protection, well developed in Britain, make
possible large savings in costs.
In Britain, as in other industrialised countries, automation has been steadily
extended to a wide range of industrial and commercial activities. Extensive use
of automation is to be found across the whole range of production industries,
including metal manufacture, the petroleum and chemical industries, engineer¬
ing, food, drink and tobacco manufacture, printing and publishing, and
power transmission, and in service industries such as transport, posts and

telecommunications, retailing, wholesale distribution and business and financial
services.
The growth of digital techniques, including the use of computers, has greatly
extended the range for automatic operations; it is now possible for an entire
production process to be controlled automatically, and for information to be
provided rapidly for managerial, commercial and technical purposes. Britain
has many advanced applications of computer control in operation in both the
public and private sectors of industry, and is among the world’s leading nations
in the provision of ‘software’ services and systems (that is, the preparation of
instructions for computer operations).
The scope of electronic controls has been extended still further by the
development of micro-electronics, and in particular the microprocessor, a
term commonly used to refer to a miniature wafer or ‘chip’ of silicon about 5mm
(0-2 inches) square, on which are placed electronic circuits equivalent to those
found in the central processing unit of a computer. The importance of this
development has been widely recognised in Britain, partly through government
initiatives, including a microprocessor awareness campaign aimed at industrial¬
ists and trade unions. In addition financial support has been provided for the
micro-electronics industry, and a scheme to support applications of micro¬
electronics has been established. British companies are also improving the
performance of operations which are already automated by developing more
comprehensive and powerful control systems.
In Britain, as elsewhere, it is recognised that managers require special skills and
training. The British Institute of Management (BIM), which is playing an
increasingly representative role for the management and administrative pro¬
fessions, provides a wide range of information services and has a particular
interest in management education and training. The Institute of Directors also
provides information and other services to directors of all types of company. The
Industrial Society, whose membership includes trade unions as well as em¬
ployers and their associations, works to promote better use of human resources;
it advises members and conducts conferences and courses.
A large proportion of management education is provided by polytechnics and
many of the colleges of further education throughout Britain; 12 regional centres
of management education have been established in England and Wales through
the association of polytechnics and colleges which have high reputations for
management studies. Universities also make an important contribution, especi¬
ally the full-time postgraduate programmes at the business schools of London
and Manchester Universities. Training courses for higher management are
offered by several colleges including the Administrative Staff College, Henley-
on-Thames, and Ashridge College of Management, Berkhamsted. The Council
of Industry for Management Education, jointly sponsored by the CBI, the BIM
and the Foundation for Management Education, works to foster the develop¬
ment of business and management education. Many firms provide general
management courses for senior executives or systems of informal training. There
are also a number of bodies concerned with specialised branches of management,
for example, the Institute of Personnel Management, the Institution of Works
Managers, the Institute of Administrative Management, the Institute of Super¬
visory Management, the Institute of Marketing, the Institute of Chartered
Secretaries and Administrators and the Institute of Purchasing and Supply.
The large number of professional people working as management con¬
sultants indicates the concern for improved management performance in Britain.
Such consultancy services are being increasingly used by overseas clients.
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY

Design
Industrial
Property
Standards
Design is an important factor in improving the quality and competitiveness of
manufactured goods. Improvement of the design of British goods is the concern
of the government-sponsored Design Council and its separate Scottish Com¬
mittee, while the Computer-Aided Design Centre (see p 381) also provides
assistance to individual firms.
At the Council’s Design Centres in London and Glasgow there are permanent
displays of well-designed modern British goods, together with special exhibitions
illustrating new design developments. There is a third, smaller showroom in
Cardiff. All the products displayed are chosen from the Council’s Design Index,
a record of some 7,000 current British products, chosen by independent com¬
mittees for their high standards of design, safety and performance. The Council’s
services include advice on design matters, the organisation of product displays
at overseas trade fairs, conferences and seminars on design, help for design
education and the publication of a range of material. It provides annual Design
Council Awards for manufacturers of consumer and engineering products and
for medical equipment and motor vehicles.
Other bodies concerned with industrial design include the Royal Society of
Arts (see p 385), the Society of Industrial Artists and Designers, which is the
representative professional body in Great Britain of industrial designers, and
the Design and Industries Association, a voluntary association of industrial
companies, designers, and others interested in the promotion of good design in
industry. The British Craft Centre and the Scottish Craft Centre are both grant-
aided and work to improve craft design by, for example, organising regular
exhibitions and other events.
There exists a substantial body of legislation designed to secure the rights of the
originators of inventions relating to manufacture, new industrial designs and
trade marks. These matters are administered respectively by the Patents Office,
the Design Registry and the Trade Marks Registry, while governmental
responsibility is exercised by the Department of Trade. It is also open to
British residents to apply for protection under international agreements such as
the European Patent Convention and the Patent Co-operation Treaty, both of
which came into effect in 1978. International protection for patents, designs and
trade marks is available under the International Convention for the Protection
of Industrial Property.
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is a voluntary non-profit-making body
incorporated by Royal Charter, funded in part by sale of standards, by sub¬
scription and by government grant. It prepares and promulgates standards
which, variously, specify dimensions, performance and safety criteria, testing
methods and codes of practice for a large range of products and processes in
most fields of production. Voluntary acceptance of such standards by manu¬
facturers, buyers and sellers reduces unnecessary variety and simplifies the
specification of requirements. BSI is governed by an executive board which
includes representatives of the main organisations of employers and workers,
professional institutions, consumers and the larger government departments.
The British Calibration Service (BCS) was established in 1966 in response to
the growth in demand for industrial calibration services, which was beginning to
exceed the capacity of the National Physical Laboratory (see p 380). The BCS is
an organisation of over 80 laboratories, belonging to industry, universities and
the Government, which offer ‘authenticated calibration traceable to national
standards’, a phrase which refers to the fact that all these laboratories make
measurements with instruments which are calibrated directly by the National

Physical Laboratory (NPL), Britain’s highest calibration authority, or against
secondary standards which are themselves calibrated by NPL. BCS laboratories
issue calibration certificates for electrical, mechanical, optical, pressure, flow and
thermal measurements; the range covers those essential to quality, efficiency and
safety in manufacturing and process industries. The BCS has provided a model
which other countries have followed.
The following is a summary of how British industry is distributed through the
eight standard regions of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
London is Britain’s capital and main communication centre, and is one of the
world’s most important financial and tourist centres. Lying at the head of ocean
navigation on the Thames estuary it is one of the world’s largest cities and largest
ports, though much deep-sea-going traffic has moved down-river to Tilbury
docks. It is the main centre in Britain of printing and the manufacture of
ladies’ clothing, materials for the arts, precision instruments, jewellery, and many
other specialised products. Small firms predominate in many of these industries
and the average size of manufacturing firms (particularly in the central area)
is well below the national average. London is also important, especially in its
outer ring, for light engineering, chemicals and consumer goods and has some
heavy engineering plants and a number of leading research establishments.
There has been in recent years, however, a considerable drop in employment
and population in London.
Towards the periphery of Greater London and in the surrounding Outer
Metropolitan Area, industry, particularly the electronics and consumer goods
industries, has expanded greatly; some of the largest aircraft plants are in these
areas, for example at Weybridge and Hatfield, as well as two of the four main
motor vehicle manufacturers at Dagenham, Luton and Dunstable. There are
other major motor vehicle manufacturing plants at Cowley, Oxford, some 50
miles north-west of London. High technology industries are well represented in
Hertfordshire, and Chelmsford is an important centre for the electronics
industry. Along the lower Thames and Medway estuaries there are large oil
refineries as well as some smaller shipyards, engineering works and major con¬
centrations of the paper and pulp and cement industries. There are centres of
manufacturing industry at Crawley, Basingstoke, Slough and Reading, in the
Medway towns and the Aldershot-Farnborough area. Heathrow and Gatwick
airports are of major importance and are large employers.
A great part of the Channel coast eastwards from Southampton consists of
built-up areas, many of which are partly residential areas for people working in
London. Holiday resorts fringe the coast. Portsmouth is a naval port with some
shipbuilding and general manufacturing. Southampton is one of Britain’s
leading ports for both passengers and freight; its industries include ship repair¬
ing, oil refining, cable-making, electronics and synthetic rubber. Dover,
Folkestone and Newhaven are ferry ports. Brighton, apart from being an
important holiday, residential and conference centre, is a university town and has
important manufacturing plant.
Though famous for its tourism, leisure industries and agriculture, the south¬
west of England has a busy manufacturing sector. Bristol, the region’s admini¬
strative and commercial centre, is a leading port and the largest industrial city,
having tobacco, packaging materials, printing, aerospace, chocolate and metal
manufacture as well as a wide range of engineering and other industries; there
are extensive modern docks at Avonmouth, an industrialised suburb with

important basic chemicals and non-ferrous metal plants. Plymouth, with the
naval dockyard and electrical and other industries, is an important manu¬
facturing centre. The towns of Gloucester, Poole, Christchurch, Cheltenham
and Bath are major producers of machinery, instrumentation and other engineer¬
ing products. Swindon has vehicle, electrical and electronic engineering.
Chemical and engineering products are made at Yeovil, Taunton and Bridg¬
water. Clothing and other textile products and footwear are made at several
centres. In the Camborne, Redruth, Falmouth and St. Austell areas of Corn¬
wall there is china clay and tin mining, and machinery manufacture, ship
repairing and other forms of engineering.
Although the smallest of the regions East Anglia has been rapidly growing in
terms of both population and employment. A major contribution to this growth
was made by a scheme under which nine towns absorbed an overspill of popula¬
tion and industry from London. The area is one of the most productive
agricultural regions in the world and this has provided a firm base for the
growth of the food processing industry, which is concerned mainly with canning,
and more recently freezing local produce. Cambridge is a major centre of
research-based industry; Ipswich and Peterborough are noted for diesel engines,
agricultural machinery and engineering generally and Norwich for footwear and
food manufacture. Cambridge, Ipswich and Norwich have become increasingly
important as centres for service industries. The east coast ports of Great Yar¬
mouth and Lowestoft are important bases for companies associated with natural
gas exploitation in the North Sea.
This is the only landlocked region and it has a greater dependency on manu¬
facturing industry than any other region. However, more than three-quarters of
the land is still used for agriculture and includes some areas of great natural
beauty, particularly in the south and west. The main concentration of industry
is in the West Midlands metropolitan county which includes the districts of
Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhamp¬
ton. The economy is largely dependent upon the metal-using industries and in
particular on motor vehicle manufacture. Other notable industries are mechanical
and electrical engineering, machine tools, castings, tubes, locks, jewellery,
domestic metalware and rubber manufactures. The metropolitan county also
contains the National Exhibition Centre, which is one of the largest and most
modern exhibition complexes in the world.
In north Staffordshire, a smaller conurbation centred upon Stoke-on-Trent
is the centre of the British pottery and china industry and the region’s major
coalmining area. Other industries are rubber and electrical products. Coal¬
mining is also important in the Cannock Chase and north Warwickshire areas.
Other important centres include Stafford, with heavy electrical and other
engineering; Worcester, mechanical engineering and pottery; Burton-on-
Trent, brewing and rubber; Kidderminster, carpets; and Rugby, electrical
engineering. Stratford-upon-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare, is
an international tourist centre.
The two major new towns, Telford and Redditch, have large metal-based
industries.
Although some major industries are heavily concentrated in the East Midlands
(over 60 per cent of Britain’s hosiery and knitwear, 40 per cent of its footwear
and more than 20 per cent of its coal) industry is well diversified. North Not¬
tinghamshire and Derbyshire are traditional coalmining areas where productivity
214
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
rates are high. In the northern part of the region engineering is also important.
In Nottingham a high proportion of employment is in pharmaceuticals, elec¬
tronics, tobacco and bicycle manufacture. Nottingham lace is famous throughout
the world, but textiles and clothing are of more importance. Derby is primarily
an engineering town with aero-engines, rail rolling stock, boilers and castings
among a wide range of engineering products. The production of man-made
fibres is also of considerable importance. Agriculture is significant in Lincoln¬
shire as well as food processing and engineering, much of which produces
agricultural and constructional equipment. Lincoln has a substantial engineering
industry. Engineering is also a major industry in Leicestershire, much of it
supplying other local industries such as textiles and footwear. Electrical engineer¬
ing is of especial importance in Loughborough. Northamptonshire is famous
for high quality footwear. In recent years light engineering, much of it related
to the motor and electronics industries, has expanded considerably.
North West The North West comprises the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester
and Merseyside and the counties of Lancashire and Cheshire. The Department
of Industry’s administration of this region extends also into parts of Cumbria
and Derbyshire. The region is one of the most highly industrialised in Britain.
Manchester is Britain’s second most important commercial and financial centre
and an important port. It is one of the chief centres for electrical and heavy
engineering and for the production of a wide range of goods including computers,
electronic equipment, petrochemicals, clothing, dye-stuffs and pharmaceuticals.
Manchester’s traditional role as the centre for the Lancashire textile industry
is only a small part of its present-day activities.
The textile towns, while adapting to the decline of traditional textiles and to
increasing use of man-made fibres and moving into new textile products, such
as carpets, have for the most part seen engineering outgrow the textile industry.
The largest towns, Bolton, Stockport, Oldham, Blackburn, Preston, Rochdale,
Burnley and Bury, are diversified with such industries as paper-making, textile
and electrical machinery, light engineering and consumer durables, plastics,
foods, chemicals, nuclear process plant, electronics, aircraft and heavy com¬
mercial vehicles.
The Manchester Ship Canal, which carries a substantial volume of export
traffic, links Manchester and Merseyside. It passes through Warrington, with
its new town, Widnes, Runcorn with the chemical industry, and Ellesmere Port
with its oil refinery installations, before reaching the Mersey estuary. St. Helens,
to the north of the canal, is famous for glass manufacture. Liverpool, with its
modernised dock system, is one of Britain’s leading seaports and, after London,
the largest centre for processing and converting imported foodstuffs and raw
materials (grain milling, oils, fats and tobacco, sugar refining and rubber
products). The centre of economic activity in Merseyside is still its port, but
its industrial strength has moved from older industries closely related to the
port to the newer industries including motor vehicles, electrical engineering,
heavy industrial plant and chemicals.
To the north of this industrial belt lie Blackpool and Lancaster with light
industries and chemicals and to the south, the Cheshire plain with agriculture,
while a variety of industries such as salt, chemicals, motor vehicles, pharma¬
ceuticals and rail engineering are located among the smaller towns.
The countryside lies close to most towns and the region contains some of
Britain’s most fertile farmland. There is a large tourist industry on the coast
and in historic towns, such as Chester and the four National Parks on or near
its boundaries. There are major airports at Liverpool and Manchester, a highly

developed rail system and one of the most advanced motorway networks in
Britain, providing good access throughout the region, and to the rest of the
country and continental Europe through the east coast ports.
Though some parts of Yorkshire and Humberside are heavily industrialised,
more than four-fifths of the region is open country.
The region’s industrial structure is diverse. About 70 per cent of Britain’s
worsted and woollen industry is located in West Yorkshire. Bradford is the
commercial centre of the wool trade. In addition there are strong sectors of
engineering, printing, textile machinery and carpets. The metropolitan district
of Leeds is an important commercial centre and also has a variety of industries
including men’s clothing and various engineering industries. In the south, the
steel centre based on Sheffield and Rotherham is noted for the manufacture of
high quality steels, tools and cutlery. Yorkshire’s coalfields are particularly
important and production is to be extended to the Selby area, where major
new reserves have been discovered. Doncaster, with tractor and nylon manu¬
facturing, and Barnsley are the largest towns on the coalfield where dependence
on steel and coal has been reduced by the introduction of new industries in
and around the major towns.
North Yorkshire is mainly agricultural but York, a leading tourist attraction,
is also noted for chocolate and confectionery manufacture. It is an important
railway centre, and has substantial railway workshops.
Kingston upon Hull is the principal industrial town in Humberside, which
is a major centre for maritime trade with ports at Grimsby, Immingham and
Goole in addition to Hull. Besides being important fishing ports, Hull and
Grimsby contain specialised food processing and cold storage facilities. The
Humber ports are strategically situated for direct access to Western Europe.
The British Steel Corporation’s plant at Scunthorpe is one of Britain’s largest
steel producers. Close by are chemical, fertiliser, oil refining, and food processing
plants. The north bank of the Humber contains a large proportion of Britain’s
caravan manufacturing industry.
The greater part of this region (the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear and
the counties of Northumberland, Durham, Cleveland and Cumbria) is an area
of mountains, lakes and moorland. The tourist industry, already strong in the
Lake District, is developing in other areas. Industrial activity and the bulk
of the population is concentrated in the eastern coastal strip stretching from
the coalfields north of the River Tyne southwards to the River Tees, and to a
lesser extent, on the western coastal strip of Cumbria.
The region is relatively more dependent than other parts of England on the
long-established heavy industries, notably coalmining, iron and steel manu¬
facture, shipbuilding and ship-repairing and chemicals (the complex of chemical
plants on both banks of the Tees is probably the most extensive in Europe).
Europe’s largest steelmaking complex is being developed in the Teesside area.
New industries, however, with a broader technological base, have been success¬
fully attracted to the region and the industrial structure is becoming more
diversified. Manufacture of electrical plant is a major industry.
Other industries include electric components, plastics, domestic appliances,
pharmaceuticals, machine tools, ropes, paint, glass, clothing and scientific
instruments as well as mining machinery, rolling mill plant and earth-moving
equipment. An aluminium smelter is operating on the Northumberland coast.
Atomic energy is important, with two nuclear power stations and other instal¬
lations in Cumbria, and a further nuclear power station at an advanced stage
2l6
Wales

of construction at Hartlepool. Considerable investment is taking place in the
coalmining industry to exploit large coal reserves below the sea bed off the
Northumberland and Durham coasts and to boost open-cast coal production.
The region is also involved in the North Sea oil programme. The new oil ter¬
minal at Teesside has a potential capacity of one million barrels a day of North
Sea oil. A major new reservoir at Kielder will, when completed, provide water
supplies for industry on Tyneside and Teesside.
Some two-thirds of the population (which totals 2-8 million) live in industrial
south Wales. This area has a diverse range of modern manufacturing industries,
including mechanical and electrical engineering, motor vehicle components,
plastics, chemicals and textiles. Though coalmining has declined substantially, the
south Wales coalfield still produces virtually all Britain’s anthracite and much
of its steam and other specialised coals. Steel, the other traditional industry
of south Wales, is less dominant in employment terms than formerly but still
supplies all of Britain’s tinplate and much of its sheet steel. Cardiff, Newport
and Swansea are the largest urban centres and, with Barry and Port Talbot,
are also the major ports of the region. This latter has one of the largest steel¬
making plants in Britain and a deep water harbour for importing iron ore.
Milford Haven is one of the finest natural deep water harbours in the world
and has developed as Britain’s major oil-importing port with four oil refineries
and a link with a fifth at Llandarcy.
The other main industrial area is in north-east Wales. Coalmining has now
contracted in importance but steel finishing, chemicals, man-made fibres and
aircraft construction remain significant sources of employment despite some
shedding of labour in recent years. A range of new lighter industry has been
introduced in the post-war years, particularly around Wrexham. The remainder
of Wales is predominantly rural with agriculture, forestry and tourism the
traditional basis of the economy, but here too manufacturing firms have been
successfully introduced in many towns, and one or two very large scale under¬
takings such as an aluminium plant at Holyhead, Anglesey, have been established.
About three-quarters of Scotland’s population of 5-2 million and most of the
industrial activity is concentrated in the central lowlands between the Firth of
Clyde and the Firth of Forth. The principal cities in this area are Glasgow, a
major commercial centre, and Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital, an administrative,
financial and cultural centre. There is, in addition, a wide variety of manufactur¬
ing industries. Clydeside, which includes Glasgow, is a major shipbuilding and
marine engineering centre; it produces a great variety of general engineering
products, which include modules, pumps and other products for the oil industry.
Clydeside is also an important centre for food, drink and tobacco manufactures,
carpets and printing and publishing. The steel industry, sited mainly in Central
Strathclyde, is being modernised. There are important coalmining works in
the Strathclyde, Central, Lothian and Fife regions. The electronics equipment
industry is represented in Strathclyde, Fife and Dundee, as well as in Edinburgh,
where this and other modern industries are expanding alongside the traditional
engineering, printing and publishing and brewing industries. Large-scale plants
producing cars in Linwood, near Paisley, and commercial vehicles in West
Lothian and the Scotstoun district of Glasgow, are well established, while
heavy earth-moving equipment and tracked vehicles are produced in Uddingston
and Airdrie. The chemical industry is concentrated in Ayrshire and at Grange¬
mouth, where there is also a major oil refinery. The Firth of Clyde provides
central Scotland with valuable deep water facilities.
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY
217
North-east Scotland is now the centre of the offshore oil industry and a
wide variety of oil-related projects have been established. Aberdeen, one of two
main industrial cities outside the central belt, has additionally become the chief
servicing and administrative centre for the oil industry. In June 1978 between
56,000 and 66,000 people were employed in Scotland as a whole in work directly
or indirectly related to oil. However, the older industries in the north-east
(whisky distilling, paper manufacture and food and fish processing) continue to
flourish.
Elsewhere outside the central belt there is considerable industrial concentra¬
tion in and around Dundee, where the traditional manufacture, jute, has been
supplemented by office machinery, clocks and watches, tyres and electronic
products. Numerous smaller towns outside the central lowlands have also
attracted light industry in recent years.
Much of the rest of Scotland is mountainous and therefore sparsely populated.
In the Highlands and Islands, the main industries include high quality tweed
and knitwear, papermaking and aluminium smelting and there are significant
resources of hydro-electric power. Nuclear power is also generated. The develop¬
ment of North Sea oil has led to very substantial oil-related activities including
oil platform production yards. The oil terminal at Sullom Voe, Shetland, which
became operational in 1978, is the largest in Europe. In the Borders and south¬
west of Scotland, the wool, cloth and knitwear industries are important, together
with food processing and chemicals manufacture. Tourism is important through¬
out Scotland and there are extensive holiday and recreational facilities.
Northern Ireland Although the area of Northern Ireland is relatively small there is substantial
and growing industrialisation, particularly in and around Belfast, the capital
city, and Londonderry. Britain’s largest single shipyard is in Belfast; other
well-established activities include the manufacture of aircraft, textile machinery
and a wide range of other engineering products, tobacco and clothing. Northern
Ireland has also long been an important centre for textiles. The textile industry
is extensively diversified and Northern Ireland is one of the most important
areas in Europe for man-made fibre production, providing over a quarter of
Britain’s output. There has also been extensive development in vehicle compon¬
ents, oil-well equipment, electronic instruments, telecommunication equipment,
carpets and synthetic rubber.
THE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY
While attempting to create favourable conditions for industrial activity generally,
the Government also seeks to correct regional imbalances through schemes of
assistance to areas with serious structural unemployment problems. The
Government can influence industrial activity in a number of ways—by exhorta¬
tion, through fiscal and monetary policy, through the level of public expenditure,
by inducements, through the placing of government contracts, through the
policies of publicly owned enterprises, by the provision of services, information
and advice, and through regulatory legislation such as that relating to land use
or to monopolies and restrictive trading practices.
The departments chiefly responsible for the Government’s relations with
industry are the Department of Industry (responsible for manufacturing and
for industrial research and design), the Department of Energy, the Department
of Trade (aviation, shipping, tourism, printing and publishing and the dis¬
tributive and service industries), the Department of Transport (inland transport),
the Department of the Environment (construction and water supply), and
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
the appropriate departments of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland
Offices.
The Government also has close relations with industry through the National
Economic Development Council (see p 198), subcommittees of which bring
together representatives of the Government, managements and trade unions to
make recommendations on certain industrial sectors and on various aspects of
industry.
Direct state participation in industry is mainly effected through public corpora-
Enterprise tions sponsored by government departments and responsible for particular
sectors of industrial activity. Such corporations are responsible for most of
Britain’s energy and transport sectors and for several within manufacturing;
their activities are described in the relevant chapters.
The managing boards and staffs of the nationalised industries are not generally
civil servants and although accountable to Parliament for their actions in a
variety of ways, it is they and not the ministers of the sponsoring departments
who are responsible for management.
The extent to which the responsible minister has power over the working of
the boards which have been set up to run the nationalised industries varies
from industry to industry, but two features are common to almost all of them.
First, the minister appoints (and may dismiss) the chairman and members of
each board, and, secondly, he has power to give general directions as to how
the industry should be run, but does not interfere in day-to-day management.
It is usually also laid down that the board shall give to the minister any informa¬
tion, statistics and financial accounts which he may require. In practice, as the
responsible minister is kept fully informed and major policy decisions are
reached in consultation with him, there is very seldom occasion for him to issue
a general directive. Indeed, the Government’s policy is to keep ministerial
intervention to a minimum and to encourage the nationalised industries to
behave as far as possible as commercial enterprises.
The minister also has financial powers and responsibilities. The usual statu¬
tory requirement is that the board is required to conduct its business so that
receipts at least balance outgoings over a period. However, financial targets
have been agreed by the Government for certain industries and targets for the
remaining industries are to be set as soon as possible. The main form of target,
usually set for 3-5 years, is a real return before interest on average net assets
employed. The Government is also discussing with the industries the develop¬
ment of a more direct way of relating the opportunity cost of capital to financial
performance. The responsible minister is usually empowered, subject to
Treasury approval, to say what shall be done with any surplus revenues which
may accrue. As regards finance for capital expenditure, the present system is
that finance which cannot be found from internal sources is provided mainly by
interest-bearing loans from the Exchequer and by borrowing from abroad.
Other sources of finance include grants and Public Dividend Capital on which
dividends are paid to the Government.
It is usual for the minister responsible for each nationalised industry to be
required by statute to take steps to see that the interests of the industry’s
customers are protected. This is done for certain of the industries (see p 225)
by the establishment of representative consumers’ councils to consider com¬
plaints and suggestions, and to advise the board or the minister on the changes
they think desirable.
Government policy towards the nationalised industries is subject to the
approval of Parliament. Opportunities for parliamentary discussion are afforded

by debates, including debates on their annual reports and accounts, and by
answers to parliamentary questions, which, in principle, are admissible only if
concerned with policy rather than details of administration. Provision is also
made for the examination of the affairs of the nationalised industries within the
parliamentary committee system.
The National Enterprise Board (NEB) is a public corporation which acts as a
state holding company and also has certain powers to assist in the development
of high technology companies and to provide investment funds for firms,
particularly small firms, in areas of high unemployment in England, principally
the assisted areas.
The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Development Agencies promote
industrial development within their regions by providing investment funds and
promoting new ventures, often in association with established companies. The
Scottish and Welsh agencies also have responsibilities for factory building and
land reclamation (see p 220) and for small firms (see p 222).
Britain has a generous system of national incentives for industrial development.
Under the Finance Act 1972 incentives to encourage capital expenditure in plant
and machinery take the form of a system of free depreciation enabling the whole
of such expenditure to be written off against profits for tax purposes in the year
in which it is incurred; there is in addition a 54 per cent initial allowance on new
industrial buildings and structures and an annual writing down allowance of
4 per cent thereafter.
Direct financial assistance, in the form of grants and loans, is available in a
number of ways. In addition to regional development assistance (see below),
aid may be provided throughout Britain under the Industry Acts 1972 and 1975
where it is judged to be in the national interest. High technology developments
in industry are eligible for support under the Science and Technology Act 1965.
Direct investment from overseas is also encouraged, and overseas firms are
offered the same facilities and incentives as those applying to British-owned
companies.
Economic imbalance between different parts of the country is due partly to the
steady decline over the years of older industries, such as coalmining and ship¬
building, causing a high level of unemployment in certain regions and such
adverse factors as poor amenities, derelict buildings and land and net outward
migration. In addition, the newer and expanding industries have tended to
develop mostly in the Midlands and the South East, and unemployment has
remained a persistent problem in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and some
parts of England, particularly the North and Merseyside. The ending of regional
imbalance has been an objective of successive Governments. Financial and other
aid to areas of high unemployment began in the 1930s and has been expanded
considerably over the years.
In parts of Britain designated as ‘assisted areas’ incentives are offered by the
Government to encourage industrial development and the growth of office and
other service employment. There are three categories of assisted area: special
development areas, where the economic situation and consistently high rates of
unemployment give rise to the most urgent need for assistance; development
areas with similar but rather less severe problems; and the intermediate area,
where some assistance is necessary but where the need is relatively less acute

than in the other types of area. Until August 1980 the assisted areas cover the
whole of Scotland and Wales, and in England the Northern, North West and
Yorkshire and Humberside regions; parts of the South West and East Midlands
regions; and Oswestry in the West Midlands. There will, however, be substantial
reductions in these areas, beginning in August 1980, in accordance with the
Government’s policy of concentrating help on the areas of greatest need.
Northern Ireland is covered by separate legislation; the incentives available are
outlined on p 221.
Under the Industry Act 1972 regional development grants are available in
special development and development areas towards the costs of plant,
machinery, buildings and works provided on premises used wholly or mainly
for specified manufacturing activities. Grants are also available in the inter¬
mediate areas towards the costs of buildings and works provided before August
1980. These grants are not limited to projects creating employment, and are thus
available to help with improvements and modernisation. In addition they are
not treated as reducing the capital expenditure which qualifies for tax allowances.
The Act also provides for selective financial assistance for projects which
are likely to provide, maintain or safeguard employment in any part of the
assisted areas. Assistance may be provided in a number of forms, the usual
ones for employment-creating projects being loans at concessionary rates of
interest, grants, and service industry grants.
Other forms of assistance available include the provision of modern factories for
rent or purchase, free use of government training services, and grants to assist the
transfer of key workers to posts in the assisted areas. Firms in the development
and special development areas are given preferential treatment when tendering
for contracts placed by government departments and nationalised industries.
Special measures to improve the infrastructure in the assisted areas include
provisions under the Local Employment Act 1972 for grants towards the
improvement of basic services (such as transport, power and water facilities)
and towards the acquisition and clearance of derelict land (see p 176).
Broadly speaking, responsibility for regional industrial development is exercised
in England through the Department of Industry and in Scotland and Wales
through the Scottish and Welsh Offices respectively. An important exception,
however, is the regional development grant scheme, which is operated through¬
out Great Britain by the Department of Industry.
In England the regional offices of the Department of Industry in the main
assisted areas (the North, North West and Yorkshire and Humberside offices)
can handle applications for loans of up to £2 million under the selective financial
assistance scheme without reference to the Department’s headquarters. The
Secretary of State for Industry has access to advice from the Industrial Develop¬
ment Advisory Board, a statutory body composed of prominent members of
the industrial and financial community, which makes recommendations on
industrial opportunities and on applications for selective financial assistance.
Non-statutory industrial development boards have also been established for
the North, North West, South West and Yorkshire and Humberside regions.
In Scotland and Wales, day-to-day work is carried out by the Scottish
Economic Planning Department and by the Industry Department of the
Welsh Office. Statutory Scottish and Welsh Industrial Development Advisory
Boards advise the respective Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. The
Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies are responsible for the provision of

factories for rent or purchase and are also concerned with the reclamation of
derelict land.
Under separate legislation (the Industries Development Acts 1966 and 1971,
as amended in 1976) the Northern Ireland Department of Commerce offers a
full range of incentives comparable to those available in the assisted areas of
Great Britain.
All firms establishing factories in Northern Ireland, without regard to the
number of jobs created, are eligible for capital grants at the rate of 30 per cent
of the cost of new buildings, machinery and equipment; for grants towards
training and free use of government training services; for grants towards the
cost of transferring key workers; and for the derating of industrial buildings
by 75 per cent. The capital grants, like regional development grants in Great
Britain, are not treated as reducing the capital expenditure which qualifies for
tax allowances.
Projects which are especially attractive because of the number of jobs created
can obtain special benefits which include industrial development grants of up
to 50 per cent of the cost of new buildings, machinery and equipment (as an
alternative to capital grants); contributions towards setting-up costs; grants of up
to too per cent of the cost of transferring plant and machinery; modern factories
for rent or purchase; and loans, loan guarantees and interest relief grants.
Grants of up to 50 per cent are available for research and development pro¬
jects (up to a maximum of £250,000 for any one project).
Assistance is also available to firms in the service sector which have a genuine
choice of location within Britain and which create additional net employment.
Projects serving primarily local needs are not assisted. The forms of aid available
to the manufacturing sector may also be offered to service sector projects.
The Northern Ireland Development Agency may also assist financially with
industrial development projects.
The Government also influences the location of industry by requiring industrial
development certificates before planning permission can be sought for the
building of new factories (or for extensions to existing ones) above prescribed
limits outside the assisted areas of Great Britain. Certificates are not required
in Northern Ireland. However, since 1977 the Government has been encouraging
industrial development in deprived inner-city areas (see p 171), whether or not
these are in the assisted areas.
The European Regional Development Fund assists regions of the European
Community suffering from problems of a preponderance of agriculture, indus¬
trial change and structural under-employment. In particular payments are
made from the fund in respect of approved industrial and infrastructure projects
in the assisted areas. Britain’s share of the fund in the period 1975-78 was about
£250 million.
Under a scheme introduced in 1978, loans are available from the European
Investment Bank to firms in the development areas, special development areas
and Northern Ireland. The Government is provisionally guaranteeing borrowers
against losses due to exchange rate movements.
Under a scheme introduced in 1979 loans are available from the European Coal
and Steel Community through the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corpora¬
tion (see p 354) for companies in those parts of the assisted areas affected by
222

redundancies in the coal and steel industries. The Government is providing
guarantees to borrowers, as under the European Investment Bank scheme.
Encouragement for the development of rural industries in England is provided
under the aegis of the Development Commission set up in 1909. Through the
agency of the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas (CoSIRA), the
commission provides managerial and technical advice, training facilities and a
credit service to small manufacturing and service industries in rural areas.
Loans and advice are also provided for small tourism enterprises in the rural
parts of the assisted areas and in the Commission’s special investment areas.
In addition the commission provides factory premises in rural areas and lends
support for pioneering and experimental schemes bearing on the rural economy,
for voluntary bodies aiming to enrich social and cultural life in the countryside,
and for surveys and other work in rural areas.
In Scotland and Wales these services are provided by the Scottish and Welsh
Development Agencies. Separate bodies, however, cater for particular rural
areas. In Scotland the Highlands and Islands Development Board, set up by
Act of Parliament in 1965, provides assistance to the Highland region, and
surrounding islands, and to parts of the Strathclyde region. It provides grants
and loans to industrial and commercial enterprises, builds factories, and has
powers to acquire land and set up businesses. The Development Board for
Rural Wales has the general function of promoting and undertaking measures
for economic and social development in the county of Powys and the districts
of Meirionnydd and Ceredigion. It has a particular responsibility for new
towns in those areas and can acquire land, carry out building and provide basic
services. Within its area the board owns and manages government estates and
factories and also acts as agent for the Welsh Development Agency in the pro¬
vision of investment finance for small firms.
The Department of Industry has a separate division which is the focal point
for the formation of policy towards small firms. In association with the Scottish
and Welsh Offices, the division operates a chain of Small Firms Centres through¬
out Great Britain, which work in co-operation with local business organisations
and are linked to a central information bank in London. Measures to assist small
firms include tax concessions (see p 346), a scheme to encourage collaboration
between small firms, a small firms counselling service, and experimental schemes
to provide premises and new sources of venture capital for small businesses. A
small firms employment subsidy (see p 322) is available to small manufacturing
firms in the special development and development areas.
In Northern Ireland the Local Enterprise Development Unit, established
to promote the development of smaller industries, provides grants, loans,
premises and management advice to new and expanding companies.
Government assistance for tourism is provided under the Development of
Tourism Act 1969. The Act established four independent but government-
financed statutory bodies—the British Tourist Authority, which is responsible
for the overseas promotion of tourism in Britain and has a general responsibility
for tourism within Great Britain, and the English, Scottish and Wales Tourist
Boards which are responsible for encouraging the development and improvement
of facilities and amenities for tourists in their respective countries, and for
tourist promotional work and publicity within them. (In Scotland, however,
the Highlands and Islands Development Board exercises these responsibilities
within its area—see above). The Act enables the tourist boards to give financial
assistance to selected tourist projects in the development areas. Government

policy is to encourage growth in tourism in hitherto unexploited areas (particu¬
larly in the development areas) while sustaining the industry in recognised
tourist centres. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board, established under separate
legislation, has a function broadly similar to that of the other British tourist
boards. Financial assistance to tourism projects is available from the Northern
Ireland Department of Commerce.
In 1978 there were 12-6 million visits by people from overseas to Britain,
6-2 million of which were made by residents of other member countries of the
European Community.
COMPETITION POLICY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION
The Government is concerned with competition policy and the control of
restrictive practices. An increasingly important part of government policy in
recent years has also been the encouragement of fair trading, with the particular
aim of helping consumers and safeguarding their rights. The Minister of State
for Consumer Affairs, who is answerable to the Secretary of State for Trade,
has special responsibilities for competition policy and consumer affairs (although
certain matters, such as safety of foodstuffs and road vehicles, are the concern
of other departments).
The Office of Fair Trading, a government agency headed by the Director
General of Fair Trading, is concerned with the conduct of trade and industry
in Britain.
Competition policy has led to the development of machinery for scrutinising
and regulating monopolies, mergers and restrictive trade practices and of
powers to regulate any structural changes or uncompetitive practices which
operate against the public interest. The Director General of Fair Trading
administers both the Fair Trading Act 1973, which regulates monopolies and
mergers, and the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, which regulates restrictive
trading agreements.
A Bill was introduced in July 1979 to strengthen the powers of the Director
General of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to deal
with practices which limit competition in the public and private sectors. It
would allow the Director General to conduct a preliminary investigation of prac¬
tices, other than registrable restrictive agreements (see p 224), which might be
regarded as anti-competitive. If the Director General found that an anti-com¬
petitive practice existed he could decide to refer it to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to establish whether or not it operated against the public
interest. On an adverse finding by the Commission the Secretary of State
for Trade would have powers to take remedial action. The Bill would empower
the Secretary of State to refer to the Commission questions on the efficiency,
costs, service to consumers or possible abuse of a monopoly situation of parti¬
cular named bodies in the public sector.
The Secretary of State for Trade and the Director General of Fair Trading
can refer monopolies for investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Com¬
mission. The legislation defines a monopoly as a situation where at least a quarter
of a particular kind of goods or service is supplied by or to a single person, or
two or more people acting in a common manner. Local monopolies and arrange¬
ments which prevent, restrict or distort competition, and monopolies in public
sector industries can also be referred to the Commission. If the Commission
finds that a monopoly operates against the public interest, the Secretary of
224

State for Trade has powers to make orders and otherwise to remedy or prevent
the harm which the Commission considers may exist. It is more usual, however,
for the Director General to be asked to negotiate undertakings to remedy the
adverse effects identified by the Commission.
Proposals for a merger (defined as occurring when two or more enterprises are
brought under common ownership or control) may be referred to the Commission
by the Secretary of State for Trade if it would result in or intensify a monopoly
or if the total value of gross assets taken over exceeds £5 million. There are
special provisions relating to newspaper and certain other mergers.
Under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976 restrictive trading agreements
have to be registered with the Director General of Fair Trading. Broadly, an
agreement is registrable if two or more parties to it engaged in business in Britain
in the supply of goods or services accept some limitation on their freedom to
make their own decisions about prices or conditions of sale. Failure to register
an agreement means that the restrictions are void and the parties are liable to
legal proceedings. Having placed an agreement on the register, the Director
General has the duty of referring it to the Restrictive Practices Court and the
Court must declare the restrictions in it contrary to the public interest unless the
parties can satisfy the Court by reference to criteria laid down in the Act that
this is not the case. Restrictions declared contrary to the public interest are void
and the Court can order the parties not to give effect to them or make any
similar agreement. In practice, however, many agreements do not need to be
referred to the Court because, for example, the parties choose to give up the
restrictions rather than go to Court, or the Secretary of State accepts the Director
General’s advice that the restrictions are not significant enough to warrant
reference to the Court. The European Commission may also grant exemption
or authorisation.
The objective of the competition policy of the European Community is to
promote free and fair competition in trade between member countries. The
Community’s rules of competition, which are set out in the Treaty of Rome,
apply to industrial and commercial practices likely to affect trade and prevent,
restrict or distort competition in the Community. Agreements which fall
within the rules must be notified to the European Commission, which has its
own Competition Department; the Commission has limited powers to exempt
agreements which, though restrictive of competition between member countries,
benefit the Community in defined ways.
The Fair Trading Act 1973 provides machinery (headed by the Director
General of Fair Trading) for the continuous review of consumer affairs and for
action to meet new problems as they arise, including powers to deal with
trading practices which unfairly affect consumers’ interests, and to deal with
persistent offenders under existing law. Other legislation to safeguard the
consumer’s economic interests deals principally with the description, quality
and performance of goods, credit facilities and pricing information. It includes
the Trade Descriptions Acts 1968 and 1972, the Supply of Goods (Implied
Terms) Act 1973, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Consumer
Credit Act 1974.
The other major area of legislation is concerned with the prevention of the
sale of dangerous or harmful consumer goods. The principal laws here are the
Consumer Protection Acts 1961 and 1971, and the Consumer Safety Act 1978,
which empower the Government to make regulations to ensure the safety of
THE FRAMEWORK OF INDUSTRY
225
any class of goods and to prohibit the supply of any goods which are deemed to
be unsafe.
Provision of consumer information and advice is an important function of
those in local and central Government, and of several independent organisations,
concerned with consumer protection. The local outlets are the Citizens Advice
Bureaux (see p 146) and the Consumer Advice Centres.
The independent, non-statutory National Consumer Council (and associated
councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), which also receives govern¬
ment finance, ensures that the consumer’s view is made known to those in
Government and industry whose decisions affect consumers.
Consumer councils for the energy and rail nationalised industries and for the
Post Office investigate questions of concern to the consumer, while some trade
associations in industry and commerce have established codes of practice
designed to protect the consumer. In addition several private organisations
work to further consumer interests. The largest is the Consumers’ Association,
funded by the subscriptions of its membership of over 60,000. The association
conducts an extensive programme of comparative testing of goods and investi¬
gation of services; its views and test reports are published in its monthly
magazine Which? or its satellite publications. The association also provides an
advice service on subscription. Consultancy work on European legislation is
undertaken by the association on behalf of the Department of Trade. Local
consumer groups, such as the National Federation of Consumer Groups, also
promote consumers’ interests and provide information and advice. The main
British organisations interested in consumer affairs come together under the
Consumers in the European Community Group (UK), to discuss and represent
their interests in European Community policies.
Service Industries
Output and
Investment
Manufacturing plays a vital role in the economy. It accounts for some 28 per
cent of gross domestic product; about 32 per cent of the employed labour force
is engaged in manufacturing; and around 80 per cent of visible exports consists
of manufactured or semi-manufactured goods.
The manufacturing industries are described by sector in this chapter, together
with the construction industry and the distributive and service trades.
MANUFACTURING
Most manufacturing is carried out by private enterprise. The greater parts of
the iron and steel, shipbuilding and aerospace industries are in public ownership
(see p 218); products from the state-controlled sector also include a small range
of chemicals from the plants of the British Steel Corporation, locomotives and
rolling-stock built in the workshops of British Railways, military equipment and
supplies made in establishments of the defence services, and fissile materials
and radioactive isotopes. The Government has shareholdings in various com¬
panies, principally British Petroleum Ltd. Some of these shareholdings are
controlled through the National Enterprise Board (see p 219). It is the Govern¬
ment’s general policy to reduce the extent of State ownership of industry.
The most recent complete analysis of the size distribution of establishments
and enterprises in manufacturing industry, and of the degree of concentration,
is contained in the Report on the Censuses of Production 1974 and 1975. This
shows that some 68 per cent (70,790) of the 104,089 establishments in manu¬
facturing industry had fewer than 20 employees each and accounted for 7 per
cent of total employment; 30,784 establishments had between 20 and 499
employees and accounted for some 38 per cent of the total labour force; 1,868
establishments, each with between 500 and 1,499 employees, were responsible
for 21 per cent of employment; and over one-third was in the hands of the 647
establishments each with 1,500 or more employees. About 56 per cent of the
largest establishments were in the engineering, and metal and vehicle manu¬
facturing industries. An enterprise, as defined in the census, normally consists
of either a single establishment or of two or more establishments under common
ownership. In the private sector of British manufacturing industry in 1975
38 per cent of all employment was accounted for by the largest 100 enterprises.
The figures for manufacturing output in Tables 13 and 14 show the relative
size of the sectors of manufacturing and their growth rates. Expansion between
1975 and 1978 has been evident in those industries using advanced technologies
such as electronics, instrument engineering, most sectors of the chemical industry
and paper, printing and publishing. A major stimulus has been provided by the
various needs of the offshore oil and gas industries. In other long-established

industries (for example, shipbuilding and marine engineering and electrical

being undertaken to meet changing economic conditions.

Investment in manufacturing tends to reflect the level of demand in the
economy as a whole, with some time lag between the start of an increase in
output and the implementation of investment plans. There is thus a marked
cyclical pattern in the flow of investment by manufacturing industry, and since
1965 there have been three discernible cycles.
Total manufacturing investment in 1978 at current prices was ^5^41 million,
apportioned as follows: food, drink and tobacco £815 million, coal and petroleum
products £189 million, chemicals £1,097 million, metal manufacture £568
million, engineering, shipbuilding and metal goods £1,380 million, vehicles
£579 million, textiles, leather and clothing £257 million, paper, printing and
publishing £358 million and other manufacturing industries £598 million.
Analysed by type of asset, investment was divided into £853 million for new
building work, £451 million for vehicles and £4,538 million for plant and
machinery. The growing practice of leasing rather than purchasing new capital
equipment may mean that the level of re-equipping is actually higher than these
figures indicate. In the tables in the following sections, relating to the main
sectors of manufacturing industry in 1978, employment statistics, taken from

Most of the early developments in iron and steel production originated in
Britain, today the world’s eighth largest steel-producing nation. The Iron and
Steel Act 1967 brought together into public ownership 14 major steel companies
and created the British Steel Corporation (BSC). BSC currently produces over
82 per cent of Britain’s crude steel and is the largest steel undertaking in Europe.
It employs some 190,000 people, of whom 167,500 are involved in iron and
steel manufacturing and 22,500 in other activities, such as constructional
engineering and chemicals. The remaining (private sector) companies are re¬
presented by the British Independent Steel Producers’ Association whose
members employ some 68,000 people and account for over a third of the value
of the industry’s turnover. The private sector is particularly strong in the manu¬
facture of alloy and stainless steels and of finished products for the engineering
industry. The main steel producing areas are Yorkshire and Humberside (34
per cent of crude steel output in 1978), Wales (30 per cent), the Northern region
(14 per cent), Scotland (8 per cent) and the West Midlands (7 per cent).
About 75 per cent of British steel producers’ deliveries of finished steel
products are used by home industry and the remainder for direct export, the

major markets for which are the rest of the European Community and the
United States. A large part of the steel used by industry in Britain is also sub¬
sequently exported as part of other finished products. The BSC is a member of
the European Nuclear Steelmaking Club, established to define a strategy for the
application of nuclear energy to steelmaking.
BSC has invested heavily in modernising its production capacity. Its develop¬
ment strategy includes the replacement of open-hearth steelmaking by basic
oxygen steelmaking (for bulk production) and the electric arc process (for more
specialised tasks) and the concentration of bulk steelmaking at five main sites
(Port Talbot and Llanwern in Wales, Ravenscraig near Glasgow, Lackenby in
Cleveland, and Scunthorpe) which have good access to deep water for iron ore
imports. In 1978 BSC began to reduce capacity, to move more into line with the
level of world demand, by deferring a number of planned new steelmaking
developments and closing a number of old steelworks, in advance of the dates
previously agreed.
In the production of iron and steel castings, a few large firms are responsible
for more than a quarter of total output while fewer, more highly developed units
are replacing some of the numerous small foundries. The main users of iron
castings which are essential components for a wide range of industries are the
motor vehicle industry, the general engineering industry, the manufacturers of
pressure pipes and fittings, the building and associated industries and the
steel industry. Research for the industry is conducted by the British Cast
Iron Research Association and the Steel Castings Research and Trade
Association.
Britain’s non-ferrous metal processing and fabricating industry is one of the
largest in Europe. Its major products are aluminium (both virgin and secondary
metal), secondary refined copper, lead and primary zinc. Tin mining in Cornwall
supplies about 25 per cent of Britain’s tin requirements (see p 272) but other¬
wise British metal smelting and refining industries are based on imported ores
and concentrates except for substantial secondary production from scrap metal.
Britain is also a major producer of the newer specialised metals including
uranium, zirconium and beryllium for the nuclear energy industry, niobium
for aircraft production and selenium, silicon, germanium and tantalum for
electronic apparatus. Titanium and titanium alloys are also produced and
used in aircraft production, power generation and North Sea oil production,
where their lightness, resistance to stress, flexibility and resistance to oxidisation
are especially valued. Nearly half the industry is situated in the Midlands.
Other centres include south Wales, London, Tyneside and Avonmouth, where
a zinc smelter of some 100,000 tonnes capacity operates. Three large-scale
aluminium smelters provide almost 85 per cent of Britain’s requirements for
primary aluminium. The large non-ferrous metals fabricating industry uses
large quantities of imported refined metals such as copper, lead, zinc and
aluminium. A wide range of semi-manufactures is produced in these metals
and their alloys, and, particularly in aluminium, firms are engaged in smelting,
casting and fabrication by rolling, extrusion and drawing; advanced techniques
of powder metallurgy and pressure die-castings are also employed. In recent
years considerable progress has been made in the development of ‘superplastic’
alloys, which are more ductile and elastic than conventional alloys.
Scientific and technological research for the industry is conducted by the
Warren Spring Laboratory of the Department of Industry and by the British
Non-Ferrous (BNF) Metals Technology Centre.

The mechanical engineering industry comprises a group of industries manu¬
facturing all types of machinery, machine tools, industrial engines, mechanical
handling equipment, construction equipment and industrial plant. About half
the industry’s production is for the home market. The major customers for the
heavy equipment sectors are the nationalised fuel industries, the chemical
industry and the British Steel Corporation. A wide range of equipment is
supplied to the building and construction industry. Demand for other types of
equipment comes from all the production industries in Britain.
Britain was the birthplace of the machine tool industry and many of the more
advanced types of metal-working machine tools are produced in Britain. Almost
all machine tools produced are purchased by the engineering, vehicles and
metal goods industries. Seven large groups account for about 35 per cent of
machine tool sales and exports.
The most important types of metal cutting machine tools are milling, grinding
and turning machines. Manual control for many of these tools is being replaced
by automatic control and Britain is an important producer of numerically
controlled machine tools, including machining centres. The largest export
markets for the industry in 1978 were the rest of the European Community, the
United States and Poland. The Machine Tool Trades Association represents
most of the industry and is responsible for the international machine tool
exhibition held in Britain every four years, the next being due in 1980. The
Machine Tool Industry Research Association carries out research into design
and performance of tools and into production methods.
British industry manufactures almost every type of industrial (including process)
plant and steelwork (for nuclear power station construction see Chapter 14). Of
particular importance are fabricated products such as pressure vessels, heat
exchangers and storage tanks for chemical and oil refining (process) plant,
steam-raising boilers (including those of high capacity for power stations),
sintering plant, metallurgical furnaces and plant, lime and cement kilns, nuclear

reactors, water and sewage treatment plant and fabricated steelwork for bridges,
buildings and industrial installations. The industrial plant industry comprises
both equipment manufacturers and contractors responsible for the design,
engineering, construction and commissioning of complete plants for process
industries. British manufacturers have contributed to major advances in process
technology and British contractors are carrying out major plant projects in
many overseas countries. Gas turbine engines for industry, in particular for
power generation in the fuel industries, are another thriving section of the
industry, where exports have done well in recent years. Three large firms are
pre-eminent in the manufacture of industrial engines, including those derived
from aero-engines. Industrial pumps, valves and compressors are vital com¬
ponents in many industrial processes, particularly in the chemicals, oil and
electric power industries: over half the production of all types of such equipment
is exported. The fluid power industry makes oil hydraulic and pneumatic
equipment for operating machinery and construction and other equipment.
There are many new areas where these powerful and flexible systems may be
used.
Machines and accessories for the manufacture and processing of yarns and
fabrics from all types of natural and man-made fibres are produced by the
textile machinery industry in Britain, which is noted for the range, scale and
versatility of its operations. British inventions have remained the foundation
of many textile processes in use internationally and progress has been made in
developing automation in the industry. In 1978 70 per cent of the industry’s
total sales were to export markets. Research and development is carried out by
the large firms and the four research associations connected with the textile
industry.
Machinery for food and drink preparation, processing and sterilisation is
another important sector. Refrigerating machinery (excluding domestic equip¬
ment) is used for food and drink processing, but the industry also covers plant
for ships and vehicles and equipment for conserving drinks, food and ice-cream
for the distributive and catering industries.
Almost the whole range of plant required by the construction industry is pro¬
duced, including excavating, earth-moving and road-making equipment, pile
drivers and quarry crushing and screening plant. Overseas sales of construction
equipment and mining machinery and equipment, including coal cutting and
coal face loading machinery, are increasing. Mechanical handling equipment
is used not only for construction and related activities but throughout industry
generally. It extends from individual units and accessories to complete operating
systems, the main products being cranes and bridge transporters, lifts, escalators,
conveyors, elevators, hoists and powered industrial trucks including forklift
trucks. Electronic control and completely automated handling systems are
widely available.
Britain produces a wide range of equipment for general and special use, including
many special purpose machines such as hop-picking machines, fruit harvesters
and improved root harvesters (for tractors see p 234). Mechanisation is exten¬
sively used in the arable farming and dairy farming sectors. Much of the new
machinery is designed for use in a variety of conditions to meet the needs of
overseas farmers. A large-scale annual exhibition of the industry’s products is
the Royal Smithfield Show and Agricultural Machinery Exhibition held in
London in December. The main trade association for the industry is the
Agricultural Engineers Association.

The industry covers a wide range of products including duplicators, photo¬
copiers, typewriters, word processors, microfilm, dictation and mail-room
equipment, and accounting machines and cash registers. A large proportion of
the industry is owned by multi-national companies, and is likely to continue to
be so, as the rapidly advancing technologies involved require a heavy commit¬
ment to research and development. In particular, the incorporation of micro¬
electronics into office products is certain to increase. The industry is strong in
microfilm readers/printers, duplicators and office offset litho and rapid high
volume photocopiers.
The other major products of the mechanical engineering industry include
printing, bookbinding and paper goods machinery, space heating, ventilating
and air-conditioning equipment, packaging and bottling machinery, portable
power tools and miscellaneous non-electrical machinery, such as boot and
shoe-making machinery, laundry equipment, automatic vending machines,
plastic working machinery and other types of specialised equipment.
Alongside the firms manufacturing the products of the mechanical engineering
industry are enterprises which supply parts and components and undertake
general sub-contracting, fabricating and repair work. Particularly important
is the production of ball, roller, needle and other bearings, about 25 per
cent of which is for the motor vehicle industry, and of other components,
such as industrial fasteners, precision fasteners and chains, gears and drop-
forgings.

Instrument engineering is a particularly important sector of the engineering
industry. Electronic techniques are widely used, particularly in the industrial
instrument sector, which comprises industrial and process measuring and
control instruments and equipment, optical instruments, electrical measuring
and testing instruments, analytical instruments and a diverse group of others.
The chemicals, power, petroleum and iron and steel industries account for
about 80 per cent of process control applications, the largest sector of the
industry and one which is expanding. Major advances have been made in auto¬
matic testing equipment and analytical instruments for medical diagnosis and
pollution control. The industry is served mainly by five trade associations—the
Scientific Instrument Manufacturers Association, the Control and Automation
Manufacturers Association, the British Industrial Measuring and Control
Apparatus Manufacturers Association, the Electronic Engineering Association
and the British Photographic Manufacturers Association. The Sira Institute Ltd.
conducts research on behalf of the industry.
Photographic equipment includes photographic and cinematographic cameras,
projectors and document copying machines. Other sectors of the instrument
industry are concerned with watches, clocks and time recorders and with
surgical instruments and appliances and related products.

The electrical engineering industry is engaged in the manufacture and installa¬
tion of a wide variety of equipment, which includes all types of generating,
transmission and distribution equipment, motors, telecommunications and
broadcasting equipment and domestic electrical appliances. The electronics
industry, which makes a vital contribution to the efficiency of many branches of
the country’s economy, has become one of the most important sectors of British
industry.
Leading representative organisations are the British Electrical and Allied
Manufacturers’ Association, the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic
Appliances and the Electronic Engineering Association, a member of the
Conference of the Electronics Industry which brings together the six principal
trade associations for the electronics industry. Research is carried out by ERA
Technology Ltd. (formerly the Electrical Research Association).
The main product categories are power equipment (generators, motors, con¬
verters, transformers and rectifiers) and switchgear, starting and control gear.
The industry produces cables and wires for the distribution of electric power,
for telecommunication networks and other purposes; its products include
submarine cables and cables insulated by a great variety of materials. Optical
fibres (hair-thin strands of pure glass) have been developed, which have much
greater capacity than the copper wiring used in telecommunications networks.
Four major groups are responsible for more than half the industry’s output and
for a large proportion of the world’s submarine cable requirements.
A few large firms also dominate the market for other electrical goods, including
domestic appliances. Domestic equipment includes heating and cooking equip¬
ment, washing machines and dryers, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, irons and
electric kettles. Other major sectors are electrical equipment for motor vehicles
and aircraft, electric lamps and light fittings, and batteries and accumulators.
The British electronics industry is one of the largest and most comprehensive
in the world and British scientists and companies have made important contri¬
butions to electronics technology. Because the applications of electronics
technology are continuing to multiply rapidly, an exact definition of the industry
must be arbitrary, but the sectors included are radar and navigational aids,
telecommunications equipment, security systems, components, consumer goods,
computers and communication and other capital equipment, as well as electronic
process control and industrial instrumentation (see p 232).
The dependence of the telecommunications industry on electronic techniques
is increasing as new switching systems are introduced (see p 316). The main
products are switching and transmission equipment for telephone, telex and
234
VEHICLES,
AIRCRAFT AND
SHIPS
Motor Vehicles
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
telegraph systems and subscribers’ apparatus such as telephones, private auto¬
matic branch exchanges, teleprinters and facsimile systems. The Post Office is
the main customer in the home market, which is largely supplied by four
companies, and carries out research and development work in co-operation with
companies.
The components sector manufactures the whole range of active and passive
electronic components, including integrated circuits (in which many circuits
are placed on a tiny chip of semiconductor raw material—see also p 210), mainly
for the electronics equipment industry. Though.the market is dominated by
United States manufacturers, some joint ventures with British firms are
developing.
The major consumer goods produced are radio and television sets, music
centres and high-fidelity audio equipment. In the audio field, British manu¬
facturers have a reputation for high-quality goods but are less strong in the
mass market. Equipment is also being manufactured for reception of Britain’s
‘Prestel’ and ‘teletext’ services (see pp 314 and 419).
In the computer sector, an extensive range of computer systems, central
processors and peripheral equipment, from large computers for large-scale data
processing and scientific work to mini- and micro-computers for use in control
and automation systems and for home and office use, are produced. Essential to
the sector is the ‘software’ industry, in which Britain is especially strong, which
produces programs and associated services and complements the hardware
industry, enabling the systems manufacturers to provide complete solutions to
meet the requirements of users.
An expanding sector of the industry is that which covers the manufacture of
radio communication equipment, radar and radio navigational aids for ships
and aircraft, alarms and signalling equipment, public broadcasting equipment
and other capital goods. An important development in this sector has been
the X-ray scanner systems for brain diagnosis and whole body examination
manufactured by Electric and Musical Industries. British equipment is used
extensively overseas, for defence, civil aviation, shipping, health, educational
and other purposes.

The motor vehicle industry comprises the manufacture of cars and commercial
vehicles, caravans and trailers, and parts and components. Output of cars and
commercial vehicles is dominated by four large groups: BL Ltd., in which there
is a majority public shareholding, Ford, Talbot—formerly Chrysler UK—and
Vauxhall, which account for over 99 per cent of car production and some 98 per
cent of commercial vehicle output; the remainder is in the hands of smaller,
specialist producers of cars, heavy commercial vehicles, buses and coaches.
Although there is a balance of trade deficit in cars this is outweighed by a surplus
in commercial vehicles and component parts; in 1978 the motor vehicle

industry as a whole contributed about 3^210 million to the British balance of
payments.
The principal trade association for the industry is the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders which holds a biennial motor industry show at the
National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham.
Agricultural tractors account for the bulk of wheeled tractors produced; Britain
is the third largest producer of four-wheeled agricultural tractors in the world
and a leading exporter. Production is dominated by two large firms, with three
others responsible for most of the remainder.
Though in recent years the motor cycle industry has contracted and the domestic
market is largely supplied by imports, the market for pedal cycles has doubled
in the last decade and is mainly supplied by British firms. TI Raleigh is the
largest maker and exporter of bicycles in the world.
British Rail’s requirements of locomotives and rolling stock are largely met by
its own workshops; it also supplies equipment and provides consultancy services
to many overseas countries. The private sector, which builds trains for London
Transport and rapid-transit networks, as well as railway equipment for export
(including components, traction and control gear, signalling, heating and ventila¬
tion systems and track equipment), undertakes electrification and other major
works overseas.
Britain’s aerospace industry is the largest and most comprehensive in Western
Europe and second only to that of the United States in the Western world.
The products of the industry include civil and military aircraft, helicopters,
aero-engines, guided weapons, hovercraft and space vehicles, supported by a
comprehensive range of aircraft and airfield equipment and systems. The
nationalised corporation British Aerospace (BAe) and the publicly owned
companies Short Brothers and Rolls-Royce are responsible for the greater part
of aircraft, guided weapon and aero-engine manufacture in Britain. BAe, which
acquired the assets and manufacturing capacity of the British Aircraft Corpora¬
tion, Hawker Siddeley Aviation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Scottish
Aviation, is the largest of the aircraft and guided weapons manufacturers.
Proposals have been announced to introduce private shareholdings into BAe
(see also p 206), while maintaining the present structure of the industry. Rolls-
Royce, which is one of the world’s three leading aero-engine manufacturers, is
responsible for almost the entire output of aero-engines.
The private sector is composed of a number of aircraft companies, including
Westland Aircraft and its subsidiary, Westland Helicopters, which specialises in
helicopter design and manufacture, together with nearly all of the aviation
equipment sector.
Production of BAe includes such civil aircraft as the HS748 feederliner,
the HS125 business jet, and the BAG One-Eleven airliner; while the new BAe
146 feederliner and Jetstream 31 transport aircraft are under development.
BAe is a full partner in the European consortium Airbus Industrie; it is con¬
tinuing to manufacture the wings for the A300 Airbus and will design and
manufacture the wings for the A310 derivative. Short Brothers, which is
based in Belfast, produces the Skyvan, the 330 commuter airliner, airframe com¬
ponents and missiles. Military aeroplanes include the unique Harrier vertical/
short take-off and landing aircraft (which has achieved substantial sales to the
United States), the Hawk advanced trainer aircraft, the Anglo-French Jaguar

a collaborative venture by Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy.
W estland Helicopters manufacture the successful Sea King and are the British
partners in the Anglo-French collaborative programmes on the Puma, Gazelle
and Lynx helicopters which are being produced for the armed forces of Britain,
France and other countries.
The industry is also a major producer of guided weapons which include a
number of export successes, in particular the Rapier ground-to-air missile.
Collaborative guided weapon projects between Britain and its NATO partners
are also becoming of increasing importance.
Rolls-Royce aero-engines in production include the collaboratively-produced
RB199 for the Tornado, the RB211 civil engine and its more powerful derivative
the RB211-524, the Pegasus vectored-thrust engine for the Harrier and the Gem
helicopter engine. Another RB211 derivative, the -535, is under development
and is the lead engine for the new Boeing 757 airliner. Industrial versions of
aero-engines such as the RB211 and the Olympus (developed for Concorde) are
being produced for use in oil and gas transmission and as stand-by power
generators while versions for marine use, in particular of the Olympus and the
Tyne, are being used to power a new generation of warships for the Royal
Navy and many overseas navies.
The aviation equipment manufacturers provide a wide range of systems
essential to the design of engines and aircraft, including engine and flight
controls, electrical generation, mechanical and hydraulic power systems,
cabin furnishings and flight deck information displays, which are sold both in
domestic and overseas markets. They also supply equipment for ground opera¬
tion including that needed for radar and air traffic control, ground power
suppliers and flight simulators, to airports and airlines throughout the world.
The space sector’s main effort is directed towards the programmes of the
European Space Agency (ESA, see p 389), although sales of sub-systems are
made world-wide. Ariel VI, the most recent national satellite launched in June
I979 (see P 39°)> was built for the Science Research Council. Through the ESA,
BAe’s Dynamics Group has acted as prime contractor for the OTS experimental
communications satellite and the GEOS scientific satellites. Manufacture of the
operational European Communications Satellites (ECS) for the European
telecommunications satellite organisation EUTELSAT, and the maritime
satellites (MARECS) expected to be used operationally by the international
maritime satellite organisation INMARSAT, is in hand. Ground stations are
being constructed for the Post Office (see p 315).
The industry is thus extensively involved in the manufacture of space systems
and in scientific research in other European collaborative programmes. It carries
out an extensive programme of research and development on airframes, aero¬
engines and equipment, including avionics, while considerable research is also
undertaken by universities and Government research establishments.
Aerospace production and exports, which are fairly evenly divided between
aircraft, engines and equipment (including avionics), have made considerable
progress over the past few years and now stand at record levels. The principal
destinations for exports are the United States and countries with which Britain
is involved in collaborative ventures such as France and the Federal Republic
of Germany.
The main trade association for the industry is the Society of British Aero¬
space Companies which organises a major international air show at Farnborough,
Hampshire, every two years. Major suppliers of avionics equipment are also
members of the Electronic Engineering Association.

Britain has a long-established tradition of shipbuilding and accounts for about
3-5 per cent of world output. Naval shipbuilding and the construction of vessels
and structures connected with offshore oil production are important sectors of
the industry. In merchant shipbuilding the SD14 general cargo series has been
especially successful. Programmes of modernisation and reorganisation have
taken place in most of the major shipyards, including the construction of several
covered-berth ship ‘factories’. British yards include some which are among the
most modern and efficient in the world. Employment in the industry continues
to contract, however, as a result of an over-capacity in world shipping.
Nineteen of the principal shipbuilding companies, five companies manufactur¬
ing slow-speed marine diesel engines and three training companies and their
subsidiaries were taken into public ownership in 1977 under a public corporation,
British Shipbuilders. Also in public ownership is the Belfast firm, Harland and
Wolff, which is administered by the Northern Ireland Office. Together British
Shipbuilders and Harland and Wolff account for 99 per cent of output in both
merchant and naval shipbuilding, for all slow-speed marine diesel engines and
for some 50 per cent of turnover in ship-repairing. The public sector also
includes a number of companies engaged in general engineering work connected
with the marine industries.
Following a review in 1979 of the prospects for the merchant shipbuilding
activities of British Shipbuilders the Government concluded that, given the
world shipbuilding recession and the need for the corporation to achieve
viability, further contraction within the industry would be inevitable.
A number of yards in the private sector build smaller vessels, including
patrol boats, fishing and harbour craft, supply vessels, tugs, cargo ships, small
tankers, ferries, pleasure boats and yachts.
About 35 per cent of the output of British yards is exported. Most private
sector companies in the shipbuilding and ship-repairing industries are repre¬
sented by the Shiprepairers and Shipbuilders Independent Association.
Research into shipbuilding and marine engineering is undertaken by the British
Ship Research Association.

A range of metal products other than those described in previous sections are
produced by a group of industries made up of a very large number of firms. One
of the main groups, in which small firms predominate, manufactures engineers’
small tools and gauges, which include jigs and fixtures, press tools and moulds,
hard metal-tipped tools and other metal cutting tools. Another group manu¬
factures cutlery and tableware (including safety razors and blades). Although
there are many small firms in the industry, seven relatively large concerns are
responsible for over half of output.
A wide variety of domestic utensils, such as saucepans, buckets and dustbins,
made mainly from aluminium and wrought steel, are produced by the
hollow-ware industry, together with industrial hollow-ware, such as kegs, drums

and barrels. The manufacture of hand tools, including files, saws, hammers, axes
and spades, is a long-established industry. About half of its total production is
for export. Jewellery, gold and silver ware and the refining of precious metals is
an industry in which British craftsmen are world famous; five relatively large
firms are responsible for about 60 per cent of total output. Other main groups
of metal goods are bolts, nuts and screws, cans and metal boxes, metal furniture,
metal windows, metallic closures, metal small-ware such as needles and pins,
safes, locks and keys, domestic gas appliances and drop forgings.

The chemicals industry is one of the most successful industries in Britain as
well as being its third largest industrial sector. The industry is also the second
largest in Europe and its exports of ^4,485 million in 1978 (accounting for 12
per cent of total British exports) placed Britain among the top five chemical
exporting nations. The industry is undertaking a substantial investment pro¬
gramme, despite continuing uncertainties over the price and availability of raw
materials. The largest British chemicals group, Imperial Chemical Industries, is
the fifth largest chemicals company in the world, accounting for some 25 per cent
of production in Britain. A further 40 per cent is in the hands of 20 other large-
and medium-sized companies. The industry as a whole is represented by the
Chemical Industries Association. Research and development work is financed
by the companies themselves. The rest of the European Community and the
United States are the major export markets.
About a quarter of the output of the general chemicals industry consists of a
limited number of relatively simple inorganic chemicals, such as sulphuric acid
and metallic and non-metallic oxides, serving as basic materials for industry.
Substantial quantities of inorganic chemicals are used in the manufacture of
fertilisers, detergents, paint, glass, metals and other products.
Organic chemicals include the heavy organics produced in bulk and the
speciality intermediate products. About three-quarters of the output of organic
chemicals is made up of petroleum-based chemicals. The most important
products (by weight) are ethylene, propylene and benzene. The main uses of
organic chemicals are in solvents, plastics and synthetic resins, synthetic rubber,
man-made fibres and detergents, and as intermediate chemicals in the manu¬
facture of many other products.
Outside the inorganic and organic sectors is a wide range of general chemicals
formulated for specific uses. Radioisotopes are produced by The Radiochemical
Centre Ltd.; over half the centre’s production is for export.
Pharma¬

The whole range of medicines is produced in Britain, where many of the basic
products were discovered and developed. These include antibiotics, sul-

phonamides, anti-malarial drugs, anti-histamine products, anaesthetics, vaccine
sera and naturally occurring drugs. Manufacturers in Britain are among the
world’s leading producers and exporters of preparations for the treatment of
human and animal diseases. This sector is one of the major growth areas of the
chemical industry.
Many of the basic discoveries in plastics, including polyethylene, were made in
Britain. Plastics manufacture is one of the fast growing sections of industry and
one third of total production is exported. Expansion in recent years has mainly
been in thermoplastic materials, of which the most important are polyethylene
(used in coverings and packaging—notably for foodstuffs), polyvinyl chloride
(known as PVC and used for a wide range of industrial purposes and consumer
goods), polystyrene (a material used for toys, light mouldings and many con¬
sumer goods) and polypropylene (which can be fabricated as mouldings, films
and fibres). A new group of plastics materials reinforced with carbon fibres is
also in commercial production in Britain; they have up to three times the
strength but are only 20 per cent of the weight of steel, and are being increasingly
used in, for example, vehicle manufacture. Styrene-butadiene and polybutadiene
rubbers used for tyres, high styrene rubbers for shoe soles and flooring, and
nitrile rubbers for use where oil resistance is required, are also in large-scale
production, together with neoprene rubber.
The development of chemical fertilisers owes much to the pioneer work of
British scientists. Production is dominated by three firms, with a number of
firms marketing compound fertilisers from the principal constituents—nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium—and is almost entirely for the domestic market.
The use of ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate and urea is resulting in
more concentrated fertilisers. Notable discoveries and developments by the
British crop protection industry include the insecticidal property of BHC
(benzene hexachloride), the first selective hormone weed-killer, MCPA, and
Gramoxone, a non-residual general herbicide. Herbicides are the largest category
of sales of pesticides and allied products.
Britain is a major producer of paints, varnishes and allied products. In recent
years many improved techniques have been introduced into the paint and
varnish industry, including new ranges of synthetic resins and pigments, non¬
drip, quick-drying paints and paints needing only one application.
These industries include besides soap, detergents and toilet preparations,
cosmetics and perfumes. Many of the firms in the toiletries industry are owned
or financed by United States companies but there are a number of long-
established British perfume and soap makers. Both sectors are significant
exporters.
There is a varied group of chemical products which account for about 10 per
cent of the industry’s net output. It includes formulated adhesives, printing ink,
colours and dyestuffs, photographic chemical materials and floor and furniture
polishes.
The historical branches of the industry, based on the natural fibres of cotton
and wool, linen and jute, have retained their separate identities but the boundaries
between them are becoming blurred with the increasing use of man-made fibres.
The growth of man-made fibres has stimulated the development of new

processes and new types of yarn and cloth and has strongly influenced the
structure of the industry. A small number of large multi-fibre, multi-process
groups have emerged, although in many sectors there is still a preponderance of
small firms engaged in just one or two operations.
Research for the industry is provided by the Shirley Institute (cotton, silk
and man-made fibres), the Lambeg Industrial Research Association, WIRA
(the Wool Industries Research Association) and HATRA (the Hosiery and
Allied Trades Research Association). The Department of Industry sponsors
research and development both for these research associations and also directly
within the industry.
Much of the early development of man-made fibres took place in Britain and
continuing extensive research has produced a wide variety of types with their
own special characteristics. The two main types are still those first developed—
the cellulosic fibres, such as rayon, and the synthetic fibres, such as nylon and
polyester, made wholly by chemical processes. Acrylic fibres, including Courtelle
(a British discovery), Acrilan and Orion are important products, as are the
elastomeric or spandex fibres which have inherent properties of stretch and
recovery, anti-static synthetic yarns embedded with carbon and various fire-
resistant yarns. More recently there has been a greater use of the polyolefins
(polypropylene and polyethylene) in the carpet and carpet backing and packaging
fields and still more recently in household textiles and clothing. Output in the
man-made fibre industry is concentrated in the hands of a few large firms and
has expanded rapidly in recent years.
During the nineteenth century cotton was Britain’s chief consumer goods
industry and cotton piece goods its largest export. Low-cost competition has
cut progressively into British markets and made necessary extensive reorganisa¬
tion, modernisation and the introduction of new techniques. Production includes
single and double cotton yarn, spun man-made fibre and mixture yarn, woven
cotton cloth and man-made fibre and mixture cloth. The largest markets for
cotton fabrics in 1978 were the rest of the European Community, the LTnited
States, Finland, Togo, South Africa, Zaire and Australia.
The linen industry is centred in Northern Ireland, where the lighter types of
fabrics for apparel, furnishings and household textiles are produced. The heavy¬
weight canvas for sailcloth, tents, awnings and tarpaulins is mainly produced in
Scotland.
The wool textile industry, of importance to Britain since medieval times, is
one of the largest in the world and includes the world’s biggest wool textile

company, Illingworth, Morris. There are two main branches, woollen and
worsted. An increasing amount of man-made fibre is now blended with wool.
West Yorkshire is the main producing area but Scotland and the West of England
are also famous as specialised producers of high quality yarn and cloth. Large
quantities of raw wool are scoured and cleaned in Britain to prepare it for
spinning. The largest markets for woollen and worsted fabrics are Japan, the
United States and the rest of the European Community.
The hosiery and knitwear industry comprises more than 1,000 firms, situated
mainly in the East Midlands and Scotland, of which most are small to medium
in size. The industry produces fabrics, outerwear, underwear, tights, socks,
stockings, gloves and accessories.
Some 70 per cent of the output of the carpet and rug industry is made up of
tufted carpets, in the production of which the pile, usually with a high man¬
made fibre content, is inserted into a pre-woven backing. Woven carpets, such
as Axminster and Wilton, account for most of the remainder of sales. There is
a higher wool content in woven types, although they too are making more use
of man-made fibres. The high quality and variety of design make Britain the
leading producer of woven carpets.
Jute products are manufactured in the Dundee area. Jute yarn and the man¬
made polypropylene yarn are used in the manufacturing of carpets, cordage
and ropes and woven into fabrics for a wide range of applications in the pack¬
aging, upholstery, building and motor car industries. New uses for jute, for
example, as a plastics reinforcement and for decorative wall coverings, are also
being considered.
British textile firms manufacture a wide variety of other goods, including lace,
narrow fabrics and household textiles, such as blankets, sheets, towels and
tablecloths. Rope, twine, nets and netting are manufactured by the cordage
industry, which is one of the largest in Europe. A recent development
by British manufacturers is the production of non-woven fabric by the
melded process, in which the conventional weaving and knitting stages are
omitted.
The British clothing industry is one of the largest in Europe; it is highly labour
intensive and dominated by small firms, with about 6,000 firms accounting for
only 4 per cent of Britain’s total employment in manufacturing. The negotiation
of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (see p 365) has encouraged investment and exports increased substantially
in 1977 and 1978. The Clothing Export Council, which represents a major part
of the industry, co-ordinates its promotional activities.

Britain is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of food and drink products.
About two-thirds of the bread in Britain is manufactured in large mechanised
bakeries, most of which use a process developed by the industry’s principal
research organisation, the Flour Milling and Baking Research Association, and
now widely used in other countries. Two groups are predominant. In smaller
bakeries production of cakes and other flour confectionery is usually allied to
bread production. Biscuits and related products are a major sector of the industry
and have gained a world-wide reputation. Another sector is grain milling and
the production of various specialised flours and meal.
The cocoa, chocolate and sugar confectionery industry is composed of a small
number of very large manufacturers and many medium-sized and small firms.
A substantial proportion of total world exports of chocolate and sugar con¬
fectionery are supplied by Britain.
The industry comprises the curing of bacon and ham, the canning and pre¬
serving of meat and fish, the manufacture of sausages and pies and the prepara¬
tion of extracts and pastes. In addition to the output of quick-frozen fish, small
quantities are also canned.
Fruit and vegetable products include canned, frozen and dried fruit and
vegetables, jam, marmalade, pickles and sauces. Other products of the food
processing industry include sugar, sugar preparations and honey, dairy products
and eggs, vegetable and animal oils and fats, coffee, cocoa, tea and spices and
cereal preparations.
Of prime importance among the alcoholic beverages produced in Britain, and
in the food and drink industry as a whole, is whisky. Scotch whisky accounts
for almost all whisky production in Britain. About four-fifths of annual sales
are to overseas buyers; the United States imports nearly a third of the distilled
alcoholic beverages exported from Britain. The rest of the European Community
and Japan are the other largest markets. Production of gin in Britain has risen

steadily since the early 1950s. One company accounts for a large proportion of
output. Some of the larger manufacturers also own distilleries abroad.
In the brewing and malting industry there are seven major brewery groups
whose products are sold nationally and about 80 smaller enterprises who
mainly supply locally, or regionally. Firms have introduced new production
methods, including continuous brewing processes, and automated batch pro¬
duction plants are well established. The main raw materials used are malt, hops
and some sugar. British malt, which is made almost entirely from home-grown
barley, is used by brewers throughout the world. In recent years the popularity
of lager has increased considerably.
Three major groups account for much of the cider and perry produced in
Britain. The industry is based mainly in Devon, Somerset and Hereford and
Worcester. Imported grape and fruit juices are used in the production of most of
the made wine. A much smaller, though expanding viticultural industry produces
wine from grapes grown in vineyards, mostly in southern England.
The soft drinks industry has expanded markedly in the last decade. There
are some very large firms among about 20 producing brands which are marketed
on a national scale, while other firms supply regional markets. There is some
specialisation among firms in the production of various types, such as carbonated
drinks, cola-based drinks, squashes and cordials, tonic waters and ‘mixers’,
fruit juices and health drinks.
The British tobacco industry manufactures almost all the cigarettes and tobacco
goods sold in Britain. It is made up of four major companies and a number of
smaller ones, and specialises in the production of high-quality cigarettes made
from flue-cured tobacco. Exports, mainly of cigarettes, are shipped to many over¬
seas countries including Belgium, Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands. Britain
imports raw tobacco in large amounts from the United States, India and Canada.

Firms in the industry manufacture such items as bricks, roofing tiles, chimney
pots, fireclay ware and heat-resisting products, including furnace and kiln
linings. Brickmaking is one of Britain’s oldest industries, but most manufacture
is now based on highly mechanised systems. One company, the London Brick
Company, supplies about 40 per cent of total brick deliveries. Refractory goods
include firebricks, silica bricks, magnesite bricks, chrome-magnesite bricks and
alumina bricks.
The cement industry is chiefly concerned with the manufacture of Portland
cement for the home market. Invented by Joseph Aspdin and patented in 1824,
this material and the methods of its production have been the subject of con¬
tinuous technical improvement and intensive research. One new variation,
glass-reinforced cement composites, consists of ordinary Portland cement and
sand combined with an alkali-resistant glass fibre. The capacity of the industry
as a whole has been substantially expanded in recent years.

The pottery industry, centred largely in Staffordshire, supplies almost all home
needs for domestic and industrial pottery. It uses largely indigenous clay from
Cornwall and Devon. There has been considerable re-equipment in the industry;
kilns fired by gas or electricity have replaced all the coal-fired kilns, and new
decorating techniques and automatic and semi-automatic machinery, such as
automatic glazing machines, have been introduced. Domestic pottery, including
china, earthenware and stoneware, accounts for two-thirds of the industry’s
output; the other main divisions are glazed tiles, sanitary ware and electrical
ware, and such specialised industrial products as acid-proof stoneware, porous
ceramics and laboratory porcelain. Production of tableware is concentrated in
two major groups. Britain is the world’s principal manufacturer of fine bone
china, much of which is exported; famous makes include Wedgwood, Spode,
Royal Worcester, Royal Doulton, Minton, Coalport and Royal Crown Derby.
Britain’s glass industry is one of the biggest in the world. Glass containers form
the largest part of the industry; another major section is devoted to the manu¬
facture of flat glass in its various forms, chiefly ‘float’ glass, a process developed
in Britain and licensed to glassmakers throughout the world. The use of glass
for internal decoration and as a finish for internal and external walls has greatly
increased in recent years. Large quantities of safety glass are produced for the
motor and other industries. Other products include tubular glass, mirrors, lamp
and bulb glass, scientific and medical glassware, glass fibres, and all types of glass
containers (mostly made automatically). A traditional product is hand-made lead
crystal glassware of very high quality. Collective research is undertaken by the
British Glass Industry Research Association, and much research work is also
carried out by the Department of Ceramics, Glasses and Polymers of Sheffield
University.

The British paper and board industry is one of the largest in Europe. The larger
British groups hold considerable interests abroad, including pulp and paper
producing mills in the United States, Canada, other parts of the Commonwealth
and Europe. In recent years paper production has concentrated on printing and
writing papers and boards and speciality grades. There has also been a significant
trend towards waste-based packaging grades, in order to reduce the industry’s
reliance on imported woodpulp supplies. Domestically produced woodpulp
represents only a small percentage of raw material supplies and the use of
recycled waste paper is increasing; together they currently provide nearly 60 per
cent of the industry’s needs. The Government’s Paper and Board Industry
Scheme has assisted the increased use of both recycled paper and board and of
home-produced woodpulp. The main types of paper and board produced are
printing and writing papers and board, packaging board, wrapping papers,
newsprint, household tissues and industrial and special purpose papers.
The packaging and converting industries manufacture a variety of converted
products, including cardboard boxes, cartons, fibreboard packaging and business
stationery products.
MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES
245
Printing and The printing and publishing industries produce a wide range of products,
Publishing including national and provincial newspapers, periodicals, books, business
stationery and greeting cards. Mergers have led to the formation of large groups
in the newspaper, magazine and book publishing sectors, but general printing,
engraving, bookbinding and a large part of publishing remain essentially
industries of small firms. Production processes include high-speed printing
equipment, including electronic engraving, advanced processes of photo¬
graphic reproduction and computer typesetting. Security printers (of, for
example, banknotes and postage stamps) have a high reputation and are
important exporters.
The most important overseas markets for printed matter are the United
States, the Irish Republic and Australia.

Rubber Tyres and tubes represent nearly half the output of the industry, but firms
make a variety of other goods, the most important being vehicle components
and accessories, conveyor belting, cables, hose, latex foam products and rubber
footwear, gloves and clothing. Rubber is also used for inflatable liferafts, con¬
tainers for fuel and other industrial liquids and seals for storage tanks and other
products where there are problems of air exclusion and vapour suppression.
One of the largest tyre groups in Europe, Dunlop-Pirelli Union, resulted from
a merger in 1971 of Britain’s leading rubber and tyre company and its Italian
equivalent. Tyre manufacturers include several subsidiaries of United States
and other overseas companies. The industry’s consumption of rubber includes
natural, synthetic and recycled rubber.
Furniture, Numerous enterprises manufacture furniture in Britain (including domestic,
Brushes and office, school and other furniture) with a few large firms predominating. In
Timber recent years the industry has experienced a sharp increase in demand from
overseas. Exports have risen from ^69-3 million in 1975 to £174 million in
1978. The industry comprises wooden, metal and plastic furniture, upholstery,
bedding and soft furnishings. A Development Council for the industry has
existed since 1949. Scientific research and technical and other information
services are provided by the Furniture Industry Research Association.
The brush industry is located throughout Britain and includes highly
mechanised establishments as well as small craft units.
Domestic production of timber has been steadily increasing but the timber
industries are mainly dependent on imported supplies. A large proportion of
timber sales are dependent on the construction industry. Chipboard is the
fastest growing sector of the industry; other important sectors are hardwood
and plywood.

In addition to the plastics components and accessories supplied to many different
industries, the plastics products industry manufactures a wide range of building

materials, such as pipes, sheeting for roofs, sanitary ware, tanks and other
products. It also supplies flexible foams, used in the vehicle, furniture and other
industries; rigid foams; packaging products, including bottles, containers and
bags; domestic and industrial hollow-ware; many kinds of household goods;
vinyl and other floorcoverings; and leathercloth.
The industry manufactures toys, games, sports equipment and children’s
carriages. There are about 600 toy and games makers in Britain but some 20
companies dominate the market. The greatest expansion has been in the field
of craft and hobby kits. British diecast toys and model construction kits are
well known overseas; about a third of the output of toys and games is for export.
The Federal Republic of Germany, France and the United States are the major
markets for toys while the United States and the European Community are the
main markets for sports equipment.
CONSTRUCTION
The construction industry, which accounted for about 6 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1978, includes firms engaged on the design, construction,
alteration, repair and maintenance of buildings, highways, airfields, drainage and
sewerage systems, docks, harbours and canals, sea defence works, offshore
structures, electrical wiring, heating and other installation work, and structural
work connected with thermal and hydroelectric power stations and telecom¬
munications. About 1-2 million people are employed in construction, accounting
for nearly 6 per cent of total employment. There are also about 500,000 self-
employed. About 20 per cent of construction workers are employed by local
authorities. In 1978 repair and maintenance accounted for 34 per cent of the
value of construction output in Great Britain.
Construction work is carried out both by private contractors and by public
authorities which employ their own labour. In 197^ about 88 per cent of the
work was done by private firms. Although there were about 63,000 firms employ¬
ing two or more people 93 per cent of them employed fewer than 25 people.
Public authorities as a whole employed about 225,000 operatives but a very
large proportion of these were engaged on repair and maintenance work for
local authorities.
Some 44 per cent of operatives were occupied on building maintenance,
valued at about £5,477 million annually. The total labour force includes about
68,000 trainees, training under the industry’s apprenticeship schemes. The
normal apprenticeship period is three years.
Some firms are vertically integrated, owning quarries and workshops,
mechanised plant and standard builders’ equipment; some undertake respon¬
sibility for projects from initial design to finished building. All but the smallest
projects are generally carried out under professional direction, either by architects
or, in the case of the more complicated civil engineering projects, by consulting
engineers. The functions of the latter, acting on behalf of a client, embrace
advice on the feasibility of projects, the drawing up of plans and the supervision
of the construction work by the contractor.
The Property Services Agency (PSA), which is an integral part of the Depart¬
ment of the Environment (see p 45), is responsible for the construction pro¬
grammes undertaken directly by the Government, including work for the armed
forces both in Britain and overseas. In 1977-78 the PSA spent £395 million on
design and construction. The Department of the Environment is responsible fo

the sponsorship of the construction industry. Among other things, this involves
consultation with the industry through the National Consultative Council for
the Building and Civil Engineering Industries and less formal contacts. The
Department is also responsible for co-ordinating research and development in
construction throughout Government and seeks to influence techniques and
methods within the industry.
The value of the work done in Britain in 1978 amounted to £16,147 milhon of
which £4,212 million represented new housing and £6,457 million other new
work; repair and maintenance accounted for the remaining £5,477 million.
During 1978 a total of 264,200 dwellings were started in Great Britain. Starts
in the public sector were 107,200 and those for private owners 157,000. In the
course of the same year 279,400 dwellings were completed, of which 130,600
were in the public sector and 148,700 in the private sector. Industrialised building
methods employing prefabricated components are used in some of the work.
The National Building Agency is an independent advisory body, managed
by a board of directors appointed by the Secretaries of State for the Environment
and for Scotland and Wales. Its main function is to encourage the adoption of
advanced methods of house building, and to provide technical advice and
services to government departments, local authorities and other clients.
The Association of Building Centres represents the interests of the 12 building
centres throughout Britain most of which provide both a comprehensive
permanent exhibition and information services on building materials and
products, building services and techniques.
Among important construction projects in hand in Britain in 1979 were con¬
ventional and nuclear power stations (see p 265), offshore production platforms
and onshore terminals for North Sea oil, hospitals, large-scale housing develop¬
ments, and roads, tunnels and bridges, including the new bridge being built
across the river Humber (see p 295), and the Thames Barrier which will form
part of London’s flood defences.
Total overseas earnings of all sectors of the construction industry in 1977-78
were estimated at about £2,600 million, some £440 million more than in the
previous 12 months. British contractors earned £330 million from overseas
customers and a further £60 million from overseas branches and subsidiaries.
The related professions (consulting engineers, architects and surveyors) had
earnings of £380 million, while exports of building materials, plant and
machinery accounted for some £1,800 million.
In 1977-78 British construction firms carried out work overseas valued at
£1,609 million, an increase of £330 million over the previous year. New con¬
tracts worth £1,922 million were won overseas in 1977-78.
The Government and the construction industry are represented on the
Exports Standing Committee of the National Consultative Council for the
Building and Civil Engineering Industries.
Within the Department of the Environment, the Building Research Establish¬
ment (BRE) is concerned with all aspects of construction research. In addition,
the Building Research Advisory Service of the BRE provides technical advice
over a wide range of contruction problems. An Agrement Board tests and
certifies building products and methods.
The construction industry is served by several of the industrial research

associations, while the major construction firms have research departments
working on plant, materials and methods. Other bodies concerned with research
include the universities and colleges of technology. The larger producers of
primary building materials do some research into production methods and new
developments.
DISTRIBUTIVE AND SERVICE TRADES
Internal trade can be divided into two broad categories: trade in raw materials,
capital goods and intermediate products (for example, packaging materials) and
trade in consumer goods, including the network of distributive trades by which
home-produced or imported goods reach the consumer. (For the pattern of
consumers’ expenditure, see p 201.)
In Great Britain in 1978 there were about 27 million employees in the distribu¬
tive trades (in retailing, in particular, a large number of owners of businesses
and other family workers were also engaged). The distributive trades accounted
for about 10 per cent of British national income in 1978, retailing contributing
a little more than wholesaling.
While some of the trade in consumer goods passes through wholesalers to
retailers, sales are also made directly to consumers through producers’ own
selling organisations (including their own retail outlets and mail order businesses)
and other sales are made directly by producers to retailers.
Closely connected with the distributive trades are those which offer a service
directly to the public, notably catering and hotel trades, laundries and dry
cleaners, garage and motor repair trades, hairdressers and shoe repairers.
The main source of official information on the distributive trades is the series
of annual sample inquiries, introduced in 1976, to replace the former large-scale
periodic inquiries. For retailing, sample inquiries for 1976 and 1977 have been
completed. Similar sample inquiries for the wholesale trades for 1978 and 1979
are being undertaken. In Northern Ireland a census of distribution was taken in
respect of 1975, the results of which suggest that the level of turnover was about
2-5 per cent of that in Great Britain. In the following sections figures derived
from the inquiries are for Great Britain only.
For the service trades annual inquiries into capital expenditure and stocks are
continuing and are being extended into trades not covered formerly, such as
business services and hairdressing.
The main areas in which wholesalers are dominant are groceries and provisions,
petroleum products and ores and metals. The book value of stocks held by
wholesalers and dealers at the end of 1978 was £7,185 million; gross domestic
fixed capital formation in wholesale distribution amounted to £243 million
in 1978.
Methods of wholesale distribution vary according to the type of merchandise
handled. Fish, for example, is auctioned at the ports to port wholesalers (who
may sell to inland wholesalers at the main distribution centres) or, increasingly,
is sold by contract to fryers and processors, or direct to retailers. Fruit and
vegetables may be sold (or sent on a commission basis) to primary wholesalers,
who dispose of the produce either to secondary wholesalers or direct to retailers;
alternatively, the grower may deal direct with retailers or may sell his crop,
under contract, to a food-processing company for canning or freezing. The sale
of some agricultural products such as milk, hops and potatoes, is regulated by
statutory marketing boards.
London’s wholesale markets play a leading part in the distribution of food-

stuffs. Every year Covent Garden market handles over 1 million tons of fruit
and vegetables, and about 160,000 tons of carcase meat and 50,000 tons of
poultry pass through Smithfield market; Billingsgate is the principal distributing
centre for fish.
The co-operative movement in Britain has established its own wholesale
organisation to serve the needs of retail societies. The turnover of the Co¬
operative Wholesale Society (CWS), whose membership is restricted to incor¬
porated organisations, amounted to over £1,500 million in 1978.
There were some 500 ‘cash and carry’ depots in Britain in 1978; total sales
by the cash and carry members of the National Federation of Wholesale Grocers
and Provision Merchants amounted to about £1,300 million. By bulk purchasing
and limiting their expenditure on premises and credit and delivery facilities they
can offer large discounts to their customers.
Retailing in Britain may be classified under three main forms of organisation:
large multiple retailers with ten or more outlets, small multiple retailers with
between two and nine outlets and single outlet retailers. All three forms are
represented in two other important groups of retailers: mixed retail businesses,
which include mail order houses, and retail co-operative societies.
Large multiple retailers have tended to by-pass wholesalers by having their
own buying and distributive organisations. In the grocery trade many whole¬
salers have responded by forming voluntary organisations with small retailers.
The retailers buy all they can from one wholesaler for an overall discount, with
incentives given for volume of business and continuity. (The main voluntary
groups are VG, with some 3,300 stores and about 2 per cent of the market in
groceries, Spar, Mace and Wavy Line.) This has helped to preserve the existence
of retail outlets for the wholesaler and has given small retailers the advantage
of bulk buying and co-ordinated distribution without significant loss of
independence.
There was a considerable fall in the number of retail outlets in the 1970s, a
trend not matched by the volume of sales. Between 1971 and 1976
total turnover of the retail trades (including purchase tax in 1971 and value
added tax in 1976) more than doubled. After allowance was made for price
changes the volume of sales rose by 7 per cent. Retail turnover rose by a further
14 per cent in current prices during 1977. In terms of volume, however, this
represented a fall of 2 per cent.
Over 2-4 million people were engaged in retailing in 1977.
In 1977 there were more than 231,000 retailers with just one outlet, accounting
for 60 per cent of all retail outlets (compared with 338,000, accounting for 66
per cent in 1971). Turnover (including value added tax) totalled £12,731 million
in 1977 (£7,076 million, including purchase tax, in 1971). Single outlet retailers
accounted for 33 per cent of total retail turnover in 1977 (42 per cent in 1971).
Multiple retailers had just over 31,000 businesses and some 156,000 outlets
in 1977 (over 30,000 businesses and nearly 172,000 outlets in 1971). Turnover
(including value added tax) totalled over £26,000 million in 1977 (nearly £10,000
million, including purchase tax, in 1971).
In 1977, 930,000 people were engaged in single outlet retail businesses and
1,512,000 in multiple retailers.

operated specialist businesses such as food supermarkets, into other commodity

£10,000).
groups, including clothing and durable goods, has increased their similarity to
the traditional department store. Since 1976 the term ‘department store’ has
been replaced in official classifications by ‘mixed businesses’. These are retailers
with less than 80 per cent of their sales in any one of the specialist kinds of
business mentioned in Table 15 (the first two categories being counted as
one).
In 1977 there were 411 mixed businesses (other than general mail order
houses and credit traders calling on customers) and their turnover was over
£9,200 million, almost a quarter of total retail trade. Of these, 182 were large
multiples, 107 were small multiples and 122 had a single outlet.
Retail co-operative societies are voluntary organisations controlled by their
members. Membership is open to anyone paying a small deposit on a minimum
share, which entitles the member to an equal voice with other members in the
society. There are about 10-25 million members. Share investment by individual
members is limited to £5,000 (less in some instances) and only a low rate of
interest is normally paid on the shares. The trading surplus was traditionally
paid to members in the form of a dividend in proportion to the value of their
purchases. Many societies, accounting for over four-fifths of total co-operative
sales, have included dividend stamps redeemable for cash, other goods or
credit to a store account, at different redemption rates.
Total sales of retail co-operative societies in 1978 were £2,900 million, amount¬
ing to about 7 per cent of total retail trade. There were 247 societies at the end
of 1978; amalgamations are rapidly reducing the number (in 1958 the total
was 1,015). The largest single society is Co-operative Retail Services Limited,
which in 1978 had nearly 1,000 retail outlets and a turnover of ^415 million.
Each independent society has a financial holding in the Co-operative Whole¬
sale Society (CWS), which distributes retail food and non-food products to
retail co-operative societies on competitive terms. Societies are encouraged to
buy from the CWS, which supplies about two-thirds of their total needs. Retail
societies and the CWS are members of the Co-operative Union, as are other
co-operative bodies such as the Co-operative Insurance Society, the Co-operative
Press and the National Co-operative Chemists.

Keen competition in the retail sector encourages continual innovation in
methods of selling. Price competition has intensified since 1977 and has largely-
replaced the use of trading stamps as a method of sales promotion. The tradi¬
tional method of service by shop proprietors and assistants has largely given
way to self-service. Shopping has been made more flexible by such developments
as mail order, mobile shops and automatic vending machines.
Supermarkets are self-service shops with a minimum selling area of 2,000 square
feet (186 square metres). According to estimates of the Institute of Grocery
Distribution there were 6,190 supermarkets in 1977 with sales of ,£5,097 million.
Their share of total retail grocery sales was about 53 per cent.
The number of very large stores, generally known as superstores or hyper¬
markets, is increasing. These are defined as single-level, self-service stores
offering a wide range of food and non-food merchandise, with at least 25,000
square feet (2,322 square metres) of net selling space for superstores and 50,000
square feet (4,644 square metres) for hypermarkets. At the end of 1978 there
were 178 superstores and 45 hypermarkets trading or planned (having received
planning permission). The Department of the Environment issues guidance to
local authorities on the siting of these stores.
By reducing overheads on store amenities and customer services, discount
stores are able to sell goods at low prices. They have expanded their sales in
recent years of such items as electrical goods, furniture and do-it-yourself
supplies.
In 1977 the turnover of general mail order houses was almost ^1,500 million,
accounting for nearly 4 per cent of total retail sales.
The 33 members of the Direct Sales and Service Association are manufacturing
and importing companies which sell their products directly to consumers.
Their sales (including value added tax) amounted to some £240 million in 1978
and accounted for 85 per cent of direct sales (other than sales of food or sales
by mail order).
The rapid growth of sales of household and durable consumer goods, such as
cars, furniture, washing machines, freezers and television sets, has been greatly
helped by instalment credit, including hire purchase. Total new credit extended
by finance houses and retailers in Great Britain in 1978 amounted to £5,515
million, 26 per cent more than in 1977; equal amounts were advanced by finance
houses and by retailers. New credit extended in 1978 by finance houses operating
in Northern Ireland amounted to £108 million.
Credit cards, widely used in Britain, enable users to have their signatures
accepted on bills in participating shops, hotels and restaurants. The issuers,
which include banks, then meet the bills and recover the money from the
card-holder through a single account presented periodically. Retail groups
have also begun to issue credit cards; these bear the name of the group and are
for use only in its stores.
SERVICE TRADES About 2‘3 million people in Great Britain were employed in trades offering a
service directly to the public in 1978. They included laundries and dry cleaners,
hairdressers and shoe repairers. In recent years there has been a rapid growth
252 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
of establishments offering services such as photocopying and printing and also
shops, selling ‘fast food’, to be eaten on the premises or to be taken away.
In April 1979 there were 492 members of the British Antique Dealers Associa¬
tion; nearly 4,000 travel agents belonged to the Association of British Travel
Agents at the end of 1978; and there were about 60,000 public houses in Great
Britain in 1977. The number of branches of building societies (see p 356) has
grown rapidly in recent years.
Advertising Some £1,800 million was spent by advertisers in Britain in 1978, equal to 1-3 per
cent of gross national product and 1 -9 per cent of consumers’ expenditure. This
compared with £1,500 million spent in 1977 according to the Advertising Associa¬
tion. Advertising in the press rose by 22 per cent to £ 1,236 million and advertising
on television rose by 21 per cent to £482 million. Most of the advertising is
planned by agencies, which, in some cases, also provide marketing, consumer
research and other services; their representative organisation is the Institute of
Practitioners in Advertising. The trade association for the whole industry,
including agencies, advertisers and media owners, is the Advertising Association.
It was responsible for the setting up of the Advertising Standards Authority, an
independent body whose objective is the promotion and enforcement of the
highest standards of advertising, in particular through the British Code of
Advertising Practice.
Public Industry and commerce pay great attention to improving public understanding
Relations of their work and objectives. Many have their own public relations advisers and
staff, while consultancy firms provide general services and assistance for special
public relations activities. The Institute of Public Relations, founded in 1948,
is the largest professional public relations organisation in Europe, with some
2,500 members in commerce, industry, public relations consultancies, national
associations, and central and local government.
Presentation of The expansion of self-service shops, the spread of branded and standardised
Goods products, and developments in partly prepared foods, such as ready-washed
vegetables and ready-made cake mixes, have all been major factors in the changes
which have taken place in packaging methods. Packaging products of paper and
board remain the most extensively used. Other important materials are tinplate,
plastics and glass. New uses have been found for tinplate, especially in the
canning of soft drinks and beer. The use of plastics continues to develop,
particularly polyethylene film and film products and low-density polyethylene
bottles used as an alternative to the traditional glass bottle.

Ownership of
Mineral Rights
Resources
Britain has the largest energy resources of any country in the European Com¬
munity. The development of oilfields in the British sector of the North Sea has
reduced the quantity of crude oil imported and by 1980 Britain should be
producing an amount equivalent to its total crude oil requirements. Minerals
as a whole make an important contribution to the economy. The approximate
value of minerals produced in 1977 was £6,026 million, of which coal accounted
for 44 per cent, crude oil 36 per cent and natural gas 5 per cent. Over the past
ten years the production of fuel minerals has increased. The output of non-fuel
minerals rose until 1973, but since then there has been a fall in output, particu¬
larly of the major construction materials.
Water resources are normally sufficient for domestic and industrial require¬
ments; supplies are obtained from surface sources such as mountain lakes and
from underground sources by such means as wells and boreholes.
Apart from gold, silver, oil, natural gas (which are owned by the Crown), coal
and some minerals associated with coal, all minerals in Great Britain are privately
owned. On the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS) the right to
exploit all minerals except coal is vested in the Crown. The exclusive right to
extract coal, or license others to do so, both on land and under the sea, is
vested in the National Coal Board. Normally, ownership of minerals runs with
the ownership of the land surface but in some areas, particularly where mining
has taken place, these rights have become separated. Mining and quarrying,
apart from coal, are usually carried out by privately owned companies.
ENERGY
Four main primary sources of energy—petroleum, coal, natural gas and nuclear
power—are used in Britain, together with some water power; secondary sources
produced from these are electricity, coke and very small quantities of town gas.
About three-quarters of all primary energy consumed comes from indigenous
sources and this proportion is increasing as Britain’s offshore oil production
rises rapidly. Considerable reserves of oil and gas discovered offshore in the
United Kingdom Continental Shelf should enable Britain to be virtually
self-sufficient for a number of years from 1980. Coal and nuclear power have an
increasingly important role in Britain’s primary energy supply, particularly
in the long term. Reserves of coal, Britain’s richest natural resource, are sufficient
to enable production to continue for about 300 years at current rates of extraction
and a major capital investment programme is in progress. Nuclear power provided
about 13 per cent of electricity available through the public supply system in
1978 and the proportion will grow as further nuclear power stations now under
construction, or planned, are brought into service.

Publicly owned bodies are responsible for the output and supply of most of
the energy industries, although privately owned companies predominate in
offshore oil and gas production and oil refining. The publicly owned fuel and
power industries in Britain employ in total some 600,000 people, 2-3 per cent
of the working population; their annual turnover is about £12,600 million
and capital investment about £1,800 million. In Great Britain the Secretary of
State for Energy is responsible for these industries, except for electricity in
Scotland which is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland.
Britain takes an active part in the work of the International Energy Agency
(a body with 20 member countries attached to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development) which is engaged on a programme of inter¬
national co-operation to deal with world energy problems. In addition, Britain
is co-operating fully in the development of the European Community’s energy
policy, a basic objective of which is to reduce dependence on imported energy
supplies. Because of worldwide concern over possible future oil shortages, Britain,
in common with other industrial countries, is seeking to conserve energy and to
reduce oil consumption.
In 1978 inland primary energy consumption amounted to 339-8 million tonnes
of coal equivalent, slightly higher than in 1977, but below the peak consumption
recorded in 1973 (see Table 16). Petroleum accounted for 41 per cent of primary
consumption, coal 35-3 per cent, natural gas 19-2 per cent, nuclear power 3-9
per cent and hydro-electric power o-6 per cent. Energy consumption by final
users in 1978 amounted to 59,191 million therms1 on a ‘heat supplied’
basis. Industrial users consumed about 38 per cent, domestic users 26 per
cent, transport 23 per cent, public services 6 per cent and agriculture 1 per
cent.

The role of the Government in energy conservation is to set a good example
in its use of energy, and to guide and stimulate consumers to use energy more
efficiently. Britain’s continuing energy conservation programme involves a com¬
bination of advisory, financial and mandatory measures aimed at all energy-using
sectors. The Secretary of State for Energy is advised by an independent Advisory
Council on Energy Conservation, while studies on energy conservation and
alternative sources of energy are undertaken by a number of organisations, notably
the Energy Technology Support Unit of the Department of Energy at Harwell
(Oxfordshire) and the National Engineering Laboratory of the Department of
Industry.

Since 1973 a wide range of measures designed to encourage energy saving has
been introduced. Conservation measures contributed to energy savings estimated
at around £3,000 million in the five years to the end of 1978.
Several schemes to assist industry and commerce to adopt energy conservation
measures are in operation. These include grants for insulation and boiler
replacement, subsidies for consultants’ surveys, energy audits in selected
industries and financial assistance for demonstration projects. Firms have been
encouraged to appoint energy managers (of whom there are some 3,000) to
draw up and administer energy conservation measures in factories and offices.
Many firms have achieved significant economies through measures such as
better use of heating and lighting, improved operational and maintenance
techniques, and the installation of draught-proofing and additional insulation.
A number of measures to improve insulation in houses have been introduced
including a programme to bring public sector housing up to a basic minimum
standard of insulation. In addition, grants have been made available to private
householders under the Homes Insulation Act 1978 towards the installation of
basic insulation in uninsulated houses. Other conservation measures have
included a maximum limit of 20° Centigrade on heating levels in commercial
and industrial buildings; publication of official fuel consumption figures for
new cars, so that potential purchasers can assess the petrol usage of different
models; and a major government publicity campaign to promote the efficient
use of energy.
The total value of the substantial oil and gas reserves discovered in the United
Kingdom Continental Shelf is estimated at about £300,000 million. It is one
of the world’s most attractive offshore areas for oil and gas, the average success
rate for exploration drilling comparing very favourably with other offshore
areas. Seismic prospecting began in the early 1960s and full-scale exploration
activities in 1964. Six rounds of production licensing have been held and the
Government has announced its intention of holding a seventh round. The total
area covered by production licences is some 59,000 square kilometres (22,800
square miles) out of a total designated area of about 624,600 square kilometres
(241,200 square miles), over which Britain has exercised its rights to explore
and exploit the seabed and subsoil.
Large-scale investment is taking place in offshore exploration and develop¬
ment, estimated at £2,300 million in 1978. By the end of 1978, 810 exploration
or appraisal wells and 486 production wells had been drilled or begun; of these
62 and 96 respectively were drilled in 1978.
The Department of Energy’s Offshore Supplies Office seeks to ensure that
British industry can compete effectively for orders for offshore equipment
by helping firms to identify the needs of offshore operators, assisting operators
to identify British suppliers of offshore equipment and services, and promoting
new ventures to increase British involvement in the industry. British companies
increased their share of the offshore market, worth £1,574 million in 1978, from
between 25 and 30 per cent in 1973 to 66 per cent in 1978 and are increasingly
involved in supplying other offshore markets.
During most of the twentieth century Britain has been almost wholly dependent
for its oil supplies on imports, the only indigenous supplies coming from a small
number of land-based oilfields. However, the discovery of oil offshore in the
UKCS has transformed the position and Britain is obtaining a growing propor¬
tion of its oil supplies from offshore fields. The first discovery of oil in the
256 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
UKCS was made in 1969 and the first oil was brought ashore in 1975. Output
is increasing rapidly (see Table 17) and Britain is now producing about 1*7
million barrels (235,000 tonnes) a day. Large-scale benefits to Britain, in the
form of increasing exports and of imports saved, are being realised. (For estimates
of the growing economic benefits of North Sea oil revenues see p 195.)
North Sea Twelve fields in the UKCS are producing oil: Brent and Forties, two of the
Fields largest offshore oilfields in the world; Argyll; Auk; Beryl; Claymore; Dunlin;
Heather; Montrose; Ninian; Piper and Thistle. A further 12 fields are under
development, while more than 40 further significant finds that have been made
may prove to be commercial after further appraisal. Production from most
large fields is controlled from production platforms of either steel or concrete
which have been built to withstand severe weather including gusts of wind of
up to 257 km/h (160 mph) and waves of 30 metres (100 feet).
Britain’s primary oil production, including condensates and petroleum gases,
amounted to 54 million tonnes in 1978, about 40 per cent more than in 1977,
and was equivalent to nearly three-fifths of Britain’s oil requirements for energy
and non-energy purposes and for international marine bunkers. Production is
expected to continue to rise rapidly, reaching between 70 million and 80 million
tonnes in 1979 and between 85 and 105 million tonnes in 1980. Remaining
proven reserves of oil in the UKCS amount to nearly 1,400 million tonnes
while the total remaining reserves of the UKCS could be as high as 4,300 million
tonnes.

Government The Petroleum and Submarine Pipe-lines Act 1975 provides for controls over
Control exploration, development, installation of pipelines and refining capacity, and
over the rate of depletion to ensure that offshore oil is used at the rate which
secures the greatest long-term benefit for Britain.

through participation agreements with other oil companies, to purchase 51 per
cent of most of the oil produced in the UKCS; and as a substantial enterprise
engaged in North Sea exploration, development and production. The Govern¬
ment has announced plans for restructuring the Corporation and broadening
ownership in the Corporation’s North Sea activities to include private sector
investors.
Onshore production of crude oil in Britain is much less significant than offshore
production, amounting in 1978 to about 100,000 tonnes. However, production
for 1979 is expected to be significantly higher, primarily as a result of the con¬
tribution from Britain’s largest onshore field, at Wytch Farm (Dorset), which
started production in March 1979. Twelve other onshore fields are in operation,
notably Beckingham, Bothamsall and Egmanton in Nottinghamshire, Gains¬
borough in Lincolnshire and Kimmeridge in Dorset.
In 1979 the nominal crude distillation capacity of Britain’s oil refineries amounted
to 133-1 million tonnes a year. All but three of the 20 refineries in operation
specialise in heavy products, such as bitumen and waxes. Seventeen have a
distillation capacity of over 1 million tonnes a year and are shown on the map
on p 257. Three have a crude distillation capacity of over 10 million tonnes a
year: Stanlow, in Cheshire (17-6 million tonnes); Fawley, near Southampton
(17-3 million tonnes); and Kent (io-6 million tonnes). The fall in demand for
petroleum products following the oil crisis in 1973 was a major factor in the
abandonment or postponement of several plans for new refineries. Existing
refineries are being adapted to the changing pattern of demand by the construc¬
tion of new upgrading facilities which are leading to a higher output of motor
spirit and naphtha at the expense of fuel oil.
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 1978 totalled 84-1 million tonnes including 28-2 million
tonnes of fuel oil, 19-5 million tonnes of gas and diesel oil (including derv fuel
used in road vehicles), 18-3 million tonnes of motor spirit and 7-2 million tonnes
of kerosene. Deliveries for electricity generation accounted for 40 per cent
of fuel oil deliveries in 1978. The largest industrial users of fuel oil are the
steel, chemicals and paper-making industries.
Imports of crude oil have been declining recently (see Table 17) and in 1978
were valued at £3,528 million, 11-2 per cent less in value than in 1977. Saudi
Arabia supplied approximately 21 per cent of crude oil by value, Kuwait 17 per
cent and Iran and Iraq each supplied 14 per cent. The tonnage imported is
expected to continue to decline, although heavy crude oil will still be imported
for particular uses.
High quality premium oil from the UKCS is being exported and crude oil
exports accounted for about 46 per cent of production in 1978. Exports of crude
oil have risen considerably and were valued at £1,241 million in 1978 when
£1,003 million of petroleum products were also exported. Most oil exports are
sent to other countries in Western Europe.
Oil pipelines brought ashore about 90 per cent of offshore oil in 1978. About 700
miles (1,127 kilometres) of submarine pipeline have been built to bring ashore
oil from a number of North Sea oilfields (see map). Pipelines distribute crude
oil to refineries from harbours, North Sea land terminals or offshore moorings
capable of berthing very large tankers, for example, from Finnart to Grange-

mouth; from Angle Bay, Milford Haven, to Llandarcy; from Tranmere to
Stanlow; from Amlwch (Gwynedd) to Stanlow; and from Cruden Bay to
Grangemouth. Pipelines also carry refined products and petrochemical feed¬
stocks to major marketing areas; for example, a 300-mile (480-kilometre)
pipeline runs from Milford Haven to the Midlands and Manchester.
Research into problems of petroleum technology is carried out mainly by the
leading oil companies, which have also endowed research at the universities
on a substantial scale. Research centres are situated at Sunbury-on-Thames
(British Petroleum), Ellesmere Port in Cheshire and Woodstock in Kent
(Shell), and Abingdon in Oxfordshire (Esso). Work in progress includes the
evolution of new and improved fuels and lubricants, and the development of
new uses for petroleum products and of new products based on petroleum,
especially chemicals. The main Government research and development effort
in offshore technology is undertaken by the Department of Energy with the
advice of the Offshore Energy Technology Board (see p 379). In 1979-80 the
Department of Energy expects to spend some ^18 million in support of offshore
technology.
Public supply of manufactured gas in Britain began in the early nineteenth
century in Westminster in central London. For many years gas was produced
from coal but during the 1960s, when growing supplies of oil were being imported,
there was a switch to producing town gas from oil-based feedstocks. However,
a more significant change began in the late 1960s following the first commercial
natural gas discovery in the UKCS in 1965 and the start of offshore gas produc¬
tion in 1967. Supplies of offshore natural gas grew rapidly and natural gas has
now replaced town gas as the source of gas for the public supply system in Great
Britain. Originally used almost exclusively for lighting, gas is now primarily
used for domestic cooking and heating and for industrial and commercial
purposes.
The Gas Act 1948 brought the industry in Great Britain under public ownership
and control in 1949. As a result of the change to natural gas necessitating more
centralised control of production and transmission, the British Gas Corporation
was set up in 1973 under the Gas Act 1972 to replace the Gas Council and
area gas boards. The Corporation’s powers in connection with its main duty
of developing and maintaining an efficient, co-ordinated and economical system
of gas supply and of satisfying reasonable demands for gas are: to search for
and extract natural gas and any oil discovered in the course of searching for
gas; to manufacture or acquire, transmit and distribute gas; to manufacture,
supply, or sell by-products; and to manufacture, install, maintain or remove
gas plant and fittings. It has about 100,000 employees.
Natural gas is not available in Northern Ireland and the industry there,
which is controlled by nine municipal undertakings and four private sector
companies, uses town gas produced from oil feedstocks. The position of the
gas undertakings is being reviewed in the light of the Government’s decision
not to provide a natural gas pipeline to Northern Ireland following a feasibility
study by the British Gas Corporation.
In 1978 indigenous supplies of natural gas were equivalent to about 88 per cent
of total natural gas supplies. Between 1973 and 1978 the quantity of gas sent
out by the public supply system in Britain increased by 36 per cent to 15,853
million therms. Seven major gasfields are now in production (Leman Bank,

Hewett, Indefatigable, Viking, West Sole, Rough and Frigg). Output from the
UKCS amounted to 38,200 million cubic metres in 1978. Supplies to the British
Gas Corporation are expected to continue to rise as output from the Frigg field,
which straddles the boundary between the British and Norwegian sectors of
the North Sea, builds up and as a growing amount of gas produced in association
with oil in oilfields is brought ashore. Total proven gas reserves remaining in
known discoveries in the UKCS at the end of 1978 amounted to 706,000 million
cubic metres and total possible reserves in known discoveries amounted to
1-5 million million cubic metres.
A national high pressure pipeline system provides for the transmission of natural
gas, derived mainly from British fields in the North Sea (see map, p 261). By
March 1979 some 3,500 miles (5,600 kilometres) of transmission pipeline were
in operation. The national transmission system is supplied by feeder mains
from four North Sea shore terminals and from the Canvey Island terminal which
handles tankers carrying liquefied gas imported from Algeria under a long-term
contract. Three new pipelines have been built to carry gas from St Fergus
(Grampian) to central Scotland and northern England, while a fourth is to be
laid between 1980 and 1982. In the northern North Sea two 225-mile (362-
kilometre) pipelines have been laid between the Frigg field and St Fergus,
while the longest offshore pipeline in the UKCS has been laid for 281 miles
(452 kilometres) between the Brent field and St Fergus.
There are considerable quantities of gas in the North Sea, some associated
with oil and some existing independently, which do not justify a new pipeline
to the shore. A report by Gas Gathering Pipelines (North Sea) Ltd proposed
a number of schemes for feeding such gas into existing pipelines, and some of
these schemes are already in progress. The Government is keeping under review
the need for a new gas gathering pipeline to the shore to serve fields under
development or expected to be developed.
Various methods of storage of natural gas to meet peak load conditions are
being investigated. Storage facilities for liquefied natural gas have been installed
at four sites and further facilities are under construction. Two salt cavities at
Hornsea (Humberside) are also used for gas storage and two more are under
construction.
Over half of all gas sold by the British Gas Corporation to its i4'9 rnillion
consumers is for industrial and commercial purposes, most of the remainder
being for household use. Total consumption increased rapidly during the late
1960s and early 1970s, but is now growing at a more modest rate, with sales in
Britain rising by 5 per cent in 1978 to 15,308 million therms. A phased pro¬
gramme of converting all gas appliances to use natural gas was completed in
Great Britain in 1977. Gas is used particularly in industries requiring the control
of temperatures to a fine degree of accuracy such as the pottery industry and
certain processes for making iron and steel products. In 1978* 5>9^5 milFon
therms of gas were sold to industry in Britain, 338 million therms to public
supply and transport power stations and i,744 million therms to commercial
users. The domestic load includes gas for cookers, space heaters, water heaters
and refrigerators, but an increasingly large part of domestic demand is for gas
for central heating. In 1978, 7,261 million therms were sold to domestic users,
io-2 per cent more than in 1977.
In 1978-79 the turnover of the British Gas Corporation and its subsidiary
companies amounted to £2,972 million, of which sales of gas accounted for

Capital investment amounted to £235 million and in the five-year period from
i979~8o the Corporation expects to invest some £1,750 million at 1978 prices.
Recently the Corporation has been wholly self-financing.
The British Gas Corporation conducts research at four research stations into
all aspects of gas supply and use. Research is also done on behalf of the Cor¬
poration at a number of universities and colleges. The Corporation’s total
expenditure on research and development and on technical service and testing
amounted to £32 million in 1978-79. The Corporation is undertaking various
coal gasification projects at its Westfield Development Centre in Fife in col¬
laboration with groups of North American sponsors.
Coalmining in Britain can be traced back to the thirteenth century. It played a
crucial part in the industrial revolution of the early nineteenth century and
in its peak year, 1913, the industry produced 292 million tonnes of coal, exported
98 million tonnes and employed over a million workers. In 1947 the coal mines
passed into public ownership by means of the Coal Industry Nationalisation
Act 1946, which set up the National Coal Board (NCB) as a statutory corpora¬
tion to manage the industry.
The NCB has, with limited exceptions, exclusive rights over the extraction of
coal in Great Britain, but is empowered to license private operators to work
small mines and opencast sites. Under the Coal Industry Act 1977 the NCB
has been given further powers to work other minerals, where discoveries are
made in the course of searching for, or working, coal; and to engage in certain
petrochemical activities beneficial to the future of the coal industry; and wider
powers to undertake overseas activities, subject to the consent of the Secretary
of State for Energy. It has no monopoly in coal distribution and retail sales
remain largely in private hands, although it makes bulk sales to large industrial
consumers. Two holding companies, wholly owned by the NCB, run most of
its non-mining activities. NCB (Ancillaries) Ltd’s responsibilities include
certain retail fuel distribution operations, computer services and engineering.
NCB (Coal Products) Ltd is responsible for solid smokeless fuel manufacture
and chemical and by-products plants.
At the end of March 1979 there were 223 NCB collieries in operation grouped
into 12 areas, each controlled by a director responsible to the NCB. The main
coal-bearing areas are shown on the map on p 263 and the main trends in the
coal industry are shown in Table 18.
In 1978-79 output of 119-9 million tonnes comprised 105-4 million tonnes from
the NCB’s deep mines, 13-5 million tonnes from opencast mines and 1 million
tonnes from licensed mines and other sources. Britain’s coal industry remains
the largest in Western Europe and is one of the world’s most technologically
advanced. Developments in mining technology are concentrated on the intro¬
duction of computerised automatic monitoring and remote control of machines,
together with the installation of heavy-duty equipment, such as powered roof
supports, power loaders and armoured flexible conveyors, capable of sustained
high performance with minimum maintenance.
In 1978-79 the NCB’s income was £3,312 million including sales of coal of
£2,510 million and grants under the Coal Industry Acts of £172 million. The
trading profit was £121-1 million; after interest payments and other items

there was a net loss of £19-4 million. Government assistance to the industry
included grants towards the social costs of mine closures, contributions to¬
wards the mineworkers’ pension scheme, aid towards the cost of stocking
coal and coke, and assistance to promote the sale of coal for electricity generation.
The NCR’s borrowing limit is £2,200 million, with provision for further
increases up to £2,600 million, subject to parliamentary approval.
Capital expenditure on collieries amounted to ^454 nddion in I97^_79-
substantial increase in investment is taking place under the Board’s Plan for
Coal, a general strategy for the ten years to the mid-1980s. It involves investment
of ^5,170 million at July 1979 prices of which nearly half is expenditure on major
new projects. NCB deep mines are expected to be producing 120 million tonnes
a year by the mid-1980s, with about 42 million tonnes coming from new capacity
created under the ‘Plan for Coal’ to replace that lost by exhaustion of old col¬
lieries. By March 1979 the NCB had approved over 120 major projects designed
to provide about three-quarters of this new capacity including a new mining
complex at Selby (North Yorkshire) which should be producing 10 million tonnes
of coal a year in the late 1980s. Some 35 major projects have been completed
and new coal mines have been opened at Royston (South Yorkshire) and at
Betws (Dyfed).
Although many good seams of coal have now been worked out due to the
early development of the industry, total coal reserves in Britain are estimated
at 190,000 million tonnes, of which about 45,000 million tonnes (sufficient for at
least 300 years at present rates of consumption) are recoverable using existing
mining technology. The NCB’s national exploration programme is proving
fresh reserves of economically workable coal at the rate of 500 million tonnes a
year, four times the annual consumption of coal. Major new finds have been
located in the North-east Leicestershire coalfield (with recoverable reserves
of over 500 million tonnes), and also at Park (Staffordshire), west of Coventry,
under the Firth of Forth off Musselburgh (Lothian), at Margam (West Glamor¬
gan), and in north Oxfordshire.
Consumption Coal consumption has declined in line with production. In 1978-79 internal
consumption of coal was 122-4 million tonnes of which 68 per cent went to
power stations, 12 per cent to coke ovens and 8 per cent to domestic users.
The proportion of consumption accounted for by electricity generation is
increasing and NCB sales of coal to power stations reached a record 83-3 million
tonnes in 1978-79.
Exports of coal in 1978-79 were 2-1 million tonnes, almost all of which went to
Western European countries, while imports also amounted to 2-1 million tonnes.

In 1978-79 the NCB spent £33 million on research. It has two main research
organisations: the Coal Research Establishment (CRE) at Stoke Orchard (Glou¬
cestershire), concerned with the combustion and utilisation of coal; and the
Mining Research and Development Establishment at Stanhope Bretby
(Staffordshire), for work on mining methods and equipment, including under¬
ground transport and coal preparation. Long-term research at the CRE includes
the liquefaction and gasification of coal, and financial assistance is being provided
in support of two major projects designed to convert coal to liquid fuels (including
petrol) and to produce chemical feedstocks.
Agreements to exchange technical information have been signed by the
NCB with several countries. Britain is responsible through an NCB subsidiary
for managing a programme of international coal research projects on behalf
of the International Energy Agency. A programme of five collaborative coal
research projects, including a £17 million project to develop pressurised
fluidised bed combustion (a method of steam-raising for power generation), is
based in Britain.
The first public supply of electricity in Britain was in 1881, at Godaiming (Surrey).
A measure of public control has always been a feature of the industry and in
1948 all municipal and private undertakings in Great Britain were acquired
under the Electricity Act 1947 and vested in the British Electricity Authority
and 14 regional boards, except in the north of Scotland where they became the
responsibility of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB),
which had been set up in 1943. Two subsequent Acts (1954 and 1957) effected
a measure of decentralisation and gave the industry its present structure.
Electricity supply employs about 184,400 people, including 6,500 in Northern
Ireland.
In England and Wales electricity is generated and transmitted by the Central
Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), which is responsible for the operation
and maintenance of power stations and the main transmission system (national
grid), and it is distributed by 12 separate area electricity boards. Co-ordination
is effected by the Electricity Council, the central body of the supply industry
with a general responsibility for promoting electricity supply and for advising
the Secretary of State for Energy; it is also responsible for a number of common
services, principally capital financing, research and industrial relations. The
Council consists of a chairman and two deputy chairmen, the chairman and
two designated members of the CEGB, the chairmen of the area electricity
boards and not more than three other members.
In Scotland two boards, the NSHEB and the South of Scotland Electricity
Board (SSEB), generate, distribute and sell electricity. The boundary separat¬
ing their areas runs from Dumbarton on the Firth of Clyde to Newburgh on
the Firth of Tay (see map, p 266). Each board has a chairman and between
four and eight members, one of whom is the chairman of the other board.
In Northern Ireland generation, transmission and distribution are carried
out by the publicly owned Northern Ireland Electricity Service.
In 1978-79 the income of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales
was £5,445 million and its profit after interest payments was £251 million. In
Scotland the income of the SSEB and the NSHEB was £463 million and £173
million respectively and their profits were £9*5 million and £2-1 million. In
I97^-79 th® Northern Ireland Electricity Service’s income totalled £166
million and it made a net surplus of £3-9 million. Annual capital investment

amounts to £716 million in England and Wales, ^,'100 million in Scotland and
£60 million in Northern Ireland. The statutory limit to borrowings by the indus¬
try in England and Wales is £6,500 million, in Northern Ireland £650 million
and in Scotland £1,500 million, with provision for a further increase up to
£1,950 million.
Generation for the public supply in Britain reached a record 266,791 gigawatt
hours (GWh)1 in 1978, i-8 per cent more than in 1977. Conventional steam
power stations provided 86 per cent of the total, nuclear stations 12 per cent
and gas turbine, hydro-electric and diesel plant 2 per cent. Public supply
power stations in Britain consumed 115 million tonnes of coal equivalent in
1978 of which coal accounted for 70 per cent and oil 17 per cent. The output
capacity of the 221 generating stations of the electricity boards in Britain at the
end of 1978 totalled 67,357 megawatts (MW) including 55,910 MW run by the
CEGB, 7,418 MW by the SSEB, 2,096 MW by the NSHEB and 1,908 MW by
the Northern Ireland Electricity Service. An analysis of electricity generation
by and output capacity of the public supply system in Britain is given in Table 19.
Generation of electricity outside the public supply system is relatively small
(20,898 GWh in 1978). The major sources outside the fuel industries are the
chemical, engineering, paper, and iron and steel industries and the nuclear
power plants of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)
and British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL). In 197^ these nuclear plants supplied
3>338 GWh of electricity to the public supply system.
Average thermal efficiency (the ratio of the electrical energy output to the
heat energy input of the fuel consumed) of conventional steam stations in
England and Wales rose from 2075 per cent in 1947 to 31-85 per cent in 1978-79
as new plant was brought into use. The 20 most efficient stations, containing
much of the newest plant, had an average thermal efficiency of 34-11 per cent
in 1978-79.

MW including Kingsnorth (Kent), Europe’s largest mixed-fuel station burning
either coal or oil, while Britain’s largest power station is at Longannet (Fife), a
2,400 MW station with four cross-compound units. Nearly 15,000 MW of plant
are under construction including a 3>300 MW oil-fired station at Grain (Kent)
which will be the largest in Europe, a 2,000 MW coal-fired extension to the
Drax station (North Yorkshire), a 1,320 MW station at Peterhead (Grampian),
which will be able to use natural gas liquids as well as oil, a 1,260 MW oil-
fired station at Kilroot in Northern Ireland and three nuclear power stations
(see p 269).
Hydro-electric generation is confined almost entirely to Scotland and Wales.
Most of the water-power so utilised is drawn from high-level reservoirs with
their own natural catchment areas. Higher capacities are also envisaged for future
pumped-storage stations. (In pumped-storage schemes electricity generated in
off-peak periods is used to pump water to high-level reservoirs from which
it descends to drive turbines, rapidly providing a large supply of electricity
at peak periods or to meet sudden increases in demand.) Work is in pro¬
gress on the construction of a pumped-storage station at Dinorwic (Gwynedd),
which will be the largest of its type in the world when completed in 1983 and
will have an average generated output of 1,680 MW. The NSHEB is consider¬
ing a plan for a major pumped-storage station at Craigroyston on Loch
Lomond.
Large gas turbine units of 55 to 70 MW, based on aero jet engines, have
been introduced for peak load operation, while others of 17 to 35 MW capacity
are being used in new stations to safeguard auxiliary supplies to the large new
steam units and also to provide capacity for peak operation. Two 51 MW
prototype units at Leicester are powered by industrial gas turbines. A new
power station designed to sell waste heat from electricity generation to neigh¬
bouring firms is being built at Hereford and should be in operation early in
1980. It will be a 15 MW station with diesel generators and thermal efficiency
is expected to be around 76 per cent.
Britain has been implementing a substantial nuclear power programme since
the mid-1950s, the primary purpose being to produce an additional energy
source for the generation of electricity. In 1956 the world’s first large-scale
nuclear power station, at Calder Hall (Cumbria), began to supply electricity
to the national grid. Commercial nuclear power stations are producing electricity
at much lower cost than conventional power stations.
There are 11 nuclear power stations in operation controlled by the electricity
authorities, while a further five stations are controlled by the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority (see p 379) or British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. The
UKAEA has three experimental or prototype stations which feed electricity
into the national grid: the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) at Windscale,
Cumbria (32 MW); the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor at Winfrith,
Dorset (100 MW); and the Prototype Fast Reactor (PER) at Dounreay, High¬
land (250 MW). BNFL operates the two original Magnox stations, both of
198 MW, at Calder Hall and Chapelcross (Dumfries and Galloway).
Under the first commercial programme, nine Magnox stations with a total
design capacity of 4,800 MW were commissioned between 1962 and 1971.
They range in size from Berkeley (Gloucestershire) with a design capacity of
276 MW to the most recent, Wylfa (Gwynedd), which has a design capacity of
1,180 MW. Two 1,320 MW AGR stations at Hinkley Point B (Somerset) and

Hunterston B (Strathclyde) began operating in 1976 and the three other stations
being built under this second programme (Dungeness B, Kent, 1,200 MW;
Hartlepool, Cleveland, 1,320 MW; and Heysham, Lancashire, 1,320 MW)
should be commissioned by about 1981.
It was announced in 1978 that two further AGR stations would be built,
at Heysham and Torness (Lothian). In addition, the electricity industry has
declared its intention to order a pressurised water reactor, provided that design
work is completed satisfactorily and that all necessary Government and other
consents are obtained. Policy on fast reactor development, including whether or
not to proceed with a full-scale commercial demonstration fast reactor, is under
review. Any decision to proceed would be subject to a wide-ranging public
inquiry.
BNFL provides nuclear fuel services covering the design and development of
plant, procurement and processing of uranium, uranium enrichment, fuel
element fabrication, transport and reprocessing of spent fuel, and the manu¬
facture of specialised components and preparation of radioactive materials.
All of BNFL’s shares are held by the UKAEA. BNFL is organised into three
divisions covering uranium enrichment, based at Capenhurst (Cheshire);
fuel manufacture at Springfields (Lancashire); and reprocessing at Windscale
(Cumbria) where uranium, plutonium and radioactive wastes are separated
from irradiated fuel. BNFL’s head office is at Risley (Cheshire). It is engaged on
a large-scale investment programme costing about £2,000 million over the next
ten years. This includes the refurbishing of facilities for storing and reprocessing
spent fuel from Magnox power stations, the doubling of capacity of the centrifuge
enrichment plant at Capenhurst, the construction of a new thermal oxide
reprocessing plant (THORP) at Windscale which will deal with spent fuel
from Britain’s AGRs and will also reprocess spent fuel for a number of overseas
customers, and the construction of a demonstration plant for vitrifying radio¬
active waste (see p 181). In 1978 BNFL signed contracts worth nearly £500
million for the transport and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel on behalf of
ten Japanese electricity authorities.
The British system is the largest fully interconnected power network under
unified control in the western world. By 31st March 1979 the main transmission
lines of the CEGB totalled 14,082 circuit kilometres, of which 11,590 circuit
kilometres were at 400,000 volts and the remainder at 275,000 volts. Primary
distribution in England and Wales is at 132,000 volts, secondary distribution
at 33,000 volts, tertiary at 11,000 volts or below and general low voltage dis¬
tribution at 240 volts single phase. In Scotland there were 8,575 circuit kilo¬
metres of main transmission lines at the end of March 1979 of which 340
kilometres operated at 400,000 volts, 3,090 circuit kilometres at 275,000 volts
and the remainder at 132,000 volts. Primary distribution in Scotland is at
33,000 volts. The national grid in England and Wales is divided into seven
grid control areas and operations are co-ordinated by a National Control Centre
in London. The grid in Scotland is operated from the control centres at Pitlochry
(NSHEB) and at Kirkintilloch (SSEB).
Twin cross-Channel cables between Lydd and Boulogne are capable of
transmitting up to 160 MW. Experience with this relatively low-capacity link
demonstrated the benefits of the transfer of electricity between Britain and
France. The CEGB and Electricite de France are proposing a 2,000 MW cable
link between the two countries. The first 1,000 MW stage should be commis¬
sioned in 1983 and the second stage in 1984.

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Sales of electricity in 1978 amounted to 230,210 GWh. Industry took 39-5 per
cent of the total, domestic users 37 per cent and commercial and other users the
remainder. About one-fifth of domestic sales is for space heating, one-quarter
for water heating and one-tenth for cooking. Electricity is used in industry
almost entirely for motive power, melting, heating and lighting.
The electricity industry supplies 22-8 million consumers of whom 20*2
million are in England and Wales, i-6 million are supplied by the SSEB, 528,000
by the NSHEB and 517,000 by the Northern Ireland Electricity Service.
The Electricity Council, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Energy,
is responsible for drawing up a general programme of research comprising
direct research carried out by the Council and electricity boards supported
by co-operative research with selected industrial research associations and by
research contracts placed with universities and other organisations. Collaboration
on research between the supply industry and the plant manufacturers is co¬
ordinated by the Power Engineering Research Steering Committee. The
research establishments run by the CEGB comprise the Central Electricity
Research Laboratories at Leatherhead (Surrey), the Berkeley Nuclear Labora¬
tories in Gloucestershire and the Marchwood Engineering Laboratories on
Southampton Water. Research on distribution technology and electricity
utilisation is undertaken at the Electricity Council Research Centre at Capen-
hurst (Cheshire) and by the area boards.
Both Scottish electricity boards carry out research and experimental work
on their own and in co-operation with other electricity authorities.
The financial allocation for research on alternative sources of energy (sea-wave,
wind and tidal power for electricity generation, and solar and geothermal energy
for low-grade heat for domestic and industrial uses) was increased in 1978.
Alternative sources are not expected to change the pattern of energy supply in
the immediate future but their contribution could begin to increase significantly
towards the end of the century. In principle, the most promising long-term
alternative sources are wave power (because of Britain’s long coastline and
favourable geographical position) and solar heat.
Progress continues to be made in the Government’s wave power programme,
the aim of which is to develop the most appropriate devices to full-scale proto¬
types for sea trials. Development work is in progress on a number of types of
wave energy devices and includes one-tenth scale trials, full-scale component
development, test tank experiments and the study of problems common to all
the devices. In 1977 a four-year government-funded programme of research
and development on solar energy was inaugurated to identify its potential
contribution and to stimulate the development of cost-effective solar technologies,
particularly on water and space heating in houses (the areas of greatest potential
return).
Research on geothermal energy involves collection of data in the areas
considered to have the most suitable conditions and assessment of the markets
for the relatively low-grade heat produced. The Department of Energy and an
industrial consortium are working on a project to establish the technical and
economic potential for generating electricity from wind power. A detailed
design study for a large aerogenerator has been completed and the first stage in
the construction of a 3*7 MW prototype, covering detailed design and component
testing, is in progress. Studies have been made of a project for harnessing the
tides in the Severn Estuary, one of the world’s most suitable sites for tidal
power, and the Government has set up an independent Severn Barrage Commit-

tee to assist in reaching a decision on whether to proceed with such a project.
The Committee has commissioned a series of engineering and environmental
studies which will help it in making recommendations.
NON-FUEL MINERALS
Although much of Britain’s requirements of industrial raw materials is met
by imports, non-fuel minerals produced in Britain make an important con¬
tribution to the economy. Output of non-fuel minerals in 1977 totalled 312
million tonnes, valued at ^895 million. The total number of employees in the
industry was 43,900 in 1977. The geographical locations of some of the more
important minerals produced in Britain are shown on the maps on p 272.
The exploration for and exploitation of indigenous mineral resources to meet
the requirements of British industry are being encouraged by the Government
to minimise dependence on imports. Under the Mineral Exploration and
Investment Grants Act 1972 there is provision for financial assistance of up
to 35 per cent of the cost of searching for mineral deposits in Great Britain
and on the UKCS and evaluating them for commercial purposes. Minerals
included in the scheme are the ores of non-ferrous metals, fluorspar, barium
minerals and potash. By the end of March 1979, 49 companies had sought
assistance totalling £4-3 million in respect of 174 exploration projects, mainly
for non-ferrous metals. Work on 111 projects had been completed.
The Institute of Geological Sciences is carrying out for the Department of
Industry a programme aimed at identifying areas with the potential for economic
extraction of minerals. It also has a programme for the Department of the
Environment to assess resources of sand and gravel, and limestone.
In 1977 the production of metal from non-ferrous ores totalled 20,500 tonnes,
valued at £33 million. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Britain was
a leading world producer of copper, lead and tin, but subsequently overseas
competition led to the closure of many mines and falling production. In 1977
output of tin-in-ore was 4,200 tonnes, supplying 30 per cent of Britain’s tin
requirements. Small amounts of copper, zinc and silver were produced in associ¬
ation with the tin. Production of lead-in-ore, mainly from northern England, was
8,200 tonnes in 1977. Production of iron ore (3-7 million tonnes in 1977) has
fallen substantially in recent years. Britain’s only tungsten mine, near Penrith
(Cumbria), was reopened in 1977 and its capacity increased in 1978.
Britain is a major world producer of several important industrial minerals
including china clay, ball clay, fuller’s earth, salt, fluorspar and gypsum, and
also produces significant amounts of limestone, dolomite, chalk, industrial
sands and fireclay, mostly for consumption in Britain. China clay is used mainly
as a filler and coater for fine-quality paper, for making high-quality pottery
and also in the paint, rubber, plastics, insecticide and fertiliser industries. Most
of the output of china clay and about half the output of ball clay are exported.
Fuller’s earth is used in refining, as a bonding agent in foundry moulding
sands, for oil-well drilling muds and in civil engineering. Fireclay is used for
ceramic ware and refractory products.
Britain is self-sufficient in salt, output in 1977 being 8-2 million tonnes valued
at £43 million. In 1977 production of fluorspar for the chemical and metal¬
lurgical industries was 206,000 tonnes valued at £9 million and of gypsum
for the construction industry was 3-2 million tonnes worth £13 million.

Potash, used mainly for fertiliser manufacture, is being produced at Boulby
(Cleveland).
In 1977 production of limestone and dolomite totalled 86 million tonnes,
valued at £202 million, of which about 12 per cent was used in the iron and
steel, chemicals and other manufacturing industries. Chalk production in 1977
amounted to 16 million tonnes worth £19 million, of which some 1-7 million
tonnes were used in agriculture and industry. Industrial sands are used primarily
in the glassmaking and foundry industries; output in 1977 was 6 million tonnes.
Britain also produces small amounts of barytes, talc, diatomite, calcspar,
chert and flint, celestite and anhydrite.
Production of sand, gravel and crushed rock as aggregates for use in construction
constituted over half of Britain’s output of non-fuel minerals in 1977. Of the
total output of 107 million tonnes of common sand and gravel in 1977, worth
£250 million, 15*7 million tonnes were marine-dredged; Britain is the world’s
second largest producer of marine-dredged aggregates. Production of limestone
and dolomite for aggregates was 59 million tonnes in 1977. Output of sandstone
in 1977 was 12 million tonnes valued at £44 million and of igneous rock 36 million
tonnes valued at £130 million. Small amounts of limestone, sandstone, igneous
rock and slate are used as building stone and architectural facing material.
Production of limestone, chalk and clay as raw materials for cement manu¬
facture was 10 million, 13 million and 3 million tonnes respectively in 1977.
Some 14 million tonnes of clay and shale were produced for the manufacture
of bricks, pipes and tiles.
WATER
Britain’s water resources are, with progressive development, normally sufficient
for domestic and industrial requirements. Supplies are obtained partly from
surface sources such as mountain lakes, streams impounded in upland gathering
grounds and river intakes (one-third comes from rivers), and partly from under¬
ground sources by means of wells, adits and boreholes. Water consumption in
Britain continues to increase and in 1978 amounted to about 17-2 million
cubic metres a day (mcmd), comprising 16-6 mcmd of potable (drinkable)
water and o-6 mcmd of non-potable water. Average daily consumption per
head amounts to around 390 litres.
Under the Drought Act 1976, passed in the driest period of weather since
records began to be kept in 1727, water authorities in England and Wales
can limit or prohibit the use of water and, if necessary, restrict domestic water
supplies. Subsequent very heavy rainfall replenished surface and underground
sources by the spring of 1977, but the Act has been retained as providing
important reserve powers.
In general, householders pay for their domestic water supply, sewerage and
sewage disposal services through charges based on the rateable value of their
property, whereas industrial users are charged for their water supply according
to actual metered consumption.
Responsibility for promoting a national policy for water in England and Wales
rests with the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales and the
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food who, under the Water Act 1973,
are charged with responsibility for securing the conservation, augmentation,
distribution and proper use of water resources and the provision of water
supplies; the provision of sewerage and sewage disposal services; the restoration
274 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and maintenance of the wholesomeness of rivers and other inland waters; the
use of inland waters for navigation and recreation; the provision of land drainage;
and the protection and development of fisheries.
The National Water Council advises and assists ministers and water authorities.
It consists of a chairman appointed by the Secretaries of State, the chairmen
of the water authorities, and ten other members with special relevant knowledge,
of whom eight are appointed by the Secretaries of State and two by the Minister
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
Nine regional water authorities in England and the Welsh Water Authority in
Wales are responsible for the management of water services; the development
of water resources; water distribution and supply; the prevention of pollution
(see p 178); sewerage and sewage treatment; river management; land drainage;
sea defences; recreation; and freshwater fisheries. The board of each water
authority consists of a chairman and several members appointed by the Secretary
of State for the Environment (or, in the case of the Welsh Authority, by the
Secretary of State for Wales), a few members appointed by the Minister of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and a small majority, usually of only one,
of members appointed by the county and district councils within the area of
the authority. District councils usually also act as agents of water authorities
for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of public sewers in
their areas.
Statutory Water The Water Act 1973 provides for 29 existing statutory water companies to
Companies continue to supply water. They account for about one-quarter of total supplies.
Special arrangements govern the relationship of statutory water companies
to the water authorities.
Water Data Unit The principal functions of the Water Data Unit, part of the Department of
the Environment, are to advise on information required for water management
purposes, to ensure common standards and methods of data collection and to
publish such data on a national basis.
Supplies Some 13,600 million cubic metres of water were abstracted in England and
Wales in 1977. Public water supplies, reaching over 99 per cent of the popula¬
tion, accounted for 5,377 million cubic metres. The Central Electricity Generat¬
ing Board took 5,496 million cubic metres, primarily for cooling in connection
with electricity generation, other industry 2,610 million cubic metres and the
remainder was used in agriculture. Water authorities’ estimated revenue for
1979-80 is some £1,350 million. Capital expenditure in 1978-79 on water
supply, sewerage and sewage disposal is estimated at £460 million.
The provision of piped supplies for rural areas has been assisted by grants
under the Rural Water Supplies and Sewerage Acts 1944 to 1971. By March
1979 schemes costing some £133 million had been completed or were in progress
with the aid of grants under these Acts totalling £36-7 million.
Scotland In Scotland responsibility for public water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal
rests with the nine regional and three islands councils. Additionally the Central
Scotland Water Development Board, established under the Water (Scotland)
Act 1967, is primarily responsible for developing large water sources and
supplying water in bulk to its five constituent member authorities, the regional
councils in Central Scotland.

Scotland has a relative abundance of unpolluted water from upland sources.
Over 98 per cent of the population has a public water supply. About 850
million cubic metres of water were abstracted in Scotland in 1978 for public
water supplies. Capital expenditure in 1978-79 on water supply, sewerage and
sewage disposal is estimated at £62 million. The Secretary of State for Scotland
is responsible for the promotion of the conservation of water resources and of
the provision by water authorities of adequate water supplies, and also has a
duty to promote the cleanliness of rivers and other inland waters and the tidal
waters of Scotland.
The Water Service of the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment is
responsible for water supply and sewerage in Northern Ireland. The Department
is also responsible for the conservation, cleanliness and planned development of
Northern Ireland’s water resources. Northern Ireland has abundant potential
supplies of water for both domestic and industrial use. About 140 million gallons
(636 million litres) of water a day are supplied to over 90 per cent of the popula¬
tion. Capital expenditure on water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal works
during 1978 amounted to over £24 million.
The central research organisation for the water industry in Britain is the
Water Research Centre at Henley-on-Thames (Oxfordshire). The Centre’s
laboratory at Stevenage (Hertfordshire) is concerned with water pollution
including sewage and industrial waste water treatment, sludge treatment and
disposal, flow measurement, estuarine pollution and the development of
analytical methods and quality monitoring systems. Its laboratory at Med-
menham (Buckinghamshire) deals with water resources, water treatment,
health aspects of water quality, distribution and operational research.
The Hydraulics Research Station of the Department of the Environment
at Wallingford (Oxfordshire) predicts the performance of hydraulic civil
engineering works and their effects on the environment. Its work covers back¬
ground research and specific investigations into the flow of water over weirs
and spillways, the performance of flood prevention and sea defence works,
silting in rivers and estuaries, and harbour and offshore structure design.
The Institute of Hydrology of the Natural Environment Research Council
at Wallingford studies the whole hydrological cycle, and the Meteorological
Office is concerned with rainfall.

AGRICULTURE
Although Britain is a densely populated, industrialised country relying on
imports for nearly half its food supply, agriculture remains one of its most
important industries. It occupies 664,000 people or 2-7 per cent of the total
civilian working population, provides about 2-6 per cent of the gross domestic
product, and uses nearly 19 million of the 24 million hectares (47 million of the
60 million acres) of land. Exports in the agricultural sector (including machinery
and fertilisers) in 1978 amounted to nearly £3,700 million.
The soils of the country are varied (see p 4). Land used for farming is con¬
ventionally divided into land suitable for cultivation (crops and grass) and
rough grazing. In hill country the area of cultivated land is often small, but is
usually supplemented by grazing on a comparatively large area of hill land.
There are 12 million hectares (30 million acres) under crops and grass.
Cultivated land, rough grazing, woodland and other land on agricultural holdings
together represent 78 per cent of the land area. The rest is mountain and forest,
or put to urban and kindred uses. The area available for farming is gradually
decreasing to meet the needs of housing and industry; so far, the loss has been
offset by the increase in productivity on the land being farmed.
There are about 258,000 farming units in Britain. About half are very small
units, mostly farmed part-time, and accounting for less than 10 per cent of the
industry’s total output. Some 29,000 large farm businesses (capable of employ¬
ing four or more full-time workers), accounting for less than 10 per cent of the
number of holdings, produce about half of the industry’s total output. There
are about 44,000 medium-sized (two or three workers) and some 51,000 small full¬
time farm businesses.
Amalgamation of small farms into larger, more viable units has been en¬
couraged by successive governments. The average size of full-time holdings is
about 114 hectares (282 acres) of crops and grass and rough grazings.
In Great Britain more than half of the farms, and in Northern Ireland almost
all farms, are owner-occupied.
The increasing use of intensive methods of production both in crops and in
animal husbandry has led to greater specialisation. Three-fifths of the full-time
farms in Britain are devoted mainly to dairying or beef cattle and sheep; one in
six is a cropping farm and the remainder specialise in pigs, poultry or horticul¬
ture, or are mixed farms. The farms devoted primarily to arable crops are found
mainly in the eastern parts of England and Scotland. Large-scale potato and
vegetable production is characteristic of the Fens (in south Lincolnshire and

Cambridgeshire), the alluvial areas around the rivers Thames and Humber and
the peaty lands in south Lancashire. Early potatoes are an important crop in
south-west Wales and south-west England. Elsewhere, horticultural crops are
widely dispersed amongst agricultural crops.
Dairying occurs widely, but there are concentrations in south-west Scotland,
the western parts of England and south-west Wales, where the wetter climate
encourages the growth of good grass. Sheep and cattle are reared in the hill and
moorland areas of Scotland, Wales and northern and south-western England.
Beef fattening takes place partly in better grassland areas and partly in yards on
arable farms.
In Northern Ireland dairying is the main occupation on 42 per cent of the
full-time farms, while a further 36 per cent concentrate on beef and sheep
production. The remainder specialise in other products or are mixed farms.
Britain has one of the heaviest tractor densities in the world, with 504,000
tractors in 1978, or one to every 14 hectares (34 acres) of arable land. Power-
take-off implements now characterise arable farming; and some 58,000 combine
harvesters were in use in 1978. A wide variety of machines for harvesting and
preservation of grass are employed. Milking machines are installed on all except
the smallest farms.
Over 90 per cent of the farms in Britain have an electricity supply and
accompanying equipment. Through machinery syndicates farmers have the use
of expensive equipment whose capital cost is shared among members.
Britain produces just over half of its total food requirements. About two-thirds
of the country’s indigenous-type food supplies are home grown. Home pro¬
duction of the principal foods is shown as a percentage by weight of total supplies
(that is, output plus imports less exports) in Table 20.

Britain has a long tradition of efficient farming based on technological progress
and research. Modern farming methods were first pioneered in Britain as early
as the eighteenth century. The rapid growth of productivity in recent years is due
largely to research and advice, much of which is undertaken by the Government.
The expansion in production and in yield per hectare which has taken place
in the last decade despite falling manpower is summarised in Table 21 which
also shows the effect of the drought during 1976. There has been a substantial
growth in the number of beef cattle and a less marked increase in the number
of dairy cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. Total cereal production has increased
by about a quarter. Potato production is particularly susceptible to weather
conditions but, on average, adequate supplies are maintained from a reduced
area. Increases in output of meat and milk have been associated with higher

consumption of feedings tuffs, mostly from home resources. In 1978 some 5-5
million tonnes of concentrated feeds were imported; the level of imports
depends, however, on the size of the home crop of cereals.
The index of agricultural net product at constant prices (1975 = 100), which
stood at 100 in 1968, is estimated to have risen to 122 in 1978. (The relatively
low level in 1975, the base year, was due to unfavourable weather; the index
for the years 1971-74 ranged between m and 114.)

Wheat is grown mainly in the eastern half of England. About one-half of the
wheat crop is normally used for flour milling, the remainder going mainly for
animal feed.
Since i960 the area under barley has increased by about 75 per cent. In
recent years, between 15 and 23 per cent of the crop has been used for malting
and distilling; most of the remainder is used as feed for livestock.
The universal use of combine harvesters has necessitated the installation of
drying and storage facilities on many farms. Such equipment is also often used
on a co-operative basis.
The total area of fodder crops has fallen since i960 because in many cases
farmers can provide winter feed more economically by increased grass production
and improved methods of conservation. The principal fodder crops are turnips,
swedes and kale in England, and turnips and swedes in Scotland. Their principal
use is to supplement conserved grass (mainly hay and silage) for winter feeding.
Sugar from home-grown sugar beet provides about 40 per cent of British
requirements. The British Sugar Corporation Ltd is the only processor of
sugar beet in Britain and enters into contracts with farmers to buy the beet they
will grow the following year.
Most of the other sugar used in Britain is refined from raw sugar imported
from developing countries under the Lome Convention (see p 73).
Harvesting of early potatoes starts at the end of May, and the lifting of main-
crop varieties usually begins in September. Seed potato production for Britain
and for export is chiefly centred in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Hops, grown for the brewing industry, occupy only about 6,000 hectares
(14,000 acres) but have a very high yield per hectare and value by weight.
The British climate suits grassland farming. Grass supplies about 80 per cent
of feed requirements of cattle and sheep (in terms of energy); its production
has been enhanced over recent years by the development and application of
new techniques, notably the increased use of fertilisers, new methods of grazing
control, improved herbage conservation for winter feed and irrigation. Rough
grazings are used for extensively grazed livestock, producing young animals for
fattening elsewhere.
A great number of specialised breeds of livestock have been developed over
the centuries in Britain. Substantial sales of animals and semen are made to
overseas buyers to replenish and improve their herds and flocks. In recent
years farmers have introduced a number of breeds from the continent of Europe.
Artificial insemination plays an important part in cattle breeding, about
80 per cent of the dairy herd in England, Scotland and Wales being bred in
this way.
In England, Scotland and Wales more milk goes for liquid consumption than
for manufacture, but in Northern Ireland the greater part of the milk is used
for manufactured products. Average consumption of liquid milk per head in
1978 was estimated at about 2-56 litres (4*51 pints) a week.
Average yields per dairy cow have increased during the last decade by about a
quarter and were some 4,620 litres (1,016 gallons) in 1978. Freedom from tuber¬
culosis has reduced herd wastage, and a campaign to eradicate brucellosis is well

advanced. Milk production has been stimulated by advances in grassland
management, new methods of grass conservation and programmes of controlled
use of concentrated feedingstuifs.
The average size of dairy herds has also been increasing over the years and in
1978 was some 46 cows a herd, the largest in the European Community.
About two-thirds of home-fed beef production derives from the national dairy
herd, in which the Friesian breed is predominant. While Friesians are satis¬
factory dual-purpose cattle, many dairy cows are crossed with beef bulls for
beef production. Recent years have seen the extensive introduction of beef
breeds from continental Europe. The hill and upland areas are important in the
production of store cattle which are moved for fattening to lowland pastures
where cattle imported from the Irish Republic are also fattened.
Britain has a long tradition of sheep production, with more than 40 breeds
and many crosses between those breeds. Research has provided vaccine and sera
protection against nearly all the epidemic diseases.
Ewes and lambs are brought every autumn from the hill areas, where winters
are usually severe, to join the lowland flocks, usually in two stages: first, to
intermediate altitudes, for mating with rams of a larger and more rapidly
maturing breed; then, the cross-bred progeny pass on to the milder lowland
conditions, where they become crossed again with Down rams for fat lamb
production. The hill breeds bring in hardiness, and the lowland sires fecundity
and early maturity. Store and fat lamb production provides the main source of
income for sheep farmers but wool is also important, especially to farmers in
hill areas.
Pigs Pig production is carried on in most areas but is particularly important in eastern
and southern England and in Northern Ireland. There is an increasing con¬
centration into specialist units and larger herds. Artificial insemination is avail¬
able nationally. About a third of the pigmeat is used for bacon, a third for pork
and a third for processing into sausages and other products.
Poultry The British poultry industry has expanded rapidly in recent years, aided by
the application of improved husbandry and management techniques in intensive
production units and by genetic improvements in stock. Some 85 per cent of the
laying birds on farms are in flocks of 5,000 or more, while about 74 per cent of
the broilers are in flocks of 50,000 or more. The average yield of eggs per bird
is about 240 a year. Nearly all eggs and poultry meat consumed in Britain are
home-produced.
Horticultural The horticultural industry produces a wide variety of fruit, vegetables and
Industry flowers, which are worth about 10 per cent of the total value of agricultural
output; in 1978 their value was estimated at £709 million.
In 1978 the land on which these crops were grown amounted to nearly
289,000 hectares (714,000 acres), about 2-4 per cent of the land used for crops
and grass. Fruit accounted for about 65,000 hectares (161,000 acres), vegetables,
excluding potatoes, for about 211,000 hectares (521,000 acres) and flowers, bulbs
and nursery stock for about 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres). Crops under glass,
plastic and in sheds, including mushrooms, occupied about 2,000 hectares
(4,900 acres).
Horticultural crops are largely grown on specialised holdings, but some,
particularly vegetables for processing, are produced on arable farms. Most

horticultural enterprises are increasing output per unit area with the help of
improved planting material, new techniques of cultivation and environmental
control, and the widespread use of machinery.
Field vegetables, with approximately 74 per cent of the horticultural output, are
the most important horticultural sector. They are widely spread over the
country, with the most intensive concentrations in the Thames Valley and
Hereford and Worcester and extensive production in the eastern counties.
Some 38 per cent are destined for processing.
Dessert apples are the most important fruit crop. Britain is one of the few
countries which grow varieties of apples especially suitable for cooking; these
are produced in England and Northern Ireland. Some high-quality pears are
produced in the east and south-east of England. Cherries and plums are grown
in Kent, and plums also in the Vale of Evesham and parts of East Anglia. Around
Perth in Scotland is the largest concentration of raspberry plantations in the
world.
Strawberries are the most widely grown soft fruit, with early production in
the south and west of England. Blackcurrants are also widely grown, mainly for
the manufacture of soft drinks and of flavouring for confectionery. Other fruits
include gooseberries, red and white currants, loganberries and blackberries.
Much of the glasshouse sector of the horticultural industry has been re-equipped
since the mid-1960s with the aid of government grants. Widespread use is made
of units with automatic control of heating and ventilation, semi-automatic
control of watering and carbon-dioxide enrichment of the atmosphere. Tomatoes
form the most important glasshouse crop, and, together with lettuce and cucum¬
bers, represent some 95 per cent of the total value of glasshouse vegetable output.
Mushrooms are grown in specially constructed sheds in most parts of Britain,
with concentration in south-eastern and northern England.
Flowers and bulbs occupied some 5,000 hectares (12,000 acres) and hardy
nursery stock some 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) in June 1978.
Agricultural products are marketed mainly through private trade channels, but
also through producers’ co-operatives and marketing boards. Marketing boards
are essentially producers’ organisations with certain statutory powers to regulate
the marketing of particular products. A scheme to establish a marketing board
must be approved by Parliament and (except in the case of Northern Ireland
boards) by a majority of the producers of the product concerned. The majority
of the members of each board are elected by registered producers; a small
minority of independent members are appointed by agricultural ministers.
Various safeguards exist to protect the public interest generally, including the
interests of individual producers and consumers. Most of the marketing boards
are either buyers from all registered producers or control all contracts between
producers and first buyers. This applies to the marketing boards for milk, wool,
hops and (in Northern Ireland) pigs and seed potatoes. The Potato Marketing
Board, on the other hand, maintains only a broad control over marketing
conditions, leaving producers free to deal individually with buyers. The Milk
Marketing Boards are formally recognised as part of the European Community
milk regime.
For certain other commodities there are broadly based organisations represent¬
ing producer, distributor and independent interests.

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The object of the Home-Grown Cereals Authority is to improve the marketing
of home-grown cereals. It provides a market intelligence service and promotes
research and development. It also acts as agent for the Intervention Board for
Agricultural Produce (see p 283) with regard to cereals and oilseed rape.
The Meat and Livestock Commission’s wide range of functions includes the
promotion and improvement of many activities concerning livestock and live¬
stock products in Great Britain. In Northern Ireland, the Livestock Marketing
Commission promotes better organisation, development and marketing in the
livestock and livestock products industry. The Eggs Authority has the general
duty of improving the marketing of eggs.
Under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Community (see
p 283) a wide range of horticultural produce (both home-grown and imported)
is subject to common quality standards.
Agricultural co-operatives are concerned with marketing, production, services,
and with supply of farmers’ requirements. There are, in addition, pest control
societies and machinery syndicates.
The Government provides grants for co-operative production and marketing
of agricultural and horticultural produce on the recommendation of the Central
Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation, a statutory body which
encourages co-operation among farmers and growers throughout Britain.
The aggregate net income of farmers in 1978 is estimated at £1,256 million
(excluding stock appreciation). Of the total farm output, estimated at £7,064
million in 1978, about two-thirds was in the form of livestock and livestock
products.
Feedingstuffs amount to approximately one-third of agriculture’s total cost,
and wages and machinery (including depreciation) to about one-fifth each. In
recent years agricultural workers’ earnings have risen considerably in real terms,
but this has been offset by the manpower economies made possible by increasing
mechanisation and larger farms. Labour productivity rose by nearly 4-5 per cent
a year between 1968 and 1978.
It is estimated that £335 million was added to the value of buildings and works
and £650 million was invested in new plant, machinery and vehicles in 1978.
Most of the capital for investment is generated from within the farm business.
Banks are the main source of short- and medium-term credit. Mortgage loans
form the chief source of long-term credit and are provided by specialised
financial institutions (see p 284) and private sources.
In 1977-78 the average net income (excluding stock appreciation of breeding
livestock) for farms of different types in England and Wales was generally
within the range of £60 to £170 per hectare (£24 to £69 per acre) with the
exception of pig and poultry farms and horticultural holdings, which are more
intensive in their use of land.
Responsibility for carrying out the Government’s agricultural policy is vested in
the agricultural ministers: the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in
England; and the respective Secretaries of State in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The day-to-day work is carried out by the agricultural departments:
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland, the Welsh Office Agriculture Department, and the
Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture.

Market arrangements under the Common Agricultural Policy of the European
Community are administered by the Intervention Board for Agricultural
Produce, which is responsible to the agricultural ministers.
As a member State of the European Community, Britain applies the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) to its agriculture. With the exception of a few com¬
modities (see below), all national decisions on measures of farm price support
have been replaced by decisions at Community level; the cost of such support
is met wholly by the Community. The position on other farm grants and sub¬
sidies varies, but national governments must not operate measures which would
distort competition. In some cases Community rules lay down broad guidelines
within which national governments retain considerable discretion; while certain
schemes are laid down in detail at Community level. In the latter case the
Community generally makes some contribution to the cost.
Under the CAP, producers’ returns for most of the main commodities are
supported by a combination of charges on imports from outside the Com¬
munity and internal support prices which are maintained by intervention buying
when necessary. In addition, export refunds enable Community exporters to
sell on world markets when world prices are below Community price levels.
I here is also provision for certain direct payments to producers, including beef
premiums. CAP support price levels, as well as rates of levy and subsidy, are
set in units of account and are converted into the currencies of the member
States at fixed rates of exchange (commonly called ‘green rates’) which do not
vary automatically in line with changes in real exchange rates. The green rates
can thus be out of line with the market rate of exchange between each currency
and the unit of account, giving rise to different real support price levels in the
different member States. Monetary compensatory amounts, based on the per¬
centage difference between the green and market rates of each currency, are
applied to prevent distortions in trade. They operate as import subsidies and
export levies for countries whose currencies’ market rates are below the green
rates, and as import levies and export subsidies in the opposite case.
The level of support prices under the CAP is reviewed by the Community
each year, and the results of the British annual review (see p 284) help to shape
the Government’s approach to the negotiations on CAP support. The Govern¬
ment is seeking to make significant improvements in the operation of the CAP;
it believes that support prices should be set at levels which do not produce
surpluses but offer security to reasonably efficient producers. The storage and
disposal of the surpluses adds significantly to the Community’s budget expendi¬
ture (see p 74). The Government aims in particular at the removal of the major
structural surpluses of dairy products and sugar. In 1979, Britain strongly
supported the Community’s decision to freeze the support price for milk.
Some of the grants paid to farmers under the schemes mentioned on p 284
also come within the scope of the CAP.
In the light of the annual review, agricultural ministers determine guaranteed
prices for the coming year for certain commodities not covered by the CAP
(potatoes, sheep, and wool).
Sheep producers receive guarantee payments if the average market prices
fall below the guaranteed levels. For wool and (except in Northern Ireland) for
potatoes, the Government operates the guarantees through the appropriate
marketing boards (see p 28). The Potato Marketing Board may, with govern¬
ment agreement, undertake support buying of any surplus, re-selling as much as

possible for stockfeed. In Northern Ireland, the potato guarantee is operated by
the Department of Agriculture.
In addition to market support under the CAP and the British guaranteed prices,
producers receive support through certain capital and production grants, some
of them based on Community decisions. The grants include, for example, those
paid under the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme (towards the
implementation of farmers’ development plans) and under the Farm Capital
Grant Scheme and Horticulture Capital Grant Scheme (towards the cost of
capital investment).
There is also a Payments to Outgoers Scheme designed to assist in the im¬
provement of farm structure and a Milk Non-Marketing and Conversion
Scheme under which grants are available to farmers who cease production of
milk for sale, with advantageous rates if they convert to beef or sheep production.
Special financial assistance is available under Community and national arrange¬
ments for farmers in less favoured (hill) areas. Community assistance may also
be made available for improvements to facilities for the marketing and processing
of agricultural products. There are also grants for co-operatives (see p 282).
Each year the agricultural ministers review the economic condition and prospects
of the industry in consultation with representatives of producers. The con¬
clusions drawn from the review contribute, together with views expressed on
behalf of agricultural workers, landowners, consumers and the food industry,
to the formulation of the Government’s position in the Community negotiations
on the development of agricultural policy and to the decisions on matters remain¬
ing within national competence.
Within the National Economic Development Council (see p 198) there is a
committee for agriculture, comprising representatives of farmers, workers and
landowners, as well as official and independent members.
Expenditure in 1978-79 on price guarantees, grants and subsidies and on CAP
market regulation is estimated at about £300 million and £293 million respectively,
of which an estimated £290 million was reimbursed from the Community budget.
In England and Wales, mortgage loans for the purchase or improvement of
agricultural land and buildings are available from the Agricultural Mortgage
Corporation Ltd, a company which has some government financial backing
but raises its funds on the London capital market. The Scottish Agricultural
Securities Corporation Ltd fulfils a similar role in Scotland.
In Northern Ireland loans are available to farmers from the Agricultural
Loans Fund, administered by the Department of Agriculture and financed out
of public funds.
In any part of Britain, the Agricultural Credit Corporation Ltd may provide
guarantees for bank loans. The Corporation may receive government help if
necessary.
In England and Wales scientific, technological and management advice and
services are available through the Agricultural Development and Advisory
Service (ADAS) which operates mainly from the regional and divisional offices
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and from the divisional
offices of the Welsh Office Agriculture Department. The Service also helps to
identify problems requiring investigation and research, suggests priorities for
such work, and, where appropriate, contributes to possible solutions. ADAS

provides free impartial advice to landowners, farmers and growers, but charges
are made for certain services.
In Scotland the agricultural advisory service is provided by the three regional
independent colleges of agriculture financed almost entirely by public funds.
Advisory work in Northern Ireland is under the direction of the Department
of Agriculture. The resources of the agricultural colleges, the research centres and
the specialist divisions of the Department are available to the advisory service.
Local authorities provide about 8,200 smallholdings in England and about
1,000 in Wales. In England about 800 lettable holdings are provided by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Minister and local authorities
may make loans of up to 75 per cent of required working capital to their small¬
holding tenants.
Land settlement in Scotland has always been carried out by the central
Government, which owns and maintains about 165,000 hectares (408,000 acres)
of land settlement estates, comprising some 2,800 crofts and holdings.
Within the crofting areas of Scotland (situated in Strathclyde, Highland,
Western Isles, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands) much of the land is held
by crofters, that is, tenants whose holdings are generally either rented at a cost
of not more than j£ioo a year or have an area not exceeding 30 hectares (75
acres). Crofting is administered by the Crofters Commission, and benefits from
government grants for land improvement and some other agricultural work.
A code of landlord-tenant relationships has been written into legislation in
order to protect the respective interests of landlords and tenants and to eliminate
uncertainty as to their rights and obligations.
Most agricultural tenants in Great Britain have the right to contest a notice
to quit, which then becomes inoperative unless the landlord obtains consent to
its operation from an independent body (in England and Wales the Agricultural
Land Tribunal and in Scotland the Scottish Land Court).
There is a code of compensation to which the tenant is entitled on termination
of the tenancy. Rent is a matter for negotiation between landlord and tenant and
may be varied by agreement or, failing agreement, by arbitration.
There are provisions for succession of a close relative on the death of a tenant
farmer.
The Agricultural Branch of the Health and Safety Commission (see p 333) is
responsible for the enforcement of regulations relating to the health and safety
of workers in agriculture. The regulations cover such matters as the guarding
of field and stationary machinery, farm safety, the fitting of safety cabs to
tractors, and the use of agricultural chemicals. The Commission’s Agriculture
Industry Advisory Committee assists it in resolving problems of health and
safety in agriculture, including horticulture and forestry.
Ten regional water authorities are responsible for land drainage (including
flood prevention) in England and Wales. Most of the funds needed by water
authorities are obtained from local authorities, but the Government pays grants
towards the cost of improvement schemes. In some low-lying areas where there
are special local problems of land drainage, internal drainage boards carry out
work for the special benefit and protection of their districts. The boards finance
their work from drainage rates levied on owners and occupiers, and from govern¬
ment grants payable on improvement works.
286
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Local authorities in England and Wales also have general land drainage
powers and may receive government grants towards the cost of improvement
works.
In Scotland local authorities deal with coast protection and urban land flood
prevention, while arterial drainage and agricultural land flood prevention are
the owners’ responsibility. Grants are available to owners or occupiers of
agricultural land who carry out arterial drainage work.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture is the drainage authority.
CONTROL OF
DISEASES AND
PESTS
Animals
Responsibility for the Government’s policy on animal health matters in Great
Britain rests with the agricultural ministers. Professional advice and action
on the control of animal disease and the welfare of farm livestock in accordance
with the Government’s policy is the responsibility of the Veterinary Service of
the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service. The day-to-day work of
treating animal disease is the responsibility of the practising veterinary surgeon.
The Veterinary Service has extensive laboratory facilities. In England and
Wales 24 investigation centres perform work requiring specialist knowledge and
give advice on disease problems to private practitioners. In Scotland a similar
service is provided by the investigation centres of the three regional agricultural
colleges.
Strict veterinary controls are exercised on the import of all animals, meat and
meat products, live poultry and other captive birds, and poultry meat, so as to
prevent the introduction of animal or poultry diseases into Great Britain.
Foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever have been eradicated by a slaughter
policy. Swine vesicular disease is combated by a slaughter policy backed up
by control of pig movements and of swill feeding. Rigorous measures are being
taken to eradicate sheep scab. Enzootic bovine leukosis was found for the first
time in 1978; a survey was carried out to determine the extent of the problem,
and a voluntary scheme for the establishment of enzootic bovine leukosis-free
herds in Great Britain is under consideration. The incidence of bovine tuberculo¬
sis is now very low; cattle (except for certain categories) are tested at regular
intervals and reactors to the test are slaughtered; compensation is paid to the
owners. Voluntary schemes for the eradication of brucellosis have been in opera¬
tion since 1967; compulsory eradication on an area basis began in 1972. By
January 1979, 88 per cent of all herds in Great Britain were declared free of the
disease, many areas being completely free. Newcastle disease (fowl pest) has
declined to a low level due to the operation of a vaccination policy.
As a result of these measures, Great Britain is free from many serious animal
diseases. Non-farm animals are subject to import licence and six months’
quarantine as a precaution against the introduction of rabies, and there are
severe penalties for those breaking the law. There has been no case of rabies in
the Britsh Isles since 1970.
In Northern Ireland the legislation on the control of diseases is administered
by the Department of Agriculture, which has its own veterinary service supple¬
mented by a central veterinary laboratory. The Department’s strict animal
health control policies and the geographical situation have kept Northern Ireland
free from the major animal diseases, including rabies and swine vesicular disease.
A brucellosis eradication scheme has been successfully carried out and in 1971
Northern Ireland was declared brucellosis-free.
Plants
The plant health services, operated by the agricultural departments, are respon¬
sible for statutory controls designed to limit the spread of plant pests and diseases
present in Britain and prevent the introduction of new ones from abroad. They

also issue the health certificates required by other countries to accompany
plant material imported from Britain. Certification schemes are operated to
encourage the development of healthy, vigorous and true-to-type planting stocks.
The laboratory at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and the Agricultural Scientific
Services Station, East Craigs, Edinburgh, provide advice on which these controls
and schemes are based.
The central laboratories of the Agricultural Advisory and Development Service’s
Agricultural Science Service (at Slough in Berkshire, Tolworth in Greater
London, and Worplesdon in Surrey) and the Agricultural Scientific Services of
the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland undertake research
and provide advice on harmful mammals and birds and on insects, mites and
moulds associated with grain and other stored food products.
Safeguards against the dangers which could arise from uncontrolled use of
pesticides have been devised and are operating successfully. Products must be
cleared for safety under the Pesticides Safety Precautions Scheme (see p 178),
and may be submitted through the Agricultural Chemicals Approval Scheme for
efficacy approval.
The Medicines Act 1968 provides through a system of licensing for the control
of the manufacture, sale and supply of veterinary medicinal products (including
those used in animal feedingstuffs). The agricultural ministers issue licences on
the advice of expert committees. (For other provisions of the Act see p 131.)
An outline of the organisation of British agricultural research and development,
including that carried out by the Agricultural Research Council and the univer¬
sities, is given in chapter 20. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
carries out research and development at its own laboratories and on the 22
experimental husbandry farms and horticulture stations operated by the
Agricultural Development and Advisory Service, and commissions work from
the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council
and outside research organisations. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland carries out research and development at its own laboratories, and
commissions the work of eight agricultural research institutes. The Depart¬
ment also commissions research and development work from the three colleges
which provide the advisory service (see p 285). In England and Wales, research
in agricultural economics is undertaken by 12 university departments of agricul¬
tural economics. In Scotland, agricultural economists are on the staff of the
three regional agricultural colleges and the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries. At the University of Reading, the Centre for Agricultural Strategy
provides an assessment of British agriculture with a view to developing long-term
strategies.
In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture has nine research divisions.
Fifteen British universities provide degree and postgraduate courses in agriculture
or agricultural sciences. The National College of Agricultural Engineering at
Silsoe offers degree and postgraduate courses. Sandwich courses leading to a
Higher National Diploma are available at eight agricultural colleges in England
and Wales and there are nearly 50 local authority and other agricultural colleges
providing full-time courses on different aspects of agriculture, horticulture,
forestry and farm management. A centre for European agricultural studies is
based at London University’s Wye College at Ashford, Kent.

In Scotland the three agricultural colleges which have the advisory and
development functions are also teaching establishments. They mainly provide
sandwich courses leading to Higher and Ordinary National Diplomas, post¬
diploma courses and certain short courses. In Northern Ireland degree courses
in agriculture and food science are provided at Queen’s University, Belfast.
Courses below this level are provided at three residential colleges run by the
Department of Agriculture.
Local education authorities throughout Britain provide full-time and part-
time courses for farmers, farm workers and horticulturists, as well as an advisory
service for domestic producers.
In Great Britain the Agricultural Training Board provides a training advisory
service, organises training courses and pays training grants. In Northern Ireland
training courses are organised by the Department of Agriculture.
FISHERIES
The industry catches demersal fish (caught on or near the bottom of the sea),
pelagic fish (caught nearer the surface) and shellfish. Demersal fish accounts for
about 46 per cent (by weight) of the total catch; the catches of pelagic fish
comprise over 47 per cent and the shellfish 7 per cent of the catch. The principal
demersal fish (in terms of value) are cod, haddock, plaice and whiting. The most
important pelagic species is mackerel. Shellfish include Crustacea (such as
lobsters and crabs) and molluscs (such as mussels and oysters).
Since 1977 Britain’s fishery limits have extended to 200 miles (or, where the
distance between two countries’ coasts is less than 400 miles, up to the line
half-way between the two countries). This followed the European Community
member States’ agreement to adopt such limits jointly, after similar extensions,
with resulting restrictions on Community vessels, had been announced by many
maritime nations.
Community countries, and non-Community countries having temporary
agreements with the Community, have the right to fish up to Britain’s 12-mile
limit. Restrictions are placed on fishing by Community countries in certain areas of
Britain’s 6 to 12-mile zone, and the only non-Community country which may fish
in this zone is Norway, which has very restricted rights in some areas off the Scot¬
tish coast. No foreign vessels are permitted to fish within Britain’s 6-mile limit.
The Community has negotiated exchanges of fishing rights within member
States’ waters for reciprocal rights within the waters of several non-member
countries; for 1979, reciprocal quotas have been agreed with Norway and the Faroe
Islands, whose waters are of the greatest interest to British fishermen, and also
with Sweden. Quotas have also been granted to the Community by Canada and
the United States, and by the Community to Spain. Framework agreements,
intended to establish the general lines of fishery relations between the Com¬
munity and non-Community countries, have been negotiated, but not finally
concluded, with Canada, the Faroes, Finland, Norway, Senegal, Spain and
Sweden, and an agreement has been concluded with the United States. British
fishermen have been excluded from the traditionally important grounds off
Iceland; reciprocal fishing with the Soviet Union and fishing by certain other
East European States in member States’ waters have been terminated.
With the extension of fishery limits to 200 miles, it will be necessary to revise
the Community fisheries’ internal regime to allow for controlled Community

fishing in the greatly extended area. Britain has a particularly strong interest
in such control, since about 60 per cent of the total catch within the new limits
is taken in British waters, while the loss of fishing opportunities in distant
waters (such as Iceland) has reduced the British industry’s total catch more
than that of other Community States. As a result, the British fishing industry
is looking for adequate access preferences and a substantial share of the quotas
proposed for the fish stocks around Britain’s coasts.
There is also a need for effective and enforceable conservation measures
within the waters of member States. The Government is continuing to work
towards a common fisheries policy which meets these needs. However, in the
absence of an agreed Community policy, the Government has introduced a
number of conservation measures where these have proved necessary. Rules
which would set common standards of enforcement and give member States
responsibility for operating them in their own waters would form another
essential part of a comprehensive revised internal regime.
The Community’s fishing industry is also subject to a common organisation of
the market and to a common structural policy which has not yet been fully
developed. The common organisation of the market aims at assisting in the
adaptation of supplies to marketing requirements, while ensuring, as far as
possible, a reasonable return to producers, by means of the establishment of a
common grading and price system, and common rules on competition. Provision
is also made for the protection of the Community market against disruption by
imports from non-member countries. The responsibility for market organisation
is placed largely in the hands of the industry itself through producers’ organisa¬
tions. Intra-Community fish trade is free and there is a common external
tariff.
The common structural policy aims at promoting the rational development
of the fishing industry and at ensuring an equitable standard of living for those
dependent on fishing. In pursuit of these aims it envisages common measures
for financing structural improvement, but to date little progress has been made
towards agreeing these measures.
The principal fishing ports in England and Wales are Hull, Grimsby, Fleetwood,
North Shields, Lowestoft, Plymouth, Brixham, Falmouth, Newlyn and Milford
Haven. In Scotland the chief ports are Aberdeen, Peterhead, Fraserburgh,
Lerwick, Ullapool, Mallaig, Ayr and Stornoway. In Northern Ireland the main
fishing ports are Kilkeel, Portavogie and Ardglass.
In the British fishing industry in 1978 there were some 16,400 fishermen in
regular employment and about 5,700 occasionally employed; about 48 per cent
of the former and 24 per cent of the latter were based on Scottish ports. In
Northern Ireland there are about 540 full-time fishermen and about 285 part-
time. It is estimated that for every fisherman there are between three and five
jobs in associated trades.
Fishing is an important source of employment and income in certain areas,
in many of which unemployment is well above the national average. Maintenance
of fishing opportunities, through conservation of stocks and through the pre¬
servation of British fishermen’s access to their traditional grounds, is thus vital
to Britain.
At the end of 1978 the deep-sea fleet comprised some 300 vessels; of these,
distant-water trawlers, which operate mainly from Hull and Grimsby, numbered
290

78. They are 140 feet (42-7 metres) and over in length and are of two types,
the older, traditional side trawlers, which can only preserve their catches on
ice, and modern stern freezer/factory trawlers (34 in number). Traditionally all
have fished in the north-east Arctic and still do within the constraints of quota
agreements which have reduced activity. Some side trawlers have been diverted
to home waters hitherto fished by smaller vessels. Stern trawlers also fish the
north-east Arctic but have recently been successful in mackerel fishing, mainly
off south-west England. Middle-water trawlers between no and 140 feet in
length (33'5-42'7 metres) have also had to diversify their activity into northern
North Sea grounds consequent upon reduced quota allocations off the Faroes.
The inshore group consists of some 2,000 vessels of over 40 feet (12-2 metres)
and about 4,700 smaller vessels.
In 1978, landings of all types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by British
fishing vessels totalled 957,000 tonnes valued at £255 million. Cod accounted
for 30 per cent of the total value of demersal and pelagic fish landed by British
vessels; haddock (18 per cent), mackerel (14 per cent), and plaice (7 per cent)
were the other most important sources of earnings to the industry.
Increasing attention is being paid to fish and shellfish farming and the farming
of some species of sea fish is being developed.
Experiments are being carried out in the catching and processing, for human
consumption and fish meal (for animal feed), of previously under-exploited
species of fish (for example, blue whiting and horse mackerel) of which large
stocks are known to exist in the sea adjacent to the British Isles.
Home production of fish meal in 1978 was about 65,800 tonnes. Fish oil
production was about 18,200 tonnes.
Imports of all fresh, frozen and cured fish and shellfish totalled 290,000 tonnes
valued at ^154 million. Imports of fish meal amounted to 192,000 tonnes, worth
£47 million, and those of fish oils to 217,000 tonnes, worth £53 million.
Exports and re-exports of fish and fish products amounted to 358,000 tonnes
and were valued at just under £144 million.
Total fish consumption was running at a level of approximately 13-5 lb (6 kg)
a head in 1978. Home production provided about 75 per cent of supplies.
The most valuable freshwater fish are salmon and sea-trout. Sea fishing for
salmon is prohibited in a wide area around the British Isles outside the 12-mile
zone. Within the zone, drift netting and certain other methods are prohibited
off the coast of Scotland but are permitted under licence off England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, salmon fishing is a private right. In England
and Wales, water authority licences are required for coastal and estuary netting.
The landed value of the salmon catch in 1978 was approximately £1,640,000 in
England and Wales, about £4,500,000 in Scotland, and some £520,000 in
Northern Ireland. Eels worth about £1,220,000 were caught in Northern Ireland.
Fish is distributed through wholesalers located at the ports, who buy fish at
quayside auctions and sell to inland wholesalers or retailers, and through
processors who also buy at auctions and sometimes under contract arrangements
with the owners of fishing vessels, particularly for fish frozen at sea.
The government departments mainly responsible for the administration of
legislation concerning the fishing industry and for fisheries research are the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland, the Welsh Office Agriculture Department and the

The Herring Industry Board was set up to reorganise, develop and regulate
the herring industry. In England, Scotland and Wales, the Board administers the
government grant and loan schemes which provide for assistance towards the
purchase of new fishing vessels and the improvement of existing vessels.
The function of the White Fish Authority is to reorganise, develop and regulate
the British white fish industry in all its aspects from catchers to retailers, and
to keep under review matters related to the industry. In England, Scotland and
Wales the Authority administers grant and loan schemes providing financial
assistance to the industry for the purchase of new fishing vessels, vessel improve¬
ments, provision and improvement of processing plants, cold stores and ice
plants, and towards the formation of fishermen’s co-operatives. Other duties
include research and development, training, dissemination of information, publi¬
city and promotion, and the provision of consultancy services, including services
to developing countries.
The Herring Industry Board and the White Fish Authority jointly operate a
unified administration.
The Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland operates grant and loan
schemes for the purchasing of new fishing vessels and engines and the improve¬
ment of existing vessels, and for processors, co-operatives and fish farmers.
FORESTRY
The estimated total area of woodland in Britain is 2-061 million hectares (5-092
million acres), or about 8-5 per cent of the total land area; 41 per cent of the
area is in England, 45 per cent in Scotland, n per cent in Wales and the
remainder in- Northern Ireland.
The area of productive forest in Great Britain managed by the Forestry
Commission, at 856,000 hectares (2-11 million acres), constitutes 50 per cent
of this category. The annual rate of productive forest expansion is currently
14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) by the Commission mainly in Scotland, and some
6,600 hectares (16,300 acres) by private woodland owners. The Commission’s
programme includes considerable planting in upland areas, and consists mainly
of conifers because of the difficult site conditions encountered.
Total employment in state and private forests in Great Britain was estimated
at 20,700 in 1978.
Except for the periods of the two world wars, when felling was abnormally
heavy, home woodlands have until recent years made only a limited contribution
to the nation’s consumption of wood and wood products, as less than half of the
Commission’s woodlands are yet in production. Britain imports 92 per cent of its
needs, the total import cost of wood and wood products, including pulp and
paper, being over £2,000 million in 1978.
The Forestry Commission is the national forestry authority charged with
promoting the interests of forestry, the development of afforestation and the
production and supply of timber in Great Britain. The Commissioners comply
with directions given by the forestry ministers, who are the Minister of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.
Northern Ireland has its own separate organisation (see p 292). In pursuing its

main objective, timber production, Great Britain’s forestry policy also takes
into account amenity, environmental and employment criteria. Thus the Com¬
mission’s activities include wildlife conservation, the landscaping of plantations,
and the provision of facilities for recreation. The Commission has also encour¬
aged the setting up of some 20 major new timber-using industries.
Production of timber from the Commission’s woodlands amounted to 2-02
million cubic metres in 1978-79.
The Forestry Commission is financed partly by the State and partly by receipts
from sales of produce, rentals and other sources. Income from timber is expected
to increase as production doubles in the next 20 years, probably leading to a
reduction in state subsidy.
Privately owned woods comprise 50 per cent of the total forest area in Great
Britain. About half of the private woodland area is in ownerships of under 80
hectares (198 acres) in extent.
The effective management of private woodlands is encouraged by the provision
of grants administered by the Forestry Commission, in return for which owners
accept a continuing obligation to manage their woodlands in accordance with
sound forestry practice.
Degree courses in forestry and associated studies are provided at three univer¬
sities and there are supervisory, craft and managerial level courses.
The Forestry Training Council, set up by the Forestry Commission, assists
the development of systematic training and the co-ordination of training in the
state and private sectors.
The Furniture and Timber Industry Training Board is concerned with train¬
ing for private-sector employees in the home timber trade.
Forestry research is carried out by the Forestry Commission, universities and
other institutions (see p 382).
Forestry in The Department of Agriculture is the forest authority for Northern Ireland.
Northern The Department may acquire land for afforestation and give financial and
Ireland technical assistance for private planting. It has introduced measures to control
felling, fires near plantations and damage by certain animals. Financial provision
is made annually by Parliament.
The state forest area has grown steadily since the end of the second world
war. By 1979, 57,300 hectares (142,000 acres) of plantable land had been
acquired, of which 52,200 hectares (129,000 acres) were planted. There were
about 12,000 hectares (30,000 acres) of privately owned forest.
Some 1,300 people worked in state and private forests in 1979; of these,
about 700 were employed under the Urban and Rural Improvement Campaign
for developing recreational facilities, mostly in state forests.

16 Transport and
Communications
ROADS
The application of technological developments to Britain’s transport and
communications network is helping to make travel quicker and more convenient.
Major improvements in the movement of passengers and freight have resulted
from the construction of a network of motorways, the extension of fast inter-city
rail services (such as those operated by high speed trains), the modernisation of
many ports, the increased use of containers and other modern methods in
shipping, the use by airlines of larger or speedier aircraft (such as the Concorde
supersonic aircraft) and the expansion of facilities at many airports.
Transport and communications contribute 8 per cent of gross national
product and are responsible for a rather higher proportion of gross domestic
fixed capital formation. These activities employed some 1-4 million people in
Great Britain in December 1978 and accounted for 6 per cent of the employed
labour force. Of these, 420,800 employees were engaged in road passenger
transport and road haulage, 208,300 in railways, 412,500 in postal services and
telecommunications, 146,200 in sea transport, port and inland water transport,
87,700 in air transport and 156,700 in other transport services and storage.
INLAND TRANSPORT
Passenger and freight traffic is carried mainly by road. At the end of 1978 there
were 17-8 million vehicles licensed for use on the roads of Great Britain. Of
these 14*1 million were motor cars, 1-7 million road goods vehicles, 1-2 million
motor cycles, scooters and mopeds, and 109,000 public road passenger vehicles
(including taxis). Private ownership of cars has been growing rapidly for many
years and the car is the most popular form of travel. Road haulage has a dominant
position in the movement of inland freight, accounting for 85 per cent of tonnage
moved in 1978 and for some three-quarters of tonne-kilometres. Railways and,
to a lesser extent, pipelines and inland waterways are important in carrying
certain types of freight, particularly bulk goods. The railways and much of the
bus industry are publicly owned, but road haulage is largely in the hands of
private enterprise.
Transport policy rests on the fundamental aims of helping economic growth
and higher national prosperity, and ensuring a reasonable level of personal
mobility, while improving safety, particularly on the roads, minimising damage
to the environment and taking account of energy considerations.
Large-scale investment in improving the network of trunk roads (which form
a basic network linking major centres of population, industrial areas, and ports)
has been undertaken since the mid-1960s. Of a total road network of 223,633
miles (359,903 kilometres) in Britain in April 1978, some 1,568 miles (2,523
kilometres) were motorways (roads specially designed for high speed traffic).
294

These and other trunk road improvements have helped to make travelling easier
and faster, particularly over long distances and between cities. Congestion on
inter-urban roads has been reduced or eliminated and many towns and villages
have been relieved of heavy through traffic. The programme for constructing
new trunk roads is nearing completion and accordingly annual investment in
new roads is being reduced. Motorways and other major roads are shown on
the map at the end of the book.

c In addition, there were 58 miles (94 kilometres) of local authority motorway in use in
England and 10 miles (16 kilometres) in Scotland.
In England a more selective approach to new schemes has been adopted, and
the emphasis has shifted from building a predetermined strategic network to
providing roads of a standard appropriate to the local need. Schemes are now
designed to solve specific problems by, for example, constructing by-passes to
relieve traffic congestion and environmental stress, or new sections of road to
replace dangerous or inadequate stretches. Some completely new roads, such
as the M25 London orbital route and certain routes to serve industry and the
ports, are still needed but, in general, work is being concentrated on improving
existing through routes. In Wales the priorities are to complete the motorway
across south Wales, reconstruct the coast road in north Wales and improve roads
which are important for industrial redevelopment. The main objectives of the
programme in Scotland are to complete the remaining links in the motorway/dual
carriageway network in central Scotland, to continue improving roads which are
important for North Sea oil-related activities and to construct by-passes to relieve
traffic congestion and environmental stress. In Northern Ireland the emphasis is
on building new links to the motorway network, constructing more by-passes,
and improving roads in the Belfast area and other urban areas. Priority for new
roads in urban areas of Great Britain is being given to those designed to meet
the needs of industry and commerce, serve new industrial or housing estates,
provide links to the national trunk road network or to complement traffic manage¬
ment schemes.
Motor vehicle traffic in Great Britain rose in 1978 by 4-1 per cent to a record
274,184 million vehicle-kilometres, of which cars and taxis accounted for
80 per cent.

A few road tunnels have been built to cross major estuaries, notably the
Mersey, the Thames, the Tyne and the Clyde. A second crossing of the Thames

Responsibility for trunk motorways and other trunk roads in Great Britain
rests in England with the Minister of Transport, in Scotland with the Secretary
of State for Scotland and in Wales with the Secretary of State for Wales. The
costs of construction, improvement and maintenance are paid for by central
Government. Work on major trunk road and motorway schemes in England
is controlled by regional road construction units which include staff from the
Department of Transport and county councils. The highway authority for
non-trunk roads in England and Wales is, in general, the county council in
whose area the roads lie, and in Scotland the regional or islands council. The
Government is in the process of transferring to local authorities the responsibility
for those trunk roads which have lost their importance as major through routes
following the completion of nearby motorways.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment
is responsible for public roads and bears the cost of maintenance and construction.
Great Britain’s accident record is considerably better than that of most other
countries even though it has one of the highest densities of road traffic in the
world. In 1978 6,900 people were killed on the roads, about 83,000 seriously
injured and 261,000 slightly injured. A comprehensive framework of legislation
embodied in the Road Traffic Acts and summarised in the Highway Code (which
sets out the standard of conduct for road users) has contributed to the decline
in casualty rates. Other factors have been modern roads, designed for present-
day traffic and segregating vehicles from pedestrians, and campaigns conducted
nationally by government departments and the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Accidents and locally by local authorities to persuade people to take greater
care on the roads. In recent years major publicity campaigns have been under¬
taken to increase the wearing of seat belts, to reduce casualties to child pedestrians
and to riders of motor cycles, and to reduce the incidence of drinking and driving.
Comprehensive regulations govern the design of vehicles, their use on the
roads, and the maintenance of their mechanical condition. On 1 August 1978 a
‘type approval’ scheme came into operation whereby the use of cars manufactured
after 1 October 1977 is not permitted unless they are of a type that has been
certified as meeting the required standards. In Great Britain private cars and
light vans which are three or more years old must be tested annually at private
garages authorised as test stations. (In Northern Ireland private cars seven
or more years old are tested at official vehicle inspection centres.) Heavy goods
vehicles are tested annually at government test stations. Public service vehicles
must be specially approved before being licensed to carry passengers, and are
tested at regular intervals. Any vehicle may be stopped on the road at any time
by the police and examined.
Minimum ages are laid down for driving: 16 for driving invalid carriages and
mopeds; 17 for cars and other passenger vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver), motorcycles and goods vehicles not over 3-5
tonnes maximum permissible weight; 18 for goods vehicles over 3-5 but not
over 7-5 tonnes; and 21 for passenger vehicles with over nine seats and goods
vehicles over 7-5 tonnes. All drivers of motor vehicles are required to pass the

driving test before being granted a full licence to drive. Until they pass the test
they must hold a ‘provisional’ licence, display ‘L’ (learner) plates on their
vehicle and be accompanied while driving (with certain exceptions) by a qualified
driver. In Northern Ireland a driver having passed the test is required to
display an ‘R’ (restricted) plate for a one-year period during which he must
not exceed 45 mph (72 km/h). There are schemes for special licensing and
testing of drivers of heavy goods vehicles and public service vehicles.
Speed limits also contribute to road safety. There are national limits of 70 mph
(113 km/h) on motorways and other dual carriageway roads, and 60 mph
(97 km/h) on single carriageway roads, while in built-up areas a general limit
of 30 mph (48 km/h) applies. To meet local needs the urban limit can be raised
and the other limits lowered on specific stretches of road. A wide range of other
measures directed primarily towards road safety include legislation and publicity
to discourage drinking and driving (including a maximum permissible blood
alcohol level for drivers of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood),
computer-controlled warning signals on most busy motorways to inform motor¬
ists of advisory speed limits in adverse conditions and of lane closures, and regu¬
lations (now being revised) governing the carriage of dangerous goods by road.
Traffic in the centres of cities and towns in Britain is increasingly being managed
so as to minimise congestion and its environmental effects, and to improve road
safety. Local authorities have powers to introduce a range of measures which,
when combined, form comprehensive traffic management schemes covering a
particular area. Such schemes may include one-way systems, streets reserved for
pedestrians, bus priority measures, parking controls and limited road construction.
Parking control is an important element of comprehensive traffic manage¬
ment. In most town centres parking is restricted and waiting limits apply.
Major city centres often have controlled parking zones, where payment is
required for on-street parking.
Several cities have new shopping precincts, some of them enclosed, which
are specially designed for pedestrians and from which motor vehicles are
excluded. In the centres of many towns, areas containing several streets have
been wholly or partly converted to pedestrian use, and this has resulted in a
more attractive environment.
Urban traffic control systems, which link traffic signals and some traffic
signs to a central computer, represent an important addition to local authorities’
ability to control traffic. They are confined to large towns and cities, but they
are being adapted and extended for use in smaller towns. The Department of
Transport is sponsoring two of the new systems at Torbay (which began operat¬
ing in 1979) and Hull (which is due to become operational later in 1979).
Research into all aspects of road construction, traffic engineering and safety,
and into problems associated with transport is carried out by the Transport
and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL), jointly responsible to the Department
of Transport and the Department of the Environment. The TRRL provides
technical and scientific advice and information to help in formulating, developing
and implementing the Government’s transport policy. It employs nearly
1,000 people of whom about half are scientists and engineers.
Road haulage traffic in terms of tonne-kilometres has increased substantially
and reached a record 99,100 million tonne-kilometres in 1978. Actual goods
vehicle traffic has, however, grown much less because of a move towards larger
and more efficient vehicles carrying heavier loads—over three-fifths of the

traffic, in terms of tonne-kilometres, is carried in vehicles of over 28 tonnes
gross laden weight. Much of the traffic is moved over short distances, with
about three-fifths of the tonnage being carried on hauls of 50 kilometres (31
miles) or less. The growth in road haulage has been concentrated on long¬
distance traffic, particularly international road haulage, and British hauliers
are increasingly running goods vehicles to the rest of Europe and as far afield
as North and West Africa and the Middle East. The Minister of Transport
has set up an independent inquiry to consider the growth in road haulage,
especially its impact on people and the environment, and the best way of ensuring
that future developments meet the public interest.
Road haulage is predominantly an industry of small businesses. Many of the
124,700 holders of an operator’s licence in 1978 had only one vehicle and the
average size of a vehicle fleet is only about four. Most of the industry is privately
owned, but the biggest operator in Great Britain is the publicly owned National
Freight Corporation (NFC). Turnover of the NFC’s freight transport subsid¬
iaries amounted to ^393 million in 1978 and at the end of 1978 it owned or
leased 19,100 vehicles, 12,800 trailers and 5,200 containers and demountable
bodies. The Government is preparing legislation to allow a substantial private
sector stake in the NFC. Public haulage (private road hauliers and the NFC
carrying other firms’ goods) accounts for 66 per cent of freight carried in Great
Britain in terms of tonne-kilometres. In Northern Ireland the biggest operator
is Northern Ireland Carriers Ltd, owned jointly by the Northern Ireland
Transport Holding Company and the NFC.
Those operating goods vehicles of over 3-5 tonnes gross weight (with certain
special exemptions) require an operator’s licence, obtained on showing good
repute and ability to maintain vehicles properly and control loading and drivers’
hours. Licences are divided into restricted licences for firms carrying their own
goods and standard licences, sub-divided into ‘national only’ and ‘international’,
for hauliers operating for hire or reward. Proof of professional competence
is required to obtain a standard licence.
Regulations control the emission of smoke and noise by lorries and the carriage
of dangerous goods by road. There are limits on the hours worked by drivers
of goods vehicles. The Government has proposed that the European Community
regulation requiring the use of the tachograph (a device which automatically
records a vehicle’s speed and distance covered, driving time and stopping periods)
in most goods vehicles over 3-5 tonnes gross weight, should be phased in over a
two-year transitional period with full implementation by the end of 1981. Inter¬
national road haulage is governed mainly by bilateral agreements, which are in
force with 23 other European countries and allow British road hauliers to carry
goods to or through these countries. Permits are required in some cases and
with special exceptions these are limited to a quota negotiated annually.
Bus and railway services in Britain are provided mainly by publicly owned
operators, coach and air services partly by publicly owned bodies, and taxis
and hire cars almost entirely by privately owned businesses. Buses and coaches
account for about 11 per cent of passenger mileage within Great Britain, rail
for 7 per cent and air 0-5 per cent.
In the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West Mid¬
lands, Tyne and Wear, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, the metropolitan
county council, acting as the passenger transport authority (PTA), is responsible

for local transport policy as a whole, and appoints a professional passenger
transport executive (PTE) to be responsible for day-to-day management and
operations. In Scotland the Strathclyde Regional Council is the PTA for
Greater Glasgow. The PTEs operate bus services in their areas and are respons¬
ible for reaching agreements with other passenger transport operators in their
areas, including the British Railways Board, to provide such services as are
considered necessary by the PTAs. In London the bus and Underground rail
services are operated by the London Transport Executive which is responsible
to the Greater London Council.
In the public sector in Great Britain 22,000 vehicles are operated by the National
Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group, 11,000 by the seven PTEs,
6,600 by the London Transport Executive and 6,000 by other local authority
undertakings. There are some 5,600 privately owned undertakings (of which
the majority have fewer than five vehicles) comprising about 28,600 vehicles;
only a small proportion of these operators are concerned with scheduled bus
services. Double-deck buses are an important feature of urban passenger
transport in Britain and there are some 26,700 in operation. In addition, there
are 47,000 single-deck buses and coaches, and nearly 100 trams (at Blackpool
and Llandudno which have Britain’s only remaining tramway systems).
Improvements to bus services have been undertaken in many areas to try to
halt the continuing decline in their use due primarily to the growth in ownership
of private cars. These include express and/or limited-stop bus services, ‘park
and ride’ bus services between suburban car parks and town centres, and
‘postbus’ services (Post Office minibuses carrying mail and passengers) in rural
areas. Bus operators have taken action to contain costs and to improve product¬
ivity by introducing larger buses, increasing the proportion of bus services
operated by one man and reducing or rationalising services. Many uneconomic
bus services have had to be withdrawn, particularly in the more remote rural
areas.
The National Bus Company operates in England and Wales through locally
based subsidiaries, such as the Western National Omnibus Company, Ribble
Motor Services Ltd and Crosville Motor Services Ltd, and has a network
of long-distance coach services. At the end of 1978 it owned some 17,700 vehicles
and employed 64,300 people. In 1978 passenger journeys on the Company’s
buses amounted to 1,787 million, gross revenue was ^437 million and the Com¬
pany had a net surplus of ^17-7 million.
The Scottish Transport Group (with about 3,900 vehicles) operates the
main bus services in Scotland outside the major cities and also runs ferries to
the islands off the west coast of Scotland.
In Northern Ireland almost all road passenger services are provided by
subsidiaries of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company. Citybus
Ltd operates services in the city of Belfast and Ulsterbus Ltd operates most
of the services in the rest of Northern Ireland. These companies have 400
and 1,000 vehicles respectively.
There are 11 traffic areas in Great Britain each under the jurisdiction of an
independent body of three traffic commissioners. The commissioners are
responsible for ensuring the fitness of vehicles used to carry passengers for
hire or reward, and for licensing public road passenger services. Legislation is
being prepared to revise the bus licensing system in order to make it easier for
new bus services to be introduced and to facilitate car-sharing.

RAILWAYS
There are about 37,000 taxicabs in Great Britain, mainly in urban areas,
especially London where some 12,500 taxicabs that ply for hire in the streets
are privately operated by companies or owner-drivers and are licensed annually
by the Metropolitan Police. There are about 16,700 licensed cab drivers in
London. Numerous car-hire firms are also in operation. Elsewhere taxis are
licensed by local authorities. In Northern Ireland all taxis are licensed by the
Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.
There are underground railway services in three British cities: London, Glasgow
and Liverpool. London Transport has 4,223 railway cars and serves 278 stations,
while its trains operate over 257 miles (414 kilometres) of railway, of which
about 100 miles (161 kilometres) are underground.
Urban rail projects are proceeding in several areas. A light rapid transit
system under construction on Tyneside involves the electrification of two
suburban railway lines, linked by new tunnels under Newcastle upon Tyne and
Gateshead, and a new bridge over the Tyne. The first section should be open
in 1980 and the remainder of the system, which will eventually be 34 miles
(55 kilometres) long with over 40 stations, should be brought into operation
during the 1980s. The project is the largest provincial urban transport scheme
to have been undertaken in Britain in the twentieth century. In Glasgow, as
part of the ‘Trans-Clyde’ integrated public transport system, the Underground
has been completely modernised and a new rail link, the Argyle line, has been
built; both will be opened in November 1979. Two recent additions to the
London Underground were the extension of the Piccadilly Line to Heathrow
Airport in December 1977, enabling passengers to travel directly between
Heathrow and central London by the Underground; and the opening in April
1979 of the first section of the Jubilee line, linking north-west and central
London.
Railways were pioneered in Britain, and the Stockton and Darlington Railway,
opened in 1825, was the first passenger public railway in the world to be worked
by steam power. Under the Transport Act 1947 the four large railway companies
in Great Britain were brought under public ownership and in 1963 the British
Railways Board was set up to manage railway affairs and subsidiary activities.
In Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Railways Company Ltd, a subsidiary
of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company, operates the railway
service on 200 miles (322 kilometres) of track.
A high rate of progress in railway development has been maintained in recent
years, notably on the inter-city passenger network where the introduction
of faster trains, together with the raising of standards of track and signalling,
has brought significant reductions in journey time on many routes. Inter-city
rail services in Great Britain are among the best in the world in speed, frequency
and comfort. Two major projects, the High Speed Train (HST) and the
Advanced Passenger Train (APT), have been designed to raise speeds using
existing track. A continuing important role is envisaged for the railways in
Britain’s transport system, especially in the provision of long-distance passenger
transport, commuter services and essential local services, and in the movement
of bulk freight.
British Rail’s operating statistics are shown in Table 23. In 1978 the Board’s
turnover, including financial support and income from other activities but
excluding internal transactions, was £1,979 minion. It achieved a trading surplus
of £58-3 million and a net surplus of £6-4 million. Financial support for British

British Railways Board received £434 million from the Government and the
Pl'Es in respect of the public service obligation. At the end of 1978 the British
Railways Board employed 243,300 people, of whom 182,200 were engaged on
the railways.

The passenger network (see map, p 301) comprises a fast inter-city network,
linking the main centres of Great Britain; local stopping services; and commuter
services in and around the large conurbations, especially London and the south
east. British Rail introduced the world’s fastest diesel rail service, known as
Inter-City 125, in 1976 on the route from London to Bristol and south Wales
and a similar sendee on the London-Edinburgh route in 1978. These services
are operated by HSTs, which travel at maximum sustained speeds of 125 mph
(201 km/h). In October 1979 HSTs were introduced between London and the
west of England. HSTs have been ordered for the route linking Edinburgh,
Newcastle upon Tyne, Birmingham and south-west England or south Wales.
The first of three pre-production electric APTs, capable of sustained speeds of
over 150 mph (241 km/h), is being used for testing purposes and crew training;
they will operate on the London-Glasgow route, covering the 400-mile (644-
kilometre) journey in about 4 hours 15 minutes.
Electrification is continuing, the latest project being an ^80 million scheme,
to be completed in 1982, to electrify the line between London and Bedford.
A review of the case for a programme of further main-line electrification is being
conducted by the Government and the British Railways Board, and the results
are expected to be issued in 1980.
The most important freight commodities handled in 1978 were coal and coke
(94 million tonnes) and iron and steel (24-7 million tonnes). British Rail is
concentrating on traffic particularly suitable for carriage by rail, especially
long-distance and bulk trainload traffic. Trainload traffic accounts for over 80
per cent of freight tonnage, compared with 31 per cent in 1968.
Increased efficiency is being obtained as new types of wagon are introduced with
larger capacities and which are capable of higher speeds. A network oPSpeedlink’
high-speed freight services using these new wagons is being established between

the major industrial centres. In March 1979 there were 37 Speedlink trains
running each day and the number will be increased to about 80 by 1982. Freight
traffic is being concentrated at fewer and better equipped and sited marshalling
yards and terminals. A computer-based total operations processing system,
which monitors continuously all consignments and freight train and wagon
movements in Great Britain, has reduced costs by allowing the more
intensive use of rolling stock and the withdrawal of many obsolete freight
vehicles.
To encourage the use of railways for the carriage of freight, grants of 50 per
cent are available towards the cost of construction or modernisation of privately
owned rail freight facilities where this leads to significant environmental benefits
by the removal of heavy goods vehicle traffic from the roads. By June 1979, 66
schemes had been approved for grants totalling some £18 million.
British Rail has a group of other companies, of which British Rail Engineering
Ltd (BREL) has the largest number of employees, about 35,600 at 13 engineer¬
ing plants. BREL mainly constructs locomotives, coaches, wagons and containers
for British Rail, and undertakes heavy maintenance and overhauls. It also
carries out work for export and won export orders worth nearly ^50 million in
1978. Transmark provides consultancy services overseas on railway and asso¬
ciated operations. British Transport Hotels Ltd runs 29 hotels and controls
Travellers-Fare, which is responsible for catering facilities at stations and on
trains, and provides meals and snacks on more trains than any other railway
company in Europe. The Railway Technical Centre at Derby is the largest in
the world; its most important achievement has been the development of the
APT.
The Board’s shipping and harbour assets are controlled by Sealink UK Ltd,
a wholly owned subsidiary, which, with 39 ships, is the largest short-sea ferry
operator in Europe and is the biggest partner in the international Sealink con¬
sortium operating between Britain and the continent of Europe. British Rail
Hovercraft Ltd provides hovercraft services in conjunction with Societe
Nationale des Chemins de Fer Fran^ais under the name ‘Seaspeed’ (see
P 308).
There are several small privately owned passenger-carrying railways in Great
Britain, mostly operated on a voluntary basis and providing limited services
for tourists and railway enthusiasts; the principal aim of many of these railways
is the preservation of steam traction. Some are narrow gauge railways, while
others run on former British Rail track.
INLAND Inland waterways are popular for recreation (see p 423), continue to carry
freight and are important for land drainage and water supply. Of the 2,000 miles
(3,219 kilometres) of canal and river navigations controlled by the publicly
owned British Waterways Board, some 340 miles (547 kilometres) are main¬
tained as commercial waterways for use by freight-carrying vessels. Freight
traffic carried on the Board’s waterways amounted to 85 million tonne-kilometres
in 1978 and the tonnage carried was 5*5 million tonnes. In addition, some
freight is carried on about 600 miles (966 kilometres) of inland waterways
owned by other bodies. The Board also operates docks, warehouses and inland
freight terminals, and has two barge fleets, although most of the traffic on its
waterways is conveyed by independent carriers. In 1978 the Board’s turnover
amounted to £21-9 million, and it received government grants of £16-8 million,
most of which were used to maintain its waterways to statutory standards.

Limited improvements are being undertaken for freight traffic. The most

PORTS
There are some 250 port authorities or public wharf operators in Britain, and
about 800 other undertakings engaged in various harbour operations, such as
stevedoring, towage, warehousing and lighterage. Port authorities are of four
main types: nationalised bodies, public trusts, local authorities and statutory
companies.
Ports run by nationalised undertakings represent over a fifth of total
capacity, the majority, including Southampton, Hull, Grimsby/Immingham,
Newport, Cardiff and Swansea, being owned by the British Transport Docks
Board. In 1978 shipping arrivals and departures at the Board’s docks totalled
133-1 million net registered tons (including fishing vessels) and total cargo
handled was 78-9 million tonnes. The Board’s revenue totalled £119-9 million
and it achieved a net surplus of £7 million. The British Railways Board controls
certain ports, including Fishguard, Folkestone, Holyhead, Parkeston Quay
(Harwich) and Stranraer, which are largely used for its shipping services, while
the British Waterways Board owns Sharpness (Gloucester) and Weston Point
in Runcorn. Major ports controlled by public trusts include London, Milford
Haven, Tees and Hartlepool, Medway, Forth and Clyde. Local authorities
own about one-third of Britain’s ports, including Bristol and the new oil ports
in Orkney and Shetland. Port undertakings owned by statutory companies
include Manchester and Liverpool. Many private ports deal with the traffic of
individual industrial firms in commodities such as china clay and petroleum.
Port authorities, in the main, operate with statutory powers and responsibili¬
ties set out in private Acts of Parliament. Most are members of the British
Ports Association which aims to further the common interests of port authorities
in their relations with the Government, shipowners and traders.
The National Ports Council, set up under the Harbours Act 1964, is financed
principally by a levy on port authorities. It advises the Government on major
port developments and has various responsibilities in relation to research,
training, statistics and charges.
Over 353 million tonnes of cargo a year pass through the ports of Great Britain.
Coastal traffic accounts for over no million tonnes consisting largely of petroleum
and coal. Of some 153 million tonnes of imports from overseas, about 76 million
tonnes consist of petroleum and petroleum products. Manufactured goods
form about 26 per cent of exports.
Britain’s main ports, in terms of total tonnage handled, are given in Table 24.
A noticeable feature has been the effect of offshore oil developments, which have
greatly increased the flow through certain North Sea ports, such as Tees and
Hartlepool and the Forth ports, resulted in the creation of new oil ports at Flotta
in Orkney and Sullom Voe in Shetland, and reduced oil traffic at traditional
oil importing terminals such as Milford Haven. There has also been a switch
in general cargo traffic from some of the traditional ports, such as London,
Liverpool and Manchester, to smaller ports including Dover, Felixstowe and
Harwich, partly because of the growth of container and roll-on traffic. While
non-fuel traffic has been growing only slowly, container and roll-on traffic has

trebled since 1969 to 39-3 million tonnes in 1978 and now accounts for almost
one-third of non-fuel traffic. The leading ports for this type of traffic are Dover,
Felixstowe, London, Southampton, Liverpool and Hull.

Modernisation of Britain’s ports is in progress, primarily to accommodate
the increase in the proportion of goods carried in container ships and roll-on
vessels, and the changing nature and direction of Britain’s trade. However,
port investment in real terms has been declining in the 1970s and most current
developments are concerned with specific energy or industrial needs or to
accommodate specialised container or roll-on services rather than with general
purpose port facilities.
Recent major schemes have included a £24 million container terminal, the
world’s largest terminal for refrigerated containers, at Tilbury (London)
covering 64 acres (26 hectares), which received its first ship in September 1978;
the £37 million Royal Portbury Dock at Bristol, containing six berths and the
largest entrance lock in Britain; the £10 million third phase of the 120-acre
(48-hectare) Prince Charles container port at Southampton; and one of the
world’s biggest hoverports, a £12 million terminal at Dover to handle cross-
Channel hovercraft, which became fully operational in July 1978. A terminal
for handling iron ore and coal was opened at Hunterston on the Clyde in June
1979. It can accommodate ships of up to 350,000 deadweight tons and is the
biggest terminal of its type in Europe. Work on a £20 million development
scheme at Belfast, to provide two new terminals (one for roll-on traffic and one
for container services) and a deep-water berth, is expected to begin in 1979 and
should be completed in 1984.
The first purpose-built terminal for oil from the British sector of the North
Sea was completed at Hound Point on the Forth in 1975 and other terminals
have been built on the Tees and at Flotta (Orkney), while the £813 million
terminal at Sullom Voe (Shetland), which received its first oil in November
1978, is partially open. Sullom Voe is expected to become the largest oil port
in Europe in the early 1980s. Of the four jetties in use or under construction,
three are, or will be, able to handle oil tankers of up to 300,000 deadweight
tons. Other developments related to offshore oil and gas include the construction
of supply bases for offshore vessels at a number of ports mostly on the east coast;
those include Great Yarmouth, Leith, Dundee, Montrose, Aberdeen, Peterhead,
and Lerwick in Shetland.

SHIPPING
The British merchant fleet in mid-1978 at 30-9 million gross tons1 (50-5 million
deadweight tons), was the fourth largest in active employment after those of
Liberia, Japan and Greece. The oil tanker fleet (i4‘7 million gross tons) was the
third largest and the fleet of fully cellular container ships (i-8 million gross
tons) was the largest, accounting for 21 per cent of vessels of this type. The
British fleet is one of the most modern in the world; some 36 per cent of the
tonnage is less than five years old. In the last ten years some £4,500 million
has been spent on new ships and other capital investment by Britain’s 200
shipping companies. However, the world recession in shipping has led a number
of shipowners to sell or scrap a considerable amount of tonnage, particularly
general cargo and bulk carrier vessels, and many other ships have been laid up.
The Department of Trade is the government department responsible for most
matters connected with merchant shipping, including general policy towards
the industry and Britain’s relations with other governments and international
organisations on shipping matters. Under the Merchant Shipping Acts it
administers many regulations for marine safety and welfare, and for preventing
and cleaning up pollution from ships (see p 179). For instance, it certifies the
load-line (or Plimsoll line) that shows that a ship is not overloaded; ensures
that standards of safety are observed in ship construction; ensures the pro¬
vision of adequate life-saving, fire-fighting and radio equipment; and deals
with the discipline, professional standards, health and accommodation of sea¬
men. The Acts also contain certain reserve powers for protecting shipping and
trading interests from measures adopted or proposed by overseas governments.
The Merchant Shipping Act 1979 has brought a number of major changes,
including an increase in the Department’s powers to make regulations to promote
health and safety on ships registered in Britain, and will allow the Government
to ratify several important international conventions.
The Department’s duties are carried out from marine survey offices and
mercantile marine offices located at various ports. In the offices of the Registrar
General of Shipping and Seamen, at Cardiff, a record is kept of all ships registered
in Britain and its dependencies.
In July 1978, 467 million deadweight tons of trading vessels of 100 gross tons
and over were both owned and registered in Britain. (This figure excludes non¬
trading vessels, such as fishing vessels, tugs and dredgers, and shipping registered
in Britain but owned in other Commonwealth countries, which are included in
the figure of 50-5 million deadweight tons.) These ships were usually employed
as follows: 27-4 million deadweight tons as tankers; 14*4 million deadweight
tons as tramps and 5 million deadweight tons as cargo or passenger liners. Techno¬
logical change in the merchant fleet is reflected in the current composition.
Vessels are becoming obsolete over a shorter period and as they do so are being
replaced by larger ships, incorporating labour-saving devices.
Lloyd’s Register of Shipping surveys and classifies ships with particular
regard to their safety and operational efficiency.
Nearly the whole of the British merchant fleet is privately owned, apart from
some ships which are owned and/or operated by nationalised industries as
1 One gross ton = 100 cubic feet (2-83 cubic metres). One deadweight ton = 1 long ton
(2,240 lb or 1,016 kilogrammes). Gross tonnage indicates the total capacity of the enclosed
space on a ship. Deadweight tonnage denotes the maximum load which a vessel can carry
before submerging the load-line.

part of their normal commercial operations, the main example being British Rail
(see p 302). Over half of the tanker fleet belongs to the oil companies, although
there are a few independent tanker operators. British liner tonnage is dominated
by a relatively small number of large groups, the largest liner company being
the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. Some shipowners
have delegated the management of their fleets to specialist ship management
companies. Several companies are participating in consortia, particularly
where heavy investment in ships and facilities is required, as with container
and bulk cargo vessels. Chartering of ships of all nationalities takes place on
the Baltic Exchange, the largest market of its type in the world. The represen¬
tative body for shipowners (excluding owners of fishing vessels) is the General
Council of British Shipping.
Almost all Britain’s overseas trade by weight, about four-fifths by value, is
carried by sea. Ships registered in Britain carry 32 per cent by weight, 43 per
cent by value, of seaborne trade between Britain and other countries. Tanker
cargoes account for nearly half this trade by weight but only about 11 per cent
by value, and foodstuffs and manufactured goods account for over three-quarters
by value.
Container and roll-on/roll-off vessels are responsible for a growing proportion
of general cargo trade. Many of the deep-sea liner services from Britain are
operated by container ships. Roll-on services, accommodating passengers and
their cars and, in some cases, commercial vehicles are increasing in number,
particularly between Britain and the continent of Europe. Several freight-only
roll-on services operate to the Irish Republic, the continent of Europe, and to
more distant countries, especially in the Middle East, North Africa and West
Africa.
The proportion of passengers travelling to or from Britain by sea is about
one-third, compared with about one-half in the early 1960s. Almost all of
these travel to or from the continent of Europe or the Irish Republic, services
on other routes having virtually ceased as a result of the growth of air services.
Remaining long-distance passenger ships are used for cruising and about
80,000 passengers a year embark on pleasure cruises from British ports.
British shipping companies operating liner services have associated with each
other and with the companies of other countries operating on the same routes
in a series of ‘conferences’ designed to secure standardisation and stability of
rates, and to maintain frequency and regularity of services. The essential
principle of a conference is the establishment of a common tariff of freight rates
to be applied by each member line. Each conference regularly reviews existing
rates and the share of the trade carried by member lines. Rates are reviewed
in consultation with shippers’ organisations. There are about 100 conferences
dealing with trade to and from Britain.
Various qualifications are required for employment on board ship in certain
grades. Responsibility for holding examinations and issuing certificates of
competency rests with the Department of Trade, except in the case of radio
officers where this is the function of the Home Office.
There are some 50 establishments providing full-time vocational training
for seafarers. Most deck and catering junior ratings are trained at the National
Sea Training College at Gravesend (Kent), the world’s largest ratings’ estab¬
lishment, which can accommodate some 2,000 ratings a year. The Merchant
Navy Training Board promotes the instruction and studies of apprentices,

cadets and ratings who are preparing for their examinations for the various
certificates of competency.
Wages and conditions of employment of most seafarers are negotiated by the
National Maritime Board, composed of equal numbers of representatives of
the General Council of British Shipping and seafarers’ trade unions. Under the
Merchant Navy Established Service Scheme, seafarers are employed either as
‘registered seafarers’ or they may enter into a company service contract, for a
minimum of one year, for employment on the ships of a particular company.
Registered seafarers receive special benefits between voyages in addition to
the normal state benefits. The benefits paid to company service contract sea¬
farers must be at least equivalent to those paid to registered seafarers. The
industry has introduced new disciplinary procedures and is studying ways of
improving seafaring conditions of work and leisure.
The Department of Trade’s responsibilities for safety include administration
of the Marine Survey Service, the Coastguard Service, and certain administra¬
tive functions concerning lighthouses and pilotage. It makes regulations to
ensure safety of navigation at sea and conducts inquiries into shipping casualties
and accidents. Britain’s merchant fleet is one of the safest in the world; it has a
consistently lower record of ship losses than the world average.
The Coastguard Service is responsible for initiating and co-ordinating civil
marine search and rescue action off the coasts of Britain. There are some 600
regular coastguards and about 9,000 voluntary auxiliary coastguards operating
from more than 100 coastal stations. A constant visual and radio listening watch
is maintained all the year round at certain main stations and at times of high
casualty risk at a number of others.
The Coastguard Service calls upon the lifeboats of the Royal National Life¬
boat Institution (RNLI), Ministry of Defence aircraft and helicopters, a long-
range civilian helicopter based at Sumburgh (Shetland), and any other ships
or aircraft available to assist in rescue action. In 1978 the Coastguard Service
took action in 3,740 incidents (including cliff rescues) in which 6,684 people
were rescued. The RNLI is supported entirely by voluntary contributions
and depends for its operation on voluntary workers. In 1978 lifeboats were
launched 2,380 times and rescued 933 people.
The general lighthouse authority for England and Wales, the Channel Islands
and Gibraltar is the Corporation of Trinity House, which is administered by a
board of Elder Brethren elected from the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navy.
Lighthouses in Scotland and Ireland are the responsibility respectively of the
Northern Lighthouse Board and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. These
authorities control about 350 lighthouses, many minor lights and buoys, and a
number of lightships, some of which are being replaced by unattended sea
marks or by light towers.
In Britain there are 46 pilotage authorities for the 86 pilotage districts and
over 1,500 licensed pilots. Trinity House is the chief pilotage authority, licensing
some 700 pilots in 41 districts in England and Wales. In some cases the harbour
authority or local council is the pilotage authority. Under the Merchant Shipping
Act 1979 a Pilotage Commission is to be established to advise on the organisation
of pilotage.

There are a number of traffic separation schemes around the shores of Britain,
all of which have been adopted by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consulta¬
tive Organisation (a United Nations agency with headquarters in London). Com¬
pliance with these schemes is mandatory for all vessels of countries contracting
to the 1972 International Collision Regulations. The most important scheme affect¬
ing British waters is in the Dover Strait, one of the world’s busiest seaways. It
consists of traffic lanes for shipping passing through the strait and inshore
traffic zones for use by local shipping. The number of collisions has fallen
considerably since the scheme was introduced. Britain and France operate
radar surveillance of the strait to keep watch on ships not conforming to the
scheme and, through the Channel Navigation Information Service, broadcast
navigational information to ships in the Dover Strait. The Anglo-French
Safety of Navigation Group, comprising representatives of British and French
government departments, is responsible for reviewing and improving safety
measures in the English Channel. An important development in 1978 was the
establishment of ‘Mancheplan’, a joint Anglo-French contingency plan for
handling maritime disasters in the Channel.
The hovercraft, a vehicle which rides on a cushion of air over both land and
water surfaces, was invented in Britain and has been in regular public passenger
service since the mid-1960s. There are services on cross-Channel routes and
on routes across the Solent to the Isle of Wight. Two operators provide cross-
Channel services: Seaspeed with routes between Dover and Boulogne, and
Dover and Calais; and Hoverlloyd Ltd between Ramsgate and Calais. A
hovercraft crossing takes about one-third of the time taken by ships and hover¬
craft carry about one-quarter of the traffic on the short-sea crossings to the
continent of Europe. Seaspeed operates the world’s largest hovercraft, two
British Hovercraft Corporation SR.Nqs which have been structurally enlarged
so that each accommodates 416 passengers and 60 cars.
CIVIL AVIATION
Britain has a growing civil aviation industry which is continuing to develop to
meet the increasing demand for air travel, particularly international travel.
Airline services are operated by British Airways and by a number of independent
airlines. Their fleets contain some of the most modern types of aircraft including
wide-bodied aircraft and the Concorde supersonic aircraft with which British
Airways inaugurated in 1976, jointly with Air France, the world’s first super¬
sonic passenger services. To cater for the growing number of air passengers,
many airports are being substantially modernised and new terminals installed.
The Secretary of State for Trade is responsible for international matters
(including negotiation of air service agreements with other countries, the licens¬
ing and control of public transport operations into Britain by overseas operators
and British participation in the activities of international aviation bodies),
airports policy, amenity matters such as aircraft noise, aviation security policy
and investigation of accidents.
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an independent statutory body respons¬
ible for the economic, technical and operational regulation of the industry; the
provision by the National Air Traffic Services, jointly with the Secretary of State
for Defence, of air navigation services and the aerodrome navigation services
at certain British airports; and the operation of eight aerodromes in Scotland.

The Secretary of State for Trade appoints the members of the CAA, and
issues a written guidance on the general policies to be followed, which requires
approval of both Houses of Parliament.
The CAA has been given the objective of recovering as soon as possible the
whole of its costs and a reasonable return on capital from the users of its services.
Meanwhile the Government is paying the CAA a grant to meet the deficit on
its revenue account; it amounted to £13-3 million in 1978-79.
Since 1962 more passengers have entered or left Britain by air than by sea. In
1978 a total of some 38-9 million passengers travelled by air (international
terminal passengers), compared with 19-9 million by sea. Air traffic is continuing
to increase as a result of the introduction of new and more frequent services and
lower fares on some routes. Total capacity offered on all services by British
airlines amounted to 11,970 million capacity-tonne-kilometres in 1978, 14 per
cent more than in 1977. British Airways accounts for some 90 per cent of sched¬
uled services flown by British airlines, whereas the charter market is dominated
by independent companies.
The value of overseas trade by air rose by 30 per cent in 1978 to ^14,558
million, and the proportions of Britain’s overseas trade carried by air amounted
to 20 per cent of the value of exports and 18 per cent of imports. Air freight is
important for the carriage of goods with a high value-to-weight ratio, especially
where speed of movement is essential. Precious stones (particularly diamonds),
live animals, medicinal and pharmaceutical products, clothing, leather and
skins, and scientific instruments are major categories where a relatively high
proportion of exports is sent by air.
British Airways is one of the world’s leading airlines, and in terms of inter¬
national passengers carried and of international passenger-kilometres flown it
is the largest in the world. During 1978-79 British Airways’ turnover was
£1,640 million (including £1,403 million from airline operations), and it made
a net profit of £83 million. In March 1979 British Airways employed about
57,700 staff. Its assets of £828 million included £652 million of aircraft and spares
and £106 million of land and buildings. The Government intends to introduce
legislation to give British Airways a new capital structure, and a substantial
minority shareholding will then be offered for sale to the public.
British Airways’ route network, covering some 579,800 kilometres (360,200
miles) of unduplicated route, is among the largest in the world. The airline
serves nearly 180 destinations in 80 countries and in 1978-79 carried some
15-8 million passengers on scheduled services. International scheduled services
are operated to the rest of Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, Australasia,
East and South Africa, North America and Guyana in South America. Within
Britain it runs over 1,000 services a week to 26 towns and cities throughout the
country. Scheduled Concorde services are operated from London (Heathrow) to
New York; to Washington, with Braniff Airways flying the aircraft on to Dallas/
Fort Worth airport; and to Singapore via Bahrain (in joint operation with
Singapore Airlines). In 1975 British Airways inaugurated Europe’s first air
‘shuttle’ service (a regular scheduled no-reservation service with back-up
aircraft to carry extra passengers) between Heathrow and Glasgow, and similar
services have been introduced from Heathrow to Edinburgh and Belfast. A
new shuttle service between Heathrow and Manchester was inaugurated in
October 1979. Joint shuttle services with national airlines to a number of other
European countries are being investigated.

British Airways Associated Companies Ltd is responsible for the group’s
investments connected with a number of hotel companies and air companies
in different parts of the world. The main activity of British Airways Helicopters
Ltd is the provision of links between oil and gas production platforms in the North
Sea and the mainland. It also operates a scheduled service between Penzance
(Cornwall) and the Isles of Scilly, undertakes charter work and operates air-sea
rescue services from Sumburgh (Shetland). Engine overhaul work for British
Airways and other airlines is carried out by British Airways Engine Overhaul
Ltd. International Aeradio Ltd plans, installs, operates and maintains airport
technical services and general communications and manufactures specialised
equipment for use in these services.
British Airways operated 212 aircraft and helicopters in July 1979. Aircraft
included 25 BAC One-Elevens, 20 Boeing 707s, 26 Boeing 747s, 5 Concordes,
2 HS 748s, 5 Merchantmen (converted Vanguard passenger aircraft), 15 Trident
Ones, 16 Trident Twos, 25 Trident Threes, 12 TriStars, 15 Super VCios and
20 Viscounts. A large investment programme is under way to replace the older
aircraft, and major orders for new aircraft include 28 Boeing 737s, 19 Boeing
757s and 11 TriStars. Helicopters operated comprised 23 Sikorsky 6iNs, 1 Bell
Jet Ranger and 2 Bell 212s.
The independent airlines carry over 4 million passengers a year on scheduled
services and over 10 million on charter flights. The main independent scheduled
airline is British Caledonian Airways, which operates a fleet of 29 aircraft and
carried nearly 1-4 million scheduled service passengers in 1978. Its scheduled
services are primarily to the continent of Europe, West and Central Africa,
South America and Houston in the United States. Other independent operators
of scheduled passenger services include British Island Airways, British Midland
Airways and Dan-Air Services. A notable development in transatlantic air travel
occurred in 1977 when Laker Airways pioneered a daily ‘Skytrain’ service,
a service based on low fares, between London (Gatwick) and New York. A
second Skytrain service, between Gatwick and Los Angeles, was started in
1978. Dan-Air Services, Britannia Airways, Laker Airways and Monarch
Airlines are the leading independent airlines running charter passenger services.
About 300 aircraft operated by some 130 public transport companies are
engaged in air-taxi operations. Helicopters are also used to transport business¬
men, but are being employed on a large scale in operations connected with the
development of Britain’s offshore oil and gas resources. Light aircraft and heli¬
copters are also involved in other activities, such as charter operations, search
and rescue services, crop-spraying, and aerial survey and photography.
Under the CAA’s air transport licensing system, British operators apply for
licences for scheduled and charter services, or for revocation or variation of
existing licences. The CAA also considers changes in fares, both for British
carriers and for overseas carriers on services to and from Britain, and licenses
air travel organisers who charter aircraft for inclusive tours. The Air Transport
Users Committee, which is financed by the CAA but independent of it, makes
reports and recommendations to the CAA for furthering the interests of air
transport users including the investigation of complaints against airlines.
The CAA is responsible for the regulation of the safety of civil aircraft registered
in Britain. Its Operations Division deals with the preparation and application
of safety requirements concerning airline operations, flight crew licensing and

training, aerodromes, and fire and rescue services. The Airworthiness Division
is responsible for functions such as the airworthiness certification of aircraft,
the licensing of aircraft maintenance engineers and the approval of work schedules
to which transport aircraft are maintained. The CAA is advised in its duties
by the Airworthiness Requirements Board.
Every operator of aircraft above a certain weight used for public transport
must possess an Air Operator’s Certificate which is granted by the CAA when
it is satisfied that the operator is competent to secure the safe operation of its
aircraft. The CAA’s flight operations inspectors (who are experienced airline
pilots) check that satisfactory operating standards are maintained.
Each member of the flight crew of a British registered aircraft must hold the
appropriate official licence issued by the CAA. Except for pilots with acceptable
military or other experience, all candidates for a first professional pilot’s licence
must have undertaken a full-time course of ground and flying instruction at a
flying school approved by the CAA.
Responsibility for civil and military air traffic control over Britain and the sur¬
rounding seas rests with the National Air Traffic Services (NATS). The planning
and provision of the facilities necessary for control of aircraft at the higher
flight levels are carried out in conjunction with Eurocontrol, a European
international agency of which Britain is a member. The Controller of the NATS
reports to both the CAA and the Ministry of Defence. The function of the NATS
is to secure the safe, orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic within British
airspace. It also provides air traffic services for aircraft flying over the north¬
eastern quarter of the North Atlantic. At some 20 civil aerodromes, including
most of the major British airports, the NATS provides the navigation services
necessary for the operation of aircraft taking off and landing, and integrates
them into the overall flow of traffic within British airspace. To provide its
services, the NATS uses radar, some 100 navigational beacons, landing aids,
air-to-ground communications and an extensive telecommunications network.
Of the 131 licensed civil aerodromes in Britain, nearly one-quarter each handles
more than 100,000 passengers a year. In 1978 Britain’s civil airports handled a
total of 53-4 million passengers (52-2 million terminal passengers and 1*2 million
in transit), 13-4 per cent more than in 1977, and 746,100 tonnes of freight.
London’s Heathrow airport is the world’s busiest airport for international
travel, and is Britain’s most important airport for passengers and air freight,
handling 26-9 million passengers and 460,200 tonnes of freight in 1978. Gatwick,
the second major airport in the London area, handled 7-8 million passengers
in 1978. Other leading airports were Manchester, Glasgow, Luton, Birmingham,
Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Belfast. While the number of passengers has, in
general, risen in recent years, there has not been a corresponding increase in
air transport movements owing to the growing use of wide-bodied aircraft.
The British Airports Authority (BAA), an independent statutory body operating
on a commercial basis, owns and manages seven airports—Heathrow, Gatwick
and Stansted in the south-east, and Glasgow, Edinburgh, Prestwick and Aber¬
deen in Scotland—which handle 76 per cent of air passengers and 89 per cent
of air cargo traffic in Britain. In 1978-79 the BAA’s income was £162-2 million
and it recorded a pre-tax profit of £29-4 million.

Transport Holding Company. Most of the other public airports are controlled
by local authorities. All airports and aerodromes (apart from those controlled
by the Government or by the CAA) must be licensed by the CAA. Stringent
requirements, such as the provision of adequate fire-fighting, medical and rescue
services, suitable runways, and of air traffic control services and visual aids,
must be satisfied before a licence is granted. Strict security measures are in
force at airports.
Existing airports are being developed to accommodate the substantial increase
expected in the number of air travellers. The capacity of Heathrow’s three main
terminals has been developed to their ultimate limit of about 30 million pas¬
sengers a year. Plans for a fourth major terminal, which would raise Heathrow’s
annual capacity to about 38 million passengers, have been examined at a local
planning inquiry and the report is being considered by the Government. At
Gatwick a £100 million redevelopment programme has been virtually completed,
increasing the airport’s annual capacity to some 16 million passengers. The
BAA has submitted a planning application for a second passenger terminal
which, if approved, would be in operation by the mid-1980s and would increase
Gatwick’s capacity to about 25 million passengers a year.
Work is in progress to develop facilities at several of Britain’s other airports.
A five-year development scheme, costing some £15 million, started in 1977 for
the expansion of terminal facilities at Aldergrove. Construction work has
started on a scheme to rebuild the runway at Manchester airport. A new pas¬
senger terminal is planned at Birmingham airport. Offshore oil and gas activities
have stimulated a number of major expansion schemes at airports in north-east
Britain, such as at Aberdeen, where a new terminal was opened in 1977 and which
has become the world’s biggest heliport. At Sumburgh in Shetland the CAA has
invested £30 million in developments including a new terminal for oil-related
traffic.
An Advisory Committee on Airports Policy and a Study Group on South
East Airports were set up in 1978. Their first task is to advise the Secretary of
State for Trade on the provision of a new airport to accommodate in the longer
term the growth in the demand for air transport expected in the London area,
and the Study Group has identified six locations in the south-east for further
consideration.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office, founded in 1657, provides postal, telecommunications, data
processing and Giro services. It was set up as a public authority under the
Post Office Act 1969, having previously been a government department. The
chairman and other members of the board are appointed by the Secretary of
State for Industry. With some 411,000 employees, it is the largest commercial
employer in Europe. The Government intends to separate the Post Office into
two corporations, one for postal and Giro services and the other for telecom¬
munications, and legislation to create a new telecommunications corporation is
being prepared.
In 1978-79 the Post Office’s income, excluding internal transactions, was
.£4,619 million and a profit of £375'1 million was recorded, with profits of
£347-1 million on telecommunications and £33-1 million on posts. Capital
expenditure on fixed assets amounted to £1,032 million in 1978-79. Some £74

million a year is spent on research and development, mostly at the Post Office’s
research centre at Martlesham Heath (Suffolk).
The Post Office pioneered postal services and was the first service to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance payment for mail. It provides
deliveries each working day to 22 million addresses. In 1978-79 the Post Office
handled some 172 million parcels and 9,793 million items of other correspondence
(including 9,338 million inland letters).
Postal operations are being mechanised and by 1982 there will be a national
network of 83 mechanised high-speed sorting offices. Large parcel centres,
each serving a group of counties, are gradually taking over the work of the
1,200 offices which handle parcels manually. Mechanised sorting is aided by
the use of postcodes, of which there are 1*5 million; Britain’s postcode system
is one of the most sophisticated in the world.
Britain has 22,800 post offices, of which nearly 1,600 are operated directly by
the Post Office and the remainder on an agency basis by sub-postmasters.
At a post office counter, besides making use of postal and telegraph facilities,
a person may draw a pension or a family allowance, buy a dog licence, a tele¬
vision receiving licence, renew a motor vehicle licence, obtain a British visitor’s
passport, buy national insurance stamps, and use the facilities of the National
Sayings Bank (see p 352) and of the National Girobank (see p 351). In much
of its counter service the Post Office acts as agent for government departments
and local authorities.
The Post Office provides a range of 40 specialist services, mainly for com¬
merce. Datapost’, a door-to-door overnight delivery service originally for
computer data, has been expanded to include documents, medical samples
and spare parts, and handles 3 million packets a year. There are International
Oatapost links with 16 countries. An 'Expresspost’ messenger service, for
rapid delivery of mail within or between cities, was started in London in
1976 and has been extended to 15 centres. About one-third of the Post Office’s
philatelic business, which mainly involves the sale of stamps to collectors or
dealers, is conducted by the Philatelic Bureau in Edinburgh. The British
Postal Consultancy Service offers advice and assistance on all aspects of postal
business to overseas postal administrations, and over 20 countries have used
its services.
Britain has over 25 million telephones, 16 million exchange connections, 80,000
telex connections and 57,000 data transmission modems (more than in any
country except the United States). The Post Office’s telecommunications
business employs 233,000 people, has assets of nearly £6,700 million, and runs
eight factories and a fleet of nearly 52,000 telecommunications vehicles.
In 1978-79 some 19,306 million telephone calls were made in Britain com¬
prising 16,100 million local calls, 3,022 million trunk calls and 184 million
international calls. Subscribers dial virtually all local and trunk telephone calls,
and about 90 per cent of international calls are dialled direct. Some 92 per cent
of Britain’s telephone subscribers can dial direct to 85 countries. To back up its
nationwide system of cables, the Post Office has built a network of radio towers
for transmitting telephone calls, television programmes and computer data over
microwave channels.

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Several specialised services are available by telephone, including the ‘999’
emergency dialling service enabling subscribers to be connected rapidly and
free of charge to the police, ambulance or fire brigade. Of the 618 million calls
made to recorded information services in 1978-79, over 430 million were to
the speaking clock. Other services include Dial a Disc, weather forecasts,
sports results, motoring information, recipes, bedtime stories and Financial
Times Index and Business News Summary.
Over 1,100 electronic exchanges are in use in Britain and nearly 500 more have
been ordered. They are more reliable than conventional electro-mechanical
exchanges as they have very few moving parts and so require less maintenance.
Most electronic exchanges are of the TXE2 type, with a capacity of up to
7,000 lines. Larger TXE4 exchanges, with a capacity of up to 40,000 lines,
have been brought into service since 1976, and the first orders for an improved
version, the TXE4A, have been placed.
The demand for international calls is doubling every four or five years and the
Post Office has increased the amount of equipment in its international exchanges
substantially and raised the number of cable and satellite circuits linking Britain
with other countries from nearly 3,000 in 1970 to over 13,000 in mid-1979.
Nearly 70 per cent of the intercontinental telephone traffic to or from Britain is
carried by satellite. Three aerials at the Goonhilly earth station in Cornwall
provide commercial telecommunications services via high-capacity geostationary
satellites positioned over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. A fourth aerial is
sending test speech and television signals to the European Space Agency’s
orbital test satellite, as the first step in the European Communications Satellite
project (the responsibility of Eutelsat, an organisation set up by the telecom¬
munication administrations of 17 European countries) intended to provide
high-capacity links across Europe and the Mediterranean to meet future demand
for international telephone calls and live television pictures. Britain has the second
largest interest, after the United States, in Intelsat, the world space communica¬
tions satellite network. A second earth station at Madley near Hereford, opened
in 1978, is helping the Post Office to cope with the growth in international
traffic. It carries about 1 million calls a month between Britain and some 40
other countries via the Indian Ocean Intelsat satellite.
There are some 30 submarine cables, covering a total of 6,671 nautical
miles (12,350 kilometres), from Britain to the continent of Europe, the Irish
Republic and the Faroe Islands, and three cables between Britain and North
America.
The Post Office’s ‘Prestel’ service, the world’s first public viewdata service
(in which information can be obtained through the telephone network from a
computer and displayed on a suitably equipped television set in words and
simple graphics), was inaugurated in London for householders in March 1979 and
for business users in September 1979. (A public test service had been in operation
since 1978.) In 1980 Prestel will be extended to a number of other areas. Some
156,000 ‘pages’ of information are being provided from over 160 sources.
Information is available on a wide range of subjects such as Government
services, financial services, jobs and careers, housing, travel and sports results.
Prestel centres have been or are to be established in London, Birmingham,
Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester and Norwich. The Post Office has
exported the system to telecommunications authorities in a number of countries.

The Post Office provides day-to-day communications links and radio services
for shipping of all nations through one long-range and 11 medium-range radio
stations around the coastline of Britain. At all medium-range stations a con¬
tinuous watch is maintained on the international distress frequencies, as part
of a safety of life at sea service provided on behalf of the Department of Trade.
A number of remotely controlled short-range coast radio stations provide
radiotelephone links with ships at sea at a range of up to 50 miles (80 kilometres).
Britain, through the Post Office, has the third largest share in the International
Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) Organisation, which came into existence in
July 1979 and will provide satellite capacity to improve maritime communi¬
cations. A fifth aerial will be built at Goonhilly in Cornwall and INMARSAT’S
headquarters will be set up in London.
Oil and gas production platforms in the North Sea are linked to Britain’s
telecommunications network by transhorizon radio. Two new radio stations
have been built in south Shetland and one near Fraserburgh (Grampian).
Post Office Datel services provide for transmission of information for com¬
puters and other automatic processors. A wide variety of data transmission
facilities, at speeds from 50 bits a second to 50,000 bits a second, are provided
using Post Office circuits. The services consist of a suitable telegraph or tele¬
phone line and, when necessary, a modem (which converts digital signals into
voice frequencies for transmission). An internationally compatible Datel
service at 2,400 bits a second was introduced in 1977.
The British telex service is fully automatic. Demand for inland and international
telex services is growing and the number of connections has more than doubled
since 1971. Customers can dial direct to 135 countries and 98 per cent of all
international calls are dialled direct. Britain’s first computer-controlled telex
exchange handling international automatic calls was installed in London in
1978 and a second is due to be brought into operation in 1981.
International telegrams are transmitted through the Post Office’s computer-
controlled Telegram Retransmission Centre in London. It is one of the largest
in the world, and has direct access via satellite, cable and radio circuits to over
90 terminals in 80 countries.
The Post Office is developing several new telecommunications services other
than Prestel. A radiopaging service, providing direct dialling access over the
public telephone network to small lightweight portable receivers, is already
operating in two areas (Greater London and the Thames Valley) and is to be
extended to a number of other areas, while a national service is to be established
in 1980.
The Post Office Experimental Packet Switched Service for sending computer
data came into full operation in 1977 and was the first experimental public
service of its type in Europe. It will be followed in the early 1980s by a fully
commercial packet switched service. Similar services are available to the United
States and will be extended into the continent of Europe. As a start to its
European services, the Post Office is participating in the European Community’s
‘Euronet’ project which gives access to European databases through a packet
switching network.

DATA
PROCESSING
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
A series of new switching and associated systems for telephone exchanges,
known as System X, using microelectronics technology, integrated digital
transmission and switching, stored program (software) control and common
channel signalling, has been developed. The first prototype exchanges are
expected to enter service in 1981 and the first production exchanges in 1983.
A Post Office facsimile transmission service, ‘Fonofax’, is due to be opened
on a limited basis within Britain later in 1979.
The Post Office has a corporate Data Processing Service for internal services,
and a comprehensive bureau service, known as National Data Processing, for
industry and commerce. It operates some of the most comprehensive data
processing systems in Europe and has implemented more than 400 projects.
As a major industrial country, Britain has a labour force with high levels of
technical and commercial skills. To ensure as far as possible that the working
population, like the country’s other economic resources, is fully utilised, the
Government intervenes in the labour market in a number of ways: by providing
employment services supplementing the training undertaken by employers; by
policies to promote regional development and labour mobility; by measures to
alleviate unemployment; through legislation to regulate terms and conditions
of employment and improve industrial relations; and through legislation relating
to health and safety at work.
THE WORKING POPULATION
T he total working population of Britain at the middle of June 1978 was 26*4
million, about 48 per cent of the total population. If the unemployed, the self-
employed, and the Armed Forces are omitted from the working population,
there remained 227 million employees (13-4 million men and 9-4 million
women) in employment. The percentage of women (particularly those working
part-time) in the labour force continues to rise, although at a reduced rate
compared with previous years. The great majority of the working population
work for a wage or salary, but nearly 2 million are employers or self-employed.
The working population increased slowly until 1966, then declined between
1966 and 1971, since when it has been rising again (see Table 25). One reason
for the fall after 1966 was the increased number in full-time education. During
the next few years both the male and female labour forces are expected to
continue to increase. In June 1978 men accounted for 59 per cent of all employees
and women for 41 per cent (about two-fifths of whom worked part-time).

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The distribution of employees by industry in 1970 and 1978 is shown in
Table 26.
The most notable trend in the employment pattern during the last decade has
been the transfer of employment from manufacturing to service industries.
Technological developments have increased automation, with a consequently
reduced demand for manpower, and have assisted the growth of manufacturing
capacity in other countries, particularly developing ones. New and, in some
cases, cheaper services have been introduced through advances in technology,
while improvements in living standards have led to an increasing demand for
services. There is considerable public discussion of the social and economic
effects of micro-electronic technology, in particular, and these effects are under
consideration by the Central Policy Review Staff.
MANPOWER POLICY
In Great Britain the Department of Employment is generally responsible for
employment policy, industrial relations and pay policy, and for the payment of
unemployment benefit, but the Manpower Services Commission (MSC) advises
the Government on manpower policy issues.

nine other members appointed after consultation with employers and employees,
and local government and educational interests. Scottish and Welsh committees
of the MSC consider special Scottish and Welsh aspects of manpower issues and
bring these to the attention of the respective Secretaries of State. Most of the
MSC’s activities are financed from public funds; expenditure in 1978-79
amounted to £509 million (plus £134 million on behalf of the Department
of Employment). The A'ISC is advised by a network of district manpower
committees on which employers, employees and other local interests are
represented.
The MSC’s main statutory duty is to make such arrangements as it considers
appropriate, within a general policy framework agreed with the Department of
Employment, for assisting people to select, train for, obtain and retain employ¬
ment, and for assisting employers to obtain suitable employees. The services
in Northern Ireland are run on similar lines by the Department of Manpower
Services.
The main public employment services (other than the careers service) are
provided in Great Britain by the MSC’s employment service division, the
principal aim of which is to provide a comprehensive service for employers
needing staff and for people, whether or not already in employment, seeking
jobs. It operates through a network of about 1,000 local employment offices
and ‘jobcentres’ which handle all occupations except professional, scientific,
technical and managerial, for which Professional and Executive Recruitment
(PER) is responsible. Jobcentres, where the provision of self-service facilities
for job-seekers is a standard feature, are gradually replacing employment offices
where such facilities do not always exist.
Though use of the service by both employers and job-seekers is voluntary,
in the year to March 1979 over 6 million people registered for employment'
27 million vacancies were notified and i-8 million were placed in employment!
Special employment services include services for disabled people, occupational
guidance, services to assist the geographical mobility of workers, Professional
and Executive Recruitment and the Careers Service.
The public employment service has long provided a resettlement service to
disabled people. This is provided by over 500 specially trained Disablement
Resettlement Officers (DROs) who can advise on rehabilitation and training
courses and on the comprehensive range of special schemes and facilities avail¬
able. They can also advise employers on aspects of employing disabled people,
including grants available for adaptation to premises and equipment in order
to employ or retrain a specific disabled person. The DROs administer the quota
scheme which, under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944, requires
employers to include 3 per cent registered disabled people among their work¬
force. Employment rehabilitation is provided at 27 centres (including one
linked with a medical rehabilitation unit); in 1978 some 15,000 people attended
the wide range of courses available. The MSC also gives financial assistance to
voluntary and local authority bodies concerned with specific disabilities such as
blindness, cerebral palsy and psychiatric disorders; in 1978 more than 500 people
passed through these courses.
There are vocational training facilities for the disabled at ‘skillcentres’,
educational institutions and employers’ establishments. For the more seriously
disabled there are special residential training colleges run by voluntary organisa¬
tions with the help of the MSC’s training services division. Grants are available
320 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
to disabled people qualified to undertake study or training for professional or
comparable employment.
Sheltered employment is provided for the severely disabled in Great Britain
by Remploy Ltd, a non-profit making company, and in Northern Ireland by
Ulster Sheltered Employment Ltd, a company constituted similarly to Remploy,
and by local authorities and voluntary organisations. The MSC also works in
close co-operation with the National Advisory Council on Employment of
Disabled People.
In 1978 the MSC and the Northern Ireland Department of Manpower
Services helped with the cost of providing places for over 13,500 severely
disabled people, of which approximately 1,900 were blind or partially sighted
and some 190 were trainees.
Occupational Occupational Guidance is a free advisory service available to anyone seeking
Guidance advice on changing or choosing a job. It operates through a national network
of 49 occupational guidance units, helping about 50,000 people a year. The
service is based on interviews with specially trained staff who can call on the
services of occupational psychologists if necessary.
Geographical In order to ease unemployment, particularly in the special development and
Mobility Schemes development areas, the MSC administers various grants and allowances under
the Employment Transfer Scheme to enable the unemployed, and those under
threat of redundancy, to take up jobs in other areas; and the Job Search Scheme
to provide the cost of fares and subsistence in order to attend interviews and
to move to other areas temporarily to look for work. Similar schemes are operated
in Northern Ireland by the Department of Manpower Services.
Professional and Executive Recruitment (PER) provides a specialist employ¬
ment service at managerial, professional, scientific and technical levels. It is
organised separately from the rest of the MSC and operates through a network
of 38 offices staffed by experienced consultants. PER has a computer-assisted
matching and selection system but also offers an interviewing service and an
advertising service. The service is free to candidates, while employers are
charged a fee based on the starting salary. A broadly similar service, known as
Professional and Executive Personnel and free to both employers and candidates,
is operated in Northern Ireland.
Careers Service Local education authorities have a statutory obligation under the Employment
and Training Act 1973 to provide a careers service, a vocational guidance
service for people attending all educational institutions (except universities) and
an employment service for those leaving them. Authorities also provide an
employment service for people, especially young people, in their early years at
work. There is close co-operation with the MSC’s employment service division
which also caters for those who have left school and choose to use its facilities
in preference to those of the careers service.
In Northern Ireland the careers service is an integral part of the Department
of Manpower Services.
The Careers and Occupational Information Centre publishes a wide range of
material to help people looking for jobs to make an informed choice, and distri¬
butes careers literature to some 15,000 schools, careers offices and other centres.
Immigrant In general, people coming to Britain for employment (including Commonwealth

other European Community countries and Gibraltar) need a work permit
issued by the Department of Employment. This must be applied for by the
prospective employer for a specific person and is issued for a specific job and
for a fixed period not exceeding 12 months in the first instance. People
admitted as holders of work permits may change their jobs only with the approval
of the Department of Employment. Normally further leave to remain will be
given on application to the Home Office if they remain in approved employment.
Under current immigration rules the Home Office will consider an application
to remove the conditions attached to their stay after four years in approved
employment, and if granted, a worker may change employment without restric¬
tion. Among other conditions, work permits are issued only for work requiring
a professional qualification, skill or experience, where the Department of
Employment is satisfied that the worker is necessary and there is no suitable
resident worker to fill the post, and where the wages and conditions are not less
favourable than for similar work. For many occupations it is proposed to raise
the lower age for a permit from 18 to 23 on 1 January 1980.
Permits for nursing auxiliaries and resident domestic workers in hospitals,
schools and similar establishments and private households are subject to overall
numerical limits decided annually. Applications for such employment are only
accepted from nationals of countries in Europe. Permits for resident domestic
employment are issued only for unmarried people and for married couples if
they are to work in a joint post. They are not issued to those with children
under 16 years of age. Permits for nursing auxiliaries are issued only for un¬
married people without dependants.
Commonwealth citizens and foreign nationals (other than nationals of
European Community countries and Gibraltar) are generally eligible for permits
on the same terms. In addition, Commonwealth citizens may be admitted for
fixed periods of training ‘on the job’ arranged in advance if they hold trainee
permits issued by the Department of Employment. Foreign nationals may also
enter Britain as holders of student employee permits for short-term employment
to enable them to improve their English and widen their business experience.
European Community regulations establish the right of workers to move
freely between member States for the purposes of employment. European
Community workers entering another member State are entitled to be treated
in the same way as nationals of that State as regards facilities of the national
employment services, pay and working conditions, trade union rights, vocational
training and retraining facilities, access to housing and property, and social
security and industrial injury benefits. Workers who wish to remain in the
United Kingdom for longer than an initial period of six months must apply to
the Home Office for a residence permit. If they are in permanent employment
the residence permit is normally valid for five years. If the employment is
temporary (that is, for less than a year) the permit is valid for the expected
duration of the employment.
The Department of Employment operates a Race Relations Employment
Advisory Service with advisers based in the main areas where ethnic minorities
have settled. Its general aim is to promote equal opportunity in employment
regardless of race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, and its advisers
offer help and guidance to employers and unions on a wide range of issues which
arise in the employment of a multi-racial workforce.
In common with many other industrial countries, unemployment in Britain
rose in the 1970s to the highest level for 40 years, though there was a gradual

decline in the seasonally adjusted level of unemployment from the end of 1977 to
mid-1979.
Unemployment has been relatively low in the south-east of England, and
consistently higher in those parts of the country which have the greatest de¬
pendence on shipbuilding, and certain branches of the heavy engineering and
metal manufacturing industries, notably parts of Scotland and Wales, and north¬
east England and Merseyside. The general unemployment rate in Great Britain
in August 1979 was 5-1 per cent: the areas with the highest rates were Wales
and Scotland and the north of England.
The unemployment rate in Northern Ireland has remained higher than in
other parts of the United Kingdom. In August 1979 it was 10-5 per cent of all
employees.
A succession of selected measures has been introduced since the autumn of 1975
with the purpose of mitigating the effects of high unemployment by providing
job or training opportunities for people who would otherwise be unemployed.
The level of the measures reached a peak early in 1978, when some 350,000 were
benefiting from them. Since then the numbers supported have fallen (at the
end of August 1979 the figure was 329,000). In mid-1979 some of the arrange¬
ments were changed to concentrate them in the areas where unemployment is
highest and the need for special assistance greatest and the special measures are
expected to take more people off the unemployment register in 1979 than in 1978.
The measures include: a scheme to encourage employers to use short-time
working as an alternative to redundancies; a small firms employment subsidy for
extra jobs provided by small manufacturing firms in certain areas; a youth oppor¬
tunities programme to provide a range of training and work experience opportuni¬
ties to unemployed 16-18 year olds; a special temporary employment programme
to provide worthwhile temporary jobs for adults in special development areas,
development areas and designated inner city areas, who have been unemployed
for a long time; a ‘job release’ scheme to encourage older workers, approaching
pensionable age, to leave work early and release jobs for younger unemployed
people; a ‘job introduction’ scheme for disabled people; and support for training
places in industry.
The main responsibility for carrying out industrial and commercial training
lies with individual employers, but in recent years the MSC, with government
support, has evolved a comprehensive strategy to help to improve the supply
of trained manpower needed by the economy, to provide opportunities for
individuals to acquire new skills, and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness
of training generally. The MSC’s Training Services Directorate is responsible
for putting these programmes into effect.
There are 23 industrial training boards and one industrial training committee,
covering firms employing about 60 per cent of all employees, which are respon¬
sible for promoting training in their respective industries. They receive
Exchequer funds to meet their advisory service and other costs and to enable
them to pay grants to employers to encourage training activities of national
importance (supplemented, during periods of economic recession, by special
grants to support craft and technician training). The boards’ five-year strategies
and short-term operating plans and budgets are agreed with the MSC.
The MSC also promotes training for some 10 million people employed in
industries not covered by industrial training boards, maintaining liaison with
major training organisations in this sector.

The Training Opportunities Scheme (TOPS) is intended to supplement the
training given in industry and commerce by providing individuals over the age
of 19 with the opportunity to acquire new skills. Training is carried out at 69
skillcentres’ and at many colleges and employers’ establishments. Skillcentre
courses concentrate mainly on engineering, construction and automotive trades
and those at colleges on clerical and commercial skills.
Special priority has been given to expanding and developing technician
training particularly for computer operations. In addition, electronics engineer¬
ing courses biased towards micro-electronics and micro-processor applications
have been established in several centres. In all about 600 different courses are
available in a wide range of occupations. Trainees are paid allowances which
vary with domestic responsibilities and may receive, among other things, an
earnings-related supplement, travelling expenses and a lodging allowance. Some
70,000 adults were trained under TOPS in 1978-79.
The MSC also provides a number of other direct training services to employers.
The Training Within Industry scheme is intended to develop the skills of
supervisors in developing leadership, instructing and communicating, improv¬
ing methods and improving safety practices. Special courses are also available
for supervisors employed in offices. Courses in international trade procedures
are available for staff employed in export/import offices. Courses in instruc¬
tional techniques are available to skillcentre staff and industrial and commercial
firms at the MSC’s two instructor training colleges (one in England and one in
Scotland) and at three instructor training units attached to skillcentres. In-plant
courses are also available.
Employers are able to sponsor their own employees for refresher and up¬
grading training at skillcentres, on courses designed specifically to meet the
needs of the employer and of the employees concerned. There is also a comple¬
mentary mobile instructor service for employers, which provides specific
training for employees in their own workshops.
Training services at skillcentres and courses at instructor training colleges
are also available to trainees from overseas. These facilities are increasingly
being used by overseas governments and organisations, and in every case
programmes are structured to meet agreed training objectives.
EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION LAW
Britain has been a pioneer in the introduction of protective legislation for the
safety, health and welfare of employees. The determination by statute of
minimum wages, holidays and holiday pay was until recently confined in
principle to those trades and industries where the organisation of employers or
workers, or both, was inadequate to negotiate collective agreements and to
ensure their observance. However, recent legislation, consolidated in the
Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, provides considerable safe¬
guards for employees in their terms of employment.
An employer is required to give employees written information on their
terms and conditions of employment, the disciplinary rules applicable to them
and the procedure available where an employee has a grievance about his or her
employment or is dissatisfied with any disciplinary decision; minimum periods
of notice when employment is to be terminated are also laid down for both
employers and employees. Employees with a minimum period of service of 104
weeks are entitled to lump-sum redundancy payments if their jobs cease to
exist (for example, because of technological improvements or a fall in demand)
324
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and their employers cannot offer suitable alternative work, the cost being partly
met from a fund subscribed to by industry. Protection against unfair dismissal
is provided by machinery under which an employee may complain against an
employer of unfair dismissal, and, if successful, obtain reinstatement, re¬
engagement or compensation. Legal support is given to the right to trade union
organisation by making it unfair to dismiss a person because of membership or
participation in the activities of an independent trade union; rights of employees
are also protected in regard to penalisation short of dismissal because of trade
union membership or activities. Other rights which are maintained in the Act
include payment when work is not available for reasons other than as a result of
a trade dispute, and maternity rights for female employees, including protection
from dismissal because of pregnancy, maternity pay, and the right to return to
work after confinement (although proposals put forward for discussion by the
Government wmdd restrict some of these maternity rights in some cases).
Discrimination The Race Relations Act 1976 (see p 148) makes unlawful discrimination on
grounds of colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national
origin, in employment, training and related matters. Employers may not dis¬
criminate when recruiting workers or in their treatment of employees in regard
to their terms and conditions of employment, promotion, transfer, training and
access to other benefits, or to their dismissal.
The employment provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act (see p 146) make
sex discrimination unlawful in employment, training and related matters. An
employer may not discriminate between men and women either in recruitment
or in treatment of existing employees in such matters as promotion, training,
transfer, benefits, facilities and dismissal. It is also unlawful for a married person
to be treated less favourably than an unmarried person of the same sex.
PAY, HOURS OF WORK AND HOLIDAYS
Wage Rates Pay for manual occupations, and increasingly for non-manual occupations, is
and Earnings normally set by collective bargaining (see p 330). In a small number of industries
and trades legally enforceable minimum rates are set by wages councils.
Basic rates of pay vary widely, though in private industry local rates normally
exceed the rates specified in national agreements. Higher rates are usually paid
for overtime and shift work, and weekly earnings may be further increased by
incentive bonus schemes. Piecework, or payment-by-results, is still common,
though of declining importance as production methods in many industries
increasingly dictate employees’ output.
According to the latest annual survey conducted by the Department of
Employment into earnings and hours of work, the average weekly earnings of
full-time male adult manual workers in April 1979 were, including overtime,
£93; while for full-time female adult manual workers they were £55-20. The
corresponding figures for non-manual workers were £113 and £66. Women’s
earnings are thus markedly lower than those of men, partly because on
average they work shorter hours, with less overtime paid at premium rates,
and partly because they tend to be concentrated in the less well-paid jobs. The
Equal Pay Act 1970 requires that a woman doing the same or broadly similar
work as a man, or work that has been given equal value by job evaluation,
should receive equal pay and conditions of employment.
Between April 1970 and April 1979 the average weekly earnings of manual
workers before tax and national insurance deductions increased by 248 per cent
for men and by 305 per cent for women. Part of this was offset by a rise in retail

and income tax payments. For trends between 1974 and 1979 in earnings, wage
rates, retail prices, and wages and salaries per unit of output, see the diagram
above.
Remuneration in commercial, technical and professional careers is normally by
annual salary paid monthly, often on a scale carrying annual increments, and
such careers generally afford opportunities for promotion to posts with higher
remuneration. Starting salaries may be in the range of £3,000 to £3,500 (lower
for trainees from 16-18 years of age and higher for some graduates entering
industry).

command salaries in the range of ^12,000 to £18,000 a year gross before tax.
The posts with salaries in the range of £18,000 to £35,000 a year include those
of Cabinet Ministers, top-ranking judicial appointments, the highest positions
in government departments and the largest municipal authorities, editors of
daily newspapers, some persons outstanding in their professions and in the
higher managerial posts in industry, commerce and banking. Salaries of chairmen
of major companies may exceed £50,000 a year gross, and highly successful
people (such as star entertainers) often receive more through fees or fixed
contracts. The range of net incomes in the country as a whole is, however,
reduced by a system of progressive taxation.
The normal working week in Britain is in the range 39-40 hours for manual
work and 37-38 for non-manual work; a five-day week is usually worked.
Actual hours worked in manual occupations differ from their standard hours;
in October 1978 they were 44-2 for men compared with 37-4 for women. Men
and women in non-manual occupations generally work less overtime than
manual workers.
National legislation limits and defines permissible hours of work for women
and young people in a number of industries or trades—the maximum, with
limited exceptions, being 48 hours a week and 10 hours a day (9 hours a day for
6-day-week workers) in premises covered by the Factories Act for adult women
over 18 and young people between 16 and 18. The employment of women and
young people at night is prohibited in industrial undertakings, except for
young men over 16 working in some continuous-process industries (subject to
certain conditions). The Department of Employment can make exemptions
from these restrictions on grounds of public interest. In general the hours of
work of adult men, or of people not working in factories, are not restricted by
statute.
Holiday entitlements are normally determined by collective agreements. These
generally provide for at least three weeks paid holiday a year. However about
one-third of manual workers covered by agreements have entitlements of four
weeks. Non-manual workers generally have longer holidays than manual workers.
Additional holidays, dependent upon length of service, are also quite common.
In addition to annual holidays, most agreements provide for bank holidays
or public holidays. In England and Wales, in addition to Christmas Day and
Good Friday, regular bank holidays take place on New Year’s Day, Easter
Monday, the first Monday in May, the last Monday in May, the last Monday
in August and 26 December. In Scotland public holidays are declared locally;
regular bank holidays are New Year’s Day, 2 January, Good Friday, the first
Monday in May, the last Monday in May, the first Monday in August, Christmas
Day and 26 December. The English and Welsh bank holidays apply also to
Northern Ireland, where in addition St Patrick’s Day (17 March) and 12 and 13
July are public holidays; in certain areas the Tuesday after Easter is also a
customary holiday for industry and trade.
Provision for an alternative day to be observed is made when any bank or
public holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday.
A variety of additional benefits exist in varying degree. About half of employees
in employment are covered by occupational pension schemes (see p 138). Many
employees are also covered by occupational sick pay schemes, additional or
complementary to the State schemes (see p 141), and by schemes to provide
private medical treatment. A smaller number are covered by schemes for redun-

dancy payments above the statutory minimum. Such benefits are more usual
among clerical and professional employees receiving a standard salary than
among manual workers, who have a chance to increase their pay—for example,
by working overtime. Employees may have use of a company car and some firms
provide profit-sharing and share-saving schemes.
Social security benefits, which include unemployment, sickness and industrial
injury benefits, are described in the Social Welfare chapter.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
1 he structure of industrial relations in Britain has been established mainly on
a voluntary basis. The system is based chiefly on the organisation of employees
and employers into trade unions and employers’ associations, and on freely
conducted negotiations between them at all levels. The State is ready to provide
assistance where the organisation of employees, employers, or both, is inadequate
to conduct negotiations, or where the usual methods of resolving disagreements
have failed.
According to figures published by the International Labour Office covering the
mining, manufacturing, construction and transport industries, over the ten years
1968-77 Britain lost fewer days per 1,000 employees through industrial disputes
than several other major industrial countries; official figures show some improve¬
ment in industrial relations in 1978 compared with both 1977 and the annual
average for the previous ten years but the trend in 1979 was unfavourable.
Northern Ireland’s industrial relations record is generally better than that of
the rest of Britain, with proportionately fewer disputes and working days lost
through strikes over the last ten years.
In nearly all industries and occupations some workers (and in some industries
nearly all workers) are organised into trade unions. These have grown up
gradually and independently over many years and, consequently, their form
and organisation vary considerably, as do their traditions. In the last decade or
so, trade unionism has again increased particularly among clerical, supervisory,
technical and administrative workers. Trade unions may be organised either by
occupation (for example, they may recruit clerks or fitters wherever employed)
or by industry. Some are based on a combination of both principles. In some
firms membership of the relevant trade union is required by agreement between
the employer and union ( closed shops’). At the end of 1977 the total member¬
ship of British trade unions was 127 million. There were 480 unions, but nearly
80 per cent of all trade unionists were in the 26 largest unions, each with a
membership of 100,000 or over, while only o-6 per cent were in the 263 smallest
unions with under 1,000 members each.
The Certification Officer appointed under the Employment Protection Act
I975 required to maintain a list of trade unions. To be eligible for entry on
the list a trade union must show that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the regulation of relations between
workers and employers, or between workers and employers’ associations.
Under the Employment Protection Act 1975 and other legislation, certain
rights and privileges are reserved for independent trade unions. A trade union
on the list may apply to the Certification Officer for a certificate that it is inde¬
pendent of employers, such a certificate being considered conclusive evidence of
independence.
328
Trades Union
Congress
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The central organisation of most large unions consists of a national executive
council, usually elected by and responsible to the annual conference of delegates
from local branches. Between conferences, councils are the highest authority of
unions, and carry out policy decisions made by conference delegates. Most
unions also have regional and district organisations. At the level of the individual
member there are local branches, covering one or more workplaces. Members
may attend branch meetings, make suggestions about terms and conditions of
employment, discuss the work of the union, and take part in the election of the
union’s officers. The branch takes action on certain matters considered to be
entirely, or mainly, of local interest and forwards its views on wider issues for
action by the union’s national or regional bodies. The organising of members in
individual places of work, and the negotiation of local pay agreements with
managements at the factory or plant, may be done by full-time district officials
of the union, or, increasingly, by ‘shop stewards’, who are chosen by their
fellow members in the place of work to represent them. Trade unions vary in
the degree to which shop stewards are integrated into their organisation. Where
two or more unions have members in the same workplace, shop stewards’
committees may be formed to discuss matters of common concern.
Unions often provide dispute benefit (‘strike pay’) for members involved in
official industrial action. They also provide legal advice for members who suffer
injury or contract diseases at work, and may pay members’ legal costs where a
case for compensation goes to court. Some unions pay benefits in case of illness,
accident, death and retirement (additional to those payable under the national
insurance scheme) financed out of membership contributions. Many trade
unions are affiliated to the Labour Party, although individual members may opt
out of paying that part of their affiliation fees which is paid to the Labour Party.
In Britain the national centre of the trade union movement is the Trades Union
Congress (TUC), which was founded in 1868. The TUC’s objects are to pro¬
mote the interests of its affiliated organisations and to improve the economic and
social conditions of working people. Its affiliated membership comprises 112
trade unions which together represent 11-9 million workpeople, or 94 per cent
of all trade unionists in Britain. The TUC deals with all general questions which
concern trade unions both nationally and internationally and gives assistance on
questions relating to particular trades or industries.
The annual Congress convenes in September to discuss matters of concern to
trade unionists and to employees generally. It elects a General Council which
represents it between Congresses and is responsible for carrying out Congress
decisions, watching economic and social developments, providing educational
and advisory services to unions, and presenting to the Government the trade
union viewpoint on economic, social and industrial issues. The council is also
empowered to mediate in inter-union disputes in certain circumstances, and
uses its authority to deal with unauthorised and unconstitutional stoppages of
work, as well as official disputes.
The TUC as well as many individual unions conduct extensive educational
services for members, mainly concerned with industrial subjects, trade unionism
and the principles and practice of industrial relations.
The TUC plays an active part in international trade union activity, through
its affiliations to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and the
European Trade Union Confederation. It also nominates the British workers’
delegation to the annual International Labour Conference.
There are eight TUC regional councils in England, based on the Govern¬
ment’s eight planning regions (see p 170) with a further similar body for Wales

TIONS

known as the Wales Trades Union Council. These bodies, whose function is to
make representations to the Government’s various regional bodies, co-ordinate
the activities of trade unions in the regions and keep them in touch with the
policy of the TUC at national level.
Scottish trade unions also have their own national central body, the Scottish
Trades Union Congress (STUC), which in many respects is similar in con¬
stitution and function to the TUC. Trade unions whose membership includes
Scottish workers may affiliate to the STUC and a number of trade unions are
in fact affiliated to both bodies. Trade unions in Northern Ireland are represented
by the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions
(ICTU), though the majority of trade unionists in Northern Ireland belong to
unions based in Great Britain. Almost 90 per cent of Northern Ireland trade
unionists are members of organisations affiliated to the ICTU, while the majority
belong to unions which are also affiliated to the TUC.
Many employers in Britain are members of employers’ organisations, a large
number of which are wholly or partly concerned with labour matters. The
primary aims of such organisations are to help to establish suitable terms and
conditions of employment, including a sound wage structure and proper
standards of safety, health and welfare; to promote good relations with employees
and the efficient use of manpower; and to provide means of settling any disputes
which may arise. They may also represent members’ points of view as manu¬
facturers or traders to the Government on commercial matters.
Employers’ organisations are usually organised on an industry basis rather
than a product basis. A few are purely local in character or deal with a section of
an industry; others are national in scope and are concerned with the whole of an
industry. In some of the main industries there are local or regional organisations
combined into national federations, while in others, within which different
firms are engaged in making different principal products, there is a complex
structure with national and regional federations for parts of an industry as well
as for the industry as a whole. Altogether there are some 150 national employers’
organisations, which negotiate the national collective agreements for their
industry with the trade unions concerned. Many of these national organisations
belong to the Confederation of British Industry.
The final authority of local or small national organisations may be a meeting
where all member firms are directly represented; but in larger organisations
some form of indirect representation is necessary, either through local organisa¬
tions or through regions or sections into which these are grouped.
The representatives thus chosen, together with a number of office holders,
form a general council or central committee, which meets perhaps once a
quarter, mainly to make major policy decisions, to elect committees and to ratify
their work. A paid staff under a director or secretary carries out the day-to-day
work of the organisation. There is usually a small working group, consisting
of senior officials and committee chairmen, which meets to deal with urgent
questions and co-ordinate the work of committees. Employers’ associations (as
defined in the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974) may apply to the
Certification Officer for inclusion in the list of employers’ associations maintained
by the officer.
The central body of employers is the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
which deals with all matters affecting the interests of employers and represents
them nationally to the Government and the public and also internationally, for
33° BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
instance, in the International Labour Organisation and in the various institutions
of the European Community. It is also the British member of the Union of
Industries of the European Communities and the Business and Industry Advis¬
ory Committee to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
and a member of the British national committee of the International Chamber
of Commerce. The majority of national employers’ organisations and nationalised
industries and a large number of individual companies, both large and small,
belong to the CBI, whose representatives or nominees sit on various official
bodies and take part in the discussion of matters of importance to the national
economy through their membership of the National Economic Development
Council (see p 198).
Legal
Framework
Northern
Ireland
The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 defines the status of trade
unions and employers associations and sets out certain legal requirements
which they must observe. The Act confers immunities on trade unions in
respect of actions taken in support of a trade dispute, allows peaceful picketing,
and also provides that collective agreements shall not be legally enforceable
unless they are written agreements and specifically provide for this.
Subsequent legislation has extended the rights of employees in a number of
respects and strengthened voluntary collective bargaining. The Employment
Protection Act 1975 placed the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service
on a statutory basis, provided for the appointment of a Certification Officer and
for the setting up of the Central Arbitration Committee; and established an
Employment Appeal Tribunal to hear appeals concerning decisions of the
Certification Officer and of industrial tribunals. (Industrial tribunals are inde¬
pendent judicial bodies which deal, in general, with complaints from employees
on infringements of individual rights under a number of Acts concerning, for
example, redundancy payments, contracts of employment, equal pay, unfair
dismissals and sex discrimination.)
With the aim of achieving a balance between trade unions’ rights and obliga¬
tions, legislation is to be introduced, after consultations with the unions and
other parties concerned, to limit the right to picket to those in dispute picketing
their employer s premises and to protect those not concerned in the dispute; to
modify legislation on the closed shop to protect existing employees and those
with personal convictions about union membership, to give the right of appeal
against arbitrary exclusion or expulsion from a trade union and acceptance of a
closed shop only if an overwhelming majority is in favour of it; and to provide
financial aid for the holding of postal ballots for election to union office and other
decisions. A statutory code of practice on closed shops is also proposed.
Northern Ireland has a similar but separate system of industrial relations under
which certain responsibilities devolve upon the Labour Relations Agency.
Industrial relations legislation enacted in 1976 has brought the province largely
into line with similar legislation enacted in Great Britain since 1974.
COLLECTIVE In most industries terms and conditions of employment and procedures for
AND JOINT conc^uct °f industrial relations are settled by negotiation and agreement
CONSULTATION between employers and trade unions. Agreements may be industry-wide,
supplemented as necessary by informal local agreements in firms or factories,
or at firm and factory level (plant bargaining). In the public sector agreements
are generally reached at industry level. In some industries, firms and factories,
negotiations are conducted by meetings held when necessary, while in others,
joint negotiating councils or committees have been established on a permanent

basis. The scope of the various joint bodies (from the national joint industrial
councils for whole industries to the works councils and committees in individual
workplaces) varies widely, and has frequently been extended to cover such
additional matters as production plans, absenteeism, training, education and
welfare. Normally these arrangements for collective bargaining suffice to
settle all questions which are raised, but provision is sometimes made for
matters not so settled to be referred for settlement to independent conciliation
or arbitration. The Employment Protection Act 1975 made provision for
information needed for collective bargaining purposes to be disclosed by
employers to trade unions, subject to certain safeguards.
Standing arrangements exist for consultation at national level between the
Government, the TUC, the CBI, and the nationalised industries through the
National Economic Development Council on matters in which employers and
workers have a common interest. The operation of collective bargaining has
from time to time been restricted in an attempt to control inflation.
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) is charged with
the general duty of promoting the improvement of industrial relations, and in
particular of encouraging the extension of collective bargaining and the develop¬
ment and (where necessary) reform of collective bargaining machinery.
In 1976 ACAS was placed on a statutory basis under the Employment
Protection Act and is controlled by a council consisting of a chairman and nine
other members experienced in industrial relations, of which three are nominated
by the CBI, three by the TUC, and three are independent.
The service may offer conciliation in industrial disputes in both the public
and private sectors of industry where this is thought to be helpful, and has
discretion in meeting requests for conciliation subject only to the need to pay
regard to agreed procedures in the industry or area of employment concerned.
At the joint request of the parties in dispute, and having regard to the need to
safeguard negotiating procedures, ACAS may appoint single arbitrators or
boards of arbitration to settle disputes on the basis of agreed terms of reference.
Alternatively ACAS may refer cases for arbitration to the Central Arbitration
Committee (see below). Some 390 joint requests for arbitration were made to
ACAS during 1978.
Although ACAS has prime responsibility for intervention in disputes, the
Secretary of State retains powers to appoint a court of inquiry or committee of
investigation into a dispute, whether existing or foreseen.
The service gives advice on all aspects of industrial relations and personnel
management. It conducts surveys to diagnose the causes of industrial relations
problems and suggests remedial action to management and trade unions or
employee representatives. It also carries particular responsibility for attempting
conciliation on complaints of infringement of individual employee rights (such
as individual complaints of unfair dismissal, complaints under the Equal Pay
Act 1970 and complaints on employment matters under the Sex Discrimination
Act 1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976).
The service is concerned with the long-term improvement of collective
bargaining and, with the consent of the parties involved, conducts detailed
inquiries in particular firms or industries. It also considers claims by independent
trade unions that they should be recognised by an employer.
The Central Arbitration Committee (CAC) is a permanent body for the settle¬
ment of disputes by voluntary arbitration. Disputes may be referred to the

The committee is also called upon to arbitrate on claims made under various
Acts, including the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Employment Protection Act
1975, and acts as the independent tribunal to which the Secretary of State for
Employment refers questions relating to the payment of wages and conditions
of employment observed by Government contractors.
The need for better communication between management and workers has led
to movements towards greater participation by workers in industry and com¬
merce, that is towards enabling workers to have a more decisive voice in the way
in which their firms are run. This includes the experimental appointment of
directors from the trade unions or the workforce in some nationalised industries
and public corporations; moreover, some private sector companies have long
had a system of works councils, while others are conducting experiments in
greater worker participation in one form or another.
While industrial relations in government service and in the nationalised industries
are, in general, organised on the same principles as in private industry, there are
some special features.
Non-industrial employees in central Government service, are permitted and
encouraged to join the appropriate Civil Service unions and there is a highly
developed system of negotiation and joint consultation by means of the National
and Departmental Whitley Councils. Unresolved disputes may, subject to
certain limitations, be reported to the Secretary of State for reference to the
Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, an independent body appointed by the
Secretary of State. Government industrial employees are similarly encouraged
to belong to trade unions and there is machinery for joint consultation. Disputes
on wages or conditions of employment that cannot be resolved by the existing
machinery can be referred to the Central Arbitration Committee.
In local government service there are separate National Joint Councils for the
main grades of employees (such as manual, clerical and technical employees)
which deal with wages and conditions of service as well as other matters. There
are corresponding regional and district councils.
The major nationalised industries have a statutory duty to establish satisfactory
arrangements for collective bargaining and for joint consultation with their
employees; the British Steel Corporation and the Post Office have proceeded with
the appointment of worker directors.
Unlike firms in the private sector, the corporations are not usually members
of employers’ associations (although the majority are ‘public sector members’ of
the CBI). In some industries they are sole or main employers, but even where
part of the industry is in private hands, as for example in road transport,
the corporations are separately and directly represented on wage-negotiating
bodies.
Wages and conditions of service in the nationalised industries are generally
settled by negotiation between representatives of management and trade unions
at the national level; in most cases there are also regional and local bodies,
similarly representative, to deal with local issues but not normally to negotiate
separate local agreements. Most of the industries use the facilities for arbitration
offered to industry generally by the ACAS, but coalmining and rail transport
have their own special arrangements. Consultation at all levels, including the
workplace, has been arranged in all the nationalised industries.

The Office of Manpower Economics, established in 1971 as an independent
non-statutory body, acts as secretariat for the three review bodies set up to
advise on the remuneration of certain groups in the public sector for which
negotiating machinery is not appropriate, such as chairmen and members of
boards of nationalised industries, the higher judiciary and senior civil servants;
the armed forces; and doctors and dentists. It also services special inquiries on
particular pay structures and related problems.
In a number of industries and trades where the organisation of employers or
employees or both is not strong enough to provide a basis for successful voluntary
arrangements, there are statutory wage-regulating bodies, known as wages
councils. These are composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers
and employees in the respective sectors of industry, with three independent
members. Wages councils publish proposals for minimum remuneration,
holidays, holiday remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment.
After considering any representations the councils make orders giving statutory
force to such proposals. The Department of Employment’s Wages Inspectorate
enforces the provisions of these wages orders. About 2-7 million workers are
covered by such arrangements.
Agricultural wages boards (there are boards for England and Wales, for
Scotland and for Northern Ireland) perform similar functions in relation to
employment in agriculture.
The Secretary of State for Employment has power to convert a wages council
into a statutory joint industrial council (SJIC), a body which functions in the
same ways as a wages council, except that it has no independent members.
Such conversion is intended to assist in the development of collective bargaining,
an SJIC being seen as a half-way stage between the statutory system and full
voluntary collective bargaining.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
Employers have a duty at common and criminal law to take reasonable care of
their employees and provide a safe system of working, while employees have a
duty of care towards each other and also to take care of their own safety. In
addition, minimum required standards of safety in certain kinds of workplaces
or work are laid down under a number of statutes; some of these also deal with
health and welfare. The Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 reorganised the
system under which safety and health at work was safeguarded and extended it
to cover everyone at work and to further the protection of the general public
from industrial hazards.
The Health and Safety Commission, appointed by the Secretary of State for
Employment after consultation with the TUC, CBI and local authorities, has
responsibility for supervising the application and enforcement of health and
safety legislation. Its operational arm is the Health and Safety Executive, consist¬
ing largely of the government inspectorates covering factories, mines and
quarries, agriculture, explosives, nuclear installations and alkali works; the
Employment Medical Advisory Service; and the Health and Safety Laboratories,
which include the Safety in Mines Research Establishment.
The basic obligations laid down in the Act are supported by ministerial
powers to make regulations dealing with a wide range of health and safety
matters. Regulations may be supplemented where appropriate by codes of
practice approved by the commission, and by guidance notes and other codes.

Other Measures
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
In particular the Act gives inspectors the power to issue improvement and
prohibition notices, which enable them to require practical improvements to
be made within a specified time or to require preventive measures immediately
without first having to obtain a court order. There are provisions for appeals
to industrial tribunals against such notices.
About 207,000 industrial premises (factories, warehouses, shipyards, docks and
construction sites) are regulated under the Factories Act 1961, which is enforced
mainly by the Factory Inspectorate, part of the Health and Safety Executive.
Likewise about 770,000 premises are subject to the Offices, Shops and Railway
Premises Act i963> whose enforcement is shared by the Factory Inspectorate
and the Mines and Quarries Inspectorate, the Railway Inspectorate (see below)
and local authorities.
The Acts and regulations made under them are designed to secure the health,
safety and welfare of employers, and deal with such matters as the fencing of
machinery; precautions against the exposure of people to toxic gases and dusts;
precautions against fire, dangerous substances and special risks; the safe
condition of premises; and cleanliness, lighting, temperature and ventilation.
I hey also contain provisions concerning the employment of women. Anyone
intending to employ other people in industrial or commercial premises to
which either the Factories Act or the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises
Act applies has to notify the enforcing authority of his intention and there is a
statutory duty to report every accident which is either fatal or causes more than
three days incapacity. The Factories Act includes provisions for the compulsory
notification and investigation of certain types of dangerous occurrence.
Comparable provision with appropriate variations covers mines and quarries,
agriculture and transport (including aviation and shipping, the responsibility of
the Department of Trade). As with the Factories Act these other provisions are,
with some exceptions, enforced through inspectorates—the Mines and Quarries
Inspectorate, the Agricultural Inspectorate, and the Railway Inspectorate of the
Department of Transport. Safety requirements in all other places of work
including hotels, places of entertainment and educational establishments but
excluding domestic work in the home, are covered by the Health and Safety at
Work etc. Act or (in respect of their offices and shops) by the Offices, Shops and
Railway Premises Act, while fire authorities are responsible for general fire
precautions and means of escape.
The Health and Safety Executive, through its Nuclear Installations Inspec¬
torate, is the authority concerned with the granting of nuclear site licences for
commercial nuclear installations. No such installation may be constructed or
operated in Britain without a licence granted by the executive under sections
of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 which are relevant statutory provisions
under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. Conditions attached to such
licences in the interests of safety are imposed and enforced by the inspectorate.
The Health and Safety Commission also has responsibility under the Mineral
Workings (Offshore Installations) Act 1971 and the Petroleum and Submarine
Pipelines Act 1975 for the health and safety of all persons (including divers)
engaged in the offshore oil and gas industry, by agency agreement with the
Petroleum Engineering Directorate, Department of Energy.
Transport operators and ministries concerned with road and air travel give
high priority to safety measures affecting crews and passengers. Every effort is
made to counter the higher risks resulting from rising traffic densities by im¬
proving the design of vehicles and transport equipment, by control of standards

of maintenance, by traffic regulations and by training crews in safety awareness.
To minimise the hazards which may arise from the use of pesticides, a
voluntary scheme has been established under which pesticides are vetted by the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s Advisory Committee on Pesticides
and Other Toxic Chemicals (see p 178) before being marketed. The committee
gives clearance for specific uses, subject to its recommendations on such matters
as safety precautions and labelling being agreed to.
There are also the Health and Safety Laboratories, which are concerned with
research into health and safety problems in industry (see p 383).
Legislation forbids any employment of children under 14 years of age, and
employment in any industrial undertaking of children who have not reached
the statutory minimum school-leaving age (now 16); of women and young
people underground in mines and in certain other dangerous occupations (for
example, certain processes connected with lead manufacture); and of women
in factories and workshops within four weeks after childbirth. It also limits
and defines the permissible hours of employment for women and young
people.
The Health and Safety Commission encourages the development of voluntary
central organisation within each industry at national level for the consideration
of safety matters and the formulation of policy and accident prevention. Its
inspectorates, besides inquiring into notified accidents and safety aspects of
machine design and specification, circulate expert advice to both sides of
industry and to the general public, and maintain a health and safety centre in
London, at which various types of guards for machinery are displayed, as well
as a wide range of protective clothing and equipment. Regulations which came
into force in October 1978 provide that recognised trade unions may appoint
safety representatives to represent the employees in a workplace; also, two or
more such representatives may make a written request to the employer to
establish a safety committee, which must then be set up within three months
of the request being made.
Organisations in industry participate also in joint standing and advisory
committees appointed by the Secretary of State for Employment, but these
arrangements are being superseded. The Health and Safety Commission has
appointed four major advisory committees in addition to the Committee on
Major Hazards set up in 1975 > these include one on asbestos, one on toxic
substances, one on dangerous substances and one on medical matters. Proposals
have also been made for the appointment of a number of industry-based commit¬
tees, six of which have already been set up. The Royal Society for the Prevention
of Accidents (RoSPA) and the British Safety Council are national bodies
concerned with accident prevention and sponsor a number of local accident
prevention groups.
Training is important in accident prevention and the Manpower Services
Commission provides a course in job safety for supervisors in its Training
Within Industry scheme (see p 323). The industrial training boards include
specific provisions for safety training in their training recommendations.
RoSPA provides a variety of safety courses for special needs, mainly at its
Industrial Safety Training Centre in Birmingham, and also helps the accident
prevention movement by providing and organising conferences; its regional
industrial safety officers work to promote safety activity among top-level
managers. The British Safety Council also offers safety training courses. Other
33^
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
courses are organised by local accident prevention groups and organisations such
as the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors.
A substantial amount of research is being done by industry, universities and
other academic bodies, and government research organisations into problems of
guarding machines, ergonomics, safe handling, electrical hazards, nuclear safety,
protective personal equipment, construction methods, fires and explosions,
psychological factors and causes of accidents, both generally and in particular
sectors of industry. Industrial research associations include among their more
purely economic research projects the improvement of working conditions and
the reduction of hazards.
The National Coal Board conducts courses of safety training for workmen
and officials. Its research programme includes a number of projects with a direct
bearing on safety. In addition, the Health and Safety Executive has a statutory
responsibility for research concerning the safety and health of coal miners,
largely exercised through its Safety in Mines Research Establishment.
The University of Aston in Birmingham runs a degree course for the training
of safety officers and engineers whose careers will be concerned with the tech¬
nical aspects of insurance and forensic work.
Employment The Employment Medical Advisory Service (EMAS), set up under the Employ-
Medical ment Medical Advisory Service Act 1972 and now part of the Health and Safety
Advisory Executive, provides a nation-wide service of advice on the medical aspects of
Service employment problems to employers, employees, trade unions, doctors and others.
It carries out medical examinations of workers in hazardous occupations and
surveys of employment hazards, advises the staff of the Manpower Services
Commission on medical aspects of job placement, rehabilitation and industrial
training and co-operates with school medical officers and careers officers in
helping to solve the employment problems of handicapped school leavers. The
service, headed by the Health and Safety Executive’s Director of Medical
Services, has over 100 employment medical advisers based in the country’s main
industrial centres. The TUC, the CBI and other interested organisations are
associated with the work of the service through advisory committees.
Scientific Support The Occupational Medicine and Hygiene Laboratories (which are part of the
for Occupational Health and Safety Laboratories, see p 335) at Cricklewood, north London,
Health provide laboratory services and undertake research in the field of occupational
health. The Factory Inspectorate also looks to the laboratories as a main source
of laboratory assistance.
Research facilities are provided by government agencies such as the Medical
Research Council; by university faculties of industrial health and social medicine;
and by the research departments of various industries and large industrial
concerns. Field investigations are carried out by the Factory Inspectorate,
which has specialised technical branches, and by the EMAS.
Employers’ Many employers voluntarily maintain medical services for their employees
Health Services over and above the statutory requirements. The big employers, including the
State and the boards of nationalised industries, have taken the lead but a number
of smaller factories also provide medical services and in a few cases have joined
together in group medical services.
Other Amenities An increasing number of firms pay part or all of the cost of recreational facilities.
Some have their own rehabilitation centres or support convalescent homes.
The provision of low-priced meals at the place of employment has become

usual in large undertakings and quite common in smaller ones. Many offices and
shops which are unable to provide canteen facilities for their staff have adopted
luncheon voucher schemes.
Both official and voluntary organisations are concerned with promoting better
human relationships in industry. Official research has sought to extend the
available knowledge of the factors influencing human relations in industry and
human efficiency. Such research is sponsored or conducted by the Social Science
Research Council (see p 378) and the Medical Research Council (see p 376). In
addition, the Department of Employment’s Work Research Unit provides
information on how particular jobs can be redesigned to create greater satis¬
faction, helps industry and others in initiating and evaluating changes in the
content of work, and administers a research programme. Voluntary organisations
include bodies which deal with management problems and provide a service to
subscribing firms; professional associations, linking individuals with a common
interest in particular functions of management; and bodies providing specialist
services, usually on a fee-paying basis.
The safety, health and welfare of employees in Northern Ireland have been the
subject of legislation which is embodied in the Factories Act (Northern Ireland)
1965 and the Office and Shop Premises Act (Northern Ireland) 1966. A number
of firms voluntarily employ safety officers, and industrial safety groups, supported
by representatives of industry, insurance companies and public authorities,
make a valuable contribution to accident prevention.
Legislation for Northern Ireland in line with the Health and Safety at Work
etc. Act 1974 came into effect in 1979.

Public
Expenditure
1 hrough the public finance system the Government raises money from in¬
dividuals and companies by taxation, borrowing and other means, and spends
it on behalf of the community in the provision of goods and services such as
education, health and defence, in payments to people and organisations, and
in capital investment. The term public finance also covers the raising of revenue
and its expenditure by local authorities and certain other public bodies and the
financial relationship between these agencies and the central Government.
THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Public expenditure comprises the current and capital expenditure of central
government and local authorities (collectively known as general government),
excluding expenditure charged to the operating account of trading bodies;
central government finance in the form of grants, loans or public dividend
capital provided towards the cost of capital investment by the nationalised
industries; the capital expenditure of other public corporations; the contingency
reserve; and those debt interest payments which constitute a charge on taxation.
Public expenditure, excluding the contingency reserve and debt interest, in
1978-79 amounted to nearly £63,000 million (at 1978 prices) of which 71
per cent was undertaken by the central Government and 27 per cent by local
authorities, the remaining 2 per cent representing the capital expenditure of
certain public corporations other than the nationalised industries. The social
services programmes accounted for nearly 51 per cent of the total programmes,
and defence expenditure for about 11 per cent. The wide range of functions and
purposes of this expenditure and its distribution is shown in Table 27.
Out of the total public expenditure of £65,200 million in 1978-79 some
£35,916 million or 55 per cent was spent by the public sector directly on goods
and services (wages and salaries, other current expenditure on goods and
services, gross domestic fixed capital formation and stocks). Transfer payments
to individuals, companies and other institutions in the private sector (for example,
social security payments, capital grants, subsidies, and debt interest) made up
the balance. Unlike public authorities’ direct purchases of goods and services,
transfer payments do not represent a direct demand on the nation’s resources.
The gross sums transferred create a proportionately lower indirect demand for
goods and services because of taxes paid and savings made by the recipients.
Between 1973-74 and 1978-79 total public expenditure programmes grew in
real terms by about io-8 per cent, but they are now being stabilised.
Major importance is attached to adequate planning and control of public ex¬
penditure. There are three principal and interdependent ways in which this is
done. First, the annual public expenditure survey, which leads to the publication
of a report describing the Government’s medium-term expenditure plans on a
constant price basis; secondly, the Supply Estimates by means of which Parlia¬
ment votes the cash required to run certain central government services in the

coming financial year; and thirdly, the system of cash limits under which, for
the financial year immediately ahead, the volume of expenditure at constant
prices shown in the survey plans is translated into cash provision which will not
normally be exceeded. Effective control requires up-to-date information on the
progress of expenditure, achieved through monitoring by the Treasury or other
departments. These arrangements are described in more detail below.

Each year a survey is made of the whole range of projected public expenditure
covering the period five years ahead. It is carried out by officials in the Treasury
and other government departments, under the direction of the Public Expendi¬
ture Survey Committee.
The primary purpose of the survey is to present to ministers an up-to-date
assessment of the cost of their existing policies and proposed changes as a
basis for decisions about the total and the composition of public expenditure
in the five-year period covered. This gives the Government the opportunity
to plan ahead any necessary changes without causing wasteful disruption in
existing services, and to have regard to the overall economic outlook when
taking decisions.

A report on the survey is prepared in the first half of the year. This is followed
by ministerial consideration of the report and then by the publication of the
Government’s public expenditure plans (see Bibliography). This provides the
basis for an annual public expenditure debate in the House of Commons.
The plans contain a contingency reserve to provide for additions to the pro¬
grammes set out. Since 1976 this has been developed into a more operational
instrument, as one of the means of securing that actual expenditure is kept
within the plans. The object is, as far as possible, to limit claims on the reserve
by meeting the cost of new measures, or increased estimates for existing measures,
within existing departmental totals. Recourse to the reserve to meet additional
expenditure is subject to the approval of Treasury ministers, who may refer the
larger or more difficult claims for consideration by the Cabinet as a whole.
Each department submits its cash requirements to the Treasury in the December
before the financial year beginning on the following 1 April. Estimates cover
central Government’s own expenditure. (Not all this expenditure is classified as
public expenditure—for example, payments to local authorities. Only when the
money is spent by the local authorities is public expenditure recorded.) After
they have been approved by the Treasury, the Supply Estimates are presented
to Parliament shortly before the Budget (see p 342) and are approved by Parlia¬
ment for one year ahead, by means of an annual Appropriation Act, in July
(expenditure to this date from 1 April is covered by a Vote on Account approved
by Parliament before the beginning of the financial year). There are 29 allotted
days (known as supply days) in each session on which the choice of subject for
debate rests with the Opposition and on which estimates can be debated. Broad
issues of policy are normally discussed.
Certain expenditures are not approved annually, but are covered by Acts of
Parliament allowing payments to continue from one year to another and are
paid direct from the Consolidated Fund. These include the financial provision
for members of the royal family, and salaries and pensions of judges. The
Consolidated Fund, into which tax revenue and other receipts are paid, finances
most of the Government’s expenditure; its balance is held in the Exchequer
account at the Bank of England. The National Loans Fund covers most of the
Government’s domestic lending and borrowing, and is operated as an official
account at the Bank of England. The two funds deal only with sterling receipts
and payments; official dealings in foreign exchange are carried out by the
Exchange Equalisation Account (see p 349).
Cash limits, first introduced on an extensive scale in 1976-77, have been applied
to public spending wherever they can make a useful contribution to financial
discipline. They also contribute to the Government’s policy for reducing
inflation and help in forecasting the Government’s maximum financing require¬
ments. About two-thirds of public expenditure is covered by cash limits.
Certain services such as social security payments are excluded because, once
policy and rates of payment have been determined, cash spending in the short
term depends on factors outside the Government’s direct control. Cash limits
are also placed on the financial assistance given to local authorities by central
Government and on local authority capital expenditure. The estimates of the
financing requirements of the nationalised industries are also treated as a form
of cash limit.
Spending departments and authorities are normally required to provide
within their cash limits for any increase in costs due to pay and price changes.

The cash limits for 1979-80 were first published in April 1979 and revised
figures were published in June 1979 (see Bibliography).
To simplify the control of expenditure the Supply Estimates and those cash
limits on public expenditure covered by the estimates are being assimilated.
Most were assimilated in 1979-80; the remainder will be so in early 1980.
Expenditure by government departments is monitored by the Treasury and
compared with profiles of expected expenditure prepared at the beginning of
the financial year in accordance with the approved Public Expenditure Survey,
Supply Estimate and cash limit provisions.
This process has been improved in recent years through the introduction of a
computerised financial information system for both the Treasury and for spend¬
ing departments.
Parliamentary control of public expediture is exercised not only through approval
of the supply estimates but also on the work of the Comptroller and Auditor
General, the Public Accounts Committee and the House of Commons Select
Committee on the Treasury and the Civil Service.
The Comptroller and Auditor General is appointed by the Crown and his
independence of the Executive is secured by specific statutory provisions.
He has two functions: as Comptroller General he exercises his statutory duty
to ensure that all revenue and other public moneys payable to the Consolidated
Fund and the National Loans Fund are duly paid over and that all issues from
these funds are authorised by statute; and as Auditor General, and in accordance
with the Exchequer and Audit Department Acts and the National Loans Act
1968, he audits, on behalf of the House of Commons, accounts of the transactions
of the Consolidated Fund and National Loans Fund and every Appropriation
Account, and submits his reports on them and other accounts to Parliament.
For many years and with the encouragement of the Public Accounts Committee
his statutory audit functions have been interpreted widely and his reports
regularly examine and criticise matters of general financial administration,
cost-effectiveness and cases of apparent waste or extravagance.
A new structure of House of Commons Select Committees was established in
June 1979 (see also p 33). There are 14 committees which examine the expendi¬
ture (as well as the administration and policy) of the principal government
departments. The objective of the new structure is to strengthen the account¬
ability of ministers to the House of Commons and, to this end, the Government
makes available to the select committees as much information as possible,
including confidential information.
The accounts of each department and the reports of the Comptroller and
Auditor General upon them are considered by a House of Commons Select
Committee called the Public Accounts Committee. This was established in 1861
to ensure that expenditure was only incurred in accordance with the purposes
for which it was voted and with the relevant Acts of Parliament. The Committee’s
terms of reference are simply that it must examine and report upon the accounts
laid before Parliament but these terms are widely interpreted. Successive
committees have investigated whether full value has been obtained for the sums
spent by departments and have reported in detail on cases in which administra¬
tion appeared faulty or negligent. The Committee has become a powerful
instrument for the exposure of waste or inefficiency and it embodies its findings
342
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in regular reports to Parliament. Although the Committee has no executive
powers its reports to Parliament carry considerable weight and its recommenda¬
tions are taken very seriously by departments and organisations that it examines.
The Government’s formal reply to these reports is presented to Parliament by
the Treasury in the form of a Treasury Minute, and the reports and the Minute
are made the subject of an annual debate in the House of Commons.
THE BUDGET 1 he Budget (an old word which meant a bag containing papers or accounts) is
a set of proposals, usually put forward in March or April, for financing govern¬
ment expenditure and managing the economy. In 1979 there were Budgets in
April and June because of the timing of the general election in May. Supple¬
mentary budgetary measures may also be introduced at other times of the year.
The proposals are described by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget
speech, against the background of a statement on Britain and the world economy,
the Government’s past and prospective revenue and expenditure, and an assess¬
ment of the position and prospects of the economy.
The Budget speech is followed by the moving of a set of Ways and Means
(or Budget) resolutions, in which the proposals are embodied. These resolutions,
when passed by the House, become the foundation of the Finance Act, which
expresses the proposals in statutory form.
A major function of the Budget is to act as an instrument of economic manage¬
ment, and the Budget statement is normally the main occasion for a review of
general economic policy. The Budget is therefore concerned with the balance
between the total of goods and services which are likely to be available to the
nation and the total claims which are likely to be made on them. Through taxa¬
tion the Government can exert a considerable influence on the volume of demand
for goods and services; its measures can also have a broader influence on the
pattern of demand and, through, for instance, increasing incentives, on the
long-term performance of the economy.
The Budget deals with the means of financing expenditure and particularly
with changes in taxation and not primarily with expenditure itself. On occasions,
changes affecting expenditure, such as increases in pensions and family allow¬
ances, have been announced in the Budget statement, as have financial and
monetary measures, such as changes in exchange control policies. Such measures,
however, are not generally reflected in the resolutions or the Finance Act but
are applied by the appropriate procedure, that is, separate legislation, statutory
instruments or administrative action.
The scope of the Budget and that of the Finance Act which follows it are
different although they are closely interrelated. The Budget is essentially
concerned with the measures that give effect to the Chancellor’s decision to
increase or reduce to an appropriate extent the predicted level of demand on
economic resources by use of the instruments at his disposal, and especially
by increasing or reducing the yield of central government taxes. The tax changes
proposed on the basis of the Budget judgment are enacted in the form approved
by Parliament in the Finance Act, which also provides the annual opportunity
for non-budgetary changes in the tax system and for certain other financial
matters, such as provisions relating to Government borrowing.
The bulk of the taxation proposals in the Budget are concerned with changes
in the rates of coverage of existing taxes, the introduction of new taxes or
the abolition of existing ones, and changes in the administrative machinery
relating to taxation. In two cases (income tax and corporation tax), however,
annual Ways and Means resolutions followed by a Finance Act clause are
necessary to maintain the taxes in existence at all, since they are annual

taxes. Thus a Budget at or about the beginning of each financial year is a
necessity.
New taxes and changes in certain existing taxes, like other changes in statute
law, do not come into effect until the appropriate Bill—in this case the Finance
Bill—has received Royal Assent (in the case of the spring Budget, normally
about the end of July) or at some other date laid down in the Bill. Some changes,
however, come into effect earlier, usually from Budget Day or from the start of
the tax year, under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act. This enables the
Government to collect certain taxes provisionally, income tax, for example,
either at the rates previously in operation or at new rates following the passing
of the appropriate Ways and Means resolutions. Other ways of changing taxation
are by special legislation or the use of the regulator (see p 347).
The economic background to the spring Budget and the transactions of the
central government and the public sector as a whole are presented in the Financial
Statement and Budget Report (see Bibliography) which is laid before the House
of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he presents the
Budget. The report is in three parts: the economic context of the Budget; the
accounts of the public sector for the past financial year and the one immediately
ahead; and the accounts of the central government for the same two years. The
accounts are designed to assist in assessing the impact of changes in revenue and
public expenditure on the economy.
The accounts of the public sector show the transactions of the central govern¬
ment, local authorities, nationalised industries and other public corporations
combined into a consolidated account covering the whole of the public sector.
The transactions within the public sector cancel out on consolidation and the
net balance on the consolidated account represents, therefore, the borrowing
which is required by the public sector from the private and overseas sectors.
The accounts of the central government show transactions both on the con¬
ventional cash basis of Exchequer accounting and in accordance with the frame¬
work of the national income accounts.
To raise the money it requires over and above tax revenue the Government
offers a great variety of claims on itself designed to attract different types of
lender. Broadly there is marketable debt and non-marketable debt. Marketable
debt is made up of short-term floating debt consisting of Treasury bills, and
funded or longer-term debt made up of government securities which are of
varying maturities and publicly quoted on the Stock Exchange. Non-marketable
debt comprises the various forms of national savings designed to attract the
smaller saver; certificates of tax deposits; and ways and means advances, which
basically is very short-term internal government borrowing. The bulk of public
corporations’ borrowing is met by central government through the National
Loans Fund, although public corporations’ temporary borrowing needs are met
largely from the market under Treasury guarantee. That part of local authority
borrowing met by central government is dealt with through the Public Works
Loan Board which has recourse to the National Loans Fund. The local authorities
also borrow directly from the market, both short-term and long-term, through
a range of different investments. Some public corporations also borrow, under
special statutory power and with Treasury consent, in foreign currencies.
After allowing for the changes introduced by the Budget of June 1979 the
central government’s borrowing requirement for 1979-80 was expected to be
£9,564 million,1 compared with an estimated outturn of £8,043 million in

SOURCES OF
REVENUE
The three principal sources of tax revenue are first, taxes on income, which
include income tax and corporation tax; second, taxes on capital, which include
FINANCE
345
Taxes on
Income
Income Tax
Corporation Tax
capital transfer tax and capital gains tax; and third, taxes on expenditure (includ¬
ing taxes on the ownership or use of certain assets), which include protective
and excise duties, value added tax (VAT), the National Insurance Surcharge,
local rates (see p 64), stamp duties and licence duties (for example, on motor
vehicles). Taxes on individual (but not corporate) incomes are progressive in
that larger incomes bear a proportionately higher rate of tax. The Board of
Inland Revenue assesses and collects the taxes on income and capital and the
stamp duties; the Board of Customs and Excise collects the most important
taxes on expenditure (the customs and excise duties and VAT) while a variety
of authorities is responsible for the collection of the remainder. The Government
has begun to shift the emphasis from taxes on income to taxes on expenditure.
The main changes in the June 1979 Budget were a reduction in income tax and
an increase in VAT.
Income tax is imposed for the year of assessment beginning on 6 April. The
Finance Act (No 2) 1979 reduced the basic and top rates of tax and broadened the
bands of taxable income chargeable at the intervening rates. The first £750 of
taxable income (total income less deductions and personal allowances) is taxed
at 25 per cent, after which a basic rate of 30 per cent (formerly 33 per cent) is
charged on the balance of taxable income up to £10,000, 40 per cent on the
£io,ooi-£i2,ooo band of taxable income, 45 per cent on the £i2,ooi-£i5,ooo
band, 50 per cent on the £i5,ooi-£20,ooo band, 55 per cent on the £20,001-
£25,000 band and a maximum rate of 60 per cent over £25,000 of taxable income.
These rates are charged on both earned and investment incomes. Investment
incomes are also liable to a 15 per cent surcharge on the amount by which they
exceed £5,000. The tax imposed on an individual is graduated by means of
personal allowances and reliefs. In general, the income of married couples is
taxed as one but they receive higher allowances than a single person. Husband
and wife may choose to have the wife’s earnings charged separately for tax on
condition that the former receives the single instead of the married personal
allowance. But even then the married couple are taxed jointly on their investment
income.
For 1979-80 a single person earning £5,000 a year pays £1,113 in income
tax, while a married man with the same earned income pays £918. The amount
of tax payable by a single person varies from, for example, £84 on an earned
income of £1,500 a year to £13,663 on an earned income of £30,000.
Most wage and salary earners pay their income tax under a PAYE (‘Pay as
You Earn’) system whereby tax is deducted (and accounted for to the Inland
Revenue) by the employer, thus enabling them to keep as up to date as possible
with their tax payments.
In general, income tax is charged on all income which originates in Britain
and on all income arising abroad of persons resident in Britain. Interest on
certain British government securities belonging to persons not ordinarily resi¬
dent in Britain is exempt. Britain has entered into agreements with many
countries providing for relief from double taxation; where such agreements are
not in force unilateral relief is allowed.
Companies pay corporation tax at a single rate on all their profits, whether
distributed or not. Only a proportion of any capital gains is included in total
profits, with the result that chargeable gains as a whole are subject to a lower
effective rate of tax. Income tax is not deducted from dividends but a company
which distributes profits to its shareholders is required to make to the Inland
Revenue an advance payment of corporation tax. In general, this payment is
346 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
set against a company’s corporation tax bill and the recipient of the distribution
in respect of which the advance payment was made is entitled to a tax credit,
which satisfies the liability to income tax at the basic rate.
The rate of corporation tax is fixed retrospectively in the Budget for the past
financial year; for the financial year 1978 (1 April 1978-31 March 1979) it is 52
per cent with a reduced rate of 42 per cent for small companies (as defined in
the Finance Acts 1972, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979). The taxis assessed on
the profits of accounting periods, the rate of tax being the rate for the financial
year in which the accounting period falls. Where an accounting period straddles
31 March the profits are apportioned on a time basis. Relief is given by an
interim scheme for the rise in the value of stocks and work in progress between
the beginning and the end of the accounting period. The Government is to
consult with the accountancy profession on a possible permanent scheme of
relief following the profession’s recent proposals for a system of inflation
accounting. Meanwhile deferred tax liability arising from stock relief for 1973-74
and 1974-75 has been written off. Outstanding relief for each subsequent year
will also be written off after a six-year interval.
As part of its policy for encouraging small businesses, the Government has
raised the qualifying profits limits for the small companies rate of corporation
tax to between £60,000 and £100,000.
Under the Oil Taxation Act 1975 a petroleum revenue tax (deducted in comput¬
ing profits for corporation tax) is charged on profits from the winning, as opposed
to refining or other form of processing, of hydrocarbons under licence in Britain
and on its continental shelf. The tax was increased from 45 per cent to 60 per
cent on 1 January 1979. Each licensee of an oilfield is charged on the profits for
that field, computed for half-yearly periods.
Taxes on The Government is studying capital transfer tax and capital gains tax, with a
Capital view to making the taxation of capital simpler and less oppressive.
Capital Transfer A comprehensive tax, capital transfer tax, applies to transfer of personal wealth
Tax in three main areas: lifetime gifts; transfers on death; and transfers relating to
settled property (that is, any property held in trust). The tax is chargeable in
respect of a person’s lifetime transfers as they occur and on a cumulative basis.
The final stage of cumulation is the inclusion of the property ‘passing’ on an
assumed transfer of the whole of the deceased’s estate immediately before the
death. The rates of tax applicable are progressively higher on successive slices
of the cumulative total of chargeable transfers, with a lower scale of tax for life¬
time transfers than for transfers on death. Under both scales the first £25,000 of
transfers is exempt; the rates on the remainder rise from 5 per cent on the slice
between £25,000 and £30,000 to 75 per cent on the excess over £2-01 million
for lifetime transfers and from 10 per cent on the slice between £25,000 and
£30,000 to 75 per cent on the excess over £2-01 million for transfers on death.
Capital gains accruing on the disposal of assets are liable to capital gains tax
or, in the case of companies, to corporation tax. The rate of tax is normally
30 per cent, but in the case of individuals may be less, depending on their
circumstances. For small businesses the tax on gifts and certain deemed disposals
of business assets may be deferred until the assets are sold. Certain assets may
be exempt from tax, including the principal private residence, chattels worth
less than £2,000 (and any chattels, except those used for the purpose of a trade,
with a predictable life of less than 50 years), private motor cars and National

Savings Certificates. An individual is exempt from capital gains tax where the
total net gains do not exceed £1,000 in any year; where the gains do not exceed
£5,00°, the excess over £1,000 is charged at a reduced rate of 15 per cent; where
the gains exceed £5,000, liability is limited to tax of £600 plus half of the excess
over £5>000- This marginal relief runs out at £9,500. In addition, the gains on
gilt-edged securities are exempt from the tax if the securities were held for more
than 12 months.
Ihe Development Land Tax Act 1976 introduced a development land tax
(DLT) on development value in place of the charge on development gains
and on first letting introduced in the Finance Act 1974. For disposals taking
place on or after 12 June 1979 the rate of DLT is 60 per cent but the first
£50,000 of development value realised in any financial year is completely exempt.
Exemptions from DL F include the sale or development of owner-occupied
residences.
The largest group of taxes on expenditure are those administered by the Board
of Customs and Excise, namely VAT, car tax and the excise duties on tobacco,
hydrocarbon oil, alcoholic drinks and betting and gaming, and the protective
duties, chargeable as Community customs duty in accordance with the EEC
Common Customs EarifF (no such duties are chargeable on goods which qualify
as Community goods). These taxes are usually referred to as indirect taxes
since they are normally paid by the importer, manufacturer or wholesaler, who
adjusts the prices charged to customers accordingly.
All the excise duty goods (other than certain hydrocarbon oils) are subject to
VAT. Light hydrocarbon oil (petrol) is taxable at 15 per cent. The Chancellor
of the Exchequer has power to vary between Budgets the amounts of the VAT
rates by up to 25 per cent, and the rate of any of the other main groups of
excise duties (that is, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, oil and the minor excise duties)
by up to 10 per cent. This power, known as the ‘regulator’, requires annual
renewal for alcoholic drink, oil and the minor excise duties. The regulators for
VAT and tobacco products duty are independently adjustable under powers not
requiring renewal.
Value added tax (VAT) is charged at each stage in the production and distribu¬
tion process. The final tax is borne by the consumer. A taxable person (generally,
a trader carrying on a business with a turnover of more than £10,000 a year) is
charged by suppliers of goods and services with VAT (‘input’ tax). The trader
then charges the customer with VAT on goods and services supplied (‘output’
tax). The trader pays to Customs and Excise the difference between output and
input tax. Although VAT falls on imported goods, most exports are zero-rated
and VAT entering directly into export costs can be reclaimed. VAT is chargeable
at 15 per cent.
VAT is a broadly based tax falling on final consumers’ expenditure except
where there are strong social or economic reasons for giving relief. There are
two basic methods by which supplies of goods and services may get relief from
VAT: zero-rating, when a trader does not have to charge tax to a customer, but
can reclaim any input tax paid to suppliers, and exemption, when a trader does
not have to charge a customer any output tax but is not entitled to deduct or
reclaim any input tax relating to the goods or services which he sells. The most
important supplies to which zero-rating applies are most types of food (except
in the course of catering); books, newspapers and periodicals; fuel (except for
petrol and other fuels for road use); construction of buildings; exports (goods

and many services); public transport fares; young children’s clothing and foot¬
wear; and drugs and medicines supplied on prescription. Exemption applies to
land (including rents), insurance, postal services, betting, gaming other than by
means of a gaming machine and lotteries, finance, education, health and burial
and cremation.
New cars and motor caravans, whether British made or imported, are chargeable
with car tax at 10 per cent on the wholesale value. VAT falls on the price
including car tax.
The principal betting duties are: the pool betting duty (which applies to football
pools and betting by coupon at fixed odds) charged at a rate of 40 per cent of
the stake money; and the general betting duty, which is charged at the rate of
7-5 per cent of stake money except for on-course betting, which is charged at
4 per cent. Gaming is taxed at different rates mainly by licence fees.
The annual tax on motor vehicles is collected by the Department of Transport;
the proceeds are paid into the Consolidated Fund. The licence duty on a private
motor car is £50 a year; motor cycles and three-wheel vehicles, etc., pay £5,
£10 or £20 a year according to engine capacity. Goods vehicles are taxed by
unladen weight, and taxis and buses by seating capacity.
The national insurance surcharge took effect from the start of the 1977-78
financial year. It is in the form of a levy paid by employers, along with their
national insurance contributions, in respect of their employees and is equal to
3-5 per cent of employees’ earnings up to £135 per week (earnings of less than
£19-50 per week are exempt). Generally it is assumed that the incidence of this
tax will be passed forward into prices, so that it ranks as a tax on expenditure.
On 31 March 1979 the total National Debt was estimated at £86,974 million,
of which £4,283 million was repayable in currencies other than sterling,
mainly to the United States Government. Of the £82,691 million of internal
debt, £12,139 million was short-term debt, mainly in the form of 91-day
Treasury bills, while the long-term loans included a variety of stocks, bonds,
loans and certificates carrying fixed rates of interest and with fixed or indeter¬
minate dates of repayment. The National Debt relates only to the liabilities of
the National Loans Fund (see p 343) which includes official holdings of central
Government debt by other central Government funds.
The general system of public finance in Northern Ireland is, in its main fea¬
tures, similar to that operating in Great Britain. The major sources of revenue
are the main national taxes imposed by the United Kingdom Parliament
over the whole country. The Northern Ireland share of the yield of United
Kingdom taxes is paid out of the Consolidated Fund of the United Kingdom
into that of Northern Ireland. Revenue also accrues from local resources such
as the regional rate and from certain non-tax revenue. There is also an annual
grant-in-aid voted by Parliament (£560 million in 1978-79 which, together with
the attributed share of United Kingdom taxes, rates and miscellaneous sums,
amounted to a total of £1,566 million). Loans from the United Kingdom
National Loans Fund are available (up to a limit of £1,000 million) to finance
capital expenditure programmes in Northern Ireland.
Various funds have been established in Northern Ireland, in addition to
statutory Reserve and Sinking Funds, for specific purposes. In general, these

follow the pattern for Great Britain, the principal funds being those relating
to national insurance and government loans. The latter constitutes a pool of
money available mainly for local and public authority borrowings; on 31 March
1979 a sum of approximately £311 million was outstanding against such
borrowers.
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The British banking system comprises a central bank; deposit banks which
perform the usual main banking services; the British offices of domestic and
overseas banks whose main business is in other countries; merchant banks and
other specialised institutions.
The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Act of Parliament and Royal
Charter as a corporate body; the entire capital stock was acquired by the
Government under the Bank of England Act 1946. As the central bank, the
Bank acts as banker to the Government, to overseas central banks and to deposit
banks and is the lender of last resort to the banking system; it is the note¬
issuing authority and the registrar for some 200 government, nationalised
industry, local authority, public board and Commonwealth government stocks.
As agent for the Government, the Bank administers exchange control (now
applicable to Rhodesia only, see p 366). On behalf of the Treasury it manages
the Exchange Equalisation Account (EEA), which holds Britain’s official reserves
of gold, foreign exchange and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) on the Inter¬
national Monetary Fund. Using the resources of the EEA, the Bank may intervene
in the foreign exchange market both to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange
value of sterling and to conserve the means of making payments abroad.
As banker to the Government, the Bank examines and seeks to anticipate
banking and financial problems and undertakes the appropriate operations in the
money, capital and the foreign exchange markets; consequently it has a major
responsibility for advising the Government on the formulation of monetary
policy and for its subsequent execution. It is also the main channel of com¬
munication between the deposit banks and other financial institutions of the
City of London on the one hand and the Government on the other.
The Bank’s implementation of monetary policy is carried out primarily
through control over interest rates and through direct controls over the banking
system. It administers directly the official discount rate, known as Minimum
Lending Rate (MLR), which is the rate at which the Bank will normally provide
funds to the discount market as a lender of last resort. MLR in turn can be
expected to have an influence on other short-term interest rates. In addition, the
authorities can influence interest rates through their daily operations in the
money market and the terms on which they offer gilt-edged stock.
The Bank’s direct controls over the banking system include the setting of
a 12-5 per cent minimum ratio of specified reserve assets to total eligible liabilities
(broadly, sterling deposits drawn from outside the banking system with an
original maturity of two years or less plus the banks’ net foreign currency
liability). Second, the Bank can call for special deposits as a percentage of total
eligible liabilities, which generally bear interest at the Treasury bill rate but
which do not count as reserve assets and which therefore contract the banks’
ability to lend. In addition, a supplementary special deposits scheme can be
operated; this requires a bank to place non-interest bearing supplementary
special deposits with the Bank of England for every percentage growth in the
interest-bearing element of its eligible liabilities beyond a certain specified rate
35°
The Deposit

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
over a defined period. The Bank of England has also issued qualitative guidance
on the direction of bank lending; this provides for priority to be given to the
finance required by manufacturing industry, for the expansion of exports and for
import saving.
Under the Banking Act 1979 all deposit-taking businesses which are not
specifically excluded require authorisation from the Bank of England and are
subject to its continuing supervision. Authorisation may take the form either
of recognition as a bank or of a licence to take deposits. The Act also set up a
deposit protection scheme to protect the funds of depositors.
The Bank of England has the sole right in England and Wales of issuing
bank notes. The note issue is fiduciary, that is to say, it is no longer backed by
gold but by government and other securities. The Scottish and Northern
Ireland banks have limited rights to issue notes; these issues, apart from an
amount specified by legislation for each bank, must be fully covered by holdings
of Bank of England notes. The provision of coin for circulation is the respon¬
sibility of the Royal Mint, a government department.
The primary business of the deposit banks is the receipt, transfer and encash¬
ment of deposits. The principal deposit banks are the six London clearing
banks, three Scottish clearing banks and two Northern Ireland banks. Mergers
have resulted in the formation of six banking groups, four based in London
and two in Scotland. The two Northern Ireland banks are owned by London
clearing banks, but two groups of banks based in the Irish Republic also operate
in Northern Ireland.
In August 1979 sterling sight and time deposits with these banks from non¬
bank customers in the British public and private sectors amounted to £32,639
million and accounted for 74 per cent of the total of such deposits with all banks
in Britain, that is including the accepting houses, overseas banks, consortium
banks and other British banks. Sight accounts are repayable on demand and no
interest is generally paid on them, but on time deposits interest is paid (at a
rate below individual banks’ base rates). The deposit banks provide full banking
services throughout Britain, and operate through some 14,000 branches. Several
of them have interests in British overseas and Commonwealth banks, and in
other banks which have been formed specially to compete in international
markets. They have also acquired substantial interests in hire-purchase finance
houses, and some have set up their own unit trusts and merchant banks.
The deposit banks’ reserve assets consist of balances at the Bank of England,
money at call (mainly loans to discount houses), their holdings of Treasury and
some other bills and short-dated British government securities. The banks also
hold a proportion of their assets as portfolio (mainly longer-dated British
government securities) or trade investments.
The banks’ profits are largely earned through their advances to customers
partly in the form of overdrafts1 and partly in the form of loans (with or without
collateral security). In August 1979 sterling advances by the London clearing
banks amounted to 67 per cent of their sterling deposits.
The bank giro, a credit transfer scheme, and the direct debiting by which
a creditor with the prior approval of the debtor may claim money due to him
direct from the latter’s banking account, have helped to improve the money
transmission services. An increasing number of banks have automatic cash
dispensing machines and many are also introducing more automated banking
facilities. Credit cards are in widespread use for the settlement of accounts in

retail shops; and cheque cards enable the card holder to cash a cheque up to
a specified credit limit at any office of the major British and Irish banks and
at offices of many banks overseas.
Membership of the London Bankers’ Clearing House, which deals with the
clearing of cheques and drafts, consists of the Bank of England and the London
clearing banks, together with the Co-operative Bank and the Central Trustee
Savings Bank, which became members in 1975. In 1978 cheques and drafts
passing through the London clearing system averaged in value £237,000 million
monthly.
The Post Office National Girobank (known as National Giro until 1978), which
was introduced in 1968 to provide a low-cost current account banking and
money transfer service, is operated through most post offices in Britain. All
accounts and transactions are maintained by means of a computer complex at
Bootle, Merseyside. In March 1979 Girobank had 670,000 accounts with balances
of over £300 million. The number of transactions has risen from an annual rate
of 80 million in March 1969 to one of about 300 million in September 1979. In
addition to its services to individuals, Girobank’s services to commerce, industry
and the public utilities include a facility whereby organisations with dispersed
branches, depots and representatives can rapidly channel receipts into their
central account. Some 160 local authorities as well as voluntary housing associa¬
tions use Girobank’s rent collection services. Girobank’s international services
also provide money transfer facilities in Europe linking over 19 million account
holders in the European Community and other countries in Western Europe.
The range of banking services provided by Girobank has been widened
progressively to include personal loans, a cheque guarantee card, limited over¬
drawing for personal customers and overdrafts for corporate customers, deposit
accounts, budget accounts, bridging loans, travellers’ cheques and foreign
currency, bureaux de change and the facility to draw cash at 75,000 post offices
in Europe.
Altogether 395 overseas banks and financial institutions were represented in
London in 1978, through branches, subsidiaries, representative offices and con¬
sortia. There were 308 banks directly represented in London, while 87 banks
and financial institutions were represented through a stake in one or more of
the 31 joint venture banks operating in London. Of those directly represented,
65 were from the United States, 24 from Japan and 107 from Europe, of which
56 were from the European Community. They provide a comprehensive banking
service in many parts of the world and engage in the financing of trade not
only between Britain and other countries but also between third countries.
Merchant banks have traditionally been primarily concerned with acceptance
credits1 and with the sponsoring of capital issues on behalf of their customers.
Today they have a widely diversified and complex range of activities with an
important role in international finance and the short-term capital markets, the
provision of expert advice and financial services to British industrial companies
especially where mergers, takeovers and other forms of corporate reorganisation
are involved, and in the management of investment holdings, including trusts,
pensions and other funds.
1 Acceptance credits are usually short-term (90 days) arrangements to finance exports
from, and imports to, Britain and other markets. The expression is derived from the
method of financing trade by which commercial bills are ‘accepted’ or guaranteed by a
merchant bank against documents, after which they may be discounted for cash by a
discount house.

The Discount Market is an institution which is unique to the City of London.
Its function in the monetary system is to provide a financial mechanism designed
to promote an orderly flow of short-term funds. The market consists of 11
discount houses, five money traders and two discount brokers, all of which
borrow money ‘at call’ or short notice and lend for somewhat longer periods.
The discount houses have recourse to the Bank of England as lender of last
resort. The Bank lends to them generally overnight or for seven days at minimum
lending rate, although it may charge a higher rate. Most of the market’s borrowed
funds come from the banks, which are thus provided with a flexible means of
earning a yield on surplus funds which they have at any given time, although
an increasing proportion is also coming from industry.
The assets of the discount houses mainly consist of Treasury and commercial
bills, government and local authority securities and negotiable certificates of
deposit denominated in both sterling and US dollars. The discount houses
accept as a formal responsibility that they should cover the government’s need
to borrow on Treasury bills which are offered on tender each week.
The Department for National Savings is responsible for the administration of
Government savings schemes: National Savings Bank accounts, National
Savings Certificates, British Savings Bonds, Premium Savings Bonds and Save
As You Earn contracts. Government policy is directed towards encouraging
investment, primarily of personal savings, in these schemes, particularly as they
represent a major source of funds for financing the public sector borrowing
requirement. At November 1979 National Savings totalled £12,328 million.
Facilities are provided by National Savings for the purchase of government
stocks (‘gilts’); a selection of about 50 stocks is held on the National Savings
Stock Register. Gift Tokens are also available at most post offices.
The National Savings Bank provides a countrywide system for depositing and
withdrawing small savings at post offices. There are about 21 million active
accounts. Ordinary Accounts bear interest at 5 per cent and the first £70 of
annual interest is tax-free. Up to £50 can be withdrawn on demand at any
savings bank post office, but a few days’ notice is required for larger amounts.
The money is lodged with the National Debt Commissioners and is invested
in government securities. Deposits bearing a higher rate of interest may be
made in Investment Accounts. All deposits carry a government guarantee. At
the end of May 1979 the sum of the two accounts totalled £3,273 million.
National Savings Certificates, in units of £1 (minimum purchase £10), are
encashable at par at any time. Interest, which is free of income tax and capital
gains tax, is paid only on encashment. The maximum permitted holding of
the current Eighteenth Issue is £1,500 (it will be superseded by the Nineteenth
Issue, maximum holding also £1,500, in February 1980). Index-linked National
Savings Certificates Retirement Issue are available only to men aged 65 and over
and women aged 60 and over at £10 for each one unit certificate. Interest does
not accrue periodically but instead, subject to the certificate being held for one
year, the repayment value is related to the movement of the general index of
retail prices. If held for five years a bonus of 4 per cent of the purchase price is
added to the repayment value. The maximum permitted holding is £1,200.
British Savings Bonds, 9-5 per cent, are sold in units of £5. If the bonds are held
to maturity (five years from the date of purchase) they are repaid with a tax-free
bonus of 4 per cent. The maximum permitted holding is £10,000.

Premium Savings Bonds are in units of (minimum purchase is £5) and
individual holdings are limited to £3,000. After a qualifying period of three
months the bonds give investors a chance to win tax-free prizes. There is a
weekly draw for prizes of £100,000, £50,000 and £25,000 and a monthly draw
offering thousands of prizes ranging in value from £50 to £10,000. Total net
sales of bonds to mid-1979 were some £1,400 million.
The Third Issue of the Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme introduced in 1975
is index linked. The scheme enables savings to be made in fixed regular monthly
amounts over five years, with a minimum of £4 and a maximum of £20, by
means of deductions from pay or by other regular payments. At the end of five
years, the repayment value is the total contributions plus any increase due
to index-linking of monthly contributions. Completed savings which are not
withdrawn qualify for fresh index-linking and a bonus equal to two monthly
contributions at the end of seven years. Savers who wish to stop payments
are able to withdraw the total sum saved (but there cannot be partial with¬
drawals). Tax-free compound interest is then paid at the rate of 6 per cent a year
on amounts withdrawn after the first year.
Northern Ireland issues separately Ulster Savings Certificates and Ulster
Development Bonds on similar terms to the corresponding National Savings
Certificates and British Savings Bonds.
The Trustee Savings Banks (TSBs), most of which were founded in the nine¬
teenth century, operate under their own trustees but are subject, under the
Trustee Savings Banks Acts 1969, 1976 and 1978, to the supervision of the
Trustee Savings Banks Central Board and the Treasury. Following a planned
programme of amalgamations, there were 18 individual banks in June 1979
(compared with 67 in 1975) with about 1,640 branches, 14 million accounts and
total deposits in excess of £5,000 million. The 1976 Act empowered TSBs to
provide a full range of banking services including credit services. The TSB
credit services include personal loans, temporary overdrafts, bridging loans,
and home improvement loans. The TSBs also have their own credit card,
Trustcard, which operates within the VISA system. In addition, a range of life
assurance and unit trust facilities are available. The TSBs have also introduced
a pilot scheme offering small-scale commercial loans.
Many special financial facilities, which are supplementary to the credit facilities
of the banks, are provided through institutions outside the banking system.
These include institutions providing credit in specialised forms, such as hire
purchase finance companies, and leasing and factoring companies; institutions
which manage investments on behalf of the public, such as pension funds, life
assurance companies, unit trusts and investment trusts; institutions which
provide financial services, such as the Stock Exchange, with its associated stock¬
brokers; commodity markets; and the insurance market; and intermediaries
which are less dependent on the financial markets in the City of London, such
as building societies and credit unions.
Although there are a large number of firms engaged in the financing of hire
purchase and other instalment credit transactions, about 90 per cent of all fin¬
ance house business is accounted for by the 40 firms which constitute the Finance
Houses Association (FHA). At the end of June 1979 the value of instalment credit
debt outstanding to the members of FHA, including those recognised as banks,

amounted to £5,108 million. A substantial amount of new credit extended by
finance houses related to cars and commercial vehicles, including motorcycles
and caravans, the remainder relating to industrial and building equipment and
other goods.
The leading finance houses comply with the authorities’ policies on lending
similar to those applied to banks, and all finance houses are required to observe
term controls affecting the minimum deposits and maximum repayment period
for specific goods financed by certain forms of lending. Finance houses with
total eligible liabilities exceeding £5 million are subject to the same system of
credit control as that applied to banks (see p 349).
Leasing companies buy and own plant or equipment required and chosen by
businesses and lease it at an agreed rental. This form of finance is growing in
importance, partly because the leasing companies can take advantage of invest¬
ment incentives to the benefit of customers whose tax position would otherwise
make them unavailable. In 1978 new assets leased by the 47 members of the
Equipment Leasing Association amounted to £1,214 million, some 10 per cent
of British investment in capital equipment.
Factoring companies purchase the trade debts due to a business and provide
an accounting and debt collection service. Services available cover exports from
and imports to Britain, as well as domestic trade. In 1978 the eight members of
the Association of British Factors handled £1,335 million worth of turnover.
Finance Finance corporations meet the need for medium- and long-term capital when
Corporations such funds are not easily or directly available from traditional sources such as
the Stock Exchange or the banks.
Finance for Industry Limited (FFI) was formed in 1973 as the holding com¬
pany for two previously separate but related corporations, the Finance Corpora¬
tion for Industry (FCI) and the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation
(ICFC). The purpose of the merger was to provide, in one specialist financial
institution, the capacity to support investment programmes over the whole
range of industry. The FCI provides medium-term funds at fixed and variable
interest rates for large companies in excess of £2 million. During the year ended
31 March 1979 it advanced a total of £63 million and had commitments and
guarantees at the end of the year of a further £40 million. A total of 20 customers
were involved. The ICFC provides medium-and long-term funds at fixed interest
rates for the small and medium sectors of industry. At the end of March 1979
the ICFC had gross facilities outstanding of £290 million in 2,723 companies.
Its normal lending limits range from £5,000 to £2 million for periods between
seven and 20 years. The shares in FFI are owned by the Bank of England (15
per cent) and the individual London and Scottish clearing banks.
Equity Capital for Industry Ltd (ECI) was formed in 1976 as a new specialist
long-term institution with the primary purpose of providing equity or equity-
type capital for industry in Britain which cannot appropriately be provided
through the normal market mechanism. Its authorised capital is £50 million
and the shares are largely held by insurance companies and life offices, invest¬
ment trust companies, unit trusts and FFI. There is an unauthorised unit trust
associated with ECI whose units are held by pension funds so as to enable them
to participate in the provision of capital.
The Agricultural Mortgage Corporation was established in 1928 for the
purpose of making loans to farmers. Its authorised share capital is £1-5 million
apd at 31 March 1979 loans and investments amounted to £388 million.

The Commonwealth Development Finance Company (CDFC) is no longer
confined to the Commonwealth in its activities. It supports business enterprise
overseas by providing finance in the form of share capital and loans on mutually
acceptable terms. Its authorised share capital is ^30 million, of which about 14!
million ‘A’ ordinary shares of £1 (^o-io paid) are held by industrial, shipping,
mining and banking interests in Britain, and nf million ‘B’ ordinary shares of
£1 (£0-50 paid) are held by the Bank of England and certain central banks in
the Commonwealth. At 31 March 1979 the CDFC held investments of about
^30 million spread over a wide range of industries in 40 countries.
The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) was set up in 1948
and undertakes projects for the promotion and expansion of a wide range of
enterprises within and outside of the Commonwealth. At the end of 1978 the
CDC had a total capital commitment of £397 million (see p 86).
The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations provide
financial, professional and commercial services for some 100 governments, mostly
of independent countries, and over 200 overseas public authorities and inter¬
national bodies. Individual agents have been appointed by the Minister of
Overseas Development. The office is not a government department but a public
service which is responsible to its principals for its business operation.
When the Crown Agents Act 1979 comes into force on 1 January 1980 the
unincorporated Crown Agents will be replaced by two statutory corporate bodies,
sharing common management. The Crown Agents for Oversea Governments
and Administrations will continue to operate as agents on behalf of government
and public sector bodies in Britain and overseas in such areas as procurement,
recruitment and investment management. They will carry on their existing
range of activities such as consultancy work, in their own right, subject to
specified ministerial controls. The Crown Agents Holding and Realisation
Board will have the duty of holding and realising on the best possible terms the
remaining investments in property and secondary banking entered into by the
unincorporated agents on their own account.
Pension funds are administered by trustees in order to invest members’ pension
contributions, either directly on the market or through intermediaries such as
insurance companies. The total market value of funds managed, covering private
employers and much of the public sector, was of the order of some £40,000
million at the end of 1978.
Investment trust companies and unit trusts enable investors to spread their
risks and obtain the benefit of skilled management.
The usual type of investment trust company is constituted as a public com¬
pany registered under the Companies Acts with limited liability; its business
is to invest its capital in a range of stocks and shares. Like other companies, it
may issue several types of stocks or shares and may retain part of its profits to
build up reserves. Investment trust companies grew to importance in the latter
half of the nineteenth century and have been prominent in directing capital
towards overseas investment. At the end of 1978, such companies held assets
worth £6,700 million, of which 33 per cent were in overseas securities.
Unit trusts are constituted by trust deed between a management company
and a trustee company which holds the assets. Normally, the managers sell
units to the public and must invest the proceeds in a fairly wide range of stock
exchange securities. The costs of running the trust are defrayed partly by an
initial charge which forms part of the price of a unit and partly by a half-yearly
356 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
service charge which is usually taken out of the income of the trust. The level
of both charges is controlled by the Department of Trade, from which authorisa¬
tion is required before units can be offered to the public; this is only granted if
the trust deed meets the Department’s requirements.
The first British unit trust was formed in 1931 and at the end of 1978 there
were almost 2 million unit holdings. The value of the funds invested in authorised
trusts depends on the value of the underlying securities; from only £60 million
at the end of 1958 they had risen to £3,873 million at the end of 1978. There is
a wide variety of trusts, both in the range of investments covered and in the
ways of catering for the differing needs of investors.
Building societies are non-profit-making mutual institutions which borrow
mainly short-term from individual savers, who are generally able to withdraw
their money on demand, and provide long-term loans at variable rates of interest
on the security of private dwellings purchased for owner occupation. They also
lend to a limited extent to house builders and on the security of business or
commercial property. Most societies pay and charge interest on the basis of a
structure of rates recommended periodically by the Building Societies Association,
the movement’s representative body.1
Building societies have existed in Britain for some 200 years and have been
subject to specific legislation governing their operations (now consolidated in
the Building Societies Act 1962) since 1836. The present legislation is ad¬
ministered by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies, to whom the societies
must provide regular statements of their financial position and who has dis¬
cretionary powers to restrict or suspend a society’s operations if he considers
that the way in which its business is being conducted may put investors’ money
at risk.
Building societies account for about 90 per cent of all lending for house
purchase in Britain and in recent years they have overtaken the banks as the
principal repository for the personal sector’s total liquid assets. This growth
has been accompanied by a concentration of most of the business in the hands
of a few large societies. At the end of 1978 there were 316 registered building
societies with total assets of £39,538 million; over half this amount was accounted
for by the five largest societies and about 83 per cent of it by the 20 largest.
The amount lent on mortgages in 1978 was a record £8,808 million, a 31 per
cent increase on 1977.
Credit Unions A recent development in Great Britain has been the creation of credit unions,
of which there are now over 50. Credit unions are small savings and loan clubs
where members agree to pool part of their savings in order to provide themselves
with low cost credit. The Credit Unions Act 1979 provides a legislative frame¬
work within which credit unions in Great Britain can operate. It requires that
members of a credit union should have a ‘common bond’ such as working in
the same factory, and provides a system for their registration and supervision
by the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies.
In Northern Ireland they have grown successfully since the Industrial and
Provident Societies Act (Northern Ireland) was introduced in 1969.
The Insurance The British insurance industry provides a comprehensive and competitive service
Market domestically and internationally. It has been estimated that British insurers
1 The income tax on interest is paid by the society on behalf of individual investors, at a
rate equal to their average tax rate (22-5 per cent for 1978/79). This means that while
those not liable to tax cannot reclaim the tax paid on their behalf, investors who pay at
the basic rate receive a better return than would otherwise be the case.

handle some 20 per cent of business placed on the world market. The London
market is the world’s leading centre for insurance where, in addition to most
British companies and Lloyd’s, a large number of overseas companies are also
represented. It is the world centre for the placement of international reinsurance
and, partly as a consequence of this, many British companies have formed close
relationships with overseas companies. A certain amount of insurance is provided
by friendly societies, banks and trade unions but most insurance services in
Britain are in the hands of mutual or joint stock insurance companies or Lloyd’s
underwriters.
Although some British insurance companies confine their activities to domestic
business, the majority of the large companies undertaking general business,
together with underwriters at Lloyd’s, regard themselves primarily as inter¬
national insurers, the largest proportion of their premium income and claims
being attributable to international risks. Without such a wide range of interest,
the British market would not be able to respond to the high level of demand
made on it in respect of very large single risks such as specially designed ships
for carrying liquefied gas and offshore oil production platforms. There are about
800 insurance companies authorised to carry on one or more classes of insurance
business in Britain, of which about 120 are overseas companies.
Some 310 companies belong to the British Insurance Association and these
account for about 95 per cent of the world-wide business of the British insurance
companies market.
Life assurance is available from 300 authorised insurance companies and from
certain friendly societies: and a very limited range of contracts is obtainable
from certain Lloyd’s underwriters. The main types of life policy are whole-life,
endowment, unit-linked term assurance and annuities. Many life assurance
policies are a form of savings contract as well as protection against losses incurred
by premature death.
Lloyd’s, established in the seventeenth century, is an incorporated society of
private insurers in London. Although its activities were originally confined to
the conduct of marine insurance business, a very considerable world-wide
market for the transaction of other classes of insurance business in non-marine,
aviation and motor markets has been built up.
Lloyd’s is regulated by a series of special Acts of Parliament starting in
1871. The affairs of the Society of Lloyd’s in its corporate capacity are ad¬
ministered by the Committee of Lloyd’s. The society does not accept insurance
itself.
Lloyd’s is not a company but a market for insurance, where business is
transacted by individual underwriters for their own account and risk and in
competition with each other. Insurance may only be placed through Lloyd’s
brokers, who negotiate with Lloyd’s underwriters on behalf of the insured.
Only elected underwriting members of Lloyd’s, who must transact insurance
with unlimited liability and who have met the most stringent financial
regulations laid down by the Committee of Lloyd’s, are permitted to transact
business at Lloyd’s; these financial safeguards give security to the Lloyd’s
policy.
There are some 14,000 underwriting members of Lloyd’s grouped into about
360 syndicates and represented at Lloyd’s by underwriting agents who accept
risks on behalf of the members of their syndicates.
Alongside its marine insurance business Lloyd’s has built up a world-wide
organisation for the collection and diffusion of shipping intelligence.

The insurance market is completed by the insurance brokers, acting on behalf
of the insured; brokers are an essential part of the Lloyd’s market and a valuable
part of the company market. Many brokers specialise in reinsurance business,
acting as intermediaries in the exchange of contracts between companies, both
British and overseas, and often acting as London representatives of the latter.
The Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 provides for the registration of
insurance brokers by a Registration Council.
Over 60 per cent of the general (that is, non-life) business of members of the
British Insurance Association is carried on overseas, partly by reinsurance
on the London market and partly through branches and agencies established
in over 100 countries. The basic principle of this international business is that
resources capable of meeting any potential loss are instantly available for use
in any part of the world.
Behind this large and international volume of business stand the very substantial
assets of the companies, in addition to substantial reserves of uncalled capital, and
the deposits, underwriting trust funds and other resources of Lloyd’s underwriters.
In accordance with the Treaty of Rome, insurance and reinsurance in the
European Community are regulated by directives addressed to the governments
of member states and intended to harmonise the legislation of the various
member countries, thus providing a ‘common market’, which would avoid
distortion of competition. Directives in operation cover freedom of establishment
to provide services in respect of reinsurance, compulsory motor insurance,
freedom of establishment in non-life insurance, and insurance intermediaries.
A further directive on the co-ordination of regulations relating to Community
co-insurance operations is due to come into force in 1980.
The stock exchanges of the United Kingdom and Irish Republic amalgamated
in 1973 to become ‘The Stock Exchange’ with its main trading floor and central
administration in London. There are also trading floors in Glasgow, Liverpool,
Manchester, Birmingham and Dublin.
The number and variety of securities officially listed on the Stock Exchange
are greater than in any other market in the world and its turnover of company
securities is roughly equivalent to that of all the European exchanges combined.
Some 8,000 securities are quoted on the Stock Exchange; at the end of December
1978 these had a total market value of £323,650 million. About 6,200 securities
of companies were quoted, including a number of leading overseas securities
(over 470 in December 1978 with a total market value of £193,420 million).
Company issues represented more than four-fifths of the securities at market
valuation, the remainder being British, Irish Republic and other overseas govern¬
ment and corporation stocks. Institutional investors, such as pension funds, now
own a higher proportion of ordinary shares than individuals.
A market in traded share options opened in 1978 on the Stock Exchange.
The market, initially in the shares of ten prominent British companies (now
increased to 15), enables investors not only to buy options to purchase shares in
future at pre-fixed prices but also to trade in the options themselves. Also in 1978
the Council for the Securities Industry was set up as a self-regulatory body
for the securities industry. Its main function is to sustain proper conduct and
high standards in the industry.
The market consists of banks and several firms of foreign exchange brokers which
act as intermediaries between the banks. It provides those engaged in inter¬
national trade with foreign currencies for their transactions. The foreign

exchange banks are in close contact with financial centres abroad and are able
to quote buying and selling rates for both spot and future delivery. An important
function of the market is to engage in arbitrage transactions which serve to
eliminate differentials in exchange rates between different centres. The forward
market enables traders, who at a given date in the future are due to receive or
make a specific foreign currency payment, to contract in advance to sell or buy
the foreign currency involved for sterling at a precise fixed exchange rate. The
Bank of England is responsible for granting recognition to broking houses which
wish to trade in the foreign exchange and currency deposit market for
‘scheduled’ currencies, that is, in those currencies for which a specific brokerage
scale is laid down by the Bank.
All banks may deal in gold but, in practice, dealings are largely concentrated
in the hands of the five members of the London gold market. The five members
meet twice daily to establish a London fixing price for gold. This price provides
a reference point for world-wide dealings in gold. Although much interest
centres upon the fixings, active dealing takes place throughout the day. Forward
prices may also be quoted on request.
Britain remains the principal international centre for transactions in a large
number of commodities, although most of the sales negotiated in London
relate to consignments which never pass through the ports of Britain. The
need for close links with sources of finance and with shipping and insurance
services often determined the location of these physical markets in the City
of London. There are also futures markets in cocoa, coffee, grains (wheat and
barley), rubber, soya bean meal, sugar, wool and non-ferrous metals (aluminium,
copper, lead, nickel, silver, tin and zinc).

Although small in area and accounting for only about 1-4 per cent of the world’s
population, Britain is the fifth largest trading nation in the world—and, as a
member of the European Community, part of the world’s largest trading area,
which accounts for more than one-third of all trade.
For hundreds of years, and especially since the mid-nineteenth century,
when the rapid growth of industry, commerce and shipping was accompanied
by Britain’s development as an international trading centre, overseas trade has
been of vital importance to the economy. Britain exports goods to the value of
about £35,400 million, nearly one-quarter of the gross domestic product. It
is a major supplier of machinery, vehicles, aircraft, metal manufactures,
electrical apparatus, chemicals and textiles. Britain relies upon imports for almost
half of its total consumption of foodstuffs, and for most of the raw materials
needed for its industries. It is among the world’s largest importers of foodstuffs,
timber and paper, metals and ores, and other raw materials, petroleum and
many other products. Invisible trade is also of great significance to the economy,
and net earnings from invisible trade are second only to those of the United
States.
A sound commercial banking system and a wide range of financial institutions
ensure that commercial needs are met for both short- and long-term finance
for international trade. The facilities provided by merchant banks and accepting
houses, for example, have long been used to finance shipments of goods not
only to and from Britain, but also between overseas countries.
This chapter describes the pattern of Britain’s overseas trade (including its
distribution by commodity and area). It also summarises the main aspects of
Britain’s invisible transactions, commercial policy, controls on trade and
payments and government services to exporters. The chapter ends with a
description of Britain’s balance of payments and its external assets and liabilities.
OVERSEAS TRADE
Changes in the value, volume, composition and geographical distribution of
exports and imports are outlined in the following paragraphs.
In 1978 Britain’s exports of goods were valued at about £35,400 million and
its imports of goods at about £36,600 million (both values are free on board
—fob—defined below Table 29, and are on a balance of payments basis,
as distinct from an overseas trade statistics basis, which for imports includes
the costs of insurance and freight, and for both exports and imports includes
returned goods). Between 1977 and 1978 the value of exports rose by 10 per
cent while that of imports increased by 8 per cent. Over the same period the
volume index of exports increased by 3-4 per cent and of imports by 5 per cent;

but the unit value index of exports rose by 3-3 per cent and of imports by
3-6 per cent.
The value and volume of exports and imports, together with the terms of
trade index, from 1970 to 1978 are shown in Table 29.

I Export unit value index as a percentage of import unit value index.
About 80 per cent of Britain’s exports consist of manufactured goods, both
finished and semi-manufactured. By far the most important group of goods
is machinery and transport equipment, which in 1978 accounted for 37 per cent
of total exports. Exports of machinery alone accounted for 25 per cent of total
exports in 1978. Ihe share of chemicals has grown fairly steadily, to reach
II per cent in 1978. The share of textiles has fallen from 18 per cent in 1948 to
7 per cent in i960 and 3 per cent in 1978.
Although Britain is still one of the largest importers of food in the world the
value of its imported food supplies has been growing less rapidly than the value
of total imports and the ratio of imported food, beverages and tobacco to total
imports, on an overseas trade statistics basis, has fallen from 39 per cent in
I954 t0 J5 Per cent in I97^- There has been a similar downward trend in the
proportion accounted for by basic materials—from 30 per cent in 1954 to about
8 per cent in 1978.
Imports of petroleum and petroleum products amounted to about 12 per
cent of the total value of imports during 1978, when their value was ^4,250
million on a balance of payments basis. This was 11 per cent lower than in
1977, with a fall in both price and volume, the latter reflecting increasing
production of North Sea oil.
In recent years there has been a significant rise, in Britain as in other in¬
dustrial countries, in the proportion of imports of finished manufactures.
Such imports rose from about 5 per cent of total imports in 1954 to 35
per cent in 1978, when they were valued at £14,501 million. Imports of

semi-manufactures have also been increasing and since 1962 have formed a larger
part of the total import bill than basic materials, partly the result of a shift of
the early stages of the manufacturing processes to the supplying countries.
Imports of chemicals and other semi-manufactures totalled £11,509 million
in 1978 and accounted for 28 per cent of total imports.

Although Britain’s trade has, in general, grown fastest in recent years with the
rest of the European Community, there was a marked change in the pattern
of British exports following the large rise in the price of oil at the end of 1973.
As a result of this rise, which generated large reserves of foreign exchange for
the oil-exporting countries, British exports to these countries rose in value by
52 per cent between 1973 and 1974, accounting for nearly one-tenth of the
total growth in exports over this period. On the other hand, the slowdown in
activity in most of the developed economies during 1974 and 1975 adversely
affected British exports to these economies.
In 1976 and 1977 there was a return to growth in world trade and exports
to the developed industrial countries continued the recovery which began in
the latter part of 1975 as economic conditions in the European Community and

the United States improved. Slower growth in world trade in 1978 was similarly
reflected in Britain’s export performance. Details of Britain’s principal export
markets and sources of supply in 1977 and 1978 are given in Tables 31 and 32.
As far back as estimates have been made (for nearly two centuries) Britain has
usually earned a surplus from its invisible transactions. These fall into three
main groups: services (receipts and payments arising from services, as distinct
from goods, supplied to and received from overseas residents); interest, profits
and dividends (income arising from outward and inward investment); and
transfers between Britain and other countries (see p 368). Table 33 shows the
breakdown of the figures from 1970 to 1978. Services of the private sector
(and public corporations) include sea transport and civil aviation, travel,
financial services (including insurance) and ‘other services’ which include
commissions on imports, royalties, services between related companies, con¬
struction work overseas, agency expenses and many other services.

The balance on invisibles in 1978 was £2,207 million. Gross earnings of
£18,335 million from invisible exports were about half the total of £35,432
million from visible exports. The surplus in 1978 was higher than the surplus
°f £2>°37 million in 1977 despite a sharp increase in the net contribution to
the European Community, due to the continued buoyancy of some private
services and a recovery in the surplus on interest, profits and dividends.

The deficits on government services have related predominantly to military ser¬
vices overseas, which have remained fairly steady in recent years, though currency
changes have caused the sterling value to rise. Substantial government transfer pay¬
ments relate to economic grants to developing countries (see p 86) and subscrip¬
tions to international organisations including, since 1973, Britain’s contribution
to the common budget for the financing of European Community expenditure.
Britain has long been an advocate of the removal of artificial barriers to trade,
and to this end has taken a leading part in the activities of such organisations as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (since 1973 as part of
the European Community, which operates as a single unit), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and

Development (UNCTAD) (see p 88). As a member of the European Com¬
munity Britain participates in the development of the Community’s commercial
policy. The Community’s common customs tariff is, on average, at a similar
level to the tariffs of other major industrial countries.
Protective tariffs have been considerably modified in recent years as a result
of negotiations held under the auspices of the GATT, which also seek to reduce
tariffs and other barriers to trade and to eliminate discrimination in inter¬
national commerce.
As a result of the ‘Kennedy Round’ (1964-67), a series of GATT tariff
negotiations, average reductions of over 30 per cent were made by the major
trading countries, including Britain, in their tariffs on industrial goods. In the
‘Tokyo Round’ (1973-79), yet t0 be fully ratified, agreements have been reached
on matters including phased cuts in the industrial tariffs of the main industrial
trading partners of the European Community, matched by equivalent reductions
in the common customs tariff of the Community; an agreement on subsidies
and countervailing duties (duties imposed by an importing country to offset
the benefit of a subsidy on exports), whereby developed countries undertake
not to grant export subsidies and all signatories undertake not to apply counter¬
vailing duties unless it can be demonstrated that a subsidy causes or threatens
material injury to domestic industry; and an agreement aimed at prohibiting
unfair and arbitrary methods of customs valuation.

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
All tariffs on trade between Britain and the other European Community countries
have been eliminated. Britain applies the common customs tariff to all countries
neither belonging to, nor having any special arrangement with, the Community,
subject to special arrangements for some industrial materials. Virtually all
industrial tariff barriers between the European Community and the remaining
member countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), to which
Britain belonged between i960 and 1972, have been dismantled.
Preferential tariff treatment for British imports from other independent Com¬
monwealth countries dating from the Ottawa Conference of 1932 has been
phased out since accession to the European Community. In the case of 28
developing Commonwealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific
(ACP), Commonwealth preference has been replaced by the trade provisions
of the Convention of Lome, which came into effect on 1 July 1975 (see p 73).
Developing and industrial countries, including Britain, have agreed to
establish a common fund to help to maintain stabilised prices of raw materials
(see p 88). Work is in hand in UNCTAD to finalise the detailed arrangements
for this new institution. It is envisaged that the fund will have capital of up to
$750 million, to which Britain’s contribution will be approximately $20 million.
There are now very few restrictions maintained by Britain on overseas trans¬
actions. Exchange controls on capital movements, except in relation to Rhodesia,
were abolished in October 1979, following partial relaxations earlier in the year.
As a result of the abolition of these controls (originally introduced as an emer¬
gency measure at the beginning of the second world war) British residents are
completely free to purchase and use foreign currency for any purpose, including
direct or portfolio investment abroad, and remittances and gifts abroad, and to
maintain foreign currency bank accounts. Controls on the lending of sterling
abroad have also been removed. Gold may be freely bought and sold. These
measures enable Britain to meet in full its obligations on capital movements
under European Community provisions and also those under the OECD Code
on Capital Movements. Controls on trade in goods are described below.
Under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 the
Department of Trade is empowered to require an individual import licence.
Only a narrow range of goods is subject to export control. Several other depart¬
ments have separate powers to control imports and exports for specific purposes.
In accordance with its international obligations under the GATT, and to the
IMF and the European Community, Britain has progressively removed quanti¬
tative restrictions from almost all its imports from the market economies;
those controls that remain (for example the GATT Multi-Fibre Arrangement,
approved by the European Community in December 1977) predominantly
affect textile goods. There are comparatively few quantitative restrictions on
imports from centrally planned economies, and progress towards liberalisation
continues to be made wherever possible. In accordance with its obligations to
the European Community, Britain has also removed all quantitative restrictions
on imports of goods of Community origin, with the exception of certain inter¬
nationally recognised restrictions on a few goods such as arms, ammunition and
radioactive materials and those on coffee, cocoa and cocoa products. Some further
restrictions or prohibitions are applied by other departments under separate
legislation for the prohibition of goods bearing false or misleading indications
of origin or improperly bearing a registered trade mark, for the protection of

health or public safety, in the interest of conservation, and for other non¬
economic reasons (for example, on animals, drugs and explosives).
There is a general import restriction on goods from Rhodesia as part of the
Government’s sanctions policy against the illegal regime.
The great majority of British exports are not subject to any government control
or direction. The controls that are in operation are imposed to supervise exports
of military and strategic significance. They also apply to certain metals, metal
products (including certain British coins), waste and scrap; on cattle, sheep, pigs,
horses, asses and mules, for humanitarian purposes and on cattle, swine and cer¬
tain meat exported to another member State of the European Community, for
health certification purposes; on cocoa and cocoa products and on endangered
species of animals and plants, in accordance with international agreements;
on photographic material over 60 years old and valued at £200 or more per
item and all other items over 50 years old, to restrict the export of items of
national importance; on salmon and trout, to inhibit out-of-season fishing; on
controlled (dangerous) drugs; on British spirits (beverages) in casks of less than
nine gallons; and on European Community Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
products. All exports to Rhodesia are subject to control.
The Government assists exporters by its efforts to create conditions favourable
to the export trade and by providing information and advice about opportunities
for trade in other countries and credit insurance facilities. Export promotion
is also assisted by the Scottish Council (Development and Industry), the
Development Corporation for Wales and in Northern Ireland by the Department
of Commerce.
The British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) directs Britain’s official export
promotion services, which include the provision of export intelligence, assistance
to British exporters in appointing agents and locating potential importers,
help to exporters at trade fairs and other promotional events overseas, and
support for firms participating in missions overseas and for inward commercial
visits to Britain. It includes representatives of commerce and industry, the
'Frades Union Congress, the Department of Trade and the Foreign and Com¬
monwealth Office and operates under the general authority of the Secretary of
State for Trade, who is the president.
Exporters wanting assistance and advice can consult the offices of the BOTB
throughout Britain and, through these offices, the commercial posts of the
British Diplomatic Service overseas.
Overseas officers work closely with the BOTB in the provision of services for
exporters. They regularly report on local economic and commercial conditions
and generally assist the exporter to overcome any difficulties he encounters
in trade with the country in question, particularly those arising out of govern¬
mental regulations.
I he Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) provides credit insurance
for about a third of the country’s export trade and insures exports of both goods
and services.
The main risks covered include insolvency or protracted default of the
buyer, governmental action which stops the British exporter receiving payment,
new import restrictions, war or civil disturbance in the buyer’s country. Cover

This insurance may be supplemented by unconditional guarantees of repayment
given direct to banks financing the exporter. Alternatively, for contracts
over L1 million ECGD will guarantee loans direct to overseas buyers enabling
them to pay on cash terms, or ‘lines of credit’ similarly covering an agreed
buying programme of an overseas country. The banks provide finance against
these guarantees.
A fixed-rate foreign currency financing scheme was introduced in February
1977 in order to maximise foreign currency financing. ECGD is normally
prepared to underwrite contracts for sales of capital goods and services valued
j£5 million or more on credit terms of two years or more only where the
contents are financed in foreign currency. Sterling financing, for export to Euro¬
pean Community countries and certain other overseas markets, is optionally
available.
Since 1975 ECGD has offered a measure of cover against high and unpre¬
dictable cost escalation to exporters with capital goods contracts worth over
£2 million which involve a manufacturing period of over two years. ECGD is
also prepared to support the issue of performance bonds in the commercial
market in respect of cash or near-cash contracts worth over ,£250,000.
Investment insurance is also provided for new British investment against
expropriation, war damage and restrictions on remittances.
Britain stages many exhibitions and trade fairs and British products are shown
at most of the large international trade fairs throughout the world.
Participation in trade fairs and store promotions overseas are forms of export
promotion for which the Government provides information and financial
assistance to exporters.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
Britain’s balance of payments has usually been characterised by a deficit on
visible trade partially offset by a surplus on invisible earnings. Estimates of
the balance of payments and its main constituent items from 1970 to 1978
are given in summary in Table 34 and in greater detail since 1976 in Tables 35
and 36. The balance of payments statistics contain two indicators of particular
importance. The first is the balance on current account, covering both visible
(exports and imports of goods) and invisible (trade in services, investment
income and transfers) transactions. This, together with capital transfers, provides
a measure of how far Britain is paying its way abroad and thus adding to or
using up overseas assets. The second indicator is the balance for official financing.
This is the net result of all external transactions, that is the current account,
capital transfers, investment and other capital transactions (including official
long-term capital transactions, investment flows, trade credit, and changes in
non-residents’ balances held in London in sterling and in overseas currencies)
and other flows, including unidentified transactions reflected in the balancing
item. The balance for official financing shows the impact of all external trans¬
actions on the reserves and official debt position, that is how much is available
to add to the reserves and repay any official borrowing in the case of a net
surplus, or how much must be financed by drawing on the reserves or by
borrowing if there is a net deficit. Table 35 gives details of the current account
since 1976. A slight worsening in the terms of trade in 1976 caused the visible
deficit to rise to >£3,601 million, compared with £3,236 million in 1975, the cur-
OVERSEAS TRADE AND PAYMENTS
rent deficit being £842 million. Increased production of North Sea oil was
largely responsible for the fall in the visible deficit to £1,744 million in 1977,
when the current surplus was £293 million. Further improvement in the balance
on oil caused the visible deficit to fall again in 1978 to £1,175 million and, with
some recovery in the surplus on invisibles, the current surplus rose to £1,032
million.

There was a net outflow in 1978 on identified investment and other capital
transactions of £2,931 million and a balancing item of £773 million. The
outflow in 1978 contrasted with the record net identified inflow of £4,406
million in 1977 and reflected changes in the demand for sterling between the two
years. In 1978 overseas residents increased their holdings of sterling by a much

smaller amount than in 1977; sterling lending by British banks to overseas
residents also rose in 1978 j and substantial net purchases of government securities
by overseas residents in 1977 became small net sales in 1978.
The direct benefit of the UK Continental Shelf oil and gas programme to
the balance of payments has increased substantially. Sales of oil and gas (the
latter valued at oil-equivalent prices) plus identified net balance of payments
items totalled about ,£3,500 million to ,£3,750 million in 1978 compared with
about ,£2,500 million in 1976.
Britain participates in the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) scheme which
came into effect in 1970 in order to supplement world reserves. SDRs are
reserve assets created and distributed by decision of the members of the IMF.
Any member of the IMF may join the scheme, and its share is based on its IMF
quota. Participants in the scheme accept an obligation to provide convertible
currency, when designated by the IMF to do so, to another participant in
exchange for SDRs up to a total amount equal to twice the net amount of their
own allocation of SDRs. Only those countries with a sufficiently strong balance
of payments are so designated by the IMF. SDRs may also be used in certain
direct payments between participants in the scheme and for payments of
various kinds to the IMF. The role of SDRs as a central standard of value in
international transactions (see p 204) is being enhanced.
The significance of any inventory of Britain’s aggregate external assets and
liabilities1 is limited because a variety of claims and obligations are included
that are very dissimilar in kind, in degree of liquidity and in method of valuation.
By the end of 1978 Britain had external assets and liabilities virtually in equi¬
librium after being in a net debtor position for the previous three years.
Britain’s assets arising from private investment overseas are estimated to have
been ,£28,870 million at the end of 1978. Direct investment2 excluding oil,
banking and insurance accounted for £16,370 million of the total figure for end
1978, portfolio investment for £8,200 million and oil for £4,300 million.
British banking and commercial claims at the end of 1978 totalled £9,917
million. Within this total banking claims were £5,408 million; suppliers’ export
credit to unrelated firms was £3,769 million. Official external assets, including
re-financed export credit, amounted at the end of 1978 to £4,878 million, which
included outstanding inter-government loans by Britain of £1,270 million.
These assets, with official reserves of £8,362 million, resulted in aggregate
identified external assets at the end of 1978 of some £52,000 million.
The dismantling of the exchange control regulations, described on page 366,
means that foreign currency is now available without limit for direct and port¬
folio investment overseas. The weight of evidence is that overseas investment
strengthens the current account of the balance of payments by helping to keep
and expand markets for British exports (many investments are in distribution
and similar export-promoting sectors, or create demand abroad for other
British goods and services) to the benefit of output and jobs at home. The
balance of payments will also be strengthened by invisible earnings flowing
from additional overseas investment; this will be particularly important in the
future when the overseas earnings from North Sea oil begin to decline.

million in North America.) With the inclusion of oil, portfolio and other
investment, aggregate private investment outflows totalled £4,087 million in
1978 compared with £2,222 million in 1977.
Identified external liabilities at the end of 1978 are estimated to have been some
£52>°3^ million. Net drawing on the IMF accounted for £1,142 million of this
sum and foreign currency borrowing by the Government for a further £2,131
million. Foreign currency borrowing by public bodies under the exchange
cover scheme1 totalled £4,851 million. Inter-governmental loans to Britain,
mainly a consequence of the second world war and its aftermath, totalled
£1,804 million at the end of 1978 of which £1,427 million was owed to the
United States and £315 million to Canada, with a further £61 million owed to
the Federal Republic of Germany under the 1969 Anglo-German Offset
Agreement. Other public sector liabilities of £5,954 million comprised mainly
overseas holdings of British government securities, Treasury bills and notes
and other borrowing by British public corporations and local authorities from
overseas. British banking and commercial liabilities, including liabilities in
sterling and in foreign currencies, totalled £12,539 million. Liabilities in the
form of direct overseas investment in Britain’s private sector excluding banking
and insurance totalled £23,615 million at the end of 1978.
Since the 1960s London has been the centre of the euro-currency business,
whereby banks and other institutions accept deposits and extend credit in
foreign currencies. At the end of 1978 liabilities of British banks in foreign
currencies amounted to £104,566 million (of which the equivalent of £81,943
million was in US dollars) and claims were £99,387 million.
The ‘sterling balances’, or foreign holdings in Britain of sterling in the form
of British government securities, bank deposits, deposits with local authorities
and finance houses, and Treasury bills totalled £7,876 million at the end of 1978.
Of this, £1,990 million was held by residents of oil-exporting countries, £1,436
million by residents of other member countries of the European Community
and £4,450 million by other holders. About 33 per cent of the balances were
official holdings (mostly those of central monetary institutions) and 67 per cent
were private holdings used by overseas residents to finance their international
transactions. The total of these liabilities (excluding the counterpart of borrow¬
ing) remained broadly constant between the end of 1945 and 1970, then rose
sharply in the early 1970s. As trade and payments arrangements have become
more diversified in recent years the relative importance of sterling as a reserve
currency has declined.
Overseas liabilities arising from investment in the private sector of the British
economy rose from £7,385 million in 1970 to £23,615 million at the end of 1978.
Overseas investors in Britain are free to repatriate the proceeds of the sale of
their investments, including any capital gains that may have accrued. Earnings
and dividends are transferable irrespective of their size. In 1978 the inflow of
direct, portfolio and other private investment, including oil, amounted to
£2,770 million.
The value of overseas investment in the private sector at the end of 1978
comprised: the book value of direct investment in Britain by companies incor-

porated abroad (excluding oil, banking and insurance)—^9,900 million (this
figure has been extrapolated from the book value at the end of 1974, taking
account of subsequent annual transactions); portfolio holdings of British
securities ^4,640 million; the book value of the net assets in Britain of overseas
oil companies—£5,750 million; and borrowing by British companies overseas—
£3,325 million.
Of the £1,257 million inflow of direct investment excluding oil into Britain in
I977 (^e latest year for which detailed figures are available), £646 million
originated in North America and £292 million in other member countries of the
European Community. Foreign investment inflow brings a number of benefits
to British industry, including technological development, which in turn will
strengthen the economy and its balance of payments position.

THE GOVERN¬
MENT AND
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
Britain has for centuries provided an atmosphere of learning congenial to its
scientists, whose record of achievements in relation to size of population is in
many respects unsurpassed. This record has been maintained throughout the
twentieth century. One recent example was the research carried out by two
British scientists which made possible the birth of the world’s first ‘test-tube’
baby in Britain in July 1978. Nobel prizes for science have been won by 63
British citizens—more per head of population than in any other country.
'I he Government keeps under review facilities for training scientists and
ensures that adequate research is devoted to matters of national interest, which
include defence (see Chapter 4), industrial innovation, health, environmental
protection, use and conservation of natural resources, the provision of good
food, shelter and energy and of efficient transport and communications.
Total expenditure in Britain on scientific research and development in 1975-76
(the latest year for which complete estimates are available) was £2,151 million,
or 2-2 per cent of the gross national product. Some 55 per cent was carried out
by private sector industry, 26 per cent by government organisations, 8 per cent
by universities and higher education establishments, 6 per cent by public
corporations and 5 per cent by research associations and other bodies. The
Government finances just over half of Britain’s research and development.
Funds are also provided by private and public enterprises and by private
endowments and trusts.
Central responsibility for basic civil science rests with the Secretary of State
for Education and Science, while responsibility for technology rests mainly
with the Secretary of State for Industry. Other government departments are
responsible for research and development related to their executive responsi¬
bilities. In 1972 the Government extended the customer-contractor approach
to all its applied research and development, whereby each department as
customer, with advice from its Chief Scientist, defines requirements and the
work is undertaken by contractors (government laboratories, research councils,
research associations, industry and the universities). Most departments have a
Chief Scientist’s Organisation, which formulates detailed requirements, selects
the most suitable contractor and co-operates with contractors to obtain the
best value for money.
An Advisory Council for Applied Research and Development provides a
central forum of external advice to ministers on the deployment of applied
research and development in both the public and private sectors and on the role of
Britain in international collaboration in such activities. It has published reports
on microelectronics and industrial innovation.
A Committee of Chief Scientists and Permanent Secretaries is responsible
for ensuring that scientific questions are brought before ministers as appropriate
and that scientific priorities reflect those of the Government as a whole.

I he Department of Education and Science discharges its responsibilities for
basic and applied civil science mainly through the five research councils to
which it allocates funds from its science budget (the budget totals £316-9
million in 1979-80). The councils and their allocations are: the Agricultural
Research Council (^28-8 million), the Medical Research Council (^54-4 million),
the Natural Environment Research Council (^35-1 million), the Science Research
Council (£ 174-1 million) and the Social Science Research Council 16-3 million).
Science budget grants are also made to the British Museum (Natural History)
and to the Royal Society. About one-fifth of the budget is expected to go on
research grants and contracts to universities, polytechnics and elsewhere, over
two-fifths to research units and other establishments of the research councils,
about one-seventh to postgraduate support and one-sixth to subscriptions to
international scientific organisations. The Department is also responsible for
some aspects of international scientific relations and helps to co-ordinate govern¬
ment policy regarding scientific and technical information.
The Advisory Board for the Research Councils advises the Secretary of State
on responsibilities for civil science with special reference to the research council
system, the support of postgraduate students and the proper balance between
national and international scientific activities, and on the allocation of the
science budget between research councils and other bodies; and promotes
close liaison between the councils and users of their research. Its membership
includes the chairman or secretary of each of the research councils, the chairman
of the University Grants Committee, the Chief Scientists from departments
with a major interest in the work of the research councils, the Chief Scientist
to the Central Policy Review Staff, and independent members drawn from
universities, industry and the Royal Society.
Each of the five research councils is an autonomous body established under
Royal Charter with membership drawn from the universities, professions,
industry and the Government. They conduct research through their own
research establishments and by supporting selective research in universities
and other higher education bodies. As well as being financed from the science
budget, three of the councils receive commissions, estimated at million
in 1979-80, from departments under the customer-contractor principle. The
Agricultural Research Council receives 55 per cent of its income from com¬
missions, the Natural Environment Research Council 39 per cent and the
Medical Research Council 21 per cent.
1 he Agricultural Research Council (ARC) has eight institutes under its direct
control: the Animal Breeding Research Organisation, at Edinburgh; the Institute
for Research on Animal Diseases, at Newbury (Berkshire); the Institute of
Animal Physiology, at Cambridge; the Food Research Institute, at Norwich;
the Letcombe Laboratory, at Wantage (Oxfordshire), dealing with the growth of
crops in relation to soil conditions and cultivation; the Meat Research Institute,
at Bristol; the Poultry Research Centre, at Edinburgh; and the Weed Research
Organisation, at Yarnton, near Oxford. There are six ARC units under dis¬
tinguished scientists associated with universities. The ARC is also responsible
for 15 independent state-aided agricultural research institutes, notably the
Rothamsted Experimental Station, at Harpenden (Hertfordshire), which is
the largest agricultural research institute in Britain and deals with research on
soils, fertilisers, crop physiology and crop husbandry; and the National Institute
of Agricultural Engineering, at Silsoe (Bedfordshire). There are also eight

independent institutes in Scotland financed by the Department of Agriculture
and Fisheries for Scotland with advice from the ARC on their scientific pro¬
grammes, staffing and equipment.
The ARC is planning to devote additional sums to research in a number of
areas including the study of photosynthesis with the aim of increasing crop
yields, the breeding of plants which could make their own nitrogen and so bring
savings in the use of fertilisers, and work on studying animal behaviour and
diseases to obtain healthier and more productive livestock.
The main research establishments of the Medical Research Council (MRC)
are the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, London, which
carries out fundamental research relevant to medicine and has recently given
special emphasis to neurobiology, and the Clinical Research Centre at Northwick
Park, London, which forms an integral part of Northwick Park Hospital. In
addition, the Council has over 60 research units, mostly located in university
departments, medical schools and hospitals in Britain. Subjects to which the
MRC is giving more support include cancer and its treatment, neurological
disorders (strokes and brain tumours), immunology and clinical problems.
Approval has been given for the establishment of a new unit of environmental
epidemiology to look at the long-term effects of pollution on population.
The MRC also undertakes work overseas and, with additional support from
the Overseas Development Administration, maintains laboratories in The Gambia
and in Jamaica.
The Council is assisted by four advisory boards: the Neurobiology and
Mental Health Board; the Cell Biology and Disorders Board; the Physio¬
logical Systems and Disorders Board; and the Tropical Medicine Research
Board. In addition, the MRC is advised by committees concerned with parti¬
cular aspects of its work and with research grants. The MRC’s arrangements
for the support of research fall under four main headings: investigations by
members of its scientific staff, mostly working in its own establishments;
short-term (‘project’) grants to workers in universities and elsewhere; long¬
term grants in support of specific research programmes in university depart¬
ments (‘programme grants’); and research training awards (fellowships and
studentships) tenable both at home and overseas.
The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) is responsible for en¬
couraging, planning and executing research in sciences, physical and biological,
relating to man’s natural environment and its resources. These researches are
broadly grouped and defined as: the Solid Earth—its physical properties and
mineral resources; Seas and Oceans—their behaviour and living and mineral
resources; Inland Waters—their behaviour and living resources; Terrestrial
Environments—wildlife communities and their resources; Atmosphere—its
structure and interactions; and a number of interdisciplinary studies including
pollution and the physical and biological properties of the Antarctic environment.
Research programmes which the NERC is planning to expand include those
on geological work in connection with deep drilling and mapping, which is
important for future mineral and energy exploration; new means of insect pest
control using viruses harmless to man; better understanding of the climate;
remote sensing by satellite, for resource and ecological surveys; and modelling
the behaviour of British estuaries.
The Council’s research institutes are: the British Antarctic Survey, the
Institute of Geological Sciences, the Institute of Hydrology, the Institute of
Marine Biochemistry, the Institute for Marine Environmental Research, the

Research institutes aided by council grants are: the Freshwater Biological
Association, the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, the
Scottish Marine Biological Association, the Unit of Marine Invertebrate
Biology, the Unit of Comparative Plant Ecology and other units attached to
universities.
The Science Research Council (SRC) supports basic research in astronomy,
geophysics, the biological sciences, chemistry, mathematics, physics, engineering
and applied sciences, in furthering its primary purpose of sustaining standards
of education and research in the universities. Most of the SRC’s resources are
devoted to helping university and polytechnic staff to carry out basic research
at the forefront of their subjects, in their institution, in one of the Council’s
research establishments, or elsewhere; to encouraging active collaboration in
research between the higher education institutions and industry; to identifying
and supporting areas of special importance and to enabling suitable graduates
to receive further training in methods of research or a specialised branch of
science or engineering of importance to British industry. The SRC provides
grants for research projects and awards studentships for training in methods of
research or advanced courses of study, and fellowships to promising scientists
or engineers to enable them to carry out independent research programmes
that they themselves have put forward.
The SRC maintains five research establishments: the Daresbury Laboratory at
Warrington (Cheshire), the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux
(East Sussex), the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, the Rutherford Laboratory
at Chilton (Oxfordshire), and the Appleton Laboratory (at Slough in Berkshire)
which is to be merged with the Rutherford Laboratory. The five establishments
are each centres of specialised research, but are also used for the development
and operation of research equipment beyond the resources of a university.
They provide support for scientists whose research needs access to facilities
run by international research organisations, such as the powerful particle
accelerators at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and
the high-flux neutron source at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL).
The SRC provides national contributions to CERN, the civil science programme
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the Anglo Australian Telescope,
the European Incoherent Scatter Project and part of the European Space
Agency contribution. It also contributes to, and shares with its French and
German partners, the control of the ILL reactor at Grenoble.
Developments in engineering research and training geared to the needs of
industry are a major priority of the SRC. Special programmes are being sup¬
ported in three areas—polymer engineering, marine technology and production
engineering—within a general effort to develop research and postgraduate
training in university engineering departments. Other subjects receiving major
support include microelectronics and computer applications (such as industrial
robotics), materials and energy conservation, medical engineering and coal
technology. A network to provide an interactive computing facility to universities
has been built up and is serviced by the Rutherford Laboratory.

Astronomy uses both ground-based techniques, such as optical and radio
telescopes, and space-based methods (see p 390). Optical astronomy is carried
out in university departments and, within the SRC, at the Royal Greenwich
Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. Instruments include the
Royal Greenwich Observatory’s Isaac Newton Telescope, of diameter 2-5
metres (8 feet), which is being installed at a new site on the island of La Palma
in the Canary Islands; the Anglo Australian Telescope, of diameter 3-9 metres
(13 feet), at Siding Spring, Australia, in a joint project with the Australian
Government; a i-2-metre (4-ft) Schmidt telescope on the same site; and
optical telescopes operated by the South African Astronomical Observatory,
to which the SRC contributes. A 3-8-metre (12-ft) infra-red telescope at Mauna
Kea, Hawaii was inaugurated in October 1979.
Cambridge and Manchester Universities are the main centres for research
in radio astronomy with substantial support from the SRC.
The SRC establishments concerned with the provision of facilities for university
research in nuclear physics are the Rutherford Laboratory, which supports
university teams engaged in experiments in particle physics at CERN and other
centres, and the Daresbury Laboratory, where a 30 million volt tandem acceler¬
ator for research into nuclear structure is under construction.
At the Daresbury Laboratory the Council is building a source of high intensity
electromagnetic radiation based on an electron storage ring, which will come
into operation in 1980. At the Rutherford Laboratory an intense source of
pulsed neutrons based on a proton accelerator is being constructed and is due
for completion in 1982. A high-powered laser facility at the Rutherford Labora¬
tory is used in the study of plasmas and in the development of new lasers.
The Social Science Research Council (SSRC) encourages, supports and carries
out research in, and disseminates knowledge about, the social sciences. It
initiates research into such topics as health policy, energy policy, population
studies, central and local government, young people in society, transmitted de¬
privation, and the social impact of North Sea oil. Grants are provided for research
projects at universities and other institutions, and awards made to postgraduate
students. The SSRC also has four research units: the Industrial Relations
Unit, the Cambridge Population Unit, the Ethnic Relations Unit, and the
Socio-legal Studies Centre. The SSRC’s areas of interest include economics;
political science; psychology; social anthropology; social and economic history;
sociology and social administration; social sciences and the law; education;
management and industrial relations; human geography; linguistics; planning;
and various aspects of a wide range of other disciplines.
Of the total estimated university expenditure on scientific research in the academic
year 1977-78 (over £212 million), the largest government contribution (over
^125 million) was through the University Grants Committee (UGC).
Scientific research in the universities (and other institutions of higher educa¬
tion) is also supported through the research councils. This support takes two
forms. First, nearly two-thirds of the postgraduate students in science and
technology in the universities and other institutions receive maintenance awards
from the research councils, through postgraduate studentships. These awards
are in some cases for periods of up to three years of training in research work
and in others for shorter periods for advanced studies. In 1978-79 the research
councils made 7,349 awards at a total cost of ^37-1 million. Second, grants and

contracts are given to the universities and other institutions by the research
councils for specified projects, particularly in new or developing areas of
research. These total about ^60 million a year. The ARC, MRC and SSRC
maintain a number of research units within universities. In addition, the re¬
search councils provide central facilities in their own establishments for use
by university research workers.
The other main channels of support for scientific research in the universities
are various government departments, the Royal Society, industry and the
independent foundations.
Universities in industrial centres have tended to acquire outstanding reputa¬
tions in studies relating to their local industries, and on a national scale close
relationships are fostered between the universities, industries and the Govern¬
ment in numerous joint projects.
In 1976 there were some 585,000 people with qualifications in engineering,
technology and science in Great Britain, of whom 307,000 were qualified in
science and 278,000 in engineering and technology. Of those economically
active in 1975 (465,000), about half (237,000) held engineering qualifications.
In 1977-78 total Government research and development expenditure amounted
to about £1,700 million, of which some £1,100 million was spent by departments
on commissioned research and development. Expenditure is estimated to rise
to some £2,100 million in 1979-80. The largest departmental research and
development budget is that of the Ministry of Defence (see p 97). The main
civil departments involved are the Department of Education and Science, whose
estimated research expenditure of £474 million in 1979-80 is mostly related to
expenditure by the research councils and the universities; the Department of
Energy (£155 million in 1979-80); the Department of Industry (£132 million);
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Agri¬
culture and Fisheries for Scotland (a total of £70 million); and the Department
of the Environment and the Department of Transport (a total of £56 million).
The Department of Energy is responsible for the United Kingdom Atomic
Energy Authority (UKAEA); research in support of the exploitation of North
Sea oil and gas; research into alternative sources of energy and conservation
of energy; co-ordination of energy research within government departments;
general approval of the research programmes of the coal, gas and electricity
supply industries; and co-ordination of British contributions to energy research
and development programmes sponsored by international organisations.
An Advisory Council on Research and Development for Fuel and Power
advises the Secretary of State on the general programme of research and
development of the nationalised energy industries and on other matters related
to energy research and development. An Energy Technology Support Unit
at Harwell (Oxfordshire) assists the Department in assessing technological
possibilities in energy policy, advises on long-term research and development
programmes, and assists in their management.
An Offshore Energy Technology Board advises the Secretary of State for
Energy on research and development in offshore oil and gas technology and
is responsible for programmes designed to ensure the safety and efficiency of
offshore operations and improve the competitive efficiency of the offshore
equipment industry in Britain.
The Secretary of State for Energy is responsible for promoting and controlling
the development of nuclear energy and ensuring that the proper degrees of

importance are attached to its various applications. The UKAEA is the main
body carrying out relevant research and development. Its programme includes
work in support of the Government’s nuclear power programme, and it builds
and operates experimental and prototype reactors (see p 268). The Authority
also works outside the nuclear field. Research and development work is under¬
taken at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell and at the
Culham Laboratory, also in Oxfordshire; at the Atomic Energy Establishment
at Winfrith (Dorset) and at establishments of the Authority’s northern division
at Warrington (Cheshire), Dounreay (Highland), Springfields (Lancashire)
and Windscale (Cumbria). The Safety and Reliability Directorate at Culcheth
(Cheshire) is the focal point of the UKAEA’s work in relation to the safety of
nuclear reactors and related plants and processes.
Co-operation in nuclear energy between Britain and other countries takes
place within a framework of intergovernmental agreements and membership
of bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (which operates
under the aegis of the United Nations) and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and through direct
research links between the UKAEA and counterpart organisations in other
countries.
Britain takes part in the co-operative research programmes of the European
Atomic Energy Community (Euratom, see p 70) including that concerned
with establishing the feasibility of achieving controlled thermonuclear fusion.
Britain’s centre for fusion research is the UKAEA’s Culham Laboratory
whose work forms part of a co-ordinated European programme under the
auspices of Euratom. A major component of this programme is the Joint
European Torus project which is being built at Culham where the design team
has been working since 1973. This project is intended to carry forward research
into a completely new source of energy through the fusion of the nuclei of
light elements, using cheap, readily available and hitherto untapped resources.
The Departments’ research programmes are the responsibility of the Directorate
General of Research which provides a common service to both Departments.
Programmes are formulated by seven research requirement committees, which
bring together the main customer-contractor and research policy interests.
About 40 per cent of the Departments’ programmes are carried out at their
research establishments: the Building Research Establishment (see p 247), the
Transport and Road Research Laboratory (see p 296) and the Hydraulics
Research Station. The remainder is the subject of contracts placed with, or
grants given to, a wide range of organisations. About half of the Department of
the Environment’s programme is devoted to environmental protection (including
water resources and pollution), a third to housing and construction, and the
remainder to land use planning, the location of mineral resources and the
countryside. A third of the Department of Transport’s programme is concerned
with transport policy and planning, 18 per cent with road safety and the remainder
with other road research. Research associations receiving financial assistance from
the Department include the Construction Industry Research and Information
Association, the Building Services Research and Information Association, the
Timber Research and Development Association and the Water Research Centre.
The Department of Industry is responsible for the sponsorship of manufacturing
industries and for technical services to industry, and for six research establish¬
ments. Of these, the National Physical Laboratory has responsibilities for
PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES
381
the national system of measurement, for technical aspects of standards (including
the British Calibration Service) and for research in computing, numerical
analysis, chemical standards and materials applications. The National Engineer¬
ing Laboratory carries out research in mechanical engineering aimed at helping
industry improve designs and production processes by the application of
improved technology. The Warren Spring Laboratory undertakes research
in control engineering, materials handling, metals extraction, mineral processing,
waste materials processing and environmental technology. The National
Maritime Institute has special facilities and expertise relating to the character¬
istics and performance of ships and offshore structures, marine traffic and
navigation safety, wind and water forces on structures and in conducting
marine trials and measurements at sea. The Computer Aided Design Centre
is concerned with increasing and optimising the use of computer aided design
by industry. The Laboratory of the Government Chemist offers analytical
services and scientific advice to government departments. These establishments
undertake contract research for British industry and overseas firms.
The Department sponsors research by extra-mural contracts with industry,
universities and research associations. In accordance with the Government’s
customer-contractor principle, the Department administers a number of
requirements boards to determine the objectives and balance of the relevant
research and development programmes, to further the practical application of
technology and to advise on science and technology matters in their fields.
They cover ship and marine technology; mechanical engineering and machine
tools; engineering materials; computers, systems and electronics; chemicals
and minerals; metrology and standards; garment and allied industries; and
electrical technology. They are responsible to the Secretary of State for
Industry and include representatives from other departments, industry and
bodies in the public sector. The Chief Scientist and Engineer’s Board covers
other relevant branches of technology.
Agricultural,
Food, Fisheries
and Forestry
Research
Agricultural research is carried out mainly by the Agricultural Research Council,
the government agricultural departments and by private industry. Fisheries
research is conducted by the government fisheries departments, the White Fish
Authority, and the Natural Environment Research Council.
Advice is given to the government agricultural departments and to the ARC
on priorities for all state-aided research and development in agriculture and
food in England, Wales and Scotland by the Joint Consultative Organisation
(JCO). The JCO comprises members of the farming and food industries,
scientists, economists and members of the departments’ professional, technical
and administrative services and consists of five advisory boards concerned
with animals; arable crops and forage; horticulture; food science and technology;
and engineering and buildings. The Scottish Agricultural Development Council,
comprising members of the farming industry, advises the Secretary of State for
Scotland on agricultural research and development priorities in Scotland.
Government
Agricultural
and Food
Departments
The Agricultural Development and Advisory Service of the Ministry of Agri¬
culture, Fisheries and Food does both applied and basic research. At its Central
Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, research and laboratory investigations
are carried out into the causes, pathology, epidemiology and control of diseases
of farm livestock, including poultry; the diagnosis of animal and poultry
diseases (other than foot-and-mouth disease); and the making and testing of
certain biological products. The Harpenden Laboratory provides the scientific
basis for essential legislation against plant pests and diseases, and acts as a
382
Government

liaison centre for the collection and dissemination of information on pests and
diseases of crops and plants and on the uses and toxic hazards of pesticides
used in agriculture and horticulture. It carries out research and development
on plant health problems, and also on the detection of pesticide residues in
treated crops and crop products, and on the formulation of pesticides. Research
work on insects, mites and fungi affecting food storage and on harmful mammals
and birds is carried out at laboratories at Slough (Berkshire), and Tolworth
and Worplesdon (both in Surrey). This provides the scientific basis for advisory
work on their detection and control. They are also concerned with the safe use
of pesticides in food storage and in animal husbandry, and with the effect on
wildlife of pesticides of all kinds.
The Chief Scientific Adviser (Food) and the Food Science Division provide
advice on scientific and technical aspects of food. Particular attention is paid
to the safety, quality and nutritive value of food, including consideration of
food additives and contaminants. Close liaison is maintained with the Depart¬
ment of Health and Social Security and with other government departments
and agencies. The Division has laboratories in Norwich and London.
In Scotland research work at East Craigs, Edinburgh, by the Department
of Agriculture and Fisheries, is mainly concerned with the problems of cultivar
taxonomy, seed testing, healthy seed potato production, plant pathology, and
the ecology of birds, mammals and insects harmful to agriculture and stored
products. In Northern Ireland the Department of Agriculture is responsible
for promotion of research in food produced by agriculture and in veterinary
sciences with the aim of improving efficiency of production, marketability of
foods and the health of plants and animals. The Department is also responsible
for work on forest science, ecology of freshwater and marine fish as well as on
the biology of freshwater resources.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food’s research work is carried out
by the Directorate of Fisheries Research at Lowestoft and by the Torry Research
Station in Aberdeen. The former includes a Marine Fisheries Laboratory
and Fisheries Radiobiological Laboratory at Lowestoft, a Shellfish and Marine
Pollution Laboratory at Burnham-on-Crouch (Essex), a Salmon and Freshwater
Fisheries Laboratory in London, a Shellfish Cultivation Station at Conwy
(Gwynedd) and a Fish Disease Centre at Weymouth. Torry Research Station
and an outstation at Hull are concerned with the investigation of all aspects
of fish technology. There are seven research vessels engaged on sea-going,
inshore and estuarine work. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries
for Scotland maintains a marine research laboratory and six sea-going research
ships at Aberdeen, and a freshwater fisheries research laboratory at Pitlochry.
A Fisheries Research and Development Board, representative of government
departments and the industry, advises fisheries ministers on research pro¬
grammes, objectives and priorities. A Controller of Fisheries Research and
Development, responsible jointly to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland, co-ordinates the programmes of
the research laboratories.
Forestry Forestry research is carried out by the Forestry Commission at the Forest
Research Station, Alice Holt Lodge, Surrey, and the Northern Research
Station, Roslin, near Edinburgh. By means of grants, aid is also given for
forestry research work undertaken by various universities and other institu¬
tions, including the Commonwealth Forestry Institute, Oxford. Expenditure
by the Commission on research work in Great Britain amounted to ^4 million

m 1978-79. Research into the quality and uses of home-grown timber is carried
out by Princes Risborough Laboratory in Buckinghamshire, and also by grant-
aided associations. An extensive research programme on Dutch elm disease
has been carried out by the Commission since the outbreak of the disease in
1969.
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (founded in I759)> covering 120 hectares
(300 acres), and its 200-hectare (500-acre) estate at Wakehurst Place, Ardinaly
(West Sussex) are part of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
The Herbarium houses one of the largest collections of specimens in the world
and is primarily concerned with research into classification of plants and the
preparation of plant lists; it also classifies about 50,000 specimens a year from
overseas. A Survey Unit gathers and provides information on endangered
species of plant on a worldwide basis. The gardens have an important library
and four museums open to the public. The study of plant anatomy, plant
biochemistry, cytology and genetics is undertaken in the Jodrell Laboratory.
The laboratory’s Plant Physiology Section is based at Wakehurst Place where
research is being carried out into seed germination and storage. A wide range of
living plants, comprising 3,100 types representing 340 families of plant, is
displayed at Kew.
The Royal Botanic Garden at Edinburgh was founded in 1670 and is acr
ministered by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.
Together with the associated Logan Botanic Garden at Ardwell near Stranraer^
the Younger Botanic Garden at Benmore, near Dunoon, and Dawyck Garden
at Stobo (Borders), it maintains large collections of living plants (both temperate
and tropical) used for taxonomic research (into classification of plants), including
tropical plants.
The Procurement Executive of the Ministry of Defence engages in research
for defence purposes at its research and development establishments and through
contracts placed with industry and universities (see p 96). It also undertakes
certain research for civil purposes, including meteorology (being responsible for
financing the Meteorological Office at Bracknell in Berkshire, which compiles
weather forecasts and undertakes research in meteorology and some aspects of
geophysics), civil aviation and space research.
The Department of Health and Social Security spent nearly £26 million on
research and development in 1978-79 of which £107 million was on biomedical
research through the Medical Research Council. The Department’s Chief
Scientist is supported by a group of independent advisers covering a wide range
of scientific disciplines. The Department is involved in international research
and development, and is participating in the European Community’s medical
and public health research programme.
The Health and Safety Executive, working mainly through its Health and
Safety Laboratories, carries out research into matters affecting the health and
safety of people at work. Fields of study include explosion risks, fires, protective
equipment, methods for monitoring and measuring airborne contaminants, the
safety of engineering systems and fluid mechanics.
The Department of Employment has a Research and Planning Division to
conduct and advise on its programme of research on socio-economic problems
including industrial relations, incomes and general manpower issues. Assistance
is given to the Department in social research by the Office of Population Censuses
and Surveys and close contact is maintained with the Social Science Research
Council.

Nearly all of the Home Office’s expenditure on research and development, of
about ^7 million a year, is concerned with law and order.
Some of the public corporations which run the nationalised industries have
their own research organisations, in particular those concerned with energy (see
Chapter 14), steel and transport. These organisations also give support to other
organisations concerned with research on matters of interest to them.
A considerable amount of research is undertaken and financed by private sector
firms and learned bodies (see below). Virtually all industrial research work is
carried out within industry by firms in their own laboratories and by research
associations. Important contributions to the support of medical research in
particular subjects are made by industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry,
and by the many private charities or voluntary organisations which raise money
for particular branches of research. Charities and voluntary bodies contribute
some £25 million a year to medical research.
Within the total expenditure of £1,340 million on research and development
carried out within private industry in 1975-76, expenditure by private industry
accounted for £1,185 million, public corporations for £124 million and research
associations for £31 million. The main industries involved included aerospace
(which spent £292 million), electronics, including computers (£251 million),
pharmaceutical products (£79 million), other chemical products (£159 million),
other electrical engineering (£64 million), motor vehicles (£87 million) and
mechanical engineering (£71 million). Firms in science-based industries commit
large private funds to research and development in the course of business.
A number of institutes for sponsored research have been established to
extend the facilities for private research for industrial firms by studying problems
which are not within the scope of the average industrial laboratory.
A scheme by which the Government helped firms with similar interests to form
organisations known as research associations, to carry out industrial research
co-operatively, was started in 1917. Encouragement by government grants,
related to the contributions made by the industries concerned, has lately been
phased out in favour of extra-mural contract support, such as that offered by
the Department of Industry’s Research and Development Requirements Boards
(see p 381). About 30 of these research associations operate in areas of interest
to the Department of Industry. In addition there are four (buildings services;
construction industry; timber; and water) linked with the Department of the
Environment and four (Flour Milling and Baking; Campden Food Preservation;
British Food Manufacturing Industries; and British Industrial Biological
Research) linked with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Among
the largest of the industrial research associations are those dealing with pro¬
duction engineering, welding, electrical manufacturing, cotton and man-made
fibres, non-ferrous metals and motor manufacturing. (See also Chapter 13.)
Although today most research is conducted under other auspices, the learned
societies, of which there are more than 300, have retained their traditional
function of facilitating the spread of knowledge. The most eminent of those
concerned with science in its broadest aspects (as distinct from those societies
with specialised interests and activities) are the Royal Society, Royal Society of
Arts, Royal Institution and British Association.

The Royal Society, or, more fully, the Royal Society of London for Improving
Natural Knowledge, founded in 1660, occupies a unique place in Britain’s
scientific affairs and is equivalent to national academies of sciences in other
countries. It is the oldest such academy in the world to have enjoyed continuous
existence. There are today three main categories of Fellowship: Royal Fellows,
Foreign Members, of whom there are about 80, and the main body of Fellows
numbering about 880. Election to the Fellowship, which is for life, is restricted
to 40 persons a year. The Royal Society is governed by a council of 21 members.
The President of the Society is consulted on scientific appointments to research
councils and Fellows serve on most governmental advisory councils and com¬
mittees concerned with research.
The Royal Society provides grants for scientific investigations and expeditions,
for travel by individual scientists, for studies in the history of science, and for
scientific publications. Its activities also include the holding of scientific meetings
and the publishing of scientific papers, the presentation of medals, the giving
of endowed lectures and the award of research appointments. It administers 18
research professorships, four supported from private funds and 14 from its
parliamentary grant, and a further 45 research fellowships in British universities.
The highest medal awarded is the Copley Medal, for which scientists from all
countries are eligible; there are also three Royal Medals, and the Rumford,
Davy, Darwin, Buchanan, Sylvester, Hughes, Leverhulme and Mullard Medals,
and the Esso Award for the conservation of energy. There are seven lectureships:
the Croonian (biology); the Bakerian (physical sciences); the Ferrier (nervous
system); the Wilkins (history of science); the Leeuwenhoek (microbiology); the
Bernal (social functions of science); and the Clifford Paterson (for electrical
science and technology). There are also the Rutherford Memorial, the Blackett
Memorial and the Isaac Newton Lectures which are given overseas. The Council
has set up committees, some of them jointly with other bodies, to promote
improvements in education in science and to emphasise the importance of
applied sciences, especially engineering.
The international relations of the Royal Society are extensive. It represents
Britain in the international unions comprising the International Council of
Scientific Unions and appoints national committees for each of them. The
Society represents Britain on the Council of the International Institute for
Applied Systems Analysis, and is a member of the European Science Foundation
and certain other organisations. It also plays a leading part in international
scientific programmes and promotes exchange visits of scientists and co-operative
research through agreements with many academies throughout the world. The
largest scheme is the European Science Exchange Programme, which provides for
fellowships (usually of one year) and study visits (lasting about two months) with
16 other countries in Western Europe.
The Royal Society of Arts (properly, the Royal Society for the Encouragement
of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) is concerned with arts, architecture and
design, science and technology, industry and commerce, the environment and
education. Since its foundation in 1754, one of the Society’s principal objects
has been to promote the progress of all branches of practical knowledge, chiefly
by means of lectures and conferences, and by the publication of a monthly
journal designed to enable leading authorities to report on developments of
public as well as specialist interest.
The Royal Institution was founded in 1799 as a public body for facilitating the
introduction of useful mechanical inventions and improvements, and for teaching

the application of science to everyday life. Later it undertook the ‘promotion
of chemical science by experiments and lectures for improving arts and manu¬
factures’, and ‘the diffusion and extension of useful knowledge’. Its character,
however, was largely determined by the work of Sir Humphry Davy and Michael
Faraday, who established a tradition of research. Today, the Royal Institution
has extensive research laboratories, and lectures are given on recent developments
in science and other branches of knowledge.
The British Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1831
to promote general interest in science and its applications. One of its chief
activities is the annual meeting, attended by many young students as well as
by eminent scientists. In addition the Association plans special lectures, exhibi¬
tions and discussions (some designed for young audiences), the publication of
pamphlets, the organisation of conferences, the appointment of study groups
and liaison with the Press and with sound and television broadcasting services.
The Association has area committees and three lectureships for young scientists
(the Kelvin, the Darwin and the Lister lectureships, dealing respectively with
the physical, biological and sociological sciences) to encourage scientists to
make their activities known to wider audiences. The British Association has
made an important contribution to the development of science by taking or
recommending action to remove obstacles to the discovery and application of
scientific knowledge.
There are numerous technical institutions and professional associations, many
of which are playing a distinguished part in promoting their own disciplines or
are interested in the education and professional well-being of their members. The
Council of Engineering Institutions, the federal body for the chartered engineer¬
ing institutions, promotes the co-ordination of the engineering profession. The
Council of Science and Technology Institutes is a federal body with five member
institutes representing biologists, chemists, mathematicians, metallurgists and
physicists.
A Fellowship of Engineering, envisaged as complementary to the Royal
Society and forming an independent and authoritative forum of eminent
engineering opinion, was set up in 1976. The founder members were Fellows
of the Royal Society, together with a number of other distinguished engineers
who were selected by the chairman of the Council of Engineering Institutions
and the presidents of the individual engineering institutions. Further Fellows,
up to a total of 1,000, but not more than 60 in one year, are being elected.
MacRobert Awards have been presented since 1969 by the Council of Engineer¬
ing Institutions on behalf of MacRoberts Trusts, for successful technological
innovations contributing to the national prestige and prosperity of Britain. A
fund was endowed in 1972 by the late Lord Rank to be used to reward out¬
standing contributions to human nutrition and crop husbandry, and to opto¬
electronics and nearly related phenomena. The first Rank prizes were announced
in 1976. In giving awards for technological innovation, the Queen’s Award to
Industry scheme concentrates on the potential application in industry of out¬
standing achievements in advanced technology in the form of processes or
products.
There are at least two bodies concerned with the relationship between science
and society: the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science; and the
Council for Science and Society, formed by specialists in the natural and social

sciences, the law, and medicine to support and stimulate research into the social
effects of scientific and technological development.
The Zoological Society of London, whose main function is as a scientific
organisation, runs the world-famous London Zoo, opened in 1828, which
occupies 14 hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s Park, London. In 1931 the Society
opened Whipsnade Park Zoo near Dunstable (Bedfordshire) where over 2,000
animals roam a 200-hectare (500-acre) park. Comparative studies are undertaken
in pathology, biochemistry, radiology and infectious diseases, and in the repro¬
ductive processes of mammals. The Society also organises scientific meetings
and symposia for zoologists, publishes scientific journals and maintains one of
the largest zoological libraries in the world. At the end of 1978 the Society’s
collections at London Zoo and Whipsnade included 2,102 mammals, 2,118 birds,
383 reptiles, 268 amphibians, 2,920 fishes and 3,238 invertebrates. Other well-
known zoos are those at Edinburgh, Bristol, Chester, Dudley, Chessington and
Jersey. There are also a number of ‘safari parks’ containing reservations of wild
animals through which the public can pass in closed motor cars.
The British Museum (Natural History) is one of the world’s principal centres
for the general study of natural history, particularly for specialised research into
taxonomy. It has five scientific departments: botany, entomology, mineralogy,
palaeontology and zoology. It possesses extensive collections of extant and fossil
animals and plants and of minerals, rocks and meteorites. The Science Museum
illustrates the development of pure and applied science in all countries, but
chiefly in Britain, which has always held a leading place in engineering, agricul¬
ture, navigation, mining, aeronautics, and in the development of industrial
machinery and processes. The geology of Britain is probably known in more
exact detail than that of any other country in the world, and the Institute of
Geological Sciences has an outstanding collection of exhibits in its Geological
Museum. I hese three museums are in South Kensington, London. Other
important collections are those of the Museum of Science and Industry, in
Birmingham, and the Museum of the History of Science, at Oxford.
1 he functions of the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC),
an independent public corporation set up in 1949, are to promote the manu¬
facture by industry, under NRDC licence, of new products and processes
invented in government laboratories, universities and elsewhere, advancing
money where necessary to bring them to a commercially viable stage, and to
speed up technological advance by investing money with British industrial
firms, principally on a joint venture basis, for the development of their own
inventions and projects. 1 he NRDC can deal with innovations in almost any
area of technology except atomic energy and defence. It is engaged in 508
development projects, of which 216 are joint ventures with industry. Major
projects to date include cephalosporin antibiotics, hovercraft, pyrethroid in¬
secticides, computers and computer software, pharmaceuticals, alkali-resistant
glass fibres, fuel cells, electric motors, dental cement, electronics and carbon
fibres.
Britain is represented on the European Economic Community’s Scientific and
Technical Research Committee, the object of which is to co-ordinate national
policies on these matters and to implement joint projects of interest to the
Community, and the Committee for Scientific and Technological Policy of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Other

intergovernmental organisations involved in scientific co-operation with which
Britain is concerned include: European Co-operation in Science and Tech¬
nology; specialised agencies of the United Nations such as the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation; the International Atomic
Energy Agency; the Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Energy
Agency of the OECD; the European Organisation for Nuclear Research; the
European Space Agency; the European Molecular Biology Conference; the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory; the International Agency for Research
on Cancer; and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Science Committee.
Among non-governmental organisations Britain is represented in the inter¬
national unions comprising the International Council of Scientific Unions (see
p 385). The five research councils, the Royal Society and the British Academy
became founding members of the European Science Foundation set up in 1974.
In nuclear energy Britain also co-operates within the framework of international
agreements; through direct links between the UKAEA and its counterparts;
and through joint companies in, for example, nuclear fuel and radioisotope
manufacture.
There are scientific counsellors in the British Embassies in Washington,
Paris, Bonn, Moscow and Tokyo who among other things promote contacts in
science and technology between Britain and the countries to which they are
accredited. These counsellors serve all central government departments con¬
cerned in overseas scientific affairs, as well as the research councils and the
Royal Society, which is the main representative of Britain in areas of non¬
governmental collaboration. Administrative support for the counsellors is
provided in Britain by the Department of Industry’s Overseas Technical
Information Unit.
The Overseas Development Administration (ODA) of the Foreign and Common¬
wealth Office promotes scientific activities in the interests of developing countries.
These include research covering a wide range of disciplines, specialist advice
from Britain, advisory visits, conferences for exchange of information, training
scientists from overseas in universities and research institutions in Britain,
recruiting scientific staff from Britain, and providing support for existing research
services and research projects overseas. Equipment is sometimes provided for
research purposes and to encourage scientific training. There are two organisa¬
tions forming part of the ODA which are wholly engaged on scientific work to
assist developing countries. They are the Tropical Products Institute, which
specialises in the post-harvest aspects of agricultural, fish and animal products,
and the Centre for Overseas Pest Research, which is concerned with the develop¬
ment and application of pest control techniques relevant to tropical agriculture.
In addition, the ODA meets the cost of a number of scientific units which do
substantial research work of benefit to developing countries. The ODA also
supports the International Agricultural Research Centres under the aegis of the
Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research. In 1978 the ODA
spent ^10-2 million on scientific activities including research for the benefit of
developing countries. Some 700 research and development projects to improve
life in the developing countries are being supported, including many projects
concerned with agriculture or medicine.
The principal aims of the British Council (see p 69) in science (including
agriculture, medicine and technology) are to foster co-operation between
British scientists and scientists of other countries, to promote among overseas
specialists a better understanding and knowledge of Britain and its scientific
SPACE

PROMOTION OF THE SCIENCES 389
achievements, and, in the developing countries, to identify and manage develop¬
ment projects in the technological, scientific and educational sectors.
There are 70 staff overseas with science qualifications who work to advance
technological, educational and scientific development, and collaboration with
Britain. One of their priorities is to make British expertise available, increasingly
through consultancy schemes; others are to establish research and development
facilities, to provide trained manpower, and to assist with the establishment of
technical teaching institutes.
Interchange of scientists, technologists and educationalists is considered to
be of prime importance. British specialists in a very wide range of subjects are
sent overseas to advise on research and development and on teaching, and to
give courses of lectures, while scientists, technologists and technical teachers
are recruited or seconded to posts in overseas universities, technical teaching
institutes, teacher training colleges, education authorities, schools or curriculum
reform centres.
The Council invites senior overseas people to Britain and arranges pro¬
grammes of visits or attachments. It makes its own awards for postgraduate
study in Britain and supervises programmes for senior specialists and students
who come to Britain through the United Nations agencies or bilateral technical
assistance schemes. The Council administers the Academic Interchange with
Europe Scheme, the European Academic Links Scheme, the Younger Research
Workers’ Interchange Scheme, the Commonwealth University Interchange
Scheme and scientific exchange with Eastern Europe. Professional courses
organised by the Council in various parts of Britain for overseas specialists
include science and medicine. At the Council’s headquarters in London,
extensive professional, advisory and information facilities within specialist
departments and libraries covering education, medicine, science, technology and
science education are available to overseas people.
Government responsibility for space activities is undertaken by the Secretary
of State for Education and Science (through the Science Research Council),
the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for Industry
according to the nature of the project. Expenditure on space activities in 1978
was about ^65 million.
Britain is a member of the European Space Agency (ESA) together with
Belgium, Denmark, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Irish
Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The
Department of Industry is responsible for leading the British delegation to the
ESA and for British participation in the space application programmes of the
Agency consisting of the development of telecommunication, meteorological and
maritime satellites and the Space Laboratory, a manned laboratory to be carried
aboard the United States Space Shuttle. Development and production of
equipment for the ESA’s ‘Ariane’ launcher is undertaken through a bilateral
agreement with France. The Department of Industry is also responsible for
industrial sponsorship of Britain’s space industry. It participates in a joint
departmental industry technology programme designed to improve Britain’s
industrial capability in space application systems; the programme is supervised
on behalf of the Department by the Procurement Executive of the Ministry
of Defence. The Space Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at
Farnborough also undertakes long-term research and development to assist
industry.
The Department of Industry, through the Post Office, is responsible for the
use of satellites for civil communications purposes and undertakes research work
390
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
in connection with communications systems using satellites, including those of
Intelsat (see p 314).
1 he British civil scientific space research programme is the responsibility of
the Department of Education and Science through the SRC. The latter provides
Britain’s representatives and financial contribution for the ESA’s scientific
satellite programme. Scientific research, notably in astronomy, space and the
earth s atmosphere, using satellites, rockets and balloons, is supported by the
SRC (see p 378). The scientific programmes of the ESA and bilateral arrange¬
ments with other countries, such as the United States through its National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has made or is making possible
flight opportunities for both European and British experiments (as on the Inter¬
national Solar Polar Mission planned for 1983), American launching of the
British Ariel series of scientific satellites (the sixth of which was launched in
June 1979), the incorporation of British experiments in American satellites,
and the analysis of lunar surface samples. British experiments have provided
information which has helped to increase scientific knowledge, especially in
astronomy and astrophysics, and to interpret climatic patterns. The SRC’s
Appleton Laboratory provides support and services for the universities’ space-
based experiments and also operates the NASA Spaceflight Tracking and Data
Network station at Winkfield (Berkshire). The orbital prediction and co¬
ordination centre is at the Appleton Laboratory, which is also the home of one
of the three World Data Centres for space research.
21 Promotion of the Arts
Arts Councils
Artistic and cultural activity in Britain ranges from the highest standards of
professional performance to the enthusiastic support and participation of
amateurs. London is one of the leading world centres for music, drama, opera
and dance; and festivals held in Bath, Cheltenham, Edinburgh and other towns
are also well known. Many British playwrights, composers, sculptors, painters,
writers, actors, singers, choreographers and dancers enjoy international reputa¬
tions. At an amateur level, activities which make use of local talent and resources
take many forms. Amateur choral, orchestral, operatic, dramatic and other
societies for the arts abound; and increasing numbers of people take an interest
in crafts such as pottery, weaving and woodwork.
Promotion and patronage of the arts are the concern of both official and
unofficial bodies. The Government and local authorities take an active part, and
a substantial amount of help also comes from private sources, including trusts
and commercial concerns. Policies towards support for the arts are broadly
similar, however, and there are two main aims. One is to maintain and improve
the traditional arts and cultural heritage, and to make them more accessible to
greater numbers of people. The other is to provide financial aid to working artists
and craftsmen, and to encourage more people to take part in creative leisure
pursuits.
Ministerial responsibility for general arts policy is borne by the Chancellor of
the Duchy of Lancaster, a member of the Cabinet, at the Office of Arts and
Libraries (set up In June 1979), the Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland are also concerned with cultural matters. In addition, the
Government is responsible for the upkeep of ancient monuments and historic
buildings, and grants are made towards the maintenance of privately owned
historic buildings (see p 172).
The main educational functions concerning the arts are carried out through
the central government education departments. They are concerned, in partner¬
ship with local education authorities and voluntary bodies, with arts education
in schools, further education colleges, polytechnics, evening institutes and
community centres, and with the public library service.
Most government support for the arts takes the form of grants to independent
agencies. The most important of these is the Arts Council of Great Britain,
established by Royal Charter in 1946, whose main objects are to develop and
improve the knowledge, understanding and practice of the arts, to increase
their accessibility to the public, and to advise and co-operate with government
departments, local authorities and other organisations.
Government allocations to the Arts Council in 1979-80 amount to ^60
million. The Council gives financial help and advice to over 1,200 organisations,
from the major opera, dance and drama companies, orchestras and festivals, to
the smallest touring theatres and experimental groups.
The Council encourages such diverse interests as contemporary dance, photo¬
graphy and art films, and helps professional creative writers, choreographers,
392
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
composers, artists and photographers by means of bursary and award schemes.
It promotes art exhibitions and tours of opera, dance and drama companies.
Funds are provided for specialist training courses in the arts and for helping
with the construction of new buildings or improvements to existing theatres,
concert halls and other arts buildings under its ‘Housing the Arts’ scheme.
Members of the Council are appointed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lan¬
caster. Advised by panels responsible for different aspects of the arts, the Council
itself allocates subsidies to the main professional arts-promoting organisations.
Organisations in Scotland and Wales receive their subsidies from the Scottish
and Welsh Arts Councils which are committees of the Arts Council of Great
Britain with a large measure of autonomy.
In Northern Ireland there is an independent Arts Council with aims and
functions similar to those of the Arts Council of Great Britain. It receives an
annual grant from the Northern Ireland Department of Education.

Contributions
The British Council promotes knowledge of British culture and literature
overseas (see p 69), and maintains libraries in most of the countries in
which it is represented. The Council may initiate or support overseas tours
by British theatre companies, orchestras, choirs and opera and dance companies,
as well as by individual actors, musicians and artists. It promotes fine arts and
other exhibitions overseas, and organises British participation in international
exhibitions. The Council distributes overseas a wide range of specialised films,
many of them on the arts, and encourages professional interchange in all cultural
fields between Britain and other countries.
A major contribution to the arts (particularly music and drama) is made by the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and, to a lesser extent, by the in¬
dependent television and radio programme companies and the Independent
Broadcasting Authority (IBA). The BBC has orchestras employing about a
third of the country’s full-time professional musicians, and each week it broad¬
casts some 90 hours of serious music (both live and recorded) on its Radio 3
channel. It regularly commissions new music, particularly by British composers,
and sponsors concerts, competitions and festivals. Independent television
companies make grants for the promotion of the arts in their regions, particularly
to regional arts associations, and transmit general magazine programmes on the
arts. Both the BBC and IBA broadcast a wide range of new drama together
with adaptations of novels and stage plays. They also screen a variety of feature
films including British and overseas productions.
Local authorities support the arts in many ways. In addition to their responsi¬
bilities for education (including specialised art education) and the public
library service, many provide and maintain local museums and art galleries. In
Great Britain the authorities have power to incur expenditure on entertainment
in all its forms. Many authorities make contributions to regional arts associations
(see below) and towards the expense of professional symphony orchestras and
local theatre companies. Grants are often made towards the capital cost of new
arts buildings, especially theatres; the Greater London Council, for example,
made a substantial contribution towards the cost of the National Theatre.
Valuable support for the arts comes from many voluntary sources including
charitable trusts and foundations, and supporters’ organisations of the major
national institutions. Industrial and commercial concerns offer a growing source
of patronage, and an Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts has been

formed to advise interested companies. Sponsorship may take the form of grants
to regional arts associations, local arts festivals and orchestras, and donations
towards individual cultural events. Tax advantages and exemptions are available
to encourage such support.
The Government encourages regional co-operation in arts patronage through
15 regional arts associations in England and Wales whose aim it is to ensure
that the whole range of the arts is more widely available to people throughout
their areas. They can offer financial assistance to local and other regional arts
organisations and advise on and promote all sorts of local arts activities. They
are financed by a combination of local authority, Arts Council and private
funds; local authorities and a wide range of other interests are represented on
the associations. Other examples of co-operative patronage are the orchestra
boards which support symphony and chamber orchestras and the societies
formed to present some of the many arts festivals in Britain.
Considerable interest and enthusiasm is shown for more than 200 professional
arts festivals which take place each year. Most are subsidised by a combination
of local authority, regional arts association and private funds, while the major
ones receive Arts Council assistance. Some arts festivals concentrate particularly
on music. These include: the Three Choirs Festival which has taken place
annually for more than 250 years in Gloucester, Worcester or Hereford; the
Cheltenham Festival which is largely devoted to contemporary British music;
and the Aldeburgh and English Bach festivals. Others cater for a number of
art forms; among the better known are the Edinburgh International Festival,
the Royal National Eisteddfod of Wales, and those held in the City of London, in
Bath, Brighton, Malvern, Harrogate, Chichester, Windsor and York. A festival
is held in Belfast under the auspices of the Queen’s University.
There are more than 180 arts centres in Great Britain and the number is increas¬
ing steadily. They provide opportunities for enjoyment of and participation in the
arts. The centres are supported mainly by regional arts associations and local
authorities with some help from the Arts Council and other organisations.
They may be small centres for amateur activities or they may offer a professional
programme. A growing number of theatres and art galleries also provide a focal
point for the community by offering facilities for other arts.
The author of any original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work is auto¬
matically protected by the Copyright Act 1956 and its related international
conventions1 from the unauthorised reproduction of the work both before and
after publication. The author of the work is the first owner of the copyright,
and the normal term of copyright in published original works is the life of the
author and a period of 50 years after his or her death.
Britain is one of the world’s major theatre centres. In London during the summer
season, theatres are packed with overseas visitors, while in the provinces there
is growing support for the work of regional theatres. From what was once
called the ‘fringe’ theatre, and was based on London, a network of informal
touring companies has developed, which visit many of the new arts centres and
community festivals.

Support for much of this development in British drama comes jointly from
the Government, through the Arts Councils of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, from local authorities and regional arts associations, and from some
private sponsorship. In particular the Arts Council assists developments in
new drama by encouraging co-operation between theatres and playwrights by
means of bursaries, commissions and guaranteed royalties. Schemes are also
in operation to train stage designers, directors, technicians, actors and those
wishing to take up theatre administration.
Over 250 theatres in professional use in Britain can each accommodate more
than 200 people. Some are owned or rented by non-profit-distributing com¬
panies, the majority of which receive Arts Council subsidies, while the remainder
are operated commercially or owned by local authorities.
London is the centre of theatrical activity with some 40 principal theatres in
or near the centre and eight in the suburbs. Most are let to producing manage¬
ments on a commercial basis, but five are occupied by major subsidised com¬
panies. These include the National Theatre which stages classical and modern
plays from various countries in its three auditoria on the south bank of the River
Thames, the Royal Shakespeare Company which presents Shakespearean plays
at Stratford-upon-Avon and a mixed repertoire in London, and the Old Vic
(formerly known as the Prospect) Company, Britain’s major theatrical touring
company, which has a London base in the famous Old Vic theatre.
Outside London there are a number of theatres which accommodate pre-
and post-West End tours of the major London productions and performances
by companies specially formed for touring. (Both the National Theatre and
Royal Shakespeare companies have toured in Britain and overseas.) A decline
in the number of these theatres has been checked in response to the demand
by audiences outside London for the larger opera, dance and drama companies.
Some theatres have been bought by local authorities. Many non-repertory
theatres outside London present all kinds of drama and many also put on
variety shows and other entertainments. There has, however, been a growth in
the activities of over 40 resident theatre companies which receive financial
support from the Arts Council and the local authorities. These companies
employ leading producers, designers and actors, and standards are high. Some
companies have their own theatres, others rent from local authorities.
There is no censorship of plays, but the Theatres Act 1968 makes it an offence
to present or direct an obscene performance of a play in public or in private
(including theatre clubs), an obscene performance being defined as one which
tends to ‘deprave and corrupt persons who are likely ... to attend it’. Provision
is made for a defence against an obscenity charge on the grounds that the
performance is for the public good in the interests of, for example, drama, opera
or literature.
There are several thousand amateur dramatic societies in Britain; they are
encouraged by local education authorities, by other public bodies, and by four
special organisations—the British Theatre Association, the National Drama
Conference, the Scottish Community Drama Association and the Association
of Ulster Drama Festivals. Most universities have active amateur drama clubs
and societies; an International Festival of University Theatre is held annually.
Training for the theatre is provided mainly in drama schools. Among the best
known are the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the Central School of Speech
and Drama, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the Guildhall

School of Music and Drama, all of which are in London; and the Old Vic
School in Bristol. There is the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama
in Glasgow; and in Cardiff, the Welsh College of Music and Drama. Several
universities offer major courses in drama.
Theatre for young people has increasing importance. In 1970 the Young Vic
was opened as a theatre for young people, the National Youth Theatre is based
in London, and the Scottish Youth Theatre was established in 1970. There are
some 10 specialist companies, including the Unicorn Theatre for Young People,
Theatre Centre and the Polka Company, some of which are supported by the
Arts Council. Outside London about 30 repertory companies provide pro¬
grammes and other types of theatre activity for young people. In Northern
Ireland Interplay Theatre, a company sponsored and administered by the Arts
Council of Northern Ireland, works mainly in schools.
Most of the many amateur youth theatres in Britain are supported by local
authorities. Many schools and youth clubs put on plays and provide some
education in drama. The London education service provides special drama
centres for young people.
Music plays an important role in British cultural life. Pop music, folk music,
jazz, light music and brass bands all have substantial followings while the wide¬
spread interest in classical music is reflected in the large audiences at choral and
orchestral concerts and at performances of opera, dance and chamber music.
The Arts Councils provide subsidies for orchestras, opera and dance com¬
panies, music societies and festivals. They also provide bursaries and com¬
missions for composers, musicians, designers and choreographers. The Master
of the Queen’s Music holds an office within the Royal Household, with
responsibility for organising and writing music for State occasions.
Seasons of orchestral concerts are promoted every year in many of the large
towns and cities. In central London the principal concert halls are the Royal
Festival Hall, adjacent to which are the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell
Room which accommodate smaller-scale performances; the Royal Albert Hall,
where the annual summer season of Promenade Concerts is given; the Wigmore
Hall, a recital centre; and St John’s, Smith Square.
The leading symphony orchestras are the London Philharmonic, the London
Symphony, the Philharmonia, the Royal Philharmonic, the Royal Liverpool
Philharmonic, the Halle (Manchester), the City of Birmingham Symphony,
the Bournemouth Symphony, the Ulster and the Scottish National. The BBC
runs a number of orchestras, including four symphony orchestras, providing
broadcast concerts which are often open to the public. There are also specialised
string and chamber orchestras such as the English Chamber Orchestra, the
Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, the London Mozart Players, the Bourne¬
mouth Sinfonietta, the Northern Sinfonia (Newcastle upon Tyne), the Scottish
Philharmonic, the Scottish Baroque Ensemble and the Scottish Chamber
Orchestra. Most orchestras (other than those of the BBC) receive financial aid
from the Arts Councils, local authorities and industrial sources.
Among the principal choral societies are the Bach Choir, the Royal Choral
Society, the Swansea Philharmonic Choir, the Edinburgh Royal Choral Union
and the Belfast Philharmonic Society. Almost all the leading orchestras have
close links with particular choirs, such as the Philharmonia Chorus and the

London Symphony Chorus, though these choirs are mostly independent of the
orchestras. The majority of choral societies are affiliated to the National Federa¬
tion of Music Societies.
Interest in amateur music-making is encouraged by county music committees
(some of them voluntary and some, sub-committees of local education authorities),
which are aided by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust and united in the
Standing Conference for Amateur Music. The National Federation of Music
Societies, the organisation for chamber music societies, amateur choirs and
amateur orchestras, receives an annual grant from the Arts Council to assist
affiliated societies with the cost of engaging professional soloists. Some 1,200
music societies are members of the Federation, which advises them on concert
planning and promotion. The Welsh Amateur Music Federation, funded by
the Welsh Arts Council, assists amateur music-making in Wales.
Regular seasons of opera and ballet are given at the Royal Opera House, Covent
Garden, London, which receives financial assistance from the Arts Council and
from private and business sponsorship. The Royal Opera House has a permanent
orchestra which plays for the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet. Both organisa¬
tions have a high international reputation. Seasons of opera and operetta in
English are given by the English National Opera which plays in the London
Coliseum, and makes provincial tours supplemented by the English National
Opera North based in Leeds. Sadler’s Wells Theatre houses the London per¬
formances of visiting opera and dance companies and the Sadler’s Wells Royal
Ballet. Scottish Opera has regular winter seasons at its permanent home, the
Theatre Royal in Glasgow, and tours mainly in Scotland and northern England,
while the Welsh National Opera has four quarterly seasons at the New Theatre,
Cardiff and at the Hippodrome Theatre, Birmingham, and tours chiefly in Wales
and the west of England.
An opera season, for which international casts are specially assembled, is held
every summer at Glyndebourne in Sussex; this is followed with an autumn tour
by Glyndebourne Touring Opera with different casts. Other opera companies
include Kent Opera, the English Music Theatre Company which specialises in
the performance of works by British composers, and the New Opera Company
which is associated with the English National Opera. Opera in Northern Ireland
is promoted by the Northern Ireland Opera Trust and the Studio Opera Group.
A new touring company, Opera 80, financed mainly by the Arts Council, is
expected to start production early in 1980.
Dance companies also include London Festival Ballet, Ballet Rambert (Britain’s
oldest ballet company, which re-formed in 1966 as a leading modern dance
company), Scottish Ballet, London Contemporary Dance Theatre (which
provides regular seasons of contemporary dance in London besides touring
extensively) and Northern Ballet Theatre (which concentrates its activities in
the north of England, although it makes periodic tours elsewhere). Many small
modern groups also give performances.
Professional training in music is given at colleges of music, of which the Royal
Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music and Trinity College of Music in
London, and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama in Glasgow are
grant-aided. Other leading colleges include the Guildhall School of Music and
Drama in London, the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester and the

Birmingham School of Music. The National Opera Studio provides advanced
training courses. The leading dance schools are the Royal Ballet School, the
Rambert School of Ballet and the London School of Contemporary Dance
which, with many private schools, have helped in raising British dance to its
present high standard.
A Youth and Music organisation, affiliated to the international Jeunesses
Musicales, encourages attendances by young people at opera, dance and concert
performances. Ballet for All, previously a branch of the Royal Ballet, now run
by the Royal Academy of Dancing, presents lecture-demonstrations on classical
ballet to young audiences. Educational Dance Drama Theatre receives financial
support for its work with young people and Ludus (a dance-in-education team)
and East Anglian Dance Theatre are supported by their regional arts associations
to perform in schools respectively in the North-West and East Anglian regions
of England. Scottish Ballet Workshop, the educational branch of Scottish Ballet,
operates widely in schools throughout Scotland.
Many children learn to play musical instruments at school, and some take
the examinations of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music. The
National Youth Orchestras of Great Britain and of Wales and other youth
orchestras are noted for their high standards. Almost a third of the players in
the European Community Youth Orchestra come from Britain.
British films, actors and the creative and technical services which support them
have achieved successes in international film festivals and other events. Cinema
and television films are exported to most countries of the world.
There are about 1,550 cinema screens in Great Britain, and estimated
attendance in 1978 amounted to 127 million. Cinema attendance figures have
been declining since the mid-1950s as television has become generally accessible.
In 1953 the average weekly cinema audience was some 25 million; by 1978 it was
one-tenth of that figure although this represented an increase over 1977.
An Interim Action Committee is studying the future of the film industry.
Among the ideas being considered is the establishment of a British Film
Authority.
The Government does not invest directly in films but the National Film
Finance Corporation lends money for feature film production from capital
advanced by the Government and private interests. The Corporation also
administers the National Film Development Fund which provides loans for
script-writing and other pre-production costs.
A levy on cinema admissions, known as the Eady Levy, provides a fund to
benefit the makers of eligible films. Grants from the levy can be made to the
Children’s Film Foundation, the British Film Institute Production Board, the
National Film School, and the National Film Finance Corporation. The rest
of the fund is distributed to makers of eligible films in proportion to a film’s
takings.
A specified number of British or European Community films must be shown
in British cinemas each year. For main feature films the quota is 30 per cent
and for supporting programmes, 25 per cent.
Local authorities have powers to license cinemas and censor films. They have a
legal duty to prohibit the admission of children under the age of 16 to unsuitable
films, and may also exercise censorship over films for adults. In considering the
suitability of films the authorities normally rely on the judgment of an indepen¬
dent body, the British Board of Film Censors, to which most films for public
showing are submitted.

The British Board of Film Censors was set up in 1912, on the initiative of the
cinema industry, to ensure that a proper standard was maintained in the films
offered to the public. The Board, which does not use any written code of censor¬
ship, may require cuts to be made before granting a certificate to a film; very
rarely, it refuses a certificate. Films passed by the board are placed into one of
four categories: ‘U’ (for general exhibition); ‘A’ (for general exhibition but
parents are advised that the film contains material which they may not wish
children under the age of 14 years to see); ‘AA’ (for persons of not less than 14
years of age); and ‘X’ (for persons of not less than 18 years of age).
The documentary tradition in short film production in Britain was founded in
1929 when a group of directors began making factual films of a distinctive and
imaginative kind for the Government, and later for commercial organisations.
The war years saw a big expansion in this field and, since then, British docu¬
mentary technicians have continued to produce, for both cinema and television,
high quality factual films which have won numerous international awards. The
British Industrial and Scientific Film Association promotes the use of films in
industry, science and commerce. The Federation of Specialised Film Associa¬
tions is the trade association of documentary, short, industrial, advertising and
cartoon film makers. The National Panel for Film Festivals, under the aegis of
the British Council, is responsible for the selection of British entries for inter¬
national short and documentary film festivals.
The Government sponsors a wide range of documentary films for use non-
theatrically and on television in Britain and overseas. They are produced through
the Central Office of Information (COI), and the majority are commissioned
through private companies. There are several major documentary film libraries,
including the COTs Central Film Library, which provides films on hire or free
of charge to a wide variety of educational, industrial and other users. The Films
of Scotland Committee promotes the production of films covering the industries
and cultural traditions of Scotland.
Cinemas which give children’s shows require a special licence from local
authorities which may impose conditions. There are about 300 cinemas
which provide special programmes for children on Saturday mornings. An
important contribution to these programmes is made by the Children’s Film
Foundation, which, with the aid of grants from the British Film Fund
Agency, produces and distributes entertainment films specially designed for
children.
The development of the film and television as an art is promoted by the British
Film Institute, founded in 1933 and financed mainly by a government grant,
and by the Scottish Council for Educational Technology which also receives a
government grant. The Institute offers financial and technical assistance to both
new and experienced film makers who cannot find support elsewhere. The
Institute administers the National Film Theatre in London and the National
Film Archive and maintains a film library from which films may be hired; it also
has a library of scripts and books on the film and television, a British National
Film Catalogue recording all non-fiction and short films available in Britain, and
an information service. It makes grants to the Federation of Film Societies, the
British Universities Film Council and the Society for Education in Film and
Television.
The Institute’s Educational Advisory Service offers guidance to teachers in
formal education at all levels on film and television courses, and its Editorial

Department produces a range of publications including a critical journal Sight
and Sound and the Monthly Film Bulletin.
The National Film Archive contains nearly 37,000 films, including newsreels
and other miscellaneous items, and 4,500 television programmes, besides art
designs and posters; it also has over 1 million photographic stills, selected to
illustrate the history and the art of the film and as social and historical records.
The National Film Theatre has two cinemas showing films of outstanding
historical, artistic or technical interest. It is unique as a cinema offering regular
programmes unrestricted by commercial considerations or by the age or national¬
ity of the films shown. Each year it organises the London Film Festival. The
British Film Institute has promoted the development of some 50 regional film
theatres on the lines of the National Film Theatre and may make grants towards
their costs. In Scotland the Scottish Film Council, as a committee of the Scottish
Council for Educational Technology, is responsible for regional film theatres
and administers the Scottish Central Film Library. Grants in Northern Ireland
are made by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland.
An independent National Film School which is financed primarily by grants
from the Office of Arts and Libraries and the British Film Fund Agency,
offers three-year courses for writers, directors, producers and cameramen.
Training in film production is also given at the London International Film
School, the Royal College of Art, and at some polytechnics and other institutions
of further education.
A number of modern British painters and sculptors have a high international
reputation, and have received many international prizes and commissions for
major works in foreign cities. The growth of interest in the visual arts at home
has been stimulated by improved methods of display in museums and galleries,
and by the activities of many institutions, societies, private galleries and the
growing number of local arts centres.
State support for painting and sculpture mainly takes the form of maintenance
and purchase grants for the national museums and galleries, purchase grants for
municipal museums and galleries, and grants towards the cost of art education.
The Government also encourages high standards of industrial design and crafts¬
manship through grants to the Design Council.
In addition to direct State assistance, the Arts Council runs the Hayward
Gallery in London, where major loan exhibitions are shown, and the Serpentine
Gallery, which mainly presents the work of young artists. The Council main¬
tains its own collection of contemporary British art, and organises or offers
grants or guarantees towards a variety of touring and other exhibitions. It
also supports art societies and independent galleries, and provides commissions
and awards for artists. A number of photography galleries receive Arts Council
support, including the Side Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne, the largest gallery
in Britain devoted entirely to photography. The Scottish and Welsh Arts
Councils maintain art galleries in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Cardiff respectively,
and the Northern Ireland Arts Council owns a gallery in Belfast.
London is a major centre for the international art market and regular sales of
works of art take place in the main auction houses. Certain items are covered by
export control: these are works of art and collectors’ items over 50 years old and
worth more than ^8,000; photographic material over 60 years old and worth
more than £200; documentary material over 50 years old; and British archaeo¬
logical material over 50 years old. A licence is required before such items can

be exported, but this is granted automatically in the case of objects imported into
Britain within the last 50 years. In other cases the application for a licence is
considered by the Department of Trade, and if the Department’s expert advisers
recommend the withholding of a licence, the matter is referred to the Reviewing
Committee on the Export of Works of Art. If the Committee regards a work to be
of national importance it can advise the Government to withhold the export
licence for a specified time to give a public museum or art gallery an opportunity
to offer to buy the object at a fair price.
About 1,000 museums and art galleries are open to the public including the major
national collections and a wide variety of municipally and independently owned
institutions.
An increasing number of people visit major national art galleries and museums
(about 3 million in 1978 compared with 16-2 million in 1971).
Taken together, the national museums and art galleries in London are among
the most comprehensive collections of objects of artistic, archaeological, scientific,
historical and general interest to be found within any one city. They are the
British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Gallery, the Tate
Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Imperial War Museum, the National
Army Museum, the Royal Air Force Museum, the National Maritime Museum,
the Museum of London, the Wallace Collection, the British Museum (Natural
History), the Geological Museum and the Science Museum.
There are three national museums and art galleries in Edinburgh: the National
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, the Royal Scottish Museum (including the
Scottish United Services Museum), and the National Galleries of Scotland
(comprising the National Gallery of Scotland, the Scottish National Portrait
Gallery, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art). The National
Museum of Wales, in Cardiff, has a branch at St. Fagan’s Castle where the Welsh
Folk Museum is housed and has recently opened an Industrial and Maritime
Museum in Cardiff’s dockland. It also has a branch museum (the North Wales
Quarrying Museum) at Llanberis (Gwynedd). In Northern Ireland there are
two national museums: the Ulster Museum in Belfast and the Ulster Folk and
Transport Museum, County Down.
Some of these national museums have also opened branches outside London,
examples being the National Railway Museum at York which is administered by
the Science Museum, and portrait collections at Montacute House (Somerset)
and Beningborough Hall (Yorkshire), administered by the National Portrait
Gallery in collaboration with the National Trust.
Most of the national collections are administered by trustee bodies, but the
Victoria and Albert and Science Museums are the responsibility of the Office
of Arts and Libraries; the Royal Scottish Museum is the responsibility of the
Scottish Education Department.
Other important collections in London include the Armouries (housed in the
Tower of London), the Public Record Office and the Sir John Soane’s Museum.
In Buckingham Palace the Queen’s Gallery has exhibitions of pictures from the
extensive royal collections.
Most cities and towns have museums devoted to art, archaeology and natural
history, usually administered by the local authorities but sometimes by local
learned societies or by individuals or trustees. Both Oxford and Cambridge
are rich in museums, many of them associated with the universities (for
example, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, founded in 1683, the oldest

in the country, and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge). There are impor¬
tant museums and art galleries in Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol,
Cardiff, Dundee, Glasgow, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester, Norwich,
Reading, Sheffield, Southampton and York. Many private art collections housed
in historic family mansions, including those owned by the National Trust, are
open to the public. An increasing number of open air museums depict the
regional life of an area or preserve early industrial remains (for example, the
Weald and Downland Museum in Sussex, the North of England Open Air
Museum in Durham, and the Ironbridge Gorge Museum in Salop which won
the first European Museum of the Year Award in 1978).
All national collections are financed chiefly from government funds. Besides
meeting administrative and maintenance costs, the Government provides
annual purchase grants (£io-i million in 1979-80). It may also provide special
purchase grants. Pre-eminent works of art may be accepted by the Government
in place of capital transfer tax. The Government intends to set up an independent
National Heritage Fund to provide assistance to bodies wishing to acquire land,
buildings, works of art and other objects associated with the national heritage.
Local museums and art galleries, which are maintained from rates or endow¬
ments, receive help in building up their collections through the annual govern¬
ment grants administered by the Victoria and Albert, Science and Royal Scottish
Museums. Financial and practical assistance is also given to museums and
galleries by trusts and voluntary bodies, including the Calouste Gulbenkian
Foundation, the National Art-Collections Fund, the Contemporary Art Society
and the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts.
The Government is advised on policy matters by the Standing Commission
on Museums and Galleries, which also promotes co-operation between national
and provincial institutions. Eight area museum councils, grant-aided by the
Government, provide technical services and advice on conservation, display,
documentation and publicity.
The Museums Association, to which museums and art galleries and their
staffs throughout the country belong and which also has many overseas members,
is an independent organisation. It serves as a central body for the collection of
information and discussion of matters relating to museum administration, and as
a training and examining body for professional qualifications.
Temporary exhibitions provided by the Arts Councils, the national museums and
galleries, the Art Exhibitions Bureau and the area museum councils are a regular
feature of many museums. In London the Hayward Gallery, the Tate Gallery,
the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Royal Academy
are the main centres for loan exhibitions; these are also held at the Whitechapel
Art Gallery, the Camden Arts Centre and the Institute of Contemporary Arts.
Commercial exhibitions are held in the galleries of the London dealers. The
Serpentine Gallery in London’s Kensington Gardens houses Arts Council
exhibitions of contemporary artists, and another small gallery in London is run
by the Crafts Council.
There are a number of national art exhibiting societies, some of which,
notably the Royal Academy at Burlington House, have their own galleries in
London. The Royal Scottish Academy holds annual exhibitions in Edinburgh.
An increasing number of amateur art societies throughout Britain hold local
exhibitions and encourage local interest in the fine arts. There are also children’s
exhibitions, including the National Exhibition of Children’s Art.

Art and design education is provided in maintained colleges of art, further
education colleges and polytechnics, which are administered by local education
authorities. Other institutions offering art and design courses include univer¬
sities, the Royal Academy Schools and some private art schools. At postgraduate
level there is the Royal College of Art which awards its own degrees. Art is
also taught at an advanced level at the four Scottish Central (Art) Institutions
administered by the Scottish Education Department.
The leading academic institutions for the study of the history of art are the
Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the University of London, and the Depart¬
ment of Classical Art and Archaeology in University College, London.
Art has a place in all school curricula, and the Society for Education through
Art encourages, among other activities, the purchase by schools of original works
of art by organising an annual Pictures for Schools exhibition. Pictures may
also be borrowed from many public libraries.
Government grants for the crafts, amounting to some £1 million in 1979-80,
are administered in England and Wales by the Crafts Council (formerly the
Crafts Advisory Committee). Set up in 1971 to advise the minister responsible
for the arts on the needs of artist-craftsmen, the Council holds regular exhibitions
of work at its gallery in London and also publishes the bi-monthly magazine
Crafts which features crafts activities in Britain and abroad. It also gives financial
assistance to enable craftsmen to be trained and to establish or expand their
businesses. Its activities include crafts associated with conservation and restora¬
tion. It runs a comprehensive information service and houses a slide-index. The
Council manages the craft shop at the Victoria and Albert Museum which sells
a selection of works by British artist-craftsmen. Scotland receives a separate
government grant which is similarly administered by the Joint Crafts Committee.
The British Craft Centre in London aims to increase public recognition, enjoy¬
ment, and support of the work of artist-craftsmen, and holds ten exhibitions
a year (most of the contents of which are for sale).
Official responsibility towards the nation’s architecture is concerned mainly
with encouraging the best in new building and conserving the best that has
been inherited from the past (for conservation, see p 172).
Several government departments, notably the Department of the Environ¬
ment, provide advice on building and architecture. In collaboration with the
Royal Institute of British Architects, the Secretary of State for the Environment
makes annual awards for good housing design in both the public and private
sectors. Royal Fine Art Commissions for England and Wales and for Scotland
advise the departments, planning authorities and other public bodies on questions
of public amenity or artistic importance.
The Royal Institute of British Architects is the leading professional institution
with a membership of 21,000 in Britain and 6,000 overseas. It exercises control
over standards in architectural education, and maintains one of the largest
architectural libraries in the world. The Royal Incorporation of Architects in
Scotland is allied to it.
Other bodies with an interest in architecture include the Civic Trust (see
p 182) which promotes high standards in civic building and planning, and the
National Trusts (see p 182) which acquires land and buildings in order to protect
them from harmful development for the benefit of the public. The number of
people visiting National Trust properties rose from just over a million in i960
to more than 6-3 million in 1978.

Libraries
The study of literature is included in the curricula of all schools, colleges and
universities. There are free public libraries throughout the country, private
libraries and many private literary societies. Book reviews are featured in the
press and on television and radio and there are numerous periodicals concerned
with literature. Recognition of outstanding literary merit is provided by a
number of awards, including the Booker, W. H. Smith & Son, and Whitbread
prizes. Awards to encourage young writers are made, for instance, by the
Somerset Maugham Trust Fund and the E. C. Gregory Trust Fund.
Government help is given through the Arts Councils which support literature
in a number of ways, including grants awarded to writers, translators, publishers,
small presses and magazines. Legislation passed in 1979 provides for a scheme
to give authors the right to receive payment from government funds for the use
of their books borrowed from public libraries. The title Poet Laureate is conferred
on a poet who receives a stipend as an officer of the Royal Household.
Societies for the promotion of literature include the English Association and the
Royal Society of Literature. The British Academy for the Promotion of Historical,
Philosophical and Philological Studies (known as the British Academy) is the
leading society of humanistic studies and receives a government grant.
Other specialist societies include the Early English Text Society, the Biblio¬
graphical Society, the Harleian Society, the Saltire Society, and several societies
devoted to particular authors, the largest of which is the Dickens Fellowship. A
number of societies, for example, the Poetry Society and the Apollo Society,
sponsor poetry readings and recitals. There are also a number of clubs and
societies, such as the New Fiction Society and the Poetry Book Society, which
distribute selected new books to their members.
In 1978 British publishers issued nearly 39,000 separate titles: more than 29,000
new ones, and over 9,000 reprints and new editions. An increasing proportion of
books—including specialised non-fiction—is sold in paperback form. Book clubs
make available hardback books at a lower price.
Leading organisations representing the interests of those concerned with book
production and distribution are the Publishers’ Association and the Booksellers’
Association. The British Council also publicises British books and periodicals
through its libraries in some 60 countries, its programme of book exhibitions
(248 exhibitions were mounted in 1978-79) and its bibliographical publications
including the monthly British Book News. The Book Development Council
promotes British books overseas. (For sales and exports of books in 1978 see
P 244)- ^ he National Book League has a membership including authors,
publishers, booksellers, librarians and readers. It encourages an interest in books
and arranges exhibitions in Britain and overseas.
The British Library, created in 1973 from a merger of the British Museum
Library with other libraries and institutions, is organised in three divisions.
The Reference Division includes the Department of Printed Books holding
about 10 million titles, the Department of Manuscripts, the Department of
Oriental Manuscripts and Printed Books, and the Science Reference Library.
The Lending Division at Boston Spa, West Yorkshire, has nearly 3 million
volumes including some 140,000 current periodicals available on loan to other
libraries in Britain and overseas. It also has access to many millions of books in
other libraries and is the national centre for inter-library lending within Britain
and between Britain and foreign countries. The Bibliographic Services Division
processes the acquisitions of the British Library for inclusion in its catalogues
404 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
and provides other bibliographic services; it publishes the British National
Bibliography which lists in a classified order (with indexes) all new books and
new editions, excluding reprints, published in Britain. The British Library
automatically receives a copy of each new book, pamphlet or newspaper pub¬
lished in Britain. The National Libraries of Scotland and of Wales, the Bod¬
leian Library of Oxford University and the Cambridge University Library
are also entitled to claim copies. Plans for a new headquarters of the British
Library in London are under review.
Some of the national museums also have large libraries, and many government
departments have well-established libraries of considerable size and importance.
The Public Record Office contains the records of the superior courts of law and
of most government departments, as well as such famous historical documents
as Domesday Book. In Scotland the Scottish Record Office serves the same
purpose. The National Register of Archives (maintained by the Historical
Manuscripts Commission) contains particulars of local and private records.
Besides the few great private collections, such as those of the Signet Library,
Edinburgh, and the London Library, there are the rich resources of the learned
societies and institutions (for scientific societies and institutions, see p 384).
Examples are the libraries of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the
Royal Commonwealth Society, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, the British Theatre Association, the Royal Academy of
Music, the National Library for the Blind and the National Book League.
The ancient university libraries of Oxford and Cambridge are unmatched by
any of the more recent foundations, although the combined library resources of
the colleges and institutions of the University of London total some 5-5 million
volumes, the John Rylands University Library in Manchester contains some
2 million volumes, and the university libraries of Edinburgh and Glasgow
have over 1 million volumes each, while Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and
St Andrews each has over 750,000 volumes. Many universities have built up
large and important research collections in special subjects; for example, the
Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham, and the British Library of Political
and Economic Science at the London School of Economics. Other universities
and the polytechnics are also building collections.
The importance of good libraries is recognised at all levels of the education
system. School libraries, most of which are maintained by local education
authorities, often receive important support services from the public library
service, including loans of books.
Britain is served by a network of public libraries, administered by local public
library authorities. These libraries have a total stock of some 132-7 million books
(not including the libraries in publicly maintained schools).
Qualified and specialist staff are available for consultation in all but the
smallest service points. About one-third of the total population are members of
public libraries. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is responsible for
the supervision of the public library service in England and is advised by the
Library Advisory Council for England. The Secretary of State for Wales has
responsibility for supervision of the public library service in Wales and is
advised by the Library Advisory Council for Wales. Public library authori¬
ties in England and Wales have a duty to provide (with some limitations) a
free lending and reference library service of books and periodicals. In Scotland
local authorities must provide library facilities, and similar duties are imposed
on education and library boards in Northern Ireland. There are some 5>000

public library service points in Britain; some areas are served by mobile libraries
of which about 700 are in service, and domiciliary services exist for people who
are unable to visit a library.
Many libraries have collections of records and musical scores for loan to
the public. Notable examples are the City of Westminster Central Music Library
and the Henry Watson Music Library at Manchester Central Library. A number
of libraries also lend from collections of works of art, either originals or repro¬
ductions. Nearly all libraries provide children’s departments, while reference
sections and art, music, commercial and technical departments meet the growing
and more specific demands in these fields. Most libraries hold a significant
collection of books and documents on the history of their localities.
The public library is often a centre for local cultural activities; these may
include film shows, lectures, adult education classes, book-week exhibitions,
drama groups, record recitals and children’s story hours.
A voluntary system of library co-operation exists in England and Wales under
which eight regional library bureaux (consisting mainly of public libraries in
each area) aim to be largely self-sufficient in the interlending of current British
books, achieved in some regions by a system of co-operative subject specialisation.
A number of local schemes for the exchange of specialist titles and information
involve industrial, commercial and sometimes university libraries, and are
normally centred on a major public or technical college library.
The National Libraries of Scotland and of Wales carry out functions similar
to those of the regional bureaux and the Lending Division of the British Library.
In Northern Ireland access to the stocks of all co-operating libraries is available
on application to the libraries under the control of the five education and library
boards and to the libraries of the Queen’s University and the New University of
Ulster.
The principal professional organisation is the Library Association. It maintains
a Register of Chartered Librarians, publishes books, pamphlets and official
journals, and holds regular conferences. There are also associations of libraries,
for example, the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux and
the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries.
22 The Press
Ownership
More daily newspapers, national and regional are sold per person in Britain
than in most other countries. Despite a slow but continuous decline in national
newspaper sales, on an average day nearly three out of four adults over the age
of 15 read a national morning newspaper and about one in two read an evening
newspaper. National papers have a total circulation of about 15 million on week¬
days and 18 million on Sundays though the total readership is considerably
greater.
The press caters for a variety of political views, interests and levels of
education. It is subject neither to State control nor to censorship.
Although pronounced views may be expressed in some newspapers and
their political leanings may be obvious, they are almost always financially
independent of any political party and are not obliged to follow any specific
party line. In order to preserve their character and traditions, a few newspapers
and periodicals are governed by arrangements which vest ownership of the
undertaking in trustees, or operate it in accordance with a deed of trust, or
provide that the transfer of shares be controlled by trustees. Others have
management arrangements to ensure editors’ authority and independence.
Unlike most of its European counterparts the British press receives no
subsidies and relatively few tax and postal concessions. Newspaper and magazine
sales and advertising receipts are zero-rated for value-added tax purposes.
Registered newspapers receive a concession on postal rates, and there are
concessions on ‘per-word’ rates for international press telegrams and photo¬
telegrams. In common with all postal customers, newspaper and magazine
publishers can obtain reduced charges for regular bulk postings.
About 130 daily (Monday to Saturday) and Sunday newspapers and over
1,000 weekly newspapers are published. These figures include certain specialised
papers with circulations limited not by region but by interest; for instance,
business newspapers, sporting newspapers, newspapers in foreign languages for
people of other countries resident in Britain and religious newspapers. News¬
print forms roughly a third of average national newspaper costs. Three-quarters
of Britain’s requirements are imported.
The national newspaper industry is faced with a number of problems.
Financial difficulties (alleviated to some extent by improvements in advertising
revenue) are further complicated by problems of labour relations, often associated
with the introduction of new production techniques to increase efficiency.
The Royal Commission on the Press, whose final report was published in
1977, considered and made recommendations on a wide range of matters includ¬
ing editorial standards, concentration of ownership, industrial relations, the
economics of the Press, training of journalists, and the Press Council (see
Bibliography).
Newspaper ownership, as it affects the national, London-evening and regional
daily newspapers, is concentrated mainly in the hands of a comparatively small
number of large press publishing groups (see, for example, the details of the
THE PRESS
The ‘National’
Press
English
Regional
Newspapers
407
groups controlling the national press which are given in Table 37), but there are,
in addition, some 200 independent regional and local newspaper publishers.
Although most enterprises are organised as limited liability companies,
individual and partner proprietorship survives. The large national newspaper
and periodical publishers are major corporations with diversified interests over
the whole field of publishing and communications; some have shares in indepen¬
dent television and radio contracting companies; and others are involved in
industrial and commercial activities which have no connection with publishing
or the mass media.
The law provides safeguards against the risks inherent in undue concentration
of the means of communication. For instance, if it appears that newspaper
shareholdings in television programme companies have led or are leading to
results which are contrary to the public interest, the Independent Broadcasting
Authority may, with the consent of the Home Secretary, notify the companies
that their programmes may cease to be transmitted. There is a similar stipulation
for independent local radio; if a local newspaper has a monopoly in the area, it
is not allowed to have a controlling interest in the local radio station. In addition,
it is unlawful to transfer a newspaper or newspaper assets to a proprietor whose
newspapers have an average daily circulation amounting, with that of the
newspaper to be taken over, to 500,000 or more copies unless the Minister of
State for Consumer Affairs gives written consent. Except in certain limited cases,
which include transfers of very small newspapers, consent may be given only
after the minister has referred the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission and received its report.
Ten morning daily papers and seven Sunday papers (see Table 37) circulate
throughout the country, and are known as national newspapers. All but one are
produced in London (where Fleet Street is the traditional centre for the press),
but five of the dailies and four of the Sundays also print northern editions in
Manchester (accounting for about a quarter of the total production of the
national press). One daily is printed in Manchester only, although there are
plans to print an edition in London too in the near future. An edition of the
Financial Times is also printed in Frankfurt. Prices of the national newspapers
vary from 8p to 2op for the dailies and 15P to 22p for the Sundays.
The leading Scottish papers, The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald, have a
considerable circulation outside Scotland. Each of London’s two evening papers
has a distinctive style and draws its readership from a wide area, but both have
ownership affiliations with a national daily (see Table 37).
National newspapers are often thought of as either ‘quality’ or ‘popular’ papers
on the basis of differences in format (broadsheet or tabloid, though this is not a
rigid distinction), style and content. Four dailies and three Sundays are usually
described as quality newspapers. The three Sunday qualities produce colour
supplements which are distributed as part of the paper.
'The slow decline in newspaper circulations as a whole (from 37 million in
tqyo to 33 million in 1978), conceals the different experiences of individual
papers and the fact that the circulation of some newspapers has remained
generally steady, while that of others has increased.
The regional newspapers of England (outside London, 74 morning or evening
dailies and Sundays and some 700 newspapers appearing once or twice a week)
provide mainly regional and local news. The daily newspapers also give coverage
to national affairs, and a number co-operate to provide their own foreign news
service.

Generally speaking, regional evening newspapers are non-political, while the
morning newspapers adopt a more positive political stance and tend to be
independent or conservative in outlook.
The total circulation of the regional morning and evening papers is estimated
at over 6 million. Of the morning papers the Yorkshire Post (Leeds) and the
Northern Echo (Darlington) have circulations of over 100,000 and two provincial
Sunday papers—the Sunday Sun (Newcastle upon Tyne) and the Sunday
Mercury (Birmingham)—have circulations of over 160,000 and 200,000 respec¬
tively. Individual circulation figures of regional evening papers start at about
15,000; most are in the 30,000-100,000 range, although the Manchester Evening
News and the Birmingham Evening Mail have circulations of over 330,000 and
the Liverpool Echo of 250,000. Weekly papers are mainly of local appeal; they
are also a valuable medium for local advertising. Most have circulations in the
5,000-40,000 range.
There are also many free distribution advertising newspapers (mostly weekly),
some published by orthodox newspaper publishers.
London Suburban
Papers
The London local weeklies (112) include papers for every district in Greater
London. They circulate in as many as six to eight local editions of individual
papers, affiliated in some cases to larger groups.
A number of evening newspapers, using the latest production technology,
are published in the outer metropolitan area on the fringe of the circulation
areas of the two London evening newspapers.
Wales has one daily morning newspaper, the Western Mail, published in
Cardiff; its circulation of just over 90,000 is mainly in south Wales. In north !
Wales the Liverpool Daily Post gives wide coverage to events in the area. Evening
papers published in Wales are the South Wales Echo, Cardiff; the South Wales
Argus, Newport; the South Wales Evening Post, Swansea; and the Evening \
Leader, Wrexham. Their circulation range is between 22,000 and 123,000.
North Wales is also served by the Liverpool Echo, the Shropshire Star covers
parts of mid and north Wales, and there is coverage to a smaller extent by
the Manchester Evening News.
Weeklies The weekly press (over 60) includes English language papers, some of which
carry articles in Welsh, bilingual papers, and Welsh language papers.
Scotland Scotland has six morning, six evening and three Sunday newspapers. The
morning papers, with circulations of between 89,000 and 720,000 are The
Scotsman published in Edinburgh; the Glasgow Herald', the Daily Record
(sister paper to the Daily Mirror)', the Dundee Courier and Advertiser’, the
Aberdeen Press and Journal', and the Scottish Daily Express (published only in
Manchester although production in Inverness is also planned). The evening
papers have circulations in the range of 15,000 to 212,000 and are the Evening
News of Edinburgh, Glasgow’s Evening Times, Dundee’s Evening Telegraph and
Post, Aberdeen’s Evening Express, the Paisley Daily Express and the Greenock
Telegraph. The Sunday papers are the Sunday Mail, the Sunday Post and the
Scottish Sunday Express (published in Manchester).
Weeklies Weekly and local newspapers number about 140, of which the Hamilton
Advertiser and the Falkirk Herald have the largest circulations.

BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
The size of the labour element in the costs of national and provincial newspapers
continues to encourage publishers to look for ways of increasing productivity,
often by use of the new composing technology which dispenses with traditional
‘hot metal’ typesetting, with type set in molten lead, and employs photographic
methods to produce an image. It can combine photo-composition with com¬
puter storage and handling of data, and substitutes electronic for manual
methods. It presents possibilities for reorganisation which can have effects
throughout a newspaper office and may raise difficult problems of manning
levels; the introduction of the ‘on-line’ system, for example, under which text
can be fed at electronic speeds to the computer store (and recalled for checking
on visual display units) and can be passed between the store and the photo¬
setters, can affect all the traditional departments of a newspaper up to the print¬
ing stage. The provincial press has generally led the way in adopting the new
techniques.
The 4,900 periodical publications (including local freesheets) are classified as
‘general’, ‘specialised’, ‘trade’, ‘technical’ and ‘professional’. There are also about
640 ‘house magazines’ produced by industrial undertakings, business houses or
public services for the benefit of their employees and/or clients. The ‘alternative’
press probably includes a further 500 titles, most of which are devoted to radical
politics, community matters, religion, the occult, science or ecology.
General and specialised periodicals include magazines of general interest;
women’s magazines; publications for children; religious periodicals for all
denominations; fiction magazines; magazines dealing with sport, gardening,
hobbies and humour; journals specialising in various subjects such as politics,
finance and economics, science, agriculture, medicine and the arts; and the
publications of learned societies, trade unions, regiments, universities and other
organisations.
The weekly periodicals with the highest sales are: Radio Times and TV Times
which have circulations approaching 4 million and Woman's Weekly, Woman's
Own, Woman, Weekly News (which sells mainly in Scotland) and My Weekly
with circulations in the 800,000 to i-6 million range. The leading journals of
opinion are The Economist, a politically independent publication covering
topics from a wider angle than its title implies; the New Statesman, which is
a review of politics, literature and the arts with an independent socialist political
tendency; the Spectator, which covers much the same subjects from an indepen¬
dent conservative standpoint; Tribune, which represents the views of the left-
wing of the Labour Party; New Society, covering the sociological aspects of
current affairs; and New Scientist, which reports on science and technology in
terms which the non-specialist can understand. Punch, traditionally the leading
humorous periodical, and Private Eye, a satirical fortnightly, also devote attention
to public affairs. More recent new publications include Financial Weekly, a
periodical for businessmen and investors and Now!, a weekly general news
magazine.
Literary and political journals and those specialising in international and
Commonwealth affairs, published monthly or quarterly, appeal generally
speaking to the more serious type of reader.
The publication of trade, technical, business, scientific and professional
journals (covering hundreds of subjects, many of them in considerable depth)
has become one of the more important aspects of the British publishing industry.
In addition to circulating in Britain, these journals have a considerable circulation
overseas and are an important medium for selling British goods. Their pub¬
lication ranges in frequency from weekly to quarterly.
THE PRESS
4II
Periodicals published in England circulate throughout Britain. In Wales
there are also several monthly and quarterly journals published in both Welsh
and English; in Scotland there are three monthly illustrated periodicals, a weekly
paper devoted to farming interests, a number of literary journals (of which the
most famous is probably Blackwood's), and numerous popular magazines; and
Northern Ireland has weekly, monthly and quarterly publications covering
farming, the linen industry, building, motoring, politics and social work.
News Agencies I here are three principal British news agencies registered in Britain: Reuters
Ltd; The Press Association Ltd; and The Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd.
Reuters Ltd, a world news organisation, is owned by four associations: the
Newspaper Publishers Association; The Press Association; the Australian
Associated Press; and the New Zealand Press Association. They are parties
to a trust deed which safeguards the independence and integrity of the news
service. Founded in Aachen in 1850 and transferred to London in 1851, Reuters
employs 558 journalists and correspondents in 69 countries and territories, and
has links with about 120 national or private news agencies, which give it access to
coverage by many hundreds of local reporters. Some 700,000 words of general
news, sports, and economic reports are received in London every day and are
retransmitted to 159 countries and territories over a global network of leased
teleprinter lines, satellite links and cable and radio circuits. These news services
are specially tailored to the needs of recipients in Britain and overseas, and are
distributed to information media, either direct or through national news agencies.
Reuters Economic Services, one of the world’s largest financial and business
news services, supplies information to banks, brokers and other commercial
undertakings throughout the world by means of computer-based video display
units, teleprinters and bulletins.
d he Press Association Ltd, the British national news agency founded in
1868, is co-operatively owned by the principal newspapers of the United
Kingdom outside London, and of the Irish Republic. It provides newspapers,
the broadcasting organisations, Reuters (of which it is a major joint owner) and
other international agencies with a complete service of home news, including
general and parliamentary news, legal reports, and all branches of financial,
commercial and sports news; and includes in its services to regional papers the
world news of Reuters and the Associated Press. News is teleprinted 24 hours
a day from head office in London over a network of lines leased from the Post
Office certain items being available in teletypesetting form. Through its photo¬
graphic department The Press Association serves London and regional news¬
papers with a daily picture service from home and overseas; these are wired to
the regional press. Its Special Reporting Service supplies reports of local or
special interest to daily and weekly papers and periodicals. Press Association
heatures provides exclusive rights to syndicated articles and visual features.
1 he Exchange Telegraph Company Ltd (Extel), an independent news
agency founded in 1872, is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Exchange Tele¬
graphy Company (Holdings) Ltd, a public company. It supplies financial and
sporting news to newspapers and broadcasting organisations, and to private
subscribers. In conjunction with The Press Association Ltd, racing services are
also supplied by telephone and video terminals to subscribers in London and the
provinces from offices throughout Britain.
I he British press and broadcasting organisations are also served by Associated
Press Ltd, and by United Press International, which are British subsidiaries of
United States news agencies.

services have offices in London, and there are minor agencies in other cities,
mostly specialising in various aspects of newspaper and periodical requirements.
Syndication of features is not as common in Britain as in some countries, but a
few agencies specialise in this type of work.
The National Council for the Training of Journalists (NCTJ), which represents
the principal press organisations, sets and conducts examinations, and organises
short training courses for journalists.
The two methods of entry into newspaper journalism are selection for a
one-year NCTJ pre-entry course or direct recruitment by a regional or local
newspaper. Both categories of entrant take part in an apprenticeship scheme
consisting of ‘on-the-job’ training, and block release courses for those who have
not attended a pre-entry course. A number of centres provide courses for
reporters. Other training facilities include one-year postgraduate courses in
journalism at the University College of South Wales in Cardiff, and at the City
University (London), and courses provided by the Newspaper Society Training
Service for regional newspapers in such subjects as circulation, advertising,
industrial relations and management. The NCTJ co-operates closely with the
Printing and Publishing Industry Training Board (PPITB) which is responsible
for training in printing, publishing and professional photography.
Under the Commonwealth Press Union Harry Brittain Memorial Fellowship
Scheme, several young Commonwealth journalists each year spend three months
working and studying in Britain. The Thomson Foundation holds training
courses for journalists from all parts of the world and provides consultants and
tutors for courses in journalism held overseas.
Training for work with periodicals was traditionally done ‘on the job’ but
formal courses of instruction are becoming more widely available. The London
College of Printing offers a one-year pre-entry course in periodical journalism
as well as block- and day-release courses for those who have already started
work as trainees. In addition, several of the larger publishing houses provide
systematic training which includes periods in the classroom to supplement work
experience. For publishers who do not offer training independently, a training
group has been established under the auspices of the PPITB.
The most important organisations to which employers in the industry belong
are the Newspaper Publishers Association, whose members publish national
newspapers in London and Manchester; the Newspaper Society, which repre¬
sents the regional, local and London suburban press; the Scottish Daily News¬
paper Society, which represents the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers
in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper Proprietors Association, which represents
the owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; Associated Northern Ireland
Newspapers, whose members are the proprietors of weekly newspapers in
Northern Ireland; and the Periodical Publishers Association, whose membership
embraces the independent publishers of trade and technical publications and
general magazines.
On the journalists’ side there are the Institute of Journalists (IOJ), with
about 2,300 members, and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), with
29,600 members. All practising journalists (including those engaged in radio,
television, public relations, freelance journalism and book publishing editorial
work) are eligible for membership of either. Four main printing unions are
concerned with the press.
The Guild of British Newspaper Editors with about 450 members aims to
maintain the professional status and independence of editors, defend the

freedom of the press, and improve the education and training of journalists.
The British Association of Industrial Editors is the professional organisation to
which most editors of house journals belong.
I he Press Council has a membership consisting of equal numbers of press and
non-press members, with an independent chairman. Its aims are: to preserve
the established freedom of the press; to maintain the character of the press in
accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards; to keep
under review any developments likely to restrict the supply of information of
public interest and importance; to deal with complaints about the conduct of
the press or the conduct of persons and organisations towards the press (the
Council’s complaints committee comprises equal numbers of press and non¬
press members); to report on developments in the press which may tend
towards greater concentration or monopoly; to make representation on appro¬
priate occasions to the Government, to organs of the United Nations and to
press organisations abroad; to publish its adjudications and periodic reports
recording its work; and to review from time to time developments in the press
and the factors affecting them. The Council publishes annual reports, which
include statistics of the newspaper and periodical press and a series of articles
examining the structure of the leading press groups.
The press has generally the same freedom as the individual to comment on
matters of public interest.
Apart from enactments relating directly to such matters as the registration
of newspapers for postal purposes, there are no specific press laws but certain
statutes include sections which apply to the press. These relate to such matters
as the extent of newspaper ownership in television and radio companies; the
transfer of newspaper assets; restrictions on the reporting of preliminary
hearings of indictable offences (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland); the
right of press representatives to be admitted to meetings of local authorities;
restrictions on the publication of {a) certain details of divorce, domestic and rape
proceedings in courts of law, {b) legal proceedings involving children, (c)
advertisement and investment circulars, which are governed by Acts dealing
with the publication of false or misleading descriptions of goods and services
and with fraud, and {d) advertisements of remedies for certain diseases, which
are covered by public health legislation; agreements between the Post Office and
newspaper proprietors on telegraphic communications, which must comply with
telegraphs legislation; restrictions on certain types of prize competition; and
copyrights, which come under copyright laws.
Of particular relevance to the press are the laws on libel and contempt of
court. A newspaper may not publish comments on the conduct of judicial
proceedings which are likely to prejudice their reputation for fairness before or
during the actual proceedings nor may it publish before or during a trial any¬
thing which might tend to influence the result. The obtaining and publication
of information from state and official sources of a confidential or security nature
is affected by the official secrets legislation. Newspapers are also liable to
proceedings for seditious libel and incitement to disaffection.
Legal proceedings against the press are comparatively infrequent; the majority
are libel actions brought by private individuals. In such cases, the editor,
proprietor, publishers, printer and distributor of the newspaper, as well as the
author of the article, may all be held responsible.
23 Television and Radio
All British broadcasting is based on the tradition that it is a public service
accountable to the people through Parliament. Television and radio are the
responsibility of two broadcasting authorities, the British Broadcasting Corpora¬
tion (BBC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), which work to
broad requirements and objectives placed on them by Parliament, but are quite
independent in the day-to-day conduct of business. This independence carries
with it certain obligations as to programmes and programme content. Each |
authority must ensure that its programmes display, as far as possible, a proper
balance and wide range of subject matter, impartiality in matters of controversy
and accuracy in news coverage, and also that programmes do not offend against
good taste. Codes of guidance on violence in television programmes, particularly
during hours when large numbers of children are likely to be viewing, are
operated by both authorities. A code of advertising standards and practice is also
operated by the IBA. There is no advertising on BBC television and radio.
The Home Secretary regulates broadcasting generally under the Wireless
Telegraphy Acts 1949 and 1967 which prohibit the sending or receiving of wire¬
less communications except under licence. The Minister is answerable to i
Parliament on broad policy questions, and may issue directions on a number of
technical and other matters.
Television viewing is by far the most popular leisure pastime in Britain, and
some 98 per cent of the population have access to television. It is estimated
that about 10 per cent of households have two or more receivers. Average view¬
ing time per person is over 17^ hours a week. Practically every home also has
radio, and car radios and portable transistors have made radio, national and local,
one of the country’s major day-time diversions.
Households with television must buy a licence each year—at November 1979
they cost ^12 for black and white and £34 for colour. Of about 18-5 million
licences current in April 1979 approximately 12 million were for colour and 6-5
million for black and white television. The revenue from licences meets most
of the cost of the BBC’s domestic services. Independent television and indepen¬
dent local radio are self-supporting, with revenue drawn from the sale of
advertising time.
The British The constitution and finances of the BBC are governed by the Royal Charter
Broadcasting and by a Licence and Agreement. The Corporation consists of 12 governors
Corporation (including a chairman, a vice-chairman and separate national governors for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each appointed by the Queen on the
advice of the Government. The governors are responsible for the whole broad¬
casting operation, including television and radio programmes and installations
and equipment. Committees advise them on such matters as the social effects of
television, religious broadcasting, music, agriculture, schools broadcasting,
further education, programmes for immigrants, science and engineering and
charitable appeals. There is also a programme complaints commission. The
governors appoint the Director General who is chairman of the BBC’s board of

management, which also includes the managing directors for television, radio
and external broadcasting, and the directors of personnel, finance, public affairs
and engineering.
The National Broadcasting Councils for Scotland and Wales control the
policy and content of television and radio programmes intended primarily for
reception in their respective countries. Local radio councils, representative of
the local community, are appointed by the BBC to advise on the development
and operation of local radio stations.
The domestic services of the BBC are financed principally by the income
from the sale of television licences less certain deductions for collection and
other expenses. This is supplemented by profits from trading activities, including
television programme exports, the sale of records and publications connected
with BBC programmes, the hire and sale of educational films, film library sales
and exhibitions based on programmes and other BBC activities. Nearly three-
quarters of the BBC’s expenditure on domestic services relates to television.
The BBC meets the cost of local radio stations but some local education
authorities help to make educational programmes.
The BBC’s External Services are financed by a grant determined each year
by the Government.
The IBA’s constitution and finances are governed by the Independent Broad¬
casting Authority legislation and a Licence. It consists of a chairman, a deputy
chairman and ten other members (three of whom have responsibility for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) appointed by the Home Secretary. The
IBA does not itself produce radio or television programmes; these are provided
by commercial programme companies. Its main functions are to appoint the
companies, to supervise programme arrangements, to control advertising and to
build, own and operate transmitting stations.
The IBA is advised by a General Advisory Council, by Scottish, Northern
Ireland and Welsh committees, and by committees on educational broadcasting,
religious broadcasting, charitable appeals and advertising. A specialist panel
advises on medical and allied advertisements. A Complaints Review Board
reviews reports of complaints received and investigated by the IBA’s staff. Local
advisory committees provide advice on local radio services.
The chief executive officer of the IBA, the Director General, is supported
by a headquarters and regional office staff covering all technical and admini¬
strative services.
The IBA’s finance comes from annual rental payments made by the television
and radio programme companies. The television programme companies also pay
to the IBA, for transfer to the Government, a levy related to their profits.
Fifteen television programme companies hold contracts to provide television
programmes in the 14 independent television regions (two companies share
the contract for London, one providing programmes during the week and the
other at the weekend). The companies operate on a commercial basis, deriving
their revenue from the sale of advertising time. The financial resources, advertis¬
ing revenue and programme production of the companies vary considerably,
depending largely on the size of population in the areas in which they operate.
Although newspapers can acquire an interest in programme companies, there
are safeguards to prevent their shareholdings leading to results contrary to the
public interest.
In consultation with the IBA, each company plans the content of the pro¬
grammes to be broadcast in its area. These consist partly of material produced
416 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
by the company itself, partly of that produced by the other programme com¬
panies, and partly of that purchased from elsewhere. The five largest companies
(Thames, ATV, Granada, Yorkshire and London Weekend) provide more
programmes for broadcast elsewhere on the national network than do the smaller
ones. A common news service is provided by Independent Television News
Ltd., a non-profit-making company in which all the programme companies are
shareholders. The negotiations concerning the supply, exchange and purchase
of programmes and their co-ordinated transmission through the independent
television network take place largely on the Network Planning Committee which
consists of representatives of all the programme companies and of the IBA.
Local radio is broadcast by independent stations on the same principles. The
companies providing programmes are under contract to the IBA, operate under
its control and are financed by advertising revenue. News coverage is supplied
as a common service by Independent Radio News. In certain circumstances
local newspapers have a right to a share in the control of local radio companies.
Television Three television channels are in operation: BBC-i and ITV broadcasting on
both 405 lines very high frequency (vhf) and 625 lines ultra high frequency
(uhf), and BBC-2 which broadcasts on 625 lines uhf only. Some 99 per cent of
the population live within range of vhf, and just over 98 per cent within range of
uhf transmissions, which are still being extended. The vhf transmissions are
expected to cease within a few years. A high proportion of programmes on the
three uhf services is transmitted in colour, though they can also be received in
black and white. Most television sets are designed to receive four channels, and
the Government has proposed that responsibility for the fourth channel (expected
to come into operation in 1982) should be given to the IBA.
Apart from a break during the war years the BBC has been providing regular
television broadcasts since 1936. All BBC-2 programmes and the majority of
those on BBC-i are broadcast on the national network. Of the BBC’s 1977-78
television output over 43 per cent was produced in London and 36 per cent
elsewhere in Britain; over 14 per cent comprised feature films and series, and
13 per cent Open University programmes. Current affairs, features, documentary,
news, schools, further education, Open University and religious programmes
comprised some 46 per cent of the total.
Through co-ordinated planning of programmes on its two services the BBC
is able to cater simultaneously for people of differing interests. While both
services cover the whole range of television output, BBC-i presents a higher
proportion of programmes of general interest, such as light entertainment, sport,
current affairs, children’s programmes and outside broadcasts, while BBC-2
places greater emphasis on minority interests, providing a larger element of
documentaries, travel programmes, serious drama, music, programmes on pas¬
times and international films.
The first regular independent television broadcasts began in London in 1955.
ITV services are provided on a regional basis by the programme companies.
On average each of the 14 ITV areas transmitted over 100 hours of television
programmes a week in 1978-79, nearly two-fifths of which comprised informative
programmes—including news, documentaries, current affairs, education and
religion. Three-quarters of the programmes seen on ITV are produced by the
programme companies themselves. There is a maximum of six minutes of

British Television British television programmes have won many international awards, and the
Overseas country is one of the world’s foremost exporters of television productions. It

is estimated that Britain exported about £36 million-worth of television pro¬
grammes in 1977, and there are few countries in the world where British
programmes have not been shown.
Over 14 per cent of households with television rely on cable systems for the
reception of programmes. The systems are usually used to improve reception
quality, to avoid ‘screening’ by buildings or the local topography, or because
external aerials are not allowed in some residential buildings. There are cable
networks in almost every urban area; some cover a whole town, some homes
scattered throughout an area, and others particular housing estates. Of some
275 million subscribers to cable networks in 1979 about i-6 million subscribed
to commercial systems, 980,000 to systems operated by local authorities and
other non-commercial bodies, and some 95,000 to housing associations’
systems. Commercial relay operators are represented by The Cable Television
Association of Great Britain. All operators of cable systems are licensed by the
Home Secretary and the Post Office.
Since 1972 six experiments have been authorised by the Home Secretary for
local stations to distribute locally-originated television programmes by cable
systems to subscribers. Three stations are still in operation. At Greenwich in
London funds are provided by the local commercial cable television company,
while at Swindon they are provided by a number of non-commercial bodies and
from the promotion of a weekly lottery. At Milton Keynes the experimental
station provides a locally-originated programme service over the Post Office
cable system. All the experiments enable people to see programmes about local
activities and to have access to programme-making facilities under the guidance
of the station staff. There are proposals for a Pay-TV experiment among cable
operators.
BBC Radio’s four national channels each have a distinct character. Radio 1
provides a programme of pop music, while Radio 2 provides light music as
well as being the principal channel for the coverage of sport. Radio 3 provides
mainly classical music (much of which is in stereo) and in the evening offers,
in addition, adult education programmes and works of artistic and intellectual
interest. Radio 4 is the main speech programme, providing the principal news
and information service as well as a wide range of drama, music, talks, entertain¬
ment and schools broadcasts. Many programmes are transmitted in stereo.
Local radio is provided by 20 BBC stations in England and by 19 independent
stations distributed throughout Britain. Another 18 local radio stations (nine
BBC and nine IBA) are being established and approval has been given for a
further 15 (one BBC and 14 IBA). Local broadcasts provide a comprehensive
service of local news and information, music and other entertainment,
education, consumer advice and coverage of local events, and offer residents a
chance to air their views, often by using the phone-in technique.
Four experiments in locally-initiated sound programmes over cable distribu
tion systems have been authorised. As in the case of the local community cable
television experiments an advertising service may be included if a station elects
to do so.
The BBC broadcasts to most countries overseas (in 39 languages, including
English) for a total of some 710 hours a week. The main objectives are to give
unbiased news, to reflect British opinion and to project British life and culture.
News bulletins, current affairs programmes, political commentaries and topical
magazine programmes form the main part of the output. A full sports service,
418 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
all kinds of music, drama, and a wide range of general entertainment are also
included.
The languages in which the External Services broadcast and the length of
time each language is on the air are prescribed by the Government. Apart from
this the BBC has full responsibility and it is completely independent in deter¬
mining the content of news and other programmes.
The foreign language services are divided into areas: the African, Arabic,
Eastern, Far Eastern, Latin American, French (to Europe and Africa), Central
European, South European, German and East European Services. Broadcasts
range from 63 hours a week in Arabic to 35 minutes in Maltese.
The BBC’s English by Radio and Television Service is the most extensive
language teaching undertaking in the world. English lessons are broadcast
weekly by radio with explanations in 30 other languages, and recorded lessons
are supplied to between 250 and 300 stations in over 100 countries. English by
Television programmes are shown in more than 100 countries.
The BBC World Service broadcasts for 24 hours a day in English and is
supplemented at peak listening times by additional series of programmes designed
to be of special interest to Africa.
BBC news bulletins and other programmes are rebroadcast by the domestic
radio services of many countries. Rebroadcasting involves direct relays from
BBC transmissions and the use of recorded programmes supplied through the
BBC tape and disc transcription service. There are some 3,000 rebroadcasts
weekly of World Service programmes in about 50 countries. The Transcription
Service offers programmes to over 100 countries.
Another part of the External Services is the Monitoring Service which listens
to and reports on foreign broadcasts, supplying a daily flow of significant news
and comment from overseas to the BBC, the press, and the Government.
The BBC External Services are complemented by the radio services of the
Central Office of Information (COI) which produce a range of material for
transmission by radio stations overseas. In addition, COI television services
provide material such as documentary and magazine programmes for distribution
to overseas television stations.
Transmitters The BBC’s domestic television and radio services operate more than 1,100
and Studios transmitters, and its external services from some 42 transmitters in Britain and
24 overseas. Most of the circuits used to link studios and transmitters are rented
from the Post Office. For its domestic radio, the BBC uses 100 studios in London
and the regions, and for its external services 30 in London. In addition, there
are semi-automatic studios which can be operated by programme officials
without engineering staff. Each of the BBC’s 20 local radio stations has at least
two studios. BBC television productions come from main studios at the Tele¬
vision Centre in west London and other studios in various parts of London,
and six fully-equipped regional studio centres and eight television studios in
other towns. Outside broadcasting is covered by a number of mobile units.
The IBA uses a total of 470 television and sound radio transmitting stations
throughout Britain, programme links being rented from the Post Office. Indepen¬
dent television programmes are produced at 17 studio centres throughout the
country. These studios reflect the IBA’s policy of encouraging regional tele¬
vision, and the programmes are designed for either local broadcasting or for
national transmission. All companies have facilities for colour transmission.
The BBC does not give publicity to any individual firm or organised interest by
mentioning its name or branded products, except when it is necessary in order

to provide effective and informative programmes. Under the terms of its Licence
and Agreement it must not broadcast sponsored programmes.
Advertisements are broadcast on independent television but there is no
sponsoring of programmes by advertisers. Advertisements must be clearly
distinguishable and separate from programmes, and the amount of time given
to advertising must not be so great as to detract from the value of the pro¬
grammes as a medium of information, education and entertainment. In any one
hour of broadcasting the amount of advertising time on independent television
is normally limited to seven minutes. Averaged over the day’s programmes it
must not exceed six minutes per hour. The independent local radio stations are
normally limited to up to nine minutes of advertising each hour. The IBA has
drawn up a code governing standards and practice in advertising on television
and radio and giving guidance about the types and methods of advertisement
that may not be used. Some types of advertising are prohibited, notably those
with a political or religious object or on behalf of cigarettes or betting. Advertise¬
ments may not be inserted in certain types of programme, such as broadcasts
to schools.
Government publicity material designed to support non-political campaigns
may be broadcast on independent radio and television. It is prepared through
the COI and is broadcast and paid for on a normal commercial basis. Short
public service items, mainly about health, safety and welfare themes, are also
produced by COI for free transmission by the BBC and independent television
and radio. The Government has no general access to radio or television.
Parliamentary reporting includes a daily factual and impartial account of pro¬
ceedings in Parliament, transmitted on BBC’s Radio 4 when Parliament is in
session. Since 1978 proceedings of Parliament, including its committees, have
been broadcast on radio. Some occasions are broadcast live, and recorded
sound extracts may be included in both radio and television news and current
affairs programmes.
There is also frequent coverage of political subjects in news bulletins and
current affairs programmes on both radio and television. Ministerial and party
political broadcasts are transmitted periodically under the rules agreed between
the major political parties, the BBC and the IBA.
Research into technical problems is carried out by the scientific and engineering
staffs of the BBC, the IBA, the Home Office, the Post Office, the Government,
and the radio industry. Advances by the BBC have included the electronic
conversion of monochrome and colour television pictures between the European
and the American systems, and the development of a sound-and-vision system
known as ‘sound-in-syncs’ which enables the television sound and picture to
be carried over a single 625-line vision circuit, and thus eliminates the operational
complexity and expense of a separate circuit for the sound. IBA engineers were
the first in the world to introduce a fully digital field rate standards converter
(DICE) to improve the interchange of programmes between areas using the
525-lines system (for example, North America) and those using the 625-lines
system (for example, Europe). Current IBA research projects include the
development of the first digital video tape recorder with economical use of tape,
and also a programme of research into the future use of space satellites for
broadcasting.
Both the BBC and IBA have produced ‘teletext’ systems, known respectively
as CEE FAX and ORACLE, which allow the broadcasting of written and simple
graphical information to television receivers fitted with special adaptors. Both
420

Relations
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
systems enable viewers to select a display of ‘pages’ of written information on
the television screen. ‘Prestel’, a service providing a wide range of information
via the telephone which can be displayed on the screen of a television receiver
is being developed by the Post Office (see p 314).
The BBC and the IBA (together with the Independent Television Companies
Association) are active members of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU),
which was established to advance international broadcasting projects. The
EBU manages Eurovision, is responsible for the technical and administrative
arrangements for co-ordinating the exchange of programmes over that network
and for intercontinental satellite links, and maintains a technical monitoring
station where frequency measurements and other observations on broadcasting
stations are carried out.
The BBC belongs to the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association whose
members extend to each other such facilities as the use of studios, recording
channels, and programme contributions. The BBC also provides technical aid,
particularly in training the staff of other broadcasting organisations throughout
the world; members of the BBC’s staff are seconded for service overseas.
The BBC is a partner in Visnews, which supplies a service of world news-
film to some 200 television organisations in over 90 countries and is the most
widely used newsfilm agency in the world. The BBC is also a member of the
International Television Federation (Intertel), which produces high-quality
information programmes which are exchanged overseas. United Press Inter¬
national, Paramount Pictures and Independent Television News jointly provide
an international newsfilm service to more than 100 overseas television organisa¬
tions via the Eurovision network and by satellite.
The Government spends a considerable amount each year on training in
broadcasting for overseas students and largely finances the British Council (see
p 69), which includes in its activities training in educational television and
radio for members of broadcasting organisations overseas. Training in television
work is also provided for overseas trainees at the Thomson Television College
in Glasgow, run by the Thomson Foundation, a charitable trust.
The BBC and the IBA participate in the work of the International Tele¬
communication Union (ITU), the United Nations specialised agency responsible
for the regulation and control of all international telecommunication services
(including radio and television), for the allocation and registration of all radio
frequencies and, through its international consultative committees, for the
promotion and co-ordination of the international study of technical problems in
broadcasting. The BBC is also represented on the United Kingdom Committee
of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
24 Sport and Recreation
ORGANISATION
AND
PROMOTION
Sports Councils
There is widespread interest in sport in Britain. Large crowds attend occasions
such as the association football ‘Cup Final’ at Wembley Stadium, the inter¬
national rugby matches at Twickenham, Murrayfield and Cardiff Arms Park,
the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships, the classic horse races, Grand Prix
motor racing and the cricket Test Matches; millions also watch them on tele¬
vision. Enthusiasm for active participation in sport and recreation has grown
considerably in recent decades and there is a large variety of opportunities and
facilities available. Physical recreation tends to be informal and non-competitive
and may include, for example, climbing, rambling, riding, boating, angling and
other water-based sports, keep fit, movement and dance activities.
An important feature of British sport and recreation is its amateur element (the
people who devote time and energy to the organising, teaching and training of
individual activities). Although the Government is not directly concerned with
the organisation of sport and recreation, a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of
State in the Department of the Environment has responsibility for the co¬
ordination of policies and the promotion of research in the field of active recrea¬
tion. The Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland exercise
similar responsibilities in their areas.
The Government provides financial and other assistance through a number of
official bodies. Some of these, such as the Sports Councils (see below) and the
Countryside Commissions, have specific responsibilities relating to sport and
recreation, and assist other public and private bodies in the provision of facilities.
Others, for example, the Forestry Commission, the British Waterways Board,
the Nature Conservancy Council and the regional water authorities, provide
recreational amenities in addition to their main functions.
The main responsibility for the general development of sport in Great Britain
rests with three independent bodies—the Sports Council (for England and
for general matters affecting Britain as a whole), the Sports Council for Wales
and the Scottish Sports Council. Members of the councils are appointed by
the Government. The Councils have the task, subject only to general ministerial
directives, of allocating funds made available by the Government (in 1979-80
amounting to some £20-2 million). They award grants for sports development,
coaching and administration to the governing bodies of sport and to other
national organisations; and administer national sports centres. Grants and loans
are made to voluntary organisations and local authorities to assist in the pro¬
vision of sports facilities. The Councils also assist British representatives at
international sports meetings and encourage links with international and overseas
organisations. The Sports Council consults with the Central Council of Physical
Recreation, comprising members of the national governing and representative
bodies of sport and physical recreation in England. The Sports Council is linked
with nine regional councils for sport and recreation in England on which are
represented local authorities and sport and countryside interests in each region.

The Scottish Sports Council consults with the Scottish Standing Conference of
Sport which comprises representatives of the national governing bodies of sport
in Scotland; and the Sports Council for Wales maintains, through a standing
committee, a close liaison with the governing bodies of sport in Wales.
In Northern Ireland the Department of Education provides financial assistance
to local authorities and voluntary sports bodies for the provision of facilities.
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland advises government on sport and
assists financially in coaching, administration and the provision of equipment.
It maintains strong links with the governing bodies of sport individually and
through the Northern Ireland Council of Physical Recreation.
A bibliographic service about sport is provided by the National Documentation
Centre, set up by the Sports Council and based at the University of Birmingham.
The Council also has an information centre providing data on a wide range of
sports topics; similar services are provided by the Sports Council for Wales and
the Scottish Sports Council.
There are a number of voluntary organisations whose activities are concerned
with recreation. Some, such as the Ramblers’ Association, safeguard the interests
of particular leisure pursuits; others, such as the National Trusts (see p 182),
cater for recreation in addition to their main responsibilities. Most, however,
exist to provide recreational opportunities for young people. A description of
the youth service and an outline of the work of individual organisations is
contained in Chapter 7.
The British Olympic Association, founded in 1905, organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games. The Association’s committee consists
of representatives of the 26 sports in the programme of the Olympic Games
(summer and winter). It determines the size of the British team (which competes
under the name of ‘Great Britain’); raises funds; makes all the arrangements for
the team’s travel and comfort at the games; organises the provision and transport
of clothing and equipment; and provides a headquarters staff for the management
of the team.
The National Playing Fields Association aims to encourage the provision of
playing fields, playgrounds and recreational facilities. It maintains a technical
advisory service, and specialises in the play and recreational needs of children
and young people including young handicapped people. It is a national charity
established by Royal Charter, and depends mainly on voluntary contributions.
It is helped by its eight regional play advisers and by affiliated associations in
Scotland and Northern Ireland and in English and Welsh counties.
The British Sports Association for the Disabled, founded in 1961, encourages
sports for the physically handicapped. The Association, which receives an
annual Sports Council grant, provides advice on physical recreation for the
disabled, arranges sports meetings and encourages the provision of facilities
(including sports clubs) for disabled people. Regional and branch committees
of the Association organise local, regional and national games. Annual national
and international paraplegic games are arranged by the British Paraplegic Sports
Society. At Stoke Mandeville Hospital, the first sports stadium in the world
designed for the disabled was opened in 1969. In Scotland and Wales there are
associations which co-ordinate sporting activities and facilities for disabled
people.

Private
Sponsorship
PROVISION OF
FACILITIES
Sports Centres
Increasing numbers of sports receive financial sponsorship from commercial
organisations. Sponsorship may take the form of financing specific events, or it
may be granted to individual sports organisations, for example, to provide
better accommodation for spectators or to encourage more people to participate
in the sport.
A Sports Aid Foundation has responsibility for raising and distributing funds
from industry, commerce and private sponsors in order to assist the training
of talented individual sportsmen and sportswomen. The Foundation makes
grants on the recommendation of the governing bodies of sport. The Sports
Council also runs a sponsorship advisory service which links potential sponsors
with suitable sports.
Local authorities are the main providers of land and large-scale facilities for
community recreation and their total expenditure on sport and outdoor recreation
in England and Wales amounted to some ^458 million in 1977-78. In Scotland,
total expenditure on sports and recreation facilities by local authorities in
I977~7^ was about ^59-8 million. The facilities provided include parks, playing
fields, sports halls, tennis courts, golf courses, lakes, swimming baths and sports
centres catering for a wide range of indoor and outdoor activities.
All publicly maintained schools are required by law to provide for the physical
education (for example, gymnastics, games, athletics, dancing and swimming)
of their pupils. All (except those solely for infants) must have a playing field,
or the use of one, and most secondary schools have a gymnasium. Some have
other amenities such as swimming pools, sports halls and halls designed for
dance and movement. In some areas, physical education facilities in schools are
available to the whole community outside school hours. Sport and recreation
facilities are likewise provided at universities (some of which have departments
of physical education), and there are ‘centres of sporting excellence’ at univer¬
sities and other colleges enabling selected young athletes to develop their talents
and also providing for their educational needs.
Opportunities for outdoor recreation in national parks, nature reserves,
forest parks and country parks are provided by public bodies (see p 173).
Water-based activities on canals, rivers, lakes and reservoirs are increasingly
popular. The British Waterways Board, for example, maintains about 1,760
kilometres (1,100 miles) of cruising waterways for navigation, about 960 kilo¬
metres (600 miles) of other waterways and some 90 reservoirs. An Inland
Waterways Amenity Advisory Council advises the Board on the use of its
waterways for pleasure purposes, and a Water Space Amenity Commission
provides advice on the recreational use of water in England generally.
In addition to the recreational facilities provided by public authorities, many
facilities are made available by local voluntary clubs. Some of these cater for
indoor recreation, but more common are those providing sports grounds,
particularly for games such as cricket, association and rugby football, hockey,
tennis and golf. Clubs linked to industrial business firms often cater for a wide
range of activities, and in many cases make their facilities available to members
of the public. Commercial facilities, provided as profit-making businesses,
include tenpin bowling centres, ice- and roller-skating rinks, squash courts, golf
driving ranges and riding stables.
National sports centres, some of which were initially financed by funds from
voluntary sources, are maintained by the sports councils and provide facilities
and a wide range of courses for instructors and performers in many recreational
activities. As well as making residential courses available for enthusiasts from
424 BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
all over Britain, the centres are used extensively by local clubs and by the com¬
munity generally.
There are seven national centres in England and Wales. Combined facilities
for a range of sports are provided at three centres: the Crystal Palace National
Sports Centre in London and the Bisham Abbey and Lilleshall National Sports
Centres in Buckinghamshire and Salop respectively. The centre at Crystal
Palace has a main stadium seating 17,000 spectators, a sports hall seating 2,000
spectators, a swimming hall with pools meeting Olympic requirements and
seating 2,000, two teaching pools, ten squash courts, an indoor cricket school,
practice rooms for most indoor sports and a hostel for 132 residents. These
facilities are available for international competitions as well as for training
purposes, and are supported by a grant from the Greater London Council in
addition to the Sports Council grant. The other four are specialist centres: the
Plas-y-Brenin National Centre for Mountain Activities in north Wales, the
Cowes National Sailing Centre in the Isle of Wight, the Holme Pierrepont
National Water Sports Centre in Nottinghamshire, and Harrison’s Rocks, a small
rock-climbing centre in Sussex. Work has begun on the construction of a
National Outdoor Pursuits Centre at Plas-y-Deri in Gwynedd which is expected
to be completed in 1982, and plans are in progress for the construction of a
National Ice Skating Centre in Manchester, due to be completed in 1983. In
addition there is a National Sports Centre for Wales in Cardiff which is supported
by local authorities but financed mainly from the Sports Council for Wales
grant.
The Scottish Sports Council operates three national sports training centres:
Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore for outdoor sports, Inverclyde at Largs for
general sports, and a national water sports training centre in Cumbrae Isle on
the Firth of Clyde.
As well as the national sports centres, other centres (such as the Meadowbank
Sports Centre administered by Edinburgh District Council) cater for a wide
range of recreational activities and often attract more than purely local interest.
Over 300 indoor sports centres serve local rather than national needs; more are
planned, some as ‘dual’ projects on school sites. There are also several national
centres catering for specialised interests and generally administered by the
sponsoring organisations. These include the National Equestrian Centre, run
by the British Equestrian Federation, and the Stoke Mandeville Sports Stadium
for the Paralysed and Other Disabled, run by the British Paraplegic Sports
Society (see p 422).
In Northern Ireland nine indoor sports centres are provided by district
councils and several more are being built. The Sports Council for Northern
Ireland has a Mountain Centre at Tollymore, County Down.
POPULAR Some of the major sports in Britain are described below. Sportsmen may be
SPORTS professionals (paid players) or amateurs. Some sports, such as rugby union
football, hockey and rowing, are entirely amateur but in others the distinction
between amateur and professional status is less strictly defined.
Association Probably the most popular spectator sport is association football, dating as an
Football organised game from the nineteenth century, and controlled by separate football
associations in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England
over 400 clubs are affiliated to the English Football Association (FA) and some
37,000 clubs to regional or district associations.
The principal clubs in England and Wales belong to the Football League
(92 clubs) and in Scotland to the Scottish Football League (38 clubs); the clubs
Athletics
The Highland
Games

SPORT AND RECREATION 425
play in four divisions in England and Wales and three in Scotland. During the
season attendances at Football League matches total about 27 million.
The annual competitions for the FA Challenge Cup, the Football League
Cup, the Scottish FA Cup and the Scottish League Cup are organised on a
knock-out basis, and the finals (four of the most important matches of the year)
are played at Wembley Stadium, London, and at Hampden Park, Glasgow.
National teams representing England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland
compete against one another annually and take part in European competitions,
the World Cup competition and other international matches.
The Sports Council is giving grants to some Football League clubs to enable
them to provide greater sports opportunities for young supporters.
In England amateur athletics (including track, road and cross-country running,
relay racing, jumping, vaulting, hurdling, steeplechasing, throwing and race
walking) are governed, for men, by the Amateur Athletic Association and, for
women, by the Women’s Amateur Athletic Association. Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland have their own associations and, as in England, there are
separate women’s associations. The various organisations encourage the develop¬
ment of the sport, establish uniform rules and regulations and promote regional
and national championships. Hundreds of clubs are affiliated to the various
national associations.
International athletics and the selection of British teams are the concern of
the British Amateur Athletic Board which is composed of representatives of the
national associations. British teams compete in the Olympic Games and in
other international matches, and separate teams representing England, Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland compete in the Commonwealth Games. The
Board also administers coaching schemes.
The Highland Games, traditional gatherings of local people in the Highlands
of Scotland, at which sports (including tossing the caber, putting the weight
and throwing the hammer) and dancing and piping competitions take place,
are unique spectacles which attract large numbers of spectators from all over
the world. Among better-known Highland Games are the annual Braemar
Gathering (traditionally attended by the Royal Family), the Argyllshire and
Cowal Gatherings and the meeting at Aboyne.
Boxing as a British sport is one of the oldest, probably originating in Saxon
times. Its modern form, also adopted in many overseas countries, dates from
1865 when the Marquess of Queensberry drew up a set of rules eliminating
much of the brutality that had characterised prize fighting and making skill the
basis of the sport. Boxing is both amateur and professional.
The Amateur Boxing Association controls all amateur boxing in England
including schoolboy, club and association boxing, and boxing in the armed
services. There are separate associations in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The associations organise various amateur boxing competitions, and
teams from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland take part in
international competitions.
Professional boxing is controlled by the British Boxing Board of Control,
founded in 1929. The Board has strict medical regulations which provide for
an examination of boxers before and after each contest, and for an extensive
annual medical examination. In addition the Board appoints inspectors, medical
officers and representatives to ensure that regulations are observed and to guard
against over-matching and exploitation.

Cricket
Field Sports
BRITAIN 1980: AN OFFICIAL HANDBOOK
Amateur and professional boxing championships are decided at various
weights—11 in amateur and 10 in professional boxing.
Cricket is among the most popular of summer sports and is sometimes called
the English national game. It is known to have been played as early as the
1550s. Among the many clubs founded in the eighteenth century is the
Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which was founded in London and which
reframed the laws of the game. Cricket in Britain is now governed by the
Cricket Council which consists of representatives of the MCC, the Test and
County Cricket Board (representing first class cricket) and the National Cricket
Association (representing club and junior cricket).
The game is played in schools, colleges and universities, and in most towns
and villages there are amateur teams which play weekly games from late April
to the end of September. In the Midlands and the north of England there is a
network of League cricket contested by teams of Saturday afternoon players
reinforced by professionals, some of whom come from overseas.
Some of the best supported games are the annual series of five-day sponsored
Test Matches played between England and a touring team from Australia,
New Zealand, India, Pakistan or the West Indies. A team representing England
tours one or more of these countries from November to March. There is also a
sponsored First Class County Championship of three-day games played by 17
county teams who also take part in three one-day sponsored competitions—two
of these are knock-out competitions and the other is a Sunday League.
Cricket is also played by women and girls, the governing body being the
Women’s Cricket Association, founded in 1926. Women’s cricket clubs have
regular week-end fixtures, and junior sides play largely six-a-side competitions.
Test match series are played against Australia, New Zealand and the West
Indies and other international games take place.
The British Field Sports Society looks after the interests of all field sports
(including hunting, game shooting, falconry and hare coursing). The Society
is a member of the British Shooting Sports Council which is the representative
body of recreational shooting.
Fox hunting on horseback with a pack of hounds is the most popular British
hunting sport but there is also stag hunting, and hunting the hare. The fox
hunting season lasts from early November to April. There are over 320 packs
of hounds of all kinds in Britain, and hunts are financed mainly by members’
subscriptions and by the proceeds of events such as steeplechase point-to-points.
The sport is not without its critics, but a large number of people take a keen
interest in it.
Game shooting as an organised country sport probably originated in the
early part of the nineteenth century. Game consists of grouse, black-grouse,
partridge, pheasant and ptarmigan, species which are protected by law during a
close season when they are allowed to breed on numerous estates supervised by
game-keepers who are employed on private property as well as by bodies such
as the Forestry Commission. It is necessary to have a licence to kill game, and
a certificate must be obtained from the local police by anyone who owns, buys
or acquires a shot gun. The Game Conservancy, formed by landowners, farmers
and others interested in game conservation, collects information and studies
factors controlling game population.
Other shooting sports are wildfowling which takes place on marshes and
fenlands, and deer stalking.
The most popular country sport is fishing, and there are about 4 million

anglers in Britain. Many fish for salmon and trout particularly in the rivers
and lochs of Scotland, but in England and Wales the most widely practised
form of fishing is for coarse fish such as pike, perch, carp, roach, dace, tench,
chub and bream. Angling clubs affiliate to the National Federation of Anglers
and many clubs organise angling competitions. National championships are
organised by the Federation which also enters a team in the World Angling
Championship. Freshwater fishing usually has to be paid for; most coarse
fishing is let to angling clubs by private owners, while trout and salmon fishermen
either rent a stretch of river, join a club, or pay for the right to fish by the day,
week or month. Coastal and deep sea fishing are free to all (apart from salmon
and sea trout fishing which is by licence only). In Northern Ireland the Ulster
Provincial Council of the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers and the Ulster Angling
Federation look after the interests of the sport.
Golf originated in Scotland where it has for centuries borne the title of the
Royal and Ancient Game, the headquarters of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club
being situated at St. Andrews on the east coast. The sport is played throughout
Britain and there are golf courses in the vicinity of most towns, some of them
owned by local authorities. The main event of the golfing year is the Open
Golf Championship; other important events include the Walker Cup match for
amateurs and the Ryder Cup match for professionals, both of which are played
between Britain and the United States.
The modern game of lawn tennis was first played in England in 1872 and the
first championships at Wimbledon in 1877. The controlling body, the Lawn
Tennis Association, was founded in 1888. The main event of the season is the
annual Wimbledon fortnight for players from all over the world; this draws
large crowds, the grounds at the All-England Club accommodating over 30,000
spectators. There are also county championships and national competitions for
boys’ and girls’ schools. International events include the Davis Cup and Kings
Cup for men and the Federation Cup for women. Women from Britain and the
United States compete for the Wightman Cup.
Among the most popular spectator sports are motor racing and motor rallying.
The governing body, RAC (Royal Automobile Club) Motor Sports Association,
issues competition licences to motor clubs registered with it covering all events
from hill climbs to full international race meetings. It also organises the British
Grand Prix which counts towards the Formula One World Motor Racing
Championship, and the RAC Rally which counts towards the World Rally
Championship.
Motor cycle racing is governed by the Auto-Cycle Union and the most
important events of the year are the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy races, the
British Grand Prix, and the TT Formula 1 World Championship. Motor cycle
speedway racing is governed by the Speedway Control Board.
Horse racing takes two forms—-flat racing (from late March to early November)
and steeplechasing and hurdle racing (from August to June). The Derby, run
at Epsom, is the outstanding event in the flat racing calendar. Other classic
races are: the Two Thousand Guineas and the One Thousand Guineas, both
run at Newmarket; the Oaks, run at Epsom; and the St. Leger, run at Don¬
caster. The most important steeplechase and hurdle race meeting is the National
Hunt Festival Meeting at Cheltenham. The Grand National, run at Aintree near
Liverpool, is the best known steeplechase.

The Jockey Club administers all horse racing in Britain. Its rules are the
basis of turf procedure and it also licenses racecourses.
Racing takes place on most weekdays throughout the year and about 11,000
horses are in training.
The racing of greyhounds after a mechanical hare (now considered to be
among Britain’s most popular spectator sports) takes place at 108 tracks licensed
by local authorities. Meetings are usually held two or three times a week at each
track, up to a maximum of 130 days a year. Rules for the sport are drawn up by
the National Greyhound Racing Club, but its overall administration and
organisation is the responsibility of the British Greyhound Racing Board.
The authority responsible for equestrian activities (other than racing) is the
British Equestrian Federation which co-ordinates the work of the British
Horse Society and the British Show Jumping Association at international
level.
The British Horse Society promotes the welfare of horses and ponies, the
interests of horse and pony breeding and the art of riding. It provides informa¬
tion, publications, a film library, courses and examinations and, together with
riding schools approved by it, helps to promote horsemastership. It also runs
the British Equestrian Centre at Kenilworth, Warwickshire, where a variety
of activities take place throughout the year. With some 30,000 members the
Society is the parent body of the Pony Club and the Riding Club movement.
These hold their own rallies, meetings and competitions, culminating in their
annual national championships at the British Equestrian Centre.
Horse trials are held during the spring and summer under the auspices of
the Society. The three-day events held each year are at Badminton (Avon) in
April, Windsor (Berkshire) in May, Bramham (Yorkshire) in June, Burghley
House (Lincolnshire) in September, and Wylye (Wiltshire) in October, and
include dressage, cross-country riding and show jumping.
Show jumping is promoted by the British Show Jumping Association which
draws up competition rules and prescribes the general standards and height of
obstacles. The Association keeps a register of horses and ponies taking part in
shows and seeks to improve the standard of jumping and to provide for British
representation in international competitions. It has over 15,000 members and
1,000 shows are affiliated to it. The three major show jumping events each year
are the Royal International Horse Show, the Horse of the Year Show, and the
Birmingham International Show Jumping Championships.
Rugby football is played according to two different sets of rules: Rugby Union
(a 15-a-side game) is played by amateurs while Rugby League (a 13-a-side game)
is played by professionals as well as amateurs.
Rugby Union is played throughout Britain under the auspices of the Rugby
Football Union (in England), the Welsh Rugby Union, the Scottish Rugby
Union and the Irish Rugby Football Union. International matches between
England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France are played each year and there
are tours by international teams.
Rugby League is played mostly in the north of England. The governing body
of the professional game is the Rugby Football League which sends touring
teams to Australia and New Zealand. Annual matches are also played against
France. The Challenge Cup Final, the major match of the season, is played
at Wembley Stadium in London. The amateur game is governed by the British
Amateur Rugby League Association.

SPORT AND RECREATION 429
Sailing has always been popular on Britain’s inland and coastal waters. The
Royal Yachting Association has over 1,400 affiliated clubs, 60,000 personal
members and approximately 500 recognised teaching centres in the country,
including the National Sailing Centre at Cowes in the Isle of Wight where
courses are available in all branches of the sport. One of the world’s principal
regattas takes place each year at Cowes, and major events are held at other British
sailing centres.
Swimming is enjoyed by millions of people in Britain, many of whom learn
to swim at public baths, schools or swimming clubs. Instruction and coaching
is provided by qualified teachers who hold certificates awarded by the Amateur
Swimming Association, to which over 1,700 clubs are affiliated. The Association
also draws up and enforces regulations for amateur swimming, diving, syn¬
chronised swimming and water polo championships and competitions in England.
Separate associations control the sport in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Underwater swimming (sub-aqua) is governed nationally by the British
Sub-Aqua Club which promotes underwater exploration, science and sport.
Formed in 1953, the club has become the largest in the world with some 30,000
members and more than 1,000 branches in Britain and overseas.
The governing bodies of some other sports played in Britain are given below.
Most of these are organised on the basis of clubs and regional organisations
linked to a national body. Functions of the governing bodies are broadly similar
and usually include drawing up the rules of the sport, organising regional and
national competitions and maintaining relations with sporting bodies overseas.
Many of the sports listed below have separate national bodies for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland.

Various forms of betting and commercial gaming are permitted under strict
regulations and the total money staked in Great Britain in 1978 was about
.£4,600 million. It is estimated that some 94 per cent of adults gamble at some
time or another, 39 per cent regularly.
Gaming includes the playing of casino and card games, gaming machines and
licensed bingo which is thought to be played by about 5-5 million people on a
fairly regular basis. Betting takes place mainly on horse and greyhound racing,
and on football matches (usually through football pools). Racing bets may be
made at racecourses and greyhound tracks, or through some 13,000 licensed
off-course betting offices which take nearly 90 per cent of the money staked. A
form of pool betting (totalisator betting) is organised on, and off, course by the
Horserace Totalisator Board (HTB). Bookmakers and the HTB contribute a
‘betting levy’ to the Horserace Betting Levy Board which promotes the improve¬
ment of horseracing and horsebreeding and the advancement of veterinary
science.
In addition legislation allows local authorities and certain bodies to hold
lotteries.
A Royal Commission on Gambling reported in 1978 (see Bibliography). The
Government has accepted a number of the Commission’s main recommendations,
including measures to improve the control of lotteries and proposals to improve
the supervision of gaming.

Index
Bold type in a sequence of figures indicates main references.
As the main purpose of this book is to inform readers overseas about Britain,
organisations and societies are generally indexed under their subject matter
rather than under Association of British, National, Royal, etc. {that is, Accidents,
Royal Society for the Prevention of; Archives, National Register of). In cases
where the first word is not separable, however {for example, Royal Air Force,
Royal Society), entries will be found appropriately.
Items are indexed under England, Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales only
where they are matters peculiar to these countries; otherwise they are indexed
under the relevant subject headings.

ENERGY
Much of Britain’s energy requirement is supplied from
indigenous sources of coal, oil and natural gas. Virtually
all gas needs are met from the North Sea and in 1980
Britain will be self-sufficient in oil (in net terms).
Oil and Gas
Reserves are expected
to last into the next
century.
Coal
At the current rate of
extraction, reserves
are sufficient for about
300 years.
Nuclear Power
Britain pioneered the
commercial use of
nuclear power; a major
expansion is underway.
Hydro-electricity
This makes a small but
valuable contribution to
energy requirements.
Research
on renewable
sources
of energy
Wind
Solar radiation
Waves and tides
Although these and
other sources are not
expected to change
the pattern of energy
supply in the
immediate future,
their contribution may
increase significantly
towards the end of
the century.
