Foreword
UK 2002, formerly known as the Britain Yearbook, is the 53rd edition of an official annual
reference book that was first published in the 1940s. Since 1997 it has been produced by the
Office for National Statistics (ONS). Drawing on a wide range of official and other authoritative
sources, UK 2002 provides a factual and up-to-date overview of the United Kingdom, and also
describes the main aspects of current government policy. It is a widely used work of reference,
both in the United Kingdom itself, and overseas, where it is an important element of the
information service provided by British diplomatic posts.
The 53rd edition has been fully updated and revised. Every effort is made to ensure that the
information given in UK 2002 is accurate at the time of going to press. The text is generally
based on information available up to the end of August 2001. More website addresses have been
included this year: these were also current in August 2001. Information about particular
companies has been taken from company reports and news releases, or from other publicly
available sources. No information about individual companies has been taken from returns
submitted in response to ONS statistical inquiries, which remain entirely confidential.
Acknowledgments
UK 2002 has been researched, written and edited by a combination of in-house authors and
freelances and compiled with the cooperation of around 250 organisations, including other
government departments and agencies. The editors would like to thank all the people from these
organisations who have taken so much time and care to ensure that the book’s high standards of
accuracy have been maintained. Their contributions and comments have been extremely valuable.

Note On National Accounts Revisions
The ONS has completed a major programme resulting in significant long run revisions to the
national accounts and associated indicators. This programme includes new data sources and
improvements to methodologies. The results were included in the National Accounts dataset
release on 25 September and in the 2001 editions of United Kingdom National Accounts—the Blue
Book and United Kingdom Balance of Payments—the Pink Book. The majority of figures in UK
2002 were compiled before these new data were available.
About the Office for National Statistics
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the government agency responsible for compiling,
analysing and disseminating many of the United Kingdom’s economic, social and demographic
statistics, including the retail prices index, trade figures and labour market data, as well as the
periodic census of the population and health statistics. It is also the agency that administers the
statutory registration of births, marriages and deaths. The Director of ONS is the National
Statistician and the Registrar General for England and Wales.

City Status
Historical Outline
The establishment in 1999 of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for
Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly was the most significant change in the
constitution in the United Kingdom since its formation in 1801.1 In July 2000 the
Greater London Authority assumed its responsibilities, the first of a possible
nine regional assemblies in England to be set up over the next few years.
Physical Features
The United Kingdom (UK) constitutes the
greater part of the British Isles. The largest of
the islands is Great Britain, which comprises
England, Scotland and Wales. The next
largest is Ireland, comprising Northern
Ireland, which is part of the UK, and the Irish
Republic. Western Scotland is fringed by the
large island chains known as the Inner and
Outer Hebrides, and to the north of the
Scottish mainland are the Orkney and
Shetland Islands. All these, along with the Isle
of Wight, Anglesey and the Isles of Scilly,
have administrative ties with the mainland,
but the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea and the
Channel Islands between Great Britain and
France are largely self-governing, and are not
part of the UK. The UK is one of the 15
Member States of the European Union (EU).
With an area of about 243,000 sq km
(93,000 sq miles), excluding inland water,
the UK is just under 1,000 km (about 600
miles) from the south coast to the extreme
north of the Scottish mainland and just
under 500 km (around 300 miles) across at
the widest point.
Channel Islands and Isle of Man
Although the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man are not part of the United Kingdom, they
have a special relationship with it. The Channel
Islands were part of the Duchy of Normandy in
the 10th and 11th centuries and remained
subject to the English Crown after the loss of
mainland Normandy to the French in 1204.
The Isle of Man was under the nominal
sovereignty of Norway until 1266, and
eventually came under the direct administration
of the British Crown in 1765, when it was
bought for £70,000. Its parliament, ‘Tynwald’,
was established more than 1,000 years ago and is
the oldest legislature in continuous existence in
the world. Today the territories have their own
legislative assemblies and systems of law, and
their own taxation systems. The British
Government is responsible for their
international relations and external defence.
1 When the UK was the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Ireland. The Irish Free State (now the Irish Republic) was created
in 1922, leaving Northern Ireland in the Union. The devolution
of political power is discussed in greater detail in chapters 2, 3,
4, 5 and 6.

The Channel Islands and Isle of Man are
neither EU Member States nor part of the UK
Member State. Broadly speaking, EU rules on
the free movement of goods and the Common
Agricultural Policy apply to the Islands, but
not those on the free movement of services or
persons. Islanders benefit from the provision
for free movement of persons only if they have
close ties with the UK.
Climate
The climate in the United Kingdom is
generally mild and temperate. Prevailing
weather systems move in from the Atlantic,
and the weather is mainly influenced by
depressions and their associated fronts moving
eastwards, punctuated by settled, fine,
anticyclonic periods lasting from a few days to
several weeks. There are few extremes of
temperature, which rarely rises above 32°C
(90°F) or falls below -10°C (14°F).
Rainfall is greatest in western and upland
parts of the country, where the annual average
exceeds 1,100 mm (43 inches); the higher
mountain areas receive more than 2,000 mm.
Over much of lowland central England, annual
rainfall ranges from 700 to 850 mm, although
parts of East Anglia and the South East receive
just 550 mm. Rain is fairly well distributed
throughout the year, with late winter/spring
(February to March) the driest period and
autumn/winter (October to January) the
wettest. During May, June and July (the
months of longest daylight) the mean daily
duration of sunshine varies from five hours in
northern Scotland to eight hours in the Isle of
Wight. During the months of shortest daylight
(November, December and January) sunshine
is at a minimum, with an average of an hour a
day in northern Scotland and two hours a day
on the south coast of England.
Climate Change and Flooding
It is said that the British are always talking
about the weather. During 2000 they had good
reason to do so. The year began with the
sunniest winter over England and Wales since
1909, followed by the wettest April since
records began in 1766. Parts of Scotland and
Northern Ireland then had the driest July
since 1927, before October saw rainfall records
broken throughout the UK. The autumn of
2000 turned out to be the wettest for England
and Wales since 1766, and the wet weather
continued into spring 2001, breaking the
record again for the 12 months to March.
However, 2000 was also the fifteenth warmest
year in Central England in a series going back
to 1659, although the winter of 2000-01 has
provisionally been classified as cold.
Unusual weather is not just a recent
phenomenon in the UK. On 21 January 1661
Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary: ‘It is
strange what weather we have had all this

winter; no cold at all, but the ways are dusty,
and the flyes fly up and down, and the rose¬
bushes are full of leaves, such a time of the
year as was never known in this world before
here.’2 Even so, the increased incidence of
extreme events in the UK and worldwide
appears to add substance to the predicted
impact of human activity on climate
variability—although the evidence from
historical records indicates that recent
extremes are not unprecedented.
The floods in Britain in autumn 2000 were
among the worst in living memory, setting a
benchmark for severe flooding along with 1998
(river), 1953 (coastal) and 1947 (snowmelt).
The severe weather caused the flooding of over
10,000 properties, and 11,000 people had to be
evacuated from their homes. By the following
spring some had still not been able to return.
Conditions were so extreme in some parts of
England and Wales that properties were
flooded up to three times between October and
November. Farmland was also widely affected.
However, the successful operation of flood
defences and warning systems, and the
coordinated efforts of the Environment
Agency, emergency services and local
authorities, prevented long-term damage to
a further 300,000 or so properties.
2 The Pepys diary entry continues: This day many of the Fifth
Monarchy men were hanged.’ No hanging has taken place in the
UK since 1965.
With nearly 2 million homes and businesses
at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea in
England and Wales, the Government has
redoubled its efforts to prepare for unusual
levels of flooding in the future, while
announcing extra assistance (for example,
^11.6 million in January 2001) for immediate
repairs to damaged flood defences.
A Climate Change Model for Scotland
In one scenario in a study carried out for
the Scottish Executive by the Tyndall
Centre for Climate Change Research, and
published in February 2001, average
annual rainfall in Scotland could increase
by around 20% if there were an annual
average warming of between 2°C and 3°C.
Furthermore, intense precipitation,
expected every two years, would increase
by up to 15% for every 1°C of warming. In
other words, although Scotland would
have milder winters, it would also suffer
from wetter, stormier days with an
increased threat of flooding.
Population
The population of the UK increased from 38.2
million in 1901 to 59.8 million in 2000 (see
Table 1.1). Official projections, based on
3
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
mid-1999 population estimates, forecast that
the population will reach nearly 61.8 million
by 2011.
City Status
In December 2000, to mark the Millennium,
three towns in Britain were granted city
status: Brighton & Hove and Wolverhampton
in England, and Inverness in Scotland. There
are now 61 cities in the UK: 49 in England,
five in Scotland, four in Wales and three in
Northern Ireland. City status is a mark of
distinction granted by the personal Command
of the Sovereign, on the advice of his or her
Ministers. The last towns to achieve city
status before 2000 were St David’s in Wales
and Armagh in Northern Ireland, both in
1994, and Sunderland in England in 1992.3
Historical Outline
The name ‘Britain’ derives from Greek and
Latin names which probably stem from a
Celtic original. Although in the prehistoric
timescale the Celts were relatively late arrivals
in the British Isles, only with them does

Bristol, Cambridge, Canterbury, Carlisle, Chester, Chichester,
Coventry, Derby, Durham, Ely, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford,
Kingston upon Hull, Lancaster, Leeds, Leicester, Lichfield,
Lincoln, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne,
Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Peterborough, Plymouth,
Portsmouth, Ripon, Salford, Salisbury, Sheffield, Southampton, St
Albans, Stoke-on-Trent, Truro, Wakefield, Wells, Westminster,
Winchester, Worcester and York; Scotland—Aberdeen,
Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow; Wales—Bangor, Cardiff and
Swansea; Northern Ireland—Belfast and Londonderry/Derry.
Britain emerge into recorded history. The
term ‘Celtic’ is often used rather generally to
distinguish the early inhabitants of the British
Isles from the later Anglo-Saxon invaders.
After two expeditions by Julius Caesar in 55
and 54 BC, contact between Britain and the
Roman world grew, culminating in the Roman
invasion of AD 43. Roman rule was gradually
extended from south-east England to include
Wales and, for a time, the lowlands of
Scotland. The final Roman withdrawal around
409 followed a period of increasing disorder
during which the island began to be raided by
Angles, Saxons and Jutes from northern
Europe. It is from the Angles that the name
‘England’ derives. The raids turned into
settlement and a number of small English
kingdoms were established. The Britons
maintained an independent existence in the
areas now known as Wales and Cornwall,
while in Scotland the Piets were neighbours
and rivals of the Scots, who had migrated
there from Ireland. Among the Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms more powerful ones emerged,
claiming overlordship of the whole of England,
first in the north (Northumbria), then in the
midlands (Mercia) and finally in the south
(Wessex). However, further raids and
settlement by the Vikings from Scandinavia
occurred, although in the 10th century the
Wessex dynasty defeated the invading Danes
and established a wide-ranging authority in
England. In 1066 England was invaded by the
Normans (see p. 7), who then settled along
with others from France.
Dates of some of the main events in Britain s
history are given below. The early histories of
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland are included in chapters 2 to 5.

More than four-fifths of the total population of the United Kingdom live in
England, with the greatest concentrations in London and the South East, South
and West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside, the West Midlands,
and adjoining towns in the North East on the rivers Tyne, Wear and Tees.
Between 1851 and the end of the 20th century, the population of England almost
trebled and the rise is expected to continue from 50.2 million people in 2001 to
53.7 million in 2021.
England is a country of mostly low hills and plains with a 3,200-km (2,000-
mile) coastline cut into by bays, coves and estuaries. Upland regions in the
north include the Pennine Chain, splitting northern England into north¬
western and north-eastern sectors; the Cumbrian mountains, home of the Lake
District, with the highest point in England, Scafell Pike at 978 metres (3,209 ft);
and the rugged landscape of the Yorkshire moors. The South West’s highest
point is on Dartmoor (rising to 621 metres, 2,038 ft), but there are other upland
areas, such as Exmoor (520 metres, 1,706 ft), Bodmin Moor (420 metres, 1,378
ft), and the Mendip Hills (325 metres, 1,066 ft).
Early History
When the Romans finally withdrew from
Britain in 409, the lowland regions were
invaded and settled by Angles, Saxons and
Jutes (tribes from what is now north-western
Germany). England takes its name from the
first of these. To begin with, the Anglo-Saxon
kingdoms were fairly small and numerous, but
as time went on they formed themselves into
fewer but larger areas of control. Eventually
the southern kingdom of Wessex came to
dominate, mainly because it played a leading
role in resisting the Danish invasions of the
9th century. Athelstan (who reigned from 924
to 939) used the title of‘King of all Britain’,
and from 954 there was a single Kingdom of
England.1
In 1066 the last successful invasion of
England took place. Duke William of
Normandy defeated the English at the Battle
of Hastings and became King William I,
known as ‘William the Conqueror’. Many
Normans and others from France came to
settle; French became the language of the
1 The present Royal Family is descended from the old royal
house of Wessex and, in recognition of this, the Queen’s
youngest son, Prince Edward, was created Earl of Wessex on his
marriage in June 1999.

ruling classes for the next three centuries; and
the legal and social structures were influenced
by those in force across the Channel.
When Henry II, originally from Anjou, was
king (1154-89), his ‘Angevin empire’
stretched from the river Tweed on the
Scottish border, through much of France to
the Pyrenees. However, almost all the English
Crown’s possessions in France, after
alternating periods of expansion and
contraction, were finally lost during the late
Middle Ages.
England and Wales were brought together
administratively and legally in 1536-42 during
the reign of Henry VIII, and the union of
England and Scotland took place in 1707,
when Queen Anne was Sovereign.
Government
In contrast to Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, England has no separate elected
national body exclusively responsible for its
central administration. Instead a number of
government departments look after England’s
day-to-day administrative affairs (see
Appendix 1) and a network of nine
Government Offices for the Regions (GOs—
see p. 11) is responsible for carrying out a
number of government programmes
regionally.
There are 529 English parliamentary
constituencies represented in the House of
Commons. After the General Election of June
2001, England had 323 Labour Members of
Parliament (MPs), 165 Conservative, 40
Liberal Democrat and one independent.
Conservative support tends to be strongest in
suburban and rural areas, and the party has a
large number of parliamentary seats in the
southern half of England. The Labour Party’s
key support comes mainly from the big cities
and areas associated with traditional industry,
but it also holds many seats which had in the
past been considered safe Conservative
constituencies. The Liberal Democrats, who
are traditionally strong in the South West,
now have nearly 40% (15) of their English
seats in Greater London and the South East.
In many areas a two-tier system of county
and district councils is responsible for
government at the local level. However, there
are also a number of single-tier, or unitary,
authorities—especially in the larger cities.
Since July 2000 the strategic government of
London has been the responsibility of the
Greater London Authority (see below).
England elects 71 representatives (MEPs)
to the European Parliament (see p. 73). In the
June 1999 election, the Conservatives won 33
seats, Labour 24, the Liberal Democrats 9, the
UK Independence Party 3 and the Green
Party 2.
The English legal system is made up of
‘common law’ (based on ancient custom and
rulings made earlier in similar cases), ‘statute
law’ (parliamentary and European Community
legislation) and ‘equity’ (general principles of
justice correcting or adding to common or
statute law).
The official religion of England—the
Established Church—is the Church of
England, which broke away from the Roman
Catholic Church during the Reformation in
the early 16th century. The Sovereign is head
of the Church of England and appoints its two
archbishops and 42 diocesan bishops (see
p. 241).
London
In May 2000 Londoners voted for a directly
elected Mayor for the capital, and a separately
elected Assembly of 25 members2 (see p. 10).
Subsequent elections will take place every four
years. The Mayor and Assembly form the
Greater London Authority (GLA), the first
elected London-wide body since the Greater
London Council was abolished in 1986. When
the GLA took up its powers in July 2000, four
other administrative bodies for which it is
responsible also came into being. These are
the Metropolitan Police Authority; the
London Fire and Emergency Planning
Authority; Transport for London; and the
London Development Agency, one of nine
regional agencies covering the whole of
England (see p. 10).
2 The new arrangements do not affect the continuance of the
separate post of Lord Mayor of London (first established in
1191), whose role is restricted to the City of London—the
financial ‘Square Mile’ at the heart of the capital.

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
New Greater London Authority
Building
A new home for the Greater London
Authority is being built on a site between
London Bridge and Tower Bridge on the
south bank of the river Thames. Work is
expected to be finished in spring 2002 and
the building occupied in the summer.
This new landmark for the capital takes
the form of a geometrically modified glass
sphere standing 50 metres high with 21,700
square metres of floor space on ten storeys.
In conventional terms the building has no
front or back. It uses its radical shape to
minimise its surface area—approximately
25% less than an equivalent rectangular
building—and high-performance glass
facing to ensure the best energy efficiency.
A further ‘green’ feature is the use of cold
ground water to air condition the building.
Mayor
Elections for London’s Mayor are held under
the supplementary vote system, in which voters
mark both their first and second choices. If, in
the first round, no candidate receives more than
50% of the total votes cast, the second choices
for just the two leading candidates are added to
their initial scores to decide the overall
winner. By this method, Ken Livingstone was
elected Mayor for London in 2000 with a total
of 776,427 votes (58%). From an electorate of
5,093,464 the turnout was 1,714,162 (33.7%).

Assembly
For Assembly elections, London is divided
into 14 constituencies whose members are
elected using the ‘first-past-the-post’ system.
A further 11 London-wide seats are allocated
on a ‘top-up’ basis, whereby votes are counted
across London and shared among the political
parties in proportion to the votes each party
receives. Table 2.1 shows the election results
for the first London Assembly.
The Regions of England
Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) were
launched in eight English regions in April
1999. The ninth, in London, followed in July
2000 after the GLA elections. RDAs aim to
provide coordinated regional economic
development and regeneration, reduce the
economic imbalances which exist within and
between regions and enable the English
regions to improve their competitiveness.
RDAs are accountable through ministers to
Parliament. Each RDA has a board of 13 or 14
members, including the chairman, and on each
board members have business experience. The
boards also include local councillors, and
members with expertise in education, rural
affairs, the voluntary sector and trade union
issues. RDAs have been allocated some £1.5
billion of programme spending for 2001-02;
this is scheduled to rise to £1.7 billion by
2003-04. They are also expected to attract
private finance for their work.

the 1841 census form on
which the author
Charlotte Bronte’s name
appears. Her occupation is
listed as ‘Governess’ (she
was a Governess at
Upperwood House at the
time-an experience which
she later drew on for her
portrayal of Jane Eyre in
the novel of the same
name). Charlotte’s age is
recorded as 20.
A hundred years later, just
before the issue of the
1951 census form, the
question of a lady’s age-
at that time deemed to be
too personal-brought a
flood of queries in
newspaper problem pages
from women fearful that
their true age would
become public knowledge.
As census information is
kept closed to the public
for 100 years, they need
not have worried.

Before being appointed as the first Registrar General
for England and Wales in 1836, Thomas Henry Lister
was known as a romantic novelist. He was given the
responsibility for organising the 1841 census, which
was to be on a larger scale than the previous four.
For the first time, every individual was to be named
on the household schedule, which some thought
intrusive and resulted in police protection in a few
urban areas for the specially employed enumerators.
The 1841 census introduced self-completion forms
which people were legally obliged to complete.
The administration of the forms throughout the
census process took place at the newly established
General Register Office in Somerset House, London.
This ‘new’ census system was to remain largely
unaltered until 1911.
2: ENGLAND
In April 2000 the Government set up a
Regional Co-ordination Unit, bringing
together the regional interests of a range of
central departments. The main functions of
the Unit are to:
> coordinate the delivery of central
government’s regional initiatives,
including those affecting local areas;
> promote the use of Government Offices
for the Regions (GOs) by Whitehall
departments;
> encourage better working between the
GOs and other regional and local
partners; and
> manage the shared functions of the GOs.
In the longer term, the Government has
said that it is committed to moving to directly
elected regional government for England
where support for this is demonstrated in
referendums. No decisions have yet been
taken on the form of the proposals which
might be the subject of such referendums or
when they might be held.
Economic Performance
The economic performance of the nine English
regions (see map on p. 10), and sub-regions
within them, varies quite considerably. For
example, Inner London has had the highest
level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per
head in the European Union (EU) for a
number of years, even though it also contains
some of the worst pockets of deprivation in the
UK. Under the new Objective 1 status for EU
funding that came into force in January 2000
(see p. 393), three areas of England—
Merseyside, South Yorkshire, and Cornwall
and the Isles of Scilly—qualified for funding
from 2000 to 2006. According to the latest
figures, household disposable income per head
in 1999 was above the England average in
London (by 18%) and in the South East and
East (both by 10%), and the same three regions
had the highest gross hourly earnings for full¬
time employees in 2000. The North East had
the lowest household disposable income and
GDP per head in 1999, as well as the lowest
average hourly earnings in 2000.
Among the consequences of economic
success in the wealthier English regions are
higher residential and industrial property
prices, higher rental costs for offices and
higher volumes of traffic. As people working
in London tend to live further away from their
workplaces than those in other cities, average
journey times to work are longer in London
than elsewhere, ranging from 31 minutes in
Outer London to 56 minutes in Central
London, compared with an average in Great
Britain of just 25 minutes. In autumn 1999 the
number of people entering Central London
between 7.00 a.m. and 10.00 a.m. on each
working day was nearly 1.1 million, a 1%
increase on the previous year. Public transport
is used by 79% of those working in Central
London, compared with the average of 14%
for Great Britain as a whole.
In terms of tourism, England accounts for
some 85% of all overseas visitors to the UK
(estimated at over 25 million in 2000) and
around 90% of overseas visitors’ spending
(estimated at £12.75 billion in 2000).
Rural Areas
According to the Countryside Agency, there
are over 16,500 rural towns, villages and
hamlets in England with populations of 10,000
or fewer. By this definition, one in five people
live in a rural area. Over three-quarters of rural
settlements have populations of under 500.
Car ownership is greater in rural
households (83%) than nationally (70%), but
the countryside often does not have services
which people living in urban areas take for
granted. The closures of many rural post
offices and banks in recent years are notable
examples. Another is the comparative lack of
public transport serving country areas. In
1998 the Government allocated an extra £150
million over three years to improve rural
transport in the UK as a whole. A further
£10 million a year for the next two years was
announced in the 1999 Budget. This extra
funding has led to the creation of 1,800 new or
improved rural bus services in England.
The Environment
Despite its high population density and degree
of urbanisation, England has many unspoilt
rural and coastal areas. There are eight
11
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
National Parks (including the Norfolk and
Suffolk Broads), nine forest parks, 37
designated Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty, 22 Environmentally Sensitive Areas,
over 200 country parks recognised by the
Countryside Agency, and more than 1,057 km
(657 miles) of designated heritage coastline. At
the end of March 2001, there were 208
National Nature Reserves, 670 Local Nature
Reserves and 4,115 Sites of Special Scientific
Interest (see also chapter 19).
Culture
London and other large English towns and
cities have many cultural attractions, including
art galleries, museums, theatres, ballet and
opera houses, and concert halls.
National, London-based theatre, dance
and opera companies frequently tour the
country giving performances at venues in the
English regions. Popular culture also thrives:
there are numerous kinds of pop music,
theatre styles (such as pantomime and
musicals), jazz and folk festivals and comedy
shows (see chapter 16).
Many regions and towns are associated
with great English writers, artists and
musicians. These include Stratford-upon-
Avon (William Shakespeare), the Lake
District (William Wordsworth), Stoke-on-
Trent (Arnold Bennett), Haworth (the Bronte
sisters) and Dorset (Thomas Hardy); Essex
and Suffolk (John Constable) and Salford
(L. S. Lowry); and Worcestershire (Edward
Elgar), Aldeburgh (Benjamin Britten) and
Liverpool (The Beatles).

At its nearest point, Northern Ireland’s north-eastern coast is separated from
Scotland by a stretch of water—the North Channel—only 21 km (13 miles)
wide. It has a 488-km (303-mile) border with the Irish Republic, forming the
UK’s only land boundary with another Member State of the European Union.
About half of Northern Ireland’s 1.7 million population live in the eastern
coastal region, at the centre of which is the capital, Belfast.
In December 1999 the Westminster Parliament devolved power to the
Northern Ireland Assembly and its Executive Committee of Ministers to run
most of Northern Ireland’s domestic affairs. It did so following a referendum
held in May 1998 which endorsed the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement.
Policing in Northern Ireland has undergone a number of changes as a result
of provisions in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. These include a
fundamental restructuring of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and
renaming it the ‘Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the Royal
Ulster Constabulary)’.
In the late 1990s the Northern Ireland
Continuous Household Survey (CHS)1
reported that 54% of the population regarded
themselves as Protestants and 42% as Roman
Catholics. (The 2001 Census in Northern
Ireland asked what religion, religious
denomination or body people living there
belonged to or were brought up in. Analysis of
the responses will not be available until 2002.)
Most of the Protestants are descendants of
Scots or English settlers. Northern Ireland
today has a younger population, with

proportionately more children and fewer
pensioners, than any other region in the UK.
History
The Vikings ruled Ireland from the 10th
century until Henry II of England invaded in
1169. He had been made the country’s
overlord by the English Pope Adrian IV, who
wanted the Irish Church to be fully obedient
to Rome. Although Anglo-Norman noblemen
controlled a large part of the country during
the Middle Ages, little direct authority came
from England.

The Tudor monarchs tended to intervene
in Ireland far more, and during the reign of
Elizabeth I there were several attempts to deal
with rebellion. The northern province of
Ulster was particularly subject to unrest, but
in 1607, after the resistance leaders had been
defeated and had fled, Protestant immigrants
came to settle there from Scotland and
England.
The English civil wars (1642—51) led to
further uprisings in Ireland, which Oliver
Cromwell suppressed. More fighting took place
after the overthrow of King James II, a Roman
Catholic, in 1688. At the Battle of the Boyne
(1690) the Protestant William of Orange (later
King William III) defeated the forces of James
II who was trying to regain the English throne
from his power-base in Ireland.

3: NORTHERN IRELAND
Northern Ireland: Districts
Throughout most of the 18th century there
was an uneasy peace. In 1782 the Government
in London gave the Irish Parliament (which
dated from medieval times) power to legislate
on Irish affairs, and the Crown became the
only constitutional tie with Great Britain. The
Parliament, however, represented only the
privileged Anglo-Irish minority; the Roman
Catholic majority was excluded. Following the
unsuccessful rebellion led by Wolfe Tone’s
United Irishmen movement in 1798, Great
Britain took back control of Ireland under the
1800 Act of Union. The Irish Parliament was
abolished in 1801 and Irish interests were
represented by members sitting in both
Houses of the Westminster Parliament.
The ‘Irish Question’ was one of the major
issues of British politics during the 19th
century. In 1886 the Liberal Government
introduced a Home Rule Bill to give a new
Irish Parliament devolved authority over most
internal matters with Great Britain keeping
control over foreign and defence policy. This
failed, as did a similar Bill introduced in 1893.
The issue returned in 1910 because the
Liberal Government in London depended for
its political survival on support from the Irish
Parliamentary Party, which was in favour of
Home Rule. The controversy deepened as
unionists and nationalists in Ireland formed
private armies and in 1914 Home Rule was
approved in the Government of Ireland Act.
The outbreak of the First World War,
however, suspended its implementation.
In 1916 a nationalist uprising in Dublin
was put down and its leaders executed. Two
years later the nationalist Sinn Fein party won
a large majority of the Irish seats in the
General Election to the Westminster
Parliament. Its members refused to attend
the House of Commons and instead formed
their own assembly—the Dail Eireann—in
Dublin. A nationalist guerrilla force called the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) began
15
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
operations against the British administration
in 1919.
In 1920 the Government of Ireland Act
provided for separate Parliaments in Northern
and Southern Ireland, subordinate to
Westminster. The Act was implemented in
Northern Ireland in 1921, giving six of the
nine counties of the province of Ulster their
own Parliament with powers to manage
internal affairs. However, the Act proved
unacceptable in the South, and in 1922,
following negotiations between the British
Government and Sinn Fein, which led to the
Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, the 26 counties of
Southern Ireland left the UK to become the
Irish Free State (now the Irish Republic).
From 1921 until 1972 Northern Ireland
had its own Parliament in which the unionists,
primarily representing the Protestant
community, held a permanent majority and
formed the regional government. The
nationalist minority resented this domination
and their effective exclusion from political
office and influence.
Between the late 1960s and early 1970s, the
civil rights movement and reactions to it
resulted in serious inter-communal rioting.
Consequently, in 1969, the British Army was
sent in to help police Northern Ireland.
However, because terrorism and inter-
communal violence continued, and even
worsened, in 1972 the British Government
decided to take back direct responsibility for
law and order. The Northern Ireland Unionist
Government resigned in protest, the regional
government was abolished and direct rule
from Westminster began. A Secretary of State
was appointed with a seat in the UK Cabinet
and he was given overall responsibility for
Northern Ireland’s government.
Political Change
It was never intended to make direct rule
permanent. Over the years, successive British
and Irish Governments have worked closely
together to try to bring lasting peace to
Northern Ireland, recognising the need for
new political arrangements acceptable to both
sides of the community.
In 1985 an Anglo-Irish Agreement provided
a new basis for relations between the UK and
the Irish Republic, creating an
Intergovernmental Conference in which to
discuss issues of mutual interest such as
improved cross-border cooperation and
security. Within this framework, the British
Government continued talks during the early
1990s with the Northern Ireland political parties
and separately with the Irish Government.
In 1993 the British and Irish Governments
signed the Downing Street Declaration,
setting out their views on how a future
settlement might be achieved and restating the
fundamental principle that any constitutional
change would require the consent of a
majority of people in Northern Ireland.
Following the British General Election in
May 1997, the new Government confirmed its
intention of making the talks process as
inclusive as possible and maintained that any
agreement reached would have to have the
broad support of the parties representing each
of the main communities.
Multi-party talks held in Belfast in April
1998 concluded with what became known as the
‘Good Friday Agreement’. Legislation was
passed at Westminster authorising a referendum
on the settlement in Northern Ireland and
permitting elections to a new Northern Ireland
Assembly. The Irish Parliament also considered
the Agreement and passed legislation
authorising a concurrent referendum in the
Irish Republic. In May 1998 referendums were
held in both parts of Ireland, and the
Agreement received a clear endorsement.
Northern Ireland voted 71.1% in favour and
28.8% against, while in the Irish Republic the
result was 94.3% and 5.6% respectively.
A new Northern Ireland Assembly of 108
members was elected by proportional
representation (single transferable vote) in
June 1998 and met for the first time the
following month (see p. 17). The Westminster
Parliament subsequently implemented the
whole settlement and formally instituted
devolved administrative powers in the
Northern Ireland Act 1998.
In December 1999 power was devolved to
the Assembly and its Executive Committee of
Ministers. At the same time the North/South
Ministerial Council, North/South
Implementation Bodies, British-Irish Council
and a new British-Irish Intergovernmental
Conference became fully functioning
16

institutions. However, in February 2000 the
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland
suspended the operation of the devolved
administration, owing to a lack of substantive
progress being made on decommissioning of
illegally held arms—a condition necessary for
the complete fulfilment of the Belfast (Good
Friday) Agreement by 2001. After further
talks, a political settlement was reached and
devolved powers were restored to the
Assembly and Executive in May 2000.
Nevertheless, arms decommissioning has
remained a contentious issue, prompting the
resignation of the Ulster Unionist First
Minister on 1 July 2001 and the appointment
of an acting successor.
Government
Following devolution, the Secretary of State
for Northern Ireland remains responsible for
Northern Ireland Office matters not devolved
to the Assembly. These include policing,
security policy, prisons and criminal justice.
The Secretary of State represents Northern
Ireland interests in the UK Cabinet and is
tasked with ensuring that the devolution
settlement works satisfactorily.
Northern Ireland elects 18 Members of
Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons
and, by proportional representation, three of
the 87 UK representatives to the European
Parliament (MEPs).
Northern Ireland’s 26 local government
district councils have limited executive
functions. They nominate locally elected
representatives to sit as members of the
various statutory bodies dealing with, for
example, education and libraries, health and
personal social services, drainage and fire
services.
Northern Ireland Assembly
The Assembly meets in Parliament Buildings
at Stormont, Belfast, and is the prime source
of authority for all devolved responsibilities. It
has full legislative and executive powers
within this framework, which means it can
make laws and take decisions on all the
functions of the Northern Ireland
departments (see p. 18).
At its first meeting in July 1998, the
Assembly elected, on a cross-community basis,
a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister
and appointed ten ministers with responsibility
for each of the Northern Ireland departments,
which together form the Executive. These 12
ministers make up the Executive Committee,
which meets to discuss and agree on those
issues which cut across the responsibilities of
two or more ministers. Its role is to prioritise
executive business and recommend a common
position where necessary.
The Executive’s main function is to plan
each year, and review as necessary, a

programme of government with an agreed
budget. This is subject to approval by the
Assembly, after scrutiny in Assembly
Committees, on a cross-community basis.
Assembly members can be on more than one
Assembly Committee. The first budget was
agreed in December 2000, and in March 2001
the Assembly approved the first Programme
for Government which set out the Executive’s
plans and priorities for the three years from
April 2001. The Programme identified five
key areas for action to be taken by the
Northern Ireland departments working
together and with others: Growing as a
Community; Working for a Healthier People;
Investing in Education and Health; Securing a
Competitive Economy; and Developing
North/South, East/West and International
Relations. The Programme for Government
will be reviewed on an annual basis.
The Assembly has ten Statutory
Committees. Membership of Committees is in
broad proportion to party strengths in the
Assembly to ensure that the opportunity of
Committee places is available to all Members.
Each Committee has a scrutiny, policy
development and consultation role in relation
to its department and a role in the initiation of
legislation.

Emblem
The Northern Ireland Assembly has
adopted the linen or flax plant as its official
emblem. The six flowers signify the
counties of Northern Ireland, while the
plant itself is a reminder of the economic
importance linen has had in Northern
Ireland’s agricultural and manufacturing
industries. The prevalence of blue in the
furnishings of the Assembly Chamber
reflects the colour of the flax plant’s
flowers, and the wall panels of damask linen
represent the fibre which it produces.
developing a coherent policy direction on the
work of the Executive Committee, and the
response of the Northern Ireland
administration to external relationships. The
departments which, together with the
OFMDFM, comprise the Executive
Committee are: Agriculture and Rural
Development (DARD); Culture, Arts and
Leisure (DCAL); Education (DEd);
Employment and Learning (DEL);
Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI);
Environment (DOE); Finance and Personnel
(DFP); Health, Social Services and Public
Safety (DHSSPS); Regional Development
(DRD); and Social Development (DSD). (For
functions and contact details, see Appendix 1,
pp. 537-546.)
A 60-member Civic Forum was established
in October 2000, representing the business,
trade union, voluntary and other sectors of the
Northern Ireland community. It has a
chairperson appointed by the First Minister
and Deputy First Minister and acts as a
consultative mechanism on social, economic
and cultural matters.
Intergovernmental Dialogue
The North/South Ministerial Council is a
forum for those with executive responsibilities
in Northern Ireland and the Irish
Government. The Council meets on a regular
basis to develop consultation, cooperation and
action on an all-island and cross-border basis.
The North/South Implementation Bodies,
established by international agreement
between the British and Irish Governments,
implement the policies agreed by ministers in
the North/South Ministerial Council. They
deal with: waterways; food safety; trade and
business development; special European
Union programmes; marine matters; and
language.
The British-Irish Council aims to promote
and develop good relationships among all the
peoples of the United Kingdom and Ireland.
It has representatives from the British and
Irish Governments, the devolved institutions
in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and
others from the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man.
18
3: NORTHERN IRELAND
The British-Irish Intergovernmental
Conference’s role is to promote bilateral
cooperation on matters of mutual interest
between the two governments.
Human Rights and Equality
The European Convention on Human Rights
became part of Northern Ireland domestic
law when the Human Rights Act 1998 (see
p. 214) came into effect throughout the UK in
October 2000.
A commitment to protect human rights and
promote equality w as central to the Belfast
Agreement. The resulting Northern Ireland
Act 1998 not only placed a statutory duty of
equality on all public authorities but also
established the following bodies with specific
responsibilities for fostering equal
opportunities and good community relations:
> The Northern Ireland Human Rights
Commission—to give advice to the
Government and the Northern Ireland
Assembly on human rights issues,
particularly on any need for legislation to
protect human rights.
> The Equality Commission for Northern
Ireland—to be responsible for fair
employment, equal opportunities, racial
equality, disability issues and enforcing
the statutory duty of equality on public
authorities.
> The Parades Commission—to help
implement the Public Processions
(Northern Ireland) Act 1998 covering
contentious parades in Northern Ireland.
The Commission imposed legally
binding route conditions on 168 such
parades in the year to 31 March 2001 out
of a total of 3,440. The majority of
parades each year are organised by the
Protestant/Unionist community and
most take place during the six months
from around Easter to the end of
September.
^ The Victims ofVlolence Commission—to
look at possible ways of providing
support for the victims of the violence
caused by inter-community unrest over
the past 30 years.
Security Policy
The Government remains committed to
ensuring that the security forces in Northern
Ireland have available the powers they need to
counter the terrorist threat. The Terrorism
Act 2000 (see p. 218) therefore contains a
temporary part for Northern Ireland. These
provisions are limited to five years, require
annual renewal, and each provision can be
stopped by order at any time. Setting these
temporary powers in the context of a UK¬
wide framework of permanent counter¬
terrorism measures underlines the
Government’s commitment to repealing the
Northern Ireland specific powers as soon as it
is safe to do so.
Policing and Justice
An independent Policing Commission, set up
under the terms of the Belfast Agreement,
reviewed the policing needs in Northern
Ireland. Its report—A New Beginning: Policing
in Northern Ireland (Patten Report)—was
published in September 1999 and made
recommendations w hich led to the Police
(Northern Ireland) Act 2000. The Act
contains provisions to:
^ enhance the police service’s
accountability through a new Policing
Board to be made up of ten members of
the Assembly and nine independent
members;
> give the Board reporting and inquiry
powers and require it to monitor and
assess police performance;
> create new district policing partnerships
aimed at improving local accountability;
> introduce measures to redress the
religious imbalance in the police service
between Protestants and Catholics;
> change the name of the RUC to the
‘Police Service of Northern Ireland
(incorporating the Royal Ulster
Constabulary)’. For operational
purposes, the service will be called the
‘Police Service of Northern Ireland’; and
> establish a Commissioner to oversee the
implementation of changes.
19
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
In parallel with the work of the Policing
Commission, the Government carried out a
review of the criminal justice system in
Northern Ireland in which political parties,
interested bodies, organisations and individuals
were consulted. Its recommendations,
published in March 2000, were subject to
further consultation which ended the following
September. Detailed preparation of the
legislation and implementation plan for the
review is well advanced.
The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998
established the office of a Police Ombudsman
to provide an independent means of
impartially investigating complaints against
police officers in Northern Ireland. When it is
perceived to be in the public interest, the
Police Ombudsman can also react to incidents,
even if no individual complaint has been
made. Between taking up position in
November 2000 and the end of April 2001, the
Police Ombudsman received 1,829 cases
involving 2,349 separate complaints.
Investigations or further enquiries are ongoing
for about 50% of these cases; the remaining
ones have been closed for a variety of reasons,
such as complainant non-cooperation or the
incident complained about being outside the
Police Ombudsman’s remit. By the end of
April 2001, the Police Ombudsman had
reacted to 21 public interest incidents.
The Economy
Employment in Northern Ireland grewr
throughout the 1990s and unemployment has
declined since 1993. The Labour Force
Survey for April to June 2001 showed that
67.8% of people of w orking age in Northern
Ireland were in employment, compared with
74.8% in the UK as a whole. Comparable ILO
rates for unemployment were 5.9% and 5.0%
respectively.
In Northern Ireland, manufacturing
industry accounted for some 19% of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 1998, compared
with 20.3% for the UK as a whole.
Agriculture, forestry and fishing accounted for
4.0% of GDP in 1998, compared with 1.3%
for the UK.
In 2000, 58.5% of export trade was to the
EU, similar to the UK average, but trade from
the EU accounted for nearly 36% of imports,
lower than the overall UK average of 48.6%.
A substantial increase in new inward
investment in growth industries such as
computer software, telecommunications and
network services contributed to the 7,145 new
jobs promoted by the Industrial Development
Board in 2000—01.
Northern Ireland’s economic development
strategy is being reviewed following the
Enterprise, Trade and Investment
Committee’s consideration of the Strategy
2010 report, and taking into account the
Executive’s priorities under the Programme
for Government (see p. 18). Following further
consultation with the Committee, the
Economic Development Forum and others, it
is planned to have strategic priorities in place
by March 2002.
The public expenditure allocation w ithin
the Northern Ireland Executive’s
responsibility for 2001—02 is £5.8 billion.
Economic Assistance
The Berlin EU summit at the end of March
1999 agreed a Special Programme for
Northern Ireland in support of peace, worth
about £260 million between the years 2000
and 2004. It also confirmed the renewal for
three years of EU support of approximately
£10 million a year for the International Fund
for Ireland, set up in 1986 by the British and
Irish Governments to encourage cross-border
cooperation in business enterprise, tourism,
community relations, urban development,
agriculture and rural development. Donors
include the United States, Canada, New
Zealand and the European Union.
Including funding from the new Special
Programme, Northern Ireland will receive
around £900 million under the EU Structural
Funds Programmes over the period 2000-06
(see p. 393). Within these programmes is a
unique Structural Funding package working
under the authority of the Northern Ireland
Community Support Framework (CSF). Its
priorities, which have been agreed with the
European Commission, are to support peace
and reconciliation; economic growth and
renewal; employment, human resource
development and social inclusion; balanced
regional, urban and rural development; and
20
3: NORTHERN IRELAND
North/South and wider cooperation. An
indicative allocation of 7.5% of the funds in
the Northern Ireland CSF has been set aside
for North/South cooperation.
The Irish Language
Estimates suggest that around 142,000 people
in Northern Ireland have some ability to use
Irish as a means of communication, either
orally or in writing. A cross-border
implementation body has been set up with
responsibility for promoting the Irish language
and facilitating and encouraging its use.
In 1998 a statutory duty was placed on the
education authorities in Northern Ireland to
promote Irish-medium education. In May
2001 there were 11 grant-aided schools and
five units (four primary and one secondary)
teaching 1,845 primary and secondary school
pupils in Irish as the first language. There
were also ten Irish-medium independent
schools teaching a further 105 pupils.
In March 2001, the UK ratified the
European Charter for Regional or Minority
Languages, which commits signatory States to
supporting indigenous minority languages in
key areas such as education, justice, the public
services, cultural policies and the media. The
Charter, which came into force in July 2001,
recognises as regional languages both Irish and
Ulster-Scots and promotes the use of Irish in
public life. These developments are
compatible with the Northern Ireland
Assembly’s obligations under the Belfast
Agreement and reinforce its commitment
to help protect the linguistic diversity of the
UK.
Culture and the Arts
Northern Ireland has a rich cultural heritage and
its people have made a significant contribution
to literature and the performing arts.
Northern Irish writers such as Keith Baker,
Colin Bateman, Jack Higgins, Maurice Leitch,
C. S. Lewis, Sam McAughtry, Bernard
McLaverty, Robert McLiam Wilson, Brian
Moore and Glenn Patterson have written
about places which visitors familiar with their
books enjoy coming to see.
Poets with international reputations include
Ciaran Carson, John Hewitt, Derek Mahon,
Medbh McGuckian, Louis MacNeice, John
Montague and Paul Muldoon. Among the best
known, perhaps, are Nobel Laureate Seamus
Heaney and his contemporary Michael
Longley, who was awarded the prestigious
Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry in April 2001.
Northern Ireland has produced some fine
actors among whom are Colin Blakely,
Kenneth Branagh, Amanda Burton, James
Ellis, Denys Hawthorne, Doreen Hepburn,
Liam Neeson, James Nesbitt and Stephen
Rea. The Irish dramatic tradition continues
today with playwrights like Brian Friel, Marie
Jones, Martin Lynch, Frank McGuinness,
Stewart Parker and Graham Reid.
Music is associated with cultural and social
life in Northern Ireland and there is a wide
variety on offer, from live bands in local pubs to
the Ulster Concert Orchestra in the prestigious
Waterfront Hall. Among the famous names in
music are flautist James Galway, singer/
songwriter Van Morrison, pianists Phil Coulter
and Barry Douglas, opera singer Kathleen
Feeney, blues guitarist Ronnie Greer and pop
groups Ash, The Divine Comedy and Therapy.

Scotland, the most northerly of the four parts of the United Kingdom, covers
about one-third of the island of Great Britain. Bounded by England to the
south, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and north, and the North Sea to the east,
Scotland is a country with large areas of unspoilt and wild landscape, and
many of the UK’s mountains, including its highest peak, Ben Nevis (1,343 m,
4,406 ft).
Just over 5 million people live in Scotland, three-quarters of them in the
central lowlands where two of its largest cities are situated: Edinburgh (the
capital) on the east coast and Glasgow on the west. Aberdeen and Dundee are
its two other principal cities. Together these four cities and their surrounding
regions account for 75% of Scotland’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Following devolution to the Scottish Parliament in 1999, day-to-day
administration of Scottish domestic affairs is the responsibility of the Scottish
Executive, headed by the First Minister.
Early History
Evidence of human settlement in what is now
known as Scotland dates from around the
third millennium BC. By the time the Romans
invaded Britain, many tribes were living in the
region, but despite a number of attempts to
control them, Roman rule never permanently
extended to most of Scotland. In the sixth
century, the Scots, a Celtic people from
Ireland, settled on the north-west coast of the
island of Great Britain, giving their name to
the present-day Scotland.
The kingdoms of England and Scotland
were frequently at war during the Middle
Ages. When King Edward I tried to impose
direct English rule over Scotland in 1296, a
revolt for independence broke out, which
ended in 1328 when King Edward III
recognised its leader, Robert the Bruce, as
King Robert I of Scotland.
In 1603 Queen Elizabeth I of England, who
never married and had no children of her own,
was succeeded by her nearest heir, King James
VI of Scotland. He became King James I of
England and so united the English and
Scottish crowns in one person. Politically,
however, England and Scotland remained
separate during the 17th century, apart from a
period of union forced on them by Oliver

Cromwell in the 1650s. It was not until 1707
that the English and Scottish Parliaments
agreed on a single Parliament for Great Britain
to sit at Westminster in London.
Population
Scotland’s population has changed relatively
little in the last 50 years. In June 2000 the
estimated population was 5.1 million (see
Table 4.1), compared with 5.2 million in 1971
and 5.1 million in 1951. The population
density is the lowest in the UK, averaging
65 people per sq km.
Scottish Parliament and Executive
The Scotland Act 1998 gave the necessary
statutory framework to set up a Scottish
Parliament and Executive, which the majority
of Scottish people had endorsed in a
Prince William, the elder of the Prince of
Wales’s two sons and second in line to the
throne after his father, started studying at
the University of St Andrews, Fife, in the
autumn of 2001. He will follow a four-year
course in the History of Art leading to an
MA (Honours) degree.

referendum in September 1997. Of those who
voted, 74% supported devolution. On a
second question—whether to give the new
Parliament tax-varying powers—64% of
voters were in favour.
Elections to the first Scottish Parliament for
almost 300 years were held in May 1999, and
it met for the first time in July 1999. Unlike
the Westminster Parliament, the Scottish
Parliament does not have a second chamber to
revise legislation which comes before it.
Detailed scrutiny of Bills is carried out in
committees or by taking evidence from outside
experts. The House of Lords no longer
considers Scottish legislation on devolved
matters (though it remains the final court of
appeal in hearing civil cases arising from the
Scottish courts—see chapter 14).
The Scottish Parliament’s 129 members
(MSPs) are elected for a fixed four-year term.
The ‘additional member’ system of
proportional representation (PR) is used in
Scottish Parliamentary elections, giving each
voter two votes: one for a constituency MSP
and one ‘regional’ vote for a registered
political party or an individual independent
candidate. There are 73 single-member
constituency seats and 56 seats representing
eight regions (based on the European
parliamentary constituencies) with each
returning seven members. These MSPs are
allocated so that each party’s overall share of
seats in the Parliament reflects its share of the
regional vote.
The Labour Party, which has traditionally
done well in elections in Scotland, is the largest
single party (see Table 4.2), with 55 MSPs. It
has 52 of the 73 constituency seats, including
nearly all those in central Scotland. The
Scottish National Party is the second largest
party, with 35 MSPs. In the 1999 election, most
of its seats came from the ‘top-up’ PR system, as
did all the 18 seats won at the time by the
Conservative Party, the third largest party in the
Parliament. In March 2000 the Conservatives
won their first constituency seat in a by-
election, taking it from the Labour Party.
Responsibilities
The Scottish Parliament’s responsibilities
include health; education and training; local
government; housing; economic development;
many aspects of home affairs and civil and
criminal law; transport; the environment;
agriculture, fisheries and forestry; and sport
and the arts. In these areas, the Scottish
Parliament is able to amend or repeal existing

Acts of the UK Parliament and to pass new
legislation of its own.
Responsibility for a number of other issues,
including overseas affairs, defence and
national security, overall economic and
monetary policy, energy, employment
legislation and social security, remains with
the UK Government and Parliament as
‘reserved’ matters under Schedule 5 of the
Scotland Act 1998. The Secretary of State for
Scotland has a seat in the Cabinet and is
responsible for representing Scottish interests
within the UK Government through the
Scotland Office.
The Scottish Executive—the devolved
administration in Scotland—has responsibility
for all public bodies whose functions and
services have been devolved to it, and is
accountable to the Scottish Parliament for
them. It also has an input into organisations
such as the Forestry Commission (see p. 466),
whose work covers Scotland as well as other
parts of the UK.
The Parliament currently meets at the
General Assembly Hall in Edinburgh’s Old
Town. A new Parliament building, due for
completion in the winter of 2002, is being
built at Holyrood, at the lower end of the
Royal Mile (a street in the historic centre of
Edinburgh and the location of Parliament
House, where the previous Scottish
Parliament met from 1640 to 1707).
The First Minister, normally the leader of
the party with most support in the Parliament,
heads the Scottish Executive. Since the first
elections, the Executive has been run by a
partnership between Labour and the Liberal
Democrats, with the latter having two seats in
the Cabinet, including that of Deputy First
Minister. There are 11 Cabinet positions
in all.
Finance
The Scottish Parliament’s budget for 2001-02
is £19.8 billion. Most of the money is
allocated to it by the UK Parliament through
the Secretary of State for Scotland. Once the
budget has been set, the Scottish Executive
can share out the resources across its
expenditure programmes.
The Parliament has the power to increase or
decrease the basic rate of income tax—
currently 22 pence in the pound—by a
maximum of 3 pence. A person is liable to pay
income tax if he or she is a UK resident for tax
purposes and either spends 50% or more of
the tax year in Scotland or has his or her only
or principal home there.
The Parliament is also responsible for
deciding the form of local taxation. It may, if it
wishes, alter both the council tax and business
rates.
The Economy
In the last 50 years the Scottish economy has
moved away from the traditional industries of
coal, steel and shipbuilding. Extraction of
25
BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
offshore oil and gas, growth in services and,
more recently, developments in high-
technology industries—such as chemicals,
electronic engineering and information
technology—have taken their place.
Manufacturing still remains important,
however, and Scotland’s manufacturing
exports in 2000 were valued at £18.3 billion.
Key features of the Scottish economy
include:
> Electronics. Scotland has one of the
biggest concentrations of the electronics
industry in Western Europe, employing
about 40,600 workers in 2000. Electrical
and instrument engineering exports were
worth £10 billion in 2000, accounting for
56% of Scotland’s manufactured exports.
> Oil and gas. Offshore oil and gas
production has made a significant
contribution to the Scottish economy in
the last 30 years. Many of the UK’s 115
offshore oilfields are to the east of the
Isles of Shetland and Orkney or off the
east coast of the mainland (see map, at
the back of the book).
> Whisky. Whisky production continues to
be important to Scotland. In 2000 the
value of drinks exports, dominated by
whisky, was valued at £1.3 billion. There
are 90 whisky distilleries in Scotland,
most of them in the north-east.
> Tourism. Tourism is a major industry,
supporting about 193,000 jobs. In 1999
expenditure by tourists was valued at
£2.5 billion and there were around 12.4
million tourist trips, including those
originating in Scotland.
> Financial services. Funds managed by
financial institutions in Scotland were
worth some £351.1 billion at the end of
2000, of which £117.9 billion were in
long-term life insurance and £131.1
billion in pensions. A number of financial
institutions are based in Scotland,
including insurance companies, fund
managers, unit trusts and investment
trusts. There are four Scottish-based
clearing banks, which have limited rights
to issue their own banknotes.
> Forestry. Scotland accounts for just under
half of the UK’s timber production. In
the last ten years there has been
significant international and local
investment in wood-based panel
production and in pulp and paper
processing.
> Fishing. Fishing remains significant,
particularly in the north-east and in the
Highlands and Islands. In 2000 Scotland
accounted for 70% by weight and 60%
by value of the fish landed in the UK by
British trawlers. Fish farming,
particularly of salmon, has grown in
importance; Scotland produces the
largest amount of farmed salmon in
the EU.
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and
Islands Enterprise (see p. 392) manage
domestic support for industry and commerce,
while Locate in Scotland, a joint operation
between the Scottish Executive and Scottish
Enterprise, encourages inward investment. In
2000-01, 102 inward investment projects were
recorded, which are expected to lead to -
investment of £1,763 million and the creation
or safeguarding of over 14,000 jobs.
The Labour Force Survey for April to June
2001 showed that 73.9% of people of working
age in Scotland were in employment,
compared with 74.8% in the UK as a whole.
Comparable rates for ILO unemployment (see
p. 148) over the same period were 6.1% and
5.0% respectively.
Legal System
The Scottish legal system (see chapter 14)
differs in many respects from that of England
and Wales. This is because, during the 16th
century, it based itself partly on medieval
church laws and partly on those borrowed from
other European legal systems. The 1707 Treaty
of Union allowed Scotland to keep Scots law, its
own courts and legal profession. The
prosecution, prison and police services are also
separate from those in England and Wales.
26
4: SCOTLAND
Drug Courts
Scotland’s first pilot drug court will start
operating in Glasgow towards the end of
2001. This special court aims to address
the problem of drug addicts committing
crimes to feed their habit, being punished
and then reoffending. It is part of the
Scottish Executive’s wider strategy to
tackle drug misuse in Scotland and is
expected to deal with between 150 and
200 cases a year. The court will:
> make treatment orders with
immediate effect;
> review the performance of
participants on treatment orders in
open court on a regular basis;
> provide frequent and regular drugs
tests for offenders; and
> impose penalties and sanctions for
non-compliance.
If the Glasgow drug court is successful,
the Scottish Executive will consider
further pilots in other parts of Scotland.
Education and Culture
The Scottish education system has a number
of distinctive features (see chapter 10),
including a separate system of examinations
and differences in the curriculum. Record
numbers of students are entering post-
compulsory education—around 571,000
students were enrolled in vocational, further
or higher education in 1999-2000.
It is estimated that Gaelic is spoken by some
70,000 people, many of whom live in the
Hebrides (the islands off Scotland’s west
coast). The Scottish Executive is providing
£13.3 million to support Gaelic in 2001-02.
Broadcasting is the largest single area,
accounting for £8.5 million. In 2000-01 there
were 1,862 children in Gaelic-medium
education in 60 primary schools and 326
pupils in 14 secondary schools.
The annual Edinburgh Festival is one of the
world’s leading cultural occasions. Edinburgh
Festivals bring about £120 million into the
Scottish economy each year. The International
Festival, Jazz Festival, Festival Fringe, Book
Festival, Film Festival and Military Tattoo
combine to make the Edinburgh Festival the
largest arts event in the UK.
Scotland has several major collections of the
fine and applied arts, such as the Burrell
Collection in Glasgow, and the National
Gallery of Scotland and the Scottish National
Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh. The
National Museums have built the new
Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh to house
the national Scottish collections and in July
2001 they opened the Museum of Scottish
Country Life at Kittochside near East
Kilbride, the first major national museum in
the west of Scotland.

Wales (or Cymru in Welsh) is a mountainous country on the western side of
Great Britain. Around one-quarter of the land is above 305 rn (1,000 ft) and in
the north its highest peak, Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), rises to 1,085 m (3,560 ft). e
Welsh coastline stretches for 1,180 km (732 miles) and consists of many bays,
beaches, peninsulas and cliffs.
About two-thirds of the population of Wales live in the south-eastern part o
the country. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Industrial Revolution had a
major impact in south Wales, where the iron and steel factories and coal mines
were concentrated. The capital, Cardiff, grew in the 19th century as a coal
exporting port, and Swansea and Newport also depended for their prosperity
on the surrounding industries and their position as ports in the Bristo
Channel. In the 20th century these traditional industries fell into decline, to be
replaced by those involving new technology.
Since 1999 Wales has had its own National Assembly headed by a first
Minister with a Cabinet of eight other ministers—which has powers to make
secondary legislation to meet the specific needs of the Welsh people.
Early History
After the Romans finally left Britain early in the
5th century (see p. 4), Wales remained a Celtic
stronghold ruled by sovereign princes under the
influence of England. In 1282 King Edward I
brought Wales under English rule and the
castles he built in the north remain among the
UK’s finest historic monuments. Edward Es
eldest son—later King Edward II—was born at
Caernarfon in 1284 and was created the first
English Prince of Wales in 1301. The eldest son
of the reigning monarch continues to bear this
title, Prince Charles being made Prince of Wales
in 1969.
At the beginning of the 15th century,
Welsh resentment of unjust English laws and
administration, and widespread economic
discontent, resulted in the nationalist leader
Owain Glyndwr heading an unsuccessful revolt
against the English. From 1485 to 1603 the Tudor
dynasty, which was of Welsh ancestry, ruled
England and it was during this time that the Acts
of Union (1536 and 1542) united England and
Wales administratively, politically and legally.

Welsh Emblems
The leek and the daffodil are two plants
which have come to represent Wales, but
the reasons for this are not clear. One
suggestion for the leek is that St David
(the patron saint of Wales) advised the
Britons to wear leeks in their caps so that
they could recognise one another in battle.
This has become a tradition which
survives today, with soldiers in Welsh
regiments wearing leeks on St David’s Day
(1 March). A possible reason for the
daffodil is that, in Welsh, the word for
‘leek’ is ‘cenhinen’ while that for ‘daffodil’
is ‘cenhinen pedr’.
proposals to devolve certain powers and
responsibilities to a National Assembly,
when 50.3% of those who voted were in
favour and 49.7% against. The Government
of Wales Act 1998 laid down the necessary
statutory framework to establish the National
Assembly for Wales, which held its first
elections in May 1999 and began functioning
as a devolved administration two months later.
Electors have two votes in Assembly
elections: one for a candidate in their local
constituency and one for a party list. I he

House of Commons) and 20 regional members

proportional representation (four for each of
the five former European parliamentary
constituencies in Wales—elections to the
European Parliament are now based on a
single all-Wales constituency).
The Labour Party has traditionally had
strong support in Wales. It has the largest
number of seats in the Assembly (see Table 5.2),
although it does not have an overall majority.
Since October 2000 it has run the Assembly in
partnership with the Liberal Democrats.
Responsibilities
The National Assembly for Wales has powers
to make secondary legislation (see p. 54) to
meet distinctive Welsh needs. It is responsible
for: economic development; agriculture,
forestry, fisheries and food; education and
training; industry; local government; health
and personal social services; housing; the
environment; planning; transport and roads;
arts, culture and the Welsh language; ancient
monuments and historic buildings; and sport
and recreation.
The Assembly’s budget for 2001-02 to
2002-03 is £9.1 billion. In January 2000 the
Assembly Cabinet published Better Wales—its
ten-year strategy built round five key areas for
improving life in Wales: opportunities for
learning; a stronger economy; better health and
well-being; quality of life; and better, simpler
government. Better Wales also set out more
than 100 targets for achievement by the end of
the current Assembly including: no infant
classes with more than 30 pupils; a 10%
increase in the number of Welsh exporting
companies; and the number of tourism trips to
increase to 12.2 million per year.
In October 2000 the First Minister, who
heads the Assembly, appointed a Cabinet of
eight ministers in charge of: economic
development; finance and communities;
education and lifelong learning; health and
social services; culture and sports; rural affairs;
environment; and trefnydd (business manager).
The Assembly is also responsible for over
50 public bodies. The organisations with the
largest expenditure are:
> the Higher Education Funding Council
for Wales (with planned gross
expenditure in 2001-02 of £318 million);
and
> the Welsh Development Agency (WDA,
see p. 393) (£273 million).
Local Government
The 22 Welsh unitary authorities (see map on
p. 30) have collective responsibility for
spending over a third of the National
Assembly’s budget. The Assembly sets the
policy framework and makes the secondary
legislation within which local government
operates. It also has a responsibility to ensure
that local decision-making reflects the
requirements of the law and, where
appropriate, priorities fixed by the Assembly.
The Local Government Act 2000, which the
Assembly has implemented in Wales,
contained measures to modernise local
authority management structures, strengthen
local democracy and improve local financial
accountability.
A Partnership Council has been formed,
whose role is to advise the National Assembly
on the various functions of local government. It
comprises locally elected representatives
(including those from the National Parks,
police and fire authorities, and community
councils) and selected members of the
Assembly. It also assists the Assembly in
preparing guidance and advice to local councils.
Role of the UK Government in Wales
Following devolution, the UK Government
has kept responsibility in Wales for certain
matters including foreign affairs, defence,
taxation, overall economic policy, crime,
justice and prisons, social security and
broadcasting. The office of Secretary of State
for Wales continues. The post holder has a
seat in the UK Cabinet and is responsible for
promoting the devolution settlement, bringing
forward primary legislation, bidding for the
Assembly’s budget and ensuring that Welsh
interests are properly represented and
considered within the UK Government. As
part of the UK, Wales retains full
constituency representation in the
Westminster Parliament.

BRITAIN AND ITS PEOPLE
Welsh Language
Estimates suggest that 20% of the population
over the age of three in private households are
able to speak Welsh. In much of the rural
north and west, Welsh remains the first
language.
Welsh is widely used for official purposes,
and is treated equally with English in the
work of the Assembly. It is quite extensively
used in broadcasting, and most road signs are
bilingual. Wdlsh-medium education in schools
is encouraged. Since September 2000, Welsh
has been taught—as a first or second
language—to all pupils between the ages of
5 and 16, and other subjects are taught in
Welsh to primary and secondary school
children in about 500 schools.
The National Assembly is responsible for
supporting Welsh culture and developing
greater use of the Welsh language. The Welsh
Language Act 1993 set the principle that,
in public business and in the administration
of justice in Wales, Welsh and English
should have equal treatment. The Welsh
Language Board’s role is to promote the use
of Welsh.
Economy
The Welsh economy, which was traditionally
based on coal and steel, experienced some
major changes during the 20th century. Wales
now has a more varied range of manufacturing
industries, including many at the forefront of
technology, and a growing number involved in
e-commerce. However, the steel industry
remains important, and crude steel production
in Wales was around 6.8 million tonnes in
1999, accounting for 42% of UK steel output.
The Labour Force Survey for April to June
2001 showed that 68.5% of people of working
age in Wales were in employment, compared
with 74.8% in the UK as a whole. Comparable
rates for ILO unemployment were 6.2% and
5.0% respectively. As part of the Better Wales
ten-year strategic plan (see p. 31), the National
Assembly has set a target for an additional
40,000 jobs to be created in Wales before the
end of its first term of office (2003).
Manufacturing accounts for 24.4% of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Wales,
compared with 18.1% in the UK as a whole.
Wales is an important centre for consumer and
office electronics, automotive components,
chemicals and materials, aerospace, and food
and drink. There were around 35,000
employee jobs in the manufacture of optical
and electrical equipment, and 11,000 in the
manufacture of parts and accessories for motor
vehicles and their engines in Wales, according
to the 1999 Annual Business Inquiry. In the
service sector, tourism and leisure services are
significant—estimates indicate that about 10.9
million tourist trips were made to Wales in
1999—while call centre activity is becoming
more important and widespread.
A key feature of the economy has been the
volume of investment from overseas
companies and from elsewhere in the UK.
Since 1983, over 2,000 inward investment
projects have been recorded in Wales,
bringing in a total of £13.9 billion and
promising the creation and safeguarding of
nearly 220,000 jobs. Overseas-owned
manufacturing companies in Wales employ
more than 70,000 people.
The Welsh Development Agency has
broad functions and powers, so that it is well
placed to contribute to economic
regeneration across the whole of Wales.
Increased resources are being provided to
support business development and promote
innovation. The WDA is coordinating an
Entrepreneurship Action Plan for Wales in
order to develop a strong business culture.
Environment
About one-quarter of the land in Wales is
designated as a National Park or Area of
Outstanding Natural Beauty (see p. 315). As
well as three National Parks—Snowdonia, the
Brecon Beacons and the Pembrokeshire
Coast—and five Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty, there are two national trails, 36
country parks and large stretches of heritage
coast. There are also 62 National Nature
Reserves, over 1,000 Sites of Special Scientific
Interest and a number of internationally
important nature conservation sites. For
example, 89 sites are proposed for designation
as Special Areas of Conservation under the
European Community (EC) Habitat Directive,
32
5: WALES
15 Special Protection Areas are classified
under the EC Wild Birds Directive, and ten
wetlands of international importance are
designated under the Ramsar Convention (see
p. 321). There are six Environmentally
Sensitive Areas (see p. 456), representing
about 25% of the land in Wales. The Tir
Gofal (Land in Care) scheme, introduced in
1999-2000, aims to encourage agricultural
practices that will help to protect and improve
the landscape and w ildlife of the Welsh
countryside.
Cultural and Social Affairs
Welsh literature has a long tradition and is one
of the oldest in Europe. Music is also very
important to the Welsh people: Wales is
particularly well-known for its choral singing,
while both the Welsh National Opera and the
BBC National Orchestra of Wales have
international reputations. Special festivals,
know n as eisteddfodau, encourage both Welsh
literature and music. The largest is the annual
Royal National Eisteddfod, consisting of
competitions in music, singing, prose and
poetry entirely in Welsh. Performers from all
over the world come to Llangollen in
Denbighshire for the annual International
Musical Eisteddfod, while the ‘Cardiff Singer
of the World’ competition—held every two
years—is recognised as one of the world’s
leading singing competitions.
The National Museums and Galleries of
Wales include the Museum of Welsh Life at
St Fagans, near Cardiff, and the recently
rebuilt Welsh Slate Museum at Llanberis,
Gwynedd. The main building in Cardiff
contains many paintings by Welsh artists,
including Augustus John, Gwen John and
Kyffyn \\ illiams as well as a representative
collection of other important works. A new
Industrial and Maritime Museum is to be
built in Swansea. The National Library of
Wales at Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, contains
over 4 million books.
The media in Wales include several Welsh
and English language newspapers, local radio
stations and the television broadcaster, Sianel
Pedwar Cymru (S4C), which has recently
been transmitting programmes in Welsh for
12 hours a day on its new digital channel.
Among many sporting activities, there is
particular interest in rugby union, w hich has
come to be regarded as the Welsh national
game. Association football is also popular in
Wales, and in May 2001 the Football
Association Cup Final was held at the
Millennium Stadium in Cardiff where it w ill
also be staged in 2002.

Census 2001: ‘count me in’
A Gigantic Exercise
Sunday 29 April 2001 was Census Day in the
United Kingdom. In the weeks running up to
the day itself, some 72,000 ‘enumerators’,
trained and supervised by about 8,600 census
managers, delivered census forms around
36 million—to every household and
communal establishment in the UK. The
processing of the returned forms began in
June, and the first results will be reported to
Parliament in December 2002.
The 2001 Census was organised by the Office
for National Statistics (ONS) in England and
Wales, the General Register Office for
Scotland (GROS) and the Northern Ireland
Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). The
cost of the whole exercise, at about £255
million, reflects the complexity of the
operation, the years of preparation needed to
ensure it goes smoothly (13 years from the
start of planning to when all the information is
published), the painstaking statistical analyses
of the results, and unexpected obstacles.1 It is
equivalent to less than £5 per person per year
spread over the 13-year cycle.
The Importance of the Census
As censuses only occur at ten-year intervals, a
decade of strategic planning and expenditure
relies on the information each one yields.
Today over £50 billion of public spending is
based on census information every year. The
answers to the questions on the form, mainl\
about what kind of people live in what type of
household, are used to allocate central
government funding to local authorities tor
the planning and delivery of local ser\ ices
such as education, health and transport. For
example, it is vitally important to know how
many older people and residents with health
problems or disabilities there are in a given
1 In 2001 special arrangements applied in parts of the
countryside to which access was restricted because of foot-and-
mouth disease (see p. 460). In these areas forms were delivered
by post or to a previously agreed point such as a farm boundary.
area, so that an adequate social support
structure can be put in place for them.
Equally, a local authority needs to be aware of
how many babies and children it has in its area
in order to provide the right number of
nursery places, schools, colleges and teachers.
The census provides highly detailed statistics
at a local level. No other source does this to
the same extent or so accurately. Furthermore,
it is easy to make comparisons between areas
because the census asks the same questions of
everybody at the same time,2 giving citizens a
chance to view a single snapshot of their entire
country. Nor is it just central and local
government that make practical use of the
information that emerges from the census.
Businesses can use it for their forward
planning; voluntary organisations that provide
social services are as reliant on it as
government; and it is a rich resource for
academics. The census has developed from its
comparatively simple origins into a
sophisticated tool for research and policy
implementation at many levels.
A Window onto the Past
As well as being itself a census year, 2001 was
the bicentenary of the first ‘modern census in
Britain. There had been forerunners of a
sort—a Gaelic version in Scotland in the 7th
century and the Domesday Book in England in
1086. But the census of 10 March 1801 was
the first in a series that has continued every
ten years to the present day, with the single
exception of 1941 which was cancelled because
of the Second World War.
Since 1801 the population of Great Britain has
increased around sixfold, while there are now
about 12 times as many households as 200
2 The only exceptions in 2001 were, in Wales, a question that
asked ‘Can you understand, speak, read, or write Welsh?’; and,
in Northern Ireland, more detailed questions on ‘religious
denomination or body’.
34
CENSUS 2001: ‘COUNT ME IN’
years ago. It was fears about the burgeoning
population that led to the Census Bill coming
before Parliament in 1800. Two years earlier,
Thomas Robert Malthus had published his
Essay on the Principle of Population, which
argued that population tended to grow at a
much faster rate than food supplies. A series
of bad harvests at the end of the 18th century
seemed to underline this gloomy thesis and
the consequent need to base plans for the
future on a firm statistical foundation.
The questions in successive censuses have thus
often reflected the social and economic concerns
of the day. Ironically, it was the decline in birth
rates, particularly among upper and middle
class families, that aroused anxiety a century
later. The 1911 Census therefore included a
question about the number of children born to
married women. Twenty years earlier a
question had been introduced on the number of
rooms in each household, in response to fears of
overcrowding in industrial cities. Already in the
1800s census information had enabled
government statisticians to demonstrate a link
between early death and certain occupational
groups, such as coal miners and tailors. In 1921
the census asked about ‘place of work’ for the
first time, as people moved out of cities to the
suburbs and began to travel more by bus and
train.
Over time the number of questions asked in
the census has steadily increased, as has their
level of detail. The 1801 Census was a simple
count of the number of people and their
houses, with a very broad idea of occupations.
In the early 1800s individual occupation was an
unfamiliar concept; the family was the
economic unit and family occupation was the
information sought. However, by the mid-
19th century detailed information on
individual occupations was available. In 1991
the value of ethnic monitoring was fully
understood, and a carefully worded question
on ethnicity was included for the first time in
Great Britain.
The 2001 Census
The 2001 Census was the first in the UK to
use the Internet. Extensive use was made for
publicity purposes and to give updates on
census developments; in due course, census
results will be available on the ONS, GROS
and NISRA websites. In other ways, too, it
was a ground-breaking exercise. For the first
time the main method of collection was the
post-back of completed forms in postage-paid
envelopes. The information is being scanned
directly from the forms onto computer and
stored on microfilm. The paper copies are
destroyed and the paper recycled. Census
questions were translated into 26 languages,
from Albanian to Vietnamese, and everyone in
Wales had the option of completing a Welsh
language version of the form. Versions were
also available in large print, Braille and on
audio tape. There was a helpline with a
dedicated minicom facility for people who are
deaf or hard of hearing and British Sign
Language interpreters were on hand if needed.
The 2001 Census included a question on time
spent caring for people with a long-term
physical illness or disability, people with a
mental health problem, or those experiencing
problems related to old age. This partly
reflected concerns about the ageing population
and new government initiatives designed to
support carers. Householders were required to
supply full details of the relationships of the
various people in the household, including
‘partners’ and step-relations—an
acknowledgement of recent changes in family
units and attitudes towards divorce,
separation, cohabitation and single
parenthood. The ethnic group question in
England, Wales and Scotland was extended to
reflect user requirements for more detailed
information about those from specific ethnic
groups or cultural backgrounds including
‘Black British’, ‘Asian British’, ‘Irish’ as well
as those of‘Mixed’ ethnic origin. In Northern
Ireland a basic question on ethnic group was
included for the first time. Altogether it was
the most comprehensive census yet in the UK.
Confidentiality
Census forms are kept closed for 100 years and
the information they contain is rigorously
protected by law. When statistical information
from censuses is published, no individual can

‘CensusAtSchool’
During October 2000 the largest survey of
7-16 year olds ever undertaken in the UK
produced responses via the Internet, from
59,391 pupils at over 350 schools in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Among these first findings of the ‘junior
census’ was confirmation that Manchester
United was the nation’s most popular
football team among this age-group,
especially English girls. Art emerged as the
favourite school subject (26%), followed
by PE/sport (23%) and mathematics
(9%). Nearly 60% of secondary pupils had
their own mobile telephone and 85% had
access to a home computer.3
be identified from it. Indeed, although the
census collects information from each person
and household in the country, its purpose is to
produce aggregate statistics and aid research
about the community as a whole and groups
within it, not individuals.
Census Poem
The Poet Laureate,4 Andrew Motion,
commemorated the 2001 Census with the
following poem. The opening reference to a
‘field full of folk’ is a quotation from the 700-
year-old poem ‘Piers Plowman’ by W illiam
Langland.
All of Us
Who would ever think
a field full of folk
meant wet eyes and lips
smattered among rose-hips,
and bright shining faces
bobbing in silver grasses?
No, our sense of folk
comes in stadium-hulks,
with steamrollering chants
of implacable want.
But it’s all the same.
As we shuttle through time
we might or might not
change skin-colour, forget
history, love God
or prefer ourselves instead.
The question of who we are
still goes on before—
A bow-wave we watch
creaming, but cannot catch.
Or so I thought, at least,
that grey day on the coast
I strode off with my Dad
Along a sand-spine made
by wind fighting waves,
him near the end of his life,
me in the middle. Our shoes
gave that definite soft kiss
of people leaving their mark,
but when I looked back
the tide had swallowed us both.
That is the truth.

The United Kingdom’s system of government is known as a constitutional
monarchy, though its constitution is not contained in any one document;
instead it has evolved over many years. Ministers of the Crown govern in the
name of the Sovereign, who is both head of state and head of the government.
The Queen’s succession to the throne can be traced back for more than a
thousand years and the Westminster Parliament is one of the oldest
representative assemblies in the world.
In the General Election held in June 2001, the Labour Party was returned to
office the first time it has been elected with sufficient MPs to govern for a
second full five-year period. The Government intends to take forward its long¬
term programme of decentralising power, opening up government and
reforming Parliament.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland now govern their own domestic affairs
and London now has a Mayor and an elected city-wide authority. Following the
General Election, a number of major departmental changes were made, aimed
at giving a sharper focus to the Government’s priorities and at delivering better
public services.
The Constitution
The United Kingdom does not have a ‘written
constitution’ set out in any one document.
Instead, the relationship between the State
and the people relies on statute law, common
law and conventions.1
1 Conventions are rules and practices which are not legally
enforceable but which are regarded as indispensable to the
working of government.
The UK Parliament is the legislature and
the highest authority in the land. The
executive comprises the Government
(members of the Cabinet and other
ministers responsible for policies);
government departments and agencies, in
charge of domestic matters in England and
UK-wide issues such as defence and
monetary policy; local authorities, which look
after many local services; public corporations,
charged with running certain nationalised
37
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
industries; independent bodies which regulate
the privatised industries; and other bodies
subject to ministerial control.
The judiciary (see chapter 14) determines
common law and interprets statutes.
Origins of Government
Each of the countries which form the United
Kingdom—England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland—has its own distinct
culture and history. England was united as a
kingdom over a thousand years ago (see
p. 7), and Wales became part of that kingdom
during the reign of King Elenry VIII (see
p. 28). The thrones of England and Scotland
were united in 1603, and in 1707 the English
and Scottish Parliaments passed laws creating
a single Parliament for Great Britain with
ultimate authority over England, Wales and
Scotland (see p. 23).
Ireland had links with the kingdom of
England from the 13th century, and in 1801 the
creation of the United Kingdom was completed
when the Irish Parliament joined that of Great
Britain (see p. 15). In 1920, the six counties of
what is now Northern Ireland voted to remain
within the United Kingdom and were given
their own subordinate Parliament, while the 26
counties in the south of Ireland (now the Irish
Republic) became, in 1922, an entirely separate
and self-governing country.
Despite the recent establishment of the
devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland (see below), the UK
Parliament in Westminster still has an elected
chamber including members from English,
Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish
constituencies, and continues to have the
supreme authority for government and law¬
making in the UK as a whole (see p. 52).
Administration of Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Irish Affairs
Following devolution, the responsibilities of
the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland changed considerably.
They are responsible for ensuring that the
reserved interests of the countries they
represent are properly considered in central
government; and for leading the presentation
of government policy. When necessary, they
bring forward primary legislation for their
part of the UK, although in Scotland and
Northern Ireland this occurs much less often
than in the past as much primary legislation is
dealt with in the devolved parliaments. Much
of their previous administrative role is also
now devolved. The main new function of
these UK Cabinet members following
devolution is to see that the devolution
settlements work satisfactorily.
Background to Devolution
Referendums held in Scotland and Wales in
1997 backed proposals to devolve power from
the Parliament at Westminster to a Scottish
Parliament (see p. 24) and a National
Assembly for Wales (see p. 30). Laws were
passed in 1998 to set up these institutions, and
elections were held in May 1999. Both bodies
became fully operational in July 1999.
In Northern Ireland, the political settlement
reached in April 1998 under the Belfast (Good
Friday) Agreement led to a referendum
endorsing its proposals, and elections to a
Northern Ireland Assembly were held in June
(see p. 16). The Assembly first took up its
devolved powers in December 1999, although it
was temporarily suspended between February
and May 2000 (see p. 17).
Major differences exist in how the devolved
institutions operate, reflecting the very
different historical and administrative
circumstances in each. The Scottish
Parliament may make primary legislation for
matters within its competence and it has
defined and limited financial authority to \ar\
tax revenue. It has control over most Scottish
domestic matters, including health, education,
justice, local transport, agriculture and the
environment and scrutinises the Scottish
Executive, the devolved government for
Scotland. The National Assembly for Wales
has secondary legislative powers and can
reform and direct the Welsh public bodies for
which it is responsible. It oversees a similar
range of policy areas to those of the Scottish
Parliament, the main difference being that
policing and justice matters in W ales remain
the responsibility of the UK Government. The
Northern Ireland Assembly is also in charge of

The UK Government’s overall
responsibility for economic and monetary
policy, employment, overseas affairs, defence
and national security remains unchanged.
The Monarchy
The Monarchy is the oldest institution of
government. Queen Elizabeth II is directly
39
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
descended from King Egbert, who united
England under his rule in 829. The only
interruption in the history of the Monarchy
was during the short-lived republic, which
lasted from 1649 to 1660.
The Queen’s title in the UK is: ‘Elizabeth
the Second, by the Grace of God of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms
and Territories Queen, Head of the
Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith .
In the Channel Islands and the Isle of
Man the Queen is represented by a
Lieutenant-Governor.
The Commonwealth and UK Overseas
Territories
In addition to being queen of the United
Kingdom, the Queen is also Head of State of
15 other realms and all of the Commonwealth
countries.2 In each of these the Queen is
represented by a Governor-General,
appointed by her on the advice of the
ministers of the country concerned and
independent of the British Government.
In UK Overseas Territories (see p. 79) the
Queen is usually represented by governors,
who are responsible to the British
Government for the administration of the
countries in which they serve.
Succession, Accession and Coronation
The title to the Crown comes partly from
statute and partly from common law rules of
descent. Despite interruptions in the direct
line of succession, inheritance has always been
the principle upon which the Monarchy has
passed down the generations. Sons of the
Sovereign still come before daughters in
succeeding to the throne. When a daughter
succeeds, she becomes Queen Regnant, and
has the same powers as a king. The ‘consort’
of a king takes her husband’s rank and style,
becoming Queen. The constitution does not
2 The other Commonwealth states of which the Queen is
Sovereign are: Antigua and Barbuda; Australia; the Bahamas;
Barbados; Belize; Canada; Grenada; Jamaica; New Zealand;
Papua New Guinea; St Kitts and Nevis; St Lucia; St Vincent and
the Grenadines; Solomon Islands; and Tuvalu.
give any special rank or privileges to the
husband of a Queen Regnant.
Under the Act of Settlement of 1700, only
Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia, the
Electress of Hanover (a granddaughter of
James I of England and VI of Scotland), are
eligible to succeed. The order of succession to
the throne (see Figure 6.1) can be altered only
by common consent of the countries of the
Commonwealth of which the Monarch is
Sovereign.
The Sovereign succeeds to the throne as
soon as his or her predecessor dies: there is no
interval without a ruler. He or she is at once
proclaimed at an Accession Council, to which
all members of the Privy Council (see p. 42)
are called. Members of the House of Lords
(see p. 44), the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and
other leading citizens of the City of London
are also invited.
The Sovereign’s coronation follows the
accession. The ceremony takes place at
Westminster Abbey in London, in the
presence of representatives of both Houses of
Parliament and all the major public
organisations in the UK. The Prime Ministers
and leading members of the Commonwealth
nations and representatives of other countries
also attend.
The Monarch’s Role in Government
In law, the Queen is head of the executive; an
integral part of the legislature; head of the
judiciary; the commander-in-chief of all the
armed forces of the Crown; and the supreme
governor’ of the established Church of
England. As a result of a long process of
change, during which the Monarchy’s
absolute power has been gradually reduced,
the Queen acts on the advice of her
government ministers. 4 he UK is therefore
governed by Her Majesty s Government in
the name of the Queen.
Within this framework the Queen still takes
part in some important acts of government.
These include summoning, proroguing
(discontinuing until the next session without
dissolution) and dissolving Parliament; and
giving Royal Assent to Bills passed by the UK
or Scottish Parliament and the Northern
Ireland Assembly. The Queen formally
40
6: GOVERNMENT
appoints important office holders, including
the Prime Minister and other government
ministers (see p. 58), judges, officers in the
armed forces, governors, diplomats, bishops
and some other senior clergy of the Church of
England. In instances where people have been
wrongly convicted of crimes, she is involved in
pardoning them. She also confers peerages,
knighthoods and other honours.3 In
international affairs the Queen, as Head of
State, has the power to declare war and make
peace, to recognise foreign states, to conclude
treaties and to take over or give up territory.
With very few exceptions (such as
appointing the Prime Minister), acts involving
the use of ‘royal prerogative’ powers are now
performed by government ministers, who are
responsible to Parliament and can be
questioned about particular policies. It is not
necessary to have Parliament’s authority to
exercise these prerogative powers, although
Parliament may restrict or abolish such rights.
The Queen holds Privy Council meetings
(see p. 42), gives audiences to her ministers
and officials in the CK and overseas, receives
accounts of Cabinet decisions, reads
dispatches and signs state papers. She is
consulted on many aspects of national life, and
must show complete impartiality.
The law states that a regent has to be
appointed to perform the royal functions if the
monarch is totally incapacitated. The regent
would be the Queen’s eldest son, the Prince of
\\ ales, then those aged 18 or over, in order of
succession to the throne. In the event of her
partial incapacity or absence abroad, the
Queen may delegate certain royal functions to
the Counsellors of State (her husband the
Duke of Edinburgh, the four adults next in
line of succession, and the Queen Mother).
However, Counsellors of State may not
dissolve Parliament (except on the Queen’s
instructions) or create peers.
Royal Income and Expenditure
Public funds (known as the ‘Civil List’) and
government departments together meet the
3 Although most honours are conferred by the Queen on the
advice of the Prime Minister, a few are granted by her
personally—the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle,
the Order of Merit and the Royal Victorian Order.
costs of the Queen’s official duties. In
2000-01, expenditure on royal travel was
£5.4 million, and £16.4 million was spent on
the upkeep of the royal palaces and on media
and information services.
In July 2000 a Royal Trustees’ Report
recommended that Civil List payments should
remain at the 1991 level of £7.9 million a year
for a further ten years from 2001. About
three-quarters of the Queen’s Civil List
provision is needed to meet the cost of staff.
Under the Civil List, the Queen Mother and
the Duke of Edinburgh receive annual
parliamentary allowances (together amounting
to £1 million) to enable them to carry out their
public duties. In return for the Civil List and
other financial support, the Queen surrenders
the income from the Crown Estate (£147.7
million in 2000-01) and other hereditary
revenues to the nation. The Prince of Wales
does not receive a parliamentary allowance,
since as Duke of Cornwall he is entitled to the
annual net revenues of the estate of the Duchy
of Cornwall.
The Queen’s private expenditure as
Sovereign comes from the Privy Purse, which
is financed mainly from the revenues of the
Duchy of Lancaster;4 her expenditure as a
private individual is met from her own
personal resources.
Since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid
income tax on all personal income and on that
part of the Privy Purse income which is used
for private purposes. The Queen also pays tax
on any realised capital gains on her private
investments and on the private proportion of
assets in the Privy Purse. In line with this, the
Prince of Wales pays tax on the income from
the Duchy of Cornwall so far as it is used for
private purposes.
In July 2001 the Lord Chamberlain, the
most senior member of the Queen’s
Household, published revised guidelines
setting out how members of the Royal Family
could pursue careers, including those in
business, in a way which would avoid
allegations of exploitation of royal status.
4 The Duchy of Lancaster is a landed estate which has been held
in trust for the Sovereign since 1399. It is kept quite apart from
his or her other possessions and is separately administered by
the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
41
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
A New Great Seal of the Realm
In February 2001, the Queen approved the
commissioning of a new Great Seal of the
Realm to replace the existing one which
had been in service since 1953 and is
showing considerable signs of wear.
The Great Seal of the Realm dates back
to the 11th century, originating in the
reign of Edward the Confessor who used it
to prevent forgeries of his royal
proclamations by rebellious barons. Today
it is kept in the House of Lords in the care
of the Lord Chancellor and is used on
State documents such as those approving
treaties, permitting general elections,
proclaiming royal marriages and
appointing bishops.
Previous Great Seals commissioned
include those of: Victoria (1838, 1860,
1878 and 1898); Edward VII (1904);
George V (1912 and 1930); and George VI
(1938 and 1948).
From now on, before a member of the Royal
Family takes on a new business activity, he or
she must ensure that the Lord Chamberlain
has been consulted, and the Lord
Chamberlain would be expected to advise
against accepting an invitation to an
engagement which could not be kept entirely
separate from any aspects of the business
activities of the member of the Royal Family
concerned.
The Privy Council
The Privy Council was formerly the chief
source of executive power in the State; its
origins go back to the King’s Court, which
helped the Norman monarchs run the
government. As the system of Cabinet
government developed in the 18th century,
the Cabinet (which is still, technically, a
committee of Privy Counsellors) took on
much of the role of the Privy Council.
Nowadays the Privy Council is the main
way in which ministers advise the Queen on
the approval of Orders in Council (such as
those granting Royal Charters or enacting
subordinate legislation) or the issue of royal
proclamations (such as the summoning or
dissolving of Parliament).
At any one time there are about 500 Privy
Counsellors (who may add the words ‘Right
Honourable’ before their names). Their
appointment is for life. 4 he Privy Council
consists of all members of the Cabinet, other
senior politicians, senior judges and some
individuals from the Commonwealth. It is
only members of the government of the day,
however, who play any part in its policy work.
The Prime Minister recommends membership
of the Privy Council to the Sovereign.
Committees of the Privy Council
There are a number of Privy Council
committees, normally comprising ministers
with the relevant policy interest, such as those
dealing with legislation from the Channel
Islands and the Isle of Man. Except for the
Judicial Committee, membership is confined
to members of the current administration.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council is the final court of appeal from courts
in UK Overseas Territories and those
Commonwealth countries which decided to
keep this method of appeal after their
independence. In addition, the Committee
hears appeals from the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man, and from the disciplinary and
health committees of the medical and
associated professions. It is also the Supreme
Court for determining cases relating to the
powers and actions of the devolved
administrations, and has a limited jurisdiction
to hear certain ecclesiastical appeals. Members
of the Judicial Committee include the Lord
Chancellor, the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
other Privy Counsellors who hold or have held
high judicial office and certain judges from the
Commonwealth.
The secretariat of the Privy Council is the
Privy Council Office, a government
department of which the President of the
Council, a Cabinet minister, is in charge.

The 2001 General Election on 7 June was the 16th to be held since
the end of the Second World War. Parliament was dissolved
on 14 May and, in line with an ancient tradition dating back
to the 15th century, this was announced in the City of London by
its ‘Common Cryer and Serjeant-at-Arms’, Richard Martin (left).
During the election period the three main party leaders travelled
widely throughout the United Kingdom, campaigning with their
respective party candidates and meeting the electorate. For the First
time a series of special party leader ‘Question Time’ election debates
was broadcast on television. Each leader answered questions put by
the general public (see next page).
A number of independent parties stood in the election. Among them
was the Official Monster Raving Loony Party, which was established in 1983 and has
campaigned in every General Election since then. Alan Hope is the party’s current leader.
On election day, voters arrived at their local polling stations, some in unusual locations.
Around 45,000 polling stations were open throughout the UK, each closing at 10pm.
The votes were counted by hand and most results were announced during the night.
Tony Blair was congratulated on his election victory in a personal telephone call on 8 June
by Opposition leader William Hague. Britain’s re-elected Prime Minister-the first Labour
Prime Minister to win a second consecutive full term of office-travelled from his Sedgefield
constituency to London. He thanked his colleagues outside the party’s headquarters and
addressed members of the waiting media. The new Parliament met on 13 June, when the first
business was the election of the Speaker and the swearing in of its new members.
On 20 June the State Opening of Parliament took place. The Queen’s Speech outlined the new
Labour Government’s legislative programme.
Following the election William Hague announced his resignation as leader of the Conservative Party,
lain Duncan Smith was elected as his successor in September 2001.

6: GOVERNMENT
extra resources were needed for an emergency,
such as going to war, the Sovereign would try
to persuade his barons in the Great Council—
a gathering of leading men which met several
times a year—to offer help. During the 13th
century several English kings found their own
private revenue, together with aid from the
barons, insufficient to meet the expenses of
government. They therefore called not only
their land-owning barons to the Great Council
but also representatives of counties, cities and
towns, mainly to get them to agree to
additional taxation. In this way the Great
Council came to include those who were
summoned by name (who, broadly speaking,
were later to form the House of Lords) and
those who were representatives of
communities—the Commons. These two
groups, together with the Sovereign, became
known as ‘Parliament’—a term originally
meaning a meeting for parley or discussion.
By the middle of the 14th century the
phrase ‘by the Commons with the advice of
the Lords Spiritual and Temporal’ on
enactment of a Bill signalled Parliament’s
agreement to the ‘voting of supplies to the
Crown’—that is, approval for the
Government to spend money on a particular
project. In 1407 Henry IV pledged that the
House of Commons should approve all money
grants before consideration by the Lords.
There was a similar development in the
way laws were made. Originally the King’s
legislation needed only the agreement of his
councillors, but, starting with the right of
individuals to present petitions, the Commons
was eventually allowed to appeal to the Crown
on behalf of groups of people. During the 15th
century they won the right to take part in the
process of giving their requests—or ‘Bills’—
the form of law.
These were the foundations on which the
House of Commons developed its power,
while the constitutional changes of the 17th
century led to Parliament gaining its position
as the supreme legislative authority.
The Powers of Parliament
The three parts of Parliament—the Sovereign,
the appointed House of Lords and the elected
House of Commons—are based on different
principles. They meet together only on
occasions of symbolic significance such as the
State Opening of Parliament, when the
Commons is summoned by the Sovereign to
the House of Lords. The agreement of all
three is normally needed to pass laws, but that
of the Sovereign is given as a matter of course.
Despite devolution, Parliament at
Westminster can legislate for the UK as a
whole and keeps powers to legislate for any
parts of it separately. However, by convention
it will not normally legislate on devolved
matters without the agreement of the Scottish
Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Irish
Assemblies. It still has responsibility for
certain matters (see p. 38) under the Acts of
Parliament which set up these
administrations. In the Channel Islands and
the Isle of Man, which are Crown
dependencies and not part of the UK,
legislation on domestic matters normally takes
the form of laws enacted by Island
legislatures. However, UK laws are
sometimes extended to the Islands, with their
agreement, for example in areas such as
immigration and broadcasting.
As there are no legal restraints imposed by a
written constitution, Parliament may legislate
as it pleases, as long as the UK meets its
obligations as a member of the European
Union (EU—see p. 72). It can make or change
law, and overturn established conventions or
turn them into law. It can even legislate to
prolong its own life beyond the normal period
without consulting the electorate.
In practice, however, Parliament does not
assert itself in this way. Its members work
within the common law and normally act
according to precedent. The House of
Commons is directly responsible to the
electorate, and, increasingly during the 20th
century, the House of Lords recognised the
supremacy of the elected chamber.
The Functions of Parliament
The main functions of Parliament are:
> to pass laws;
> to provide (by voting for taxation) the
means of carrying on the work of
government;
43
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
> to scrutinise government policy and
administration, including proposals for
expenditure; and
> to debate the major issues of the day.
In carrying these out, Parliament helps to
bring the relevant facts and issues to the
attention of the electorate. By custom,
Parliament is also informed before important
international treaties and agreements are
ratified. The making of treaties is, however, a
royal prerogative carried out on the advice of
the Government and does not need
parliamentary approval.
The Meeting of Parliament
A Parliament has a maximum duration of five
years, but not all Parliaments serve their full
five-year term. The maximum life has been
prolonged by legislation only in rare
circumstances such as the two World Wars.
The Sovereign dissolves Parliament and calls
for a General Election on the advice of the
Prime Minister.
The life of a Westminster Parliament is
divided into sessions. Each usually lasts for
one year—normally beginning and ending in
October or November. There are
‘adjournments’ (when the House does not sit)
at night, at weekends, at Christmas, Easter
and the late Spring Bank Holiday, and during
a long summer break usually starting in late
July. The average number of‘sitting days’ in a
session is about 148 in the House of Commons
and about 152 in the House of Lords.5 At the
start of each session the Sovereign’s speech to
Parliament outlines the Government’s policies
and proposed legislative programme. Each
session is ended by the Sovereign dismissing
it—called ‘prorogation’. Parliament then
‘stands prorogued’ for a few days until the
new session begins. Prorogation brings to an
end nearly all parliamentary business: in
particular, public Bills which have not been
passed by the end of the session are lost,
unless the Opposition has agreed they may be
carried over.
5 Taken over the last seven sessions. This includes two ‘short’
sessions in the election years of 1997 (1996-97, 79 days) and
2001 (2000-01,83 daysj and the ‘long’ session in 1997-98
(228 days).
The House of Lords
Reform
The Government has begun a step-by-step
reform of the House of Lords aimed at making
the second chamber more representative of
British society at the start of the 21st century.
As part of this process, in November 1999 the
Government passed legislation to reduce the
number of hereditary peers who had the right
to sit and vote in the second chamber from
over 750 to 92 (see below).
In May 2000 the Government set up the
House of Lords Appointments Commission to
make recommendations on the appointment of
non-political peers (including ‘people’s
peers’—see p. 46). It has taken over the role
previously played by the Political Honours
Scrutiny Committee. The Commission is an
independent body responsible for vetting all
nominations to the Sovereign for membership
of the House of Lords to ensure they meet the
highest standards of propriety. (Party-
nominated peerages are usually given in
recognition of service in politics or other walks
of public life or because one of the political
parties wants to have that particular person to
speak in support of its policies in the House of
Lords.)
After winning its second consecutive term
of office in June 2001, the Government
announced its intention to consult and then
introduce legislation to implement the next
phase of House of Lords reform which would
remove the remaining hereditary peers and
create a partly elected upper house.
Current Composition
The House of Lords consists of the Lords
Spiritual and the Lords Temporal. The Lords
Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury
and York, the Bishops of London, Durham
and Winchester, and the 21 next most senior
bishops of the Church of England. The
present Lords Temporal consist of:
> 92 hereditary peers, who were selected to
sit in the chamber by ballot from among
the membership of the House of Lords
before November 1999;

The three main political parties are
represented in the House of Lords; the

shown in Table 6.2.
Members of the House of Lords receive no
salary for their parliamentary work, but can
claim for expenses incurred in attending the
House (for which there are maximum daily
rates) and certain travelling expenses. Average
daily attendance is about 352 Members.
Officers of the House of Lords
The House is presided over by the Lord
Chancellor, who sits on the woolsack7 and acts
as Speaker of the House. If the Lord
Chancellor is not present, a nominated deputy
takes his place.
As Clerk of the House of Lords, the Clerk
of the Parliaments is responsible for the
records of proceedings of the House of Lords

Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal, is the final court of appeal in
criminal cases.

with wool from several Commonwealth countries; it is a
tradition dating from the medieval period, when wool was the
chief source of the country’s wealth.
and for the text of Acts of the UK Parliament.
The postholder is the accounting officer for
the House, and is in charge of its
administrative staff, known as the Parliament
Office. The Gentleman Usher of the Black
Rod, usually known simply as ‘Black Rod’, is
responsible for security, accommodation and
services in the House of Lords’ part of the
Palace of Westminster.
The House of Commons
The House of Commons consists of 659
elected Members of Parliament (MPs). In July
2001 there were 118 women MPs and 12 MPs
w ho had declared that they were of ethnic
minority origin. Of the 659 seats, 529
represent constituencies in England, 40 in
Wales, 72 in Scotland, and 18 in Northern
Ireland. The Scotland Act 1998, which set up
the Scottish Parliament, abolishes the
statutory minimum of 71 Scottish seats, and
provides that, at the next review of boundaries
in Scotland, the electoral quota for England
will be applied. This is expected to reduce the
number of Scottish seats to around 57 to 60.
The Boundary Commission for Scotland is
next due to report between 2002 and 2006. It
began its work on this review in June 2001.
General Elections are held after a
Parliament has been dissolved and a new one
summoned by the Sovereign. When an MP
dies, resigns8 or is given a peerage, a

membership of the House of Commons.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
‘People’s Peers’
In its first term of office, the Government
announced that it wanted the House of
Lords to be more representative of the
country as a whole and that a small
number of non-party appointments would
be made from public nominees. Anyone in
the UK would be able to nominate himself
or herself, or nominate another person.
In September 2000, the House of Lords
Appointments Commission (see p. 44)
invited nominations for these ‘people’s
peers’, who would need to demonstrate
that they were people with integrity and
independence, and had a significant record
of achievement in their chosen field or way
of life.
In April 2001 the Queen announced her
intention to bestow non-political life
peerages on the 15 people nominated by
the House of Lords Appointments
Commission. They were selected from a
total of 3,166 applications on the basis that
they would bring considerable experience
and authority to the House, adding to the
range of expertise available in a number of
areas, including science, social policy,
housing, employment, education, business
and international affairs.
by-election takes place. Members are paid an
annual salary of £51,822 (from July 2001) and,
under a new system that took effect from July
2001, provision for up to £70,000 for staff
salaries and £18,000 for incidental expenses.
(For ministers’ salaries see p. 59.) All MPs are
entitled to travel allowances and London
members may claim a supplement for the
higher cost of living in the capital. MPs from
other parts of the UK may receive allowances
for subsistence and for second homes nearer
to the Palace of Westminster.
Officers of the House of Commons
The chief officer of the House of Commons is
the Speaker, elected by MPs to preside over
the House. Other officers include the
Chairman of Ways and Means and two deputy
chairmen, who may all act as Deputy
Speakers. They are elected by the House as
nominees of the Government, but may come
from the Opposition as well as the
government party. They, like the Speaker,
neither speak nor vote except in their official
capacity (that is, when deputising for the
Speaker). The House of Commons
Commission, a statutory body chaired by the
Speaker, is responsible for the administration
of the House.
Permanent officers (who are not MPs)
include the Clerk of the House of Commons—
the principal adviser to the Speaker on the
House’s privileges and procedures. The Clerk’s
other responsibilities relate to the conduct of
the business of the House and its committees.
The Clerk is also accounting officer for the
House. The Serjeant at Arms, who waits upon
the Speaker, carries out certain orders of the
House. The postholder is also the official
housekeeper of the Commons’ part of the
building, and is responsible for security. Other
officers serve the House in the Library, the
Department of the Official Report {Hansard),
the Finance and Administration Department,
and the Refreshment Department.
Parliamentary Electoral System
For electoral purposes the UK is divided into
659 constituencies, each of which returns one
member to the House of Commons. 4 o
ensure that constituency electorates are kept
roughly equal, four permanent Parliamentary
Boundary Commissions, one each for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, keep constituencies under review.
(When the Parliamentary Boundary
Commissions’ latest reviews have been
completed, the Commissions will be absorbed
by the independent Electoral Commission—
see p. 49.) They recommend any adjustment
of seats that may seem necessary in the light of
population movements or other changes.
Reviews are conducted every 8 to 12 years.
The recommendations in the Commissions’
last general reviews were approved by
Parliament in 1995. The Parliamentary
Boundary Commissions for England and
Scotland have begun general reviews and aim
to produce reports by the end of 2005.

corrupt or illegal election practices. Members
of the armed forces, Crown servants and staff
of the British Council employed overseas
(together with their wives or husbands if
accompanying them) may be registered for an
address in the constituency where they would
live if not serving abroad. British citizens
living abroad may apply to register as electors
for a period of up to 20 years after they have
left the UK.
Voting Procedures
Each elector may cast one vote, normally in
person at a polling station. However, new
measures which help to modernise voting and
registration procedures for UK elections were
introduced under the Representation of the
People Act 2000 and implemented for the
General Election held in June 2001. Provisions
in the new Act include:
> the right for electors to cast their vote by
post if they find that method more
convenient;
> a new rolling register, updated monthly,
to enable voters to register at any time of
the year, replacing the one which was
previously updated once a year in
October and took effect the following
February;
> local authority pilot schemes to evaluate
innovative electoral procedures, such as
electronic voting, all-postal ballots, early
and weekend voting, and mobile polling
stations;
> improved access and facilities for
disabled voters, including a large print
version of the ballot paper and a template
for blind and partially sighted voters; and
> easier registration for homeless people
(who were previously barred from voting
because they had no fixed address), those
in mental institutions (other than those
who are held there because of criminal
behaviour) and unconvicted or remand
prisoners (if they are likely to be
spending a long period in custody).
Voting is not compulsory and the simple
majority system of voting is currently used for
UK General Elections. Candidates are elected
if they have more votes than any of the other
candidates (although not necessarily an
absolute majority over all other candidates).
The Government is reviewing whether there
should be changes to the voting system for the
House of Commons.
Candidates
British citizens and citizens of other
Commonwealth countries, together with
citizens of the Irish Republic, may stand for
election as MPs provided they are aged 21 or
over and are not disqualified. Those
disqualified include undischarged bankrupts;
people who have been sentenced to more than
one year’s imprisonment; peers; and holders of
certain offices listed in the House of
Commons Disqualification Act 1975.
The statutory provisions which formerly
barred ministers of religion from becoming
MPs were repealed by the House of Commons
(Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Act
2001. The new Act enables all former and
serving clergy to stand for election to the
House of Commons, but bishops sitting in the
House of Lords as Lords Spiritual continue to
be ineligible to serve as MPs because they
already have a voice in the upper chamber.
A candidate’s nomination for election must
be proposed and seconded by two electors
registered as voters in the constituency and
signed by eight other electors. Candidates do
not have to be backed by a political party.
47
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
A candidate must also deposit £500, which is
returned if he or she receives 5% or more of
the votes cast.
The maximum sum a candidate may spend
on a General Election campaign is £5,483 plus
4.6 pence for each elector in a borough
constituency, or 6.2 pence for each elector in
a county constituency. A higher limit of
£100,000 has been set for by-elections because
they are often seen as tests of national opinion
in the period between General Elections.
A candidate may send by post an election
communication to each elector in the
constituency free of charge. All election
expenses, apart from the candidate’s personal
expenses, are subject to the statutory
maximum.
The Political Party System
The party system, which has existed in one
form or another since the 18th century, is
integral to the working of the constitution.
The present system depends upon there being
organised political parties, each of which
presents its policies to the electorate for
approval; in practice most candidates in
elections, and almost all winning candidates,
belong to one of the main parties. A system of
voluntary registration for political parties in
the UK was introduced in 1998. Registered
parties contest elections to the Scottish
Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales
and the European Parliament (see p. 73) in
their own right using ‘lists’ of candidates.
Registration helps prevent the use of
misleading descriptions on ballot papers, since
only candidates representing a registered
political party are permitted to have the name
and emblem of the party printed alongside
their names.
For the last 150 years Britain has had a
predominantly two-party system. Since 1945
either the Conservative Party, whose origins
go back to the 18th century, or the Labour
Party, which emerged in the last decade of the
19th century, has held power. The Liberal
Democrats were formed in 1988 when the
Liberal Party, which also traced its origins to
the 18th century, merged with the Social
Democratic Party, formed in 1981. Other
parties include two national parties, Plaid
Cymru (founded in Wales in 1925) and the
Scottish National Party (founded in 1934).
Northern Ireland has a number of parties.
They include the Ulster Unionist Party,
formed in the early part of the 20th century;
the Democratic Unionist Party, founded in
1971 by a group which broke away from the
Ulster Unionists; the Social Democratic and
Labour Party, founded in 1970; and Sinn
Fein.9
Since 1945 the Conservative Party and
Labour Party have each won eight General
Elections.
The party which wins most seats (although
not necessarily the most votes) at a General
Election, or which has the support of a
majority of members in the House of
Commons, usually becomes the Government.
By tradition, the Sovereign asks the leader of
the party with the majority to form a
government, about 100 of whose members in
the House of Commons and the House of
Lords receive ministerial appointments
(including appointment to the Cabinet—see
p. 59) on the advice of the Prime Minister.
The largest minority party becomes the
official Opposition, with its own leader and
‘shadow cabinet’.
The Party System in Parliament
Leaders of the Government and Opposition
sit on the front benches in the debating
chamber of the House of Commons with their
supporters (‘the backbenchers’) sitting behind
them. There are similar seating arrangements
for the parties in the House of Lords, but
many peers do not wish to be associated with
any political party, and therefore choose to sit
on the ‘cross-benches’.
The effectiveness of the party system in
Parliament relies to a large extent on the
relationship between the Government and the
opposition parties. Depending on the relative
strengths of the parties in the House of
Commons, the Opposition may try to
overthrow the Government by defeating it on
a ‘matter of confidence’ vote. In general,
however, the Opposition aims to contribute to
9 Sinn Fein is the political wing of the IRA (see p. 15).

The General Election of 7 June 2001
The June 2001 General Election was
notable in a number of ways:
> Of a total electorate of 44.4 million
people, 26.4 million voted. This
represented a turnout of 59.4%,
compared with 72% in 1997, and was
the lowest for over 80 years. The
turnout for England was 59.1%,
Wales 61.4%, Scotland 58.1% and
Northern Ireland 68.0%.
> There was a relatively small change in
seats (see Table 6.3) compared with
the 1997 election. For example, only
one of the 72 seats in Scotland
changed hands and two of the 40 in
Wales. (In Northern Ireland, however,
several seats changed hands.)
> The Labour Party won its second
highest number of seats (its highest
being in the 1997 election). It was also
the first time that it had been elected
with sufficient MPs to govern for a
second full five-year period.
> The Liberal Democrats improved
their showing and gained their highest
number of seats.
> The Conservatives restored their
presence in Scotland but still have no
MPs in Wales.
the formulation of policy and legislation by
constructive criticism; to oppose government
proposals with which it disagrees; to table
amendments to Government Bills; and to put
forward its own policies to improve its
chances of winning the next General Election.
The Government Chief Whips in the
Commons and the Lords, in consultation with
their Opposition counterparts, arrange the
scheduling of government business; they do so
under the direction of the Prime Minister and
the Leaders of the two Houses. Collectively,
the Chief Whips are often referred to as ‘the
usual channels’ w hen the question of finding
time for a particular item of business is being
discussed. The Leaders of the two Houses
control the running of business in their
respective parts of the Palace of Westminster.
The Chief Whips and their assistants, who
are usually chosen by the party leaders,
manage their parliamentary parties. Their
duties include keeping members informed of
forthcoming parliamentary business,
maintaining the party’s voting strength by
ensuring members attend important debates,
and passing on to the party leadership the
opinions of backbench members. Party
discipline tends to be not as strong in the
Lords as in the Commons, since peers have
less hope of high office and no need of partv
support in elections.
Financial Assistance to Parties
The Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 contains provisions to
make party funding more open, control
spending on elections and ensure the fair
conduct of referendums. It implements the
recommendations in the Committee on
Standards in Public Life’s report The Funding
of Political Parties in the UK, published in
1998. The Act’s provisions are being
introduced in stages (see below).
In November 2000 a new' independent
Electoral Commission was set up under the
Act to supervise the financial restrictions on
parties and oversee referendums. In due
course it will take over the functions of the
Parliamentary Boundary Commission and the
Local Government Boundary Commissions
(see p. 46) and has broad responsibility for
electoral law'.
Donations
> Since February 2001, political parties
may only accept donations from
‘permissible donors’: individuals on the
UK electoral register, registered
companies incorporated in the EU which
do business in the UK, registered
political parties and trade unions. Any
political donation of over £200 to a party
must be from a permissible donor;
> all donations of over £5,000 to a political
party’s central organisation must be
reported to the Electoral Commission on
a quarterly basis—weekly during a
General Election campaign;

Election, with £0.5 million for other

local items during an election period has
been subject to new codes of practice
drawn up by the BBC and independent
broadcasting authorities, taking into
account the views of the Electoral
Commission.
Donations to Candidates
> New, tighter controls on donations to
candidates came into force in July 2001,
along with other measures under the
Representation of the People Act 2000
designed to clarify the controls on
election expenses.
Electoral Education
> The Electoral Commission has been
responsible for education about electoral
and democratic systems since July 2001.
Parliamentary Procedure
Parliamentary procedure is largely based on the
way things have been done in the past, partlv set
down by each House in a code of practice
known as its ‘Standing Orders’. The debating
system is similar in both Houses. Every subject
starts off as a proposal or ‘motion’ by a member.
After debate, in which each member (except the
person putting forward the motion) may speak
only once, the motion may be withdrawn: if it is
not, the Speaker or Chairman ‘puts the
question’ whether to agree to the motion or not.
The question may be decided without voting, or
by a simple majority vote. The main difference
between the two Houses is that in the House of
Lords the Lord Chancellor, in his role as
Speaker, or a deputising Chairman, does not
control procedure; instead such matters are
decided by the general feeling of the House,
which is sometimes interpreted by its Leader.
In the Commons the Speaker has full
authority to enforce the rules of the House and
must uphold procedure and protect minority
rights. The Speaker may or may not allow a
motion to end discussion so that a matter may
be put to the vote, and has powers to stop
irrelevant and repetitious contributions in
debate. In cases of serious disorder the
Speaker can adjourn or suspend the sitting.
The Speaker may order members who have
broken the rules of behaviour of the House to
leave the Chamber or can suspend them for a
number of days.
The Speaker supervises voting in the
Commons and announces the final result. If
there is a tie, the Speaker gives a casting vote
(usually to keep the situation as it is), without
expressing an opinion on the merits of the
question. Voting procedure in the House of
Lords is broadly similar, although the Lord
Chancellor may vote but does not have a
casting vote.
Modernisation of the House of Commons
Most of the recommendations made by the
Select Committee on Modernisation of the
House of Commons, first set up in 1997, have
now been implemented. Among them are:
> measures to improve the examination of
proposed legislation, including a system
for publishing Bills in draft;
> the experimental use of Westminster
Hall, formerly known as the Grand
Committee Room, mainly for
adjournment debates and discussion of
consultative documents;
> reformed procedures for examining
European legislation;
> abolishing old-fashioned customs, such
as that requiring a Member to remain
seated and wear an opera hat to raise a
point of order during a division;
> the introduction of programme motions
to limit the amount of time spent in
debating some Bills;
> some divisions to be deferred until the
following Wednesday afternoon to reduce
the need for MPs to stay at the House
late into the night to vote;
> experimenting with the hours during
which the House sits; and
> carrying over, in defined circumstances,
Public Bills from one session to the next.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Financial Interests
The Commons has a public register of MPs’
financial (and some non-fmancial) interests.
Members with a financial interest must
declare it when speaking in the House or in
Committee and must indicate it when giving
notice of a question or motion. In other
proceedings of the House or in dealings with
other members, ministers or civil servants,
MPs must also disclose any relevant financial
interest. MPs cannot express favourable views
in the House on matters which are related to
the source of any personal financial interest.
The House of Lords also has a Register of
Interests, on lines similar to that for MPs. A
report of the Committee of Standards in
Public Life, published in November 2000,
made recommendations for certain changes to
the rules and procedures governing conduct in
the House of Lords, including registration of
financial interests (see p. 65).
Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards
The post of Parliamentary Commissioner for
Standards was created in 1995, following
recommendations of the Committee on
Standards in Public Life (see p. 64). The
Commissioner, who is independent of
government, can advise MPs on matters of
standards, and hold initial investigations into
complaints about alleged breaches of the rules
by Members. The Commissioner reports to
the House of Commons Select Committee on
Standards and Privileges.
Public Access to Parliamentary Proceedings
Proceedings of both Houses are normally
public. The minutes and speeches (transcribed
in Hansard, the Official Report) are published
daily.
The records of the Lords from 1497 and of
the Commons from 1547, together with the
parliamentary and political papers of a number
of former members of both Houses, are
available to the public through the House of
Lords Record Office. A wide range of
information on all aspects of the workings of
Parliament can be found on the Houses of
Parliament website at ivvprp.parliament.uk.
The proceedings of both Houses of
Parliament may be broadcast on television and
radio, either live or, more usually, in recorded
or edited form. Complete coverage is available
on cable and satellite television and the
‘webcasting’ of Parliament is currently being
considered.
The Law-making Process
Statute law consists of Acts of Parliament and
delegated legislation (commonly known as
statutory instruments) made by ministers
under powers given to them by Act (see
p. 54). While the interpretation of the law is
refined constantly in the courts (see chapter
14), changes to statute law can only be made by
Parliament.
Draft laws take the form of parliamentary
Bills. Proposals for legislation affecting the
powers of particular bodies (such as individual
local authorities) or the rights of individuals
(such as certain plans relating to railways,
roads and harbours) are known as Private
Bills, and are subject to a special form of
parliamentary procedure. Bills which change
the general law and make up the more
significant part of the parliamentary legislative
process are called Public Bills.
Public Bills can be introduced into either
House, by a government minister or by any
member or peer. Most Public Bills which
become Acts of Parliament are introduced by a
government minister and are known as
‘Government Bills’. Bills introduced by other
MPs or Lords are known as ‘Private
Members’ Bills’. Government Bills are
generally accompanied by Explanatory Notes,
written by the Department which is
promoting the Bill and updated when it is
enacted. The notes are designed to help the
reader understand more easily what the Bill
seeks to achieve and how it goes about it. They
also provide other background information
about the legislation, but are not passed or
endorsed by Parliament.
The main Bills forming the Government’s
legislative programme are announced in the
Queen’s Speech at the State Opening of
Parliament, which usually takes place in
November or shortly after a General Election,
and the Bills themselves are introduced into
52
6: GOVERNMENT
one or other of the Houses over the following
weeks.
Before a Government Bill is drafted, there
may be consultation with professional bodies,
voluntary organisations and others w ith an
interest, including pressure groups looking to
promote specific causes. ‘White Papers’, which
are government statements of policy, often
contain proposals for changes in the law; these
may be debated in Parliament before a Bill is
introduced. As part of the process of
modernising procedures (see p. 51), some Bills
are now published in draft for pre-legislative
scrutiny before beginning their passage through
Parliament. The aim is to allow more input
from backbenchers and other interested parties
at an early stage, helping to save time and
reducing the number of amendments which are
made during the legislative process. The
Government may also publish consultation
papers, sometimes called ‘Green Papers’,
setting out proposals which are still taking
shape and inviting comments from the public.
Passage of Public Bills
Public Bills must normally be passed by both
Houses. Bills relating mainly to financial
matters are almost always introduced in the
Commons. Under the provisions of the
Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of
the Lords in relation to ‘money Bills’ are very
restricted. The Parliament Acts also make it
possible for a Bill to be passed by the
Commons without the consent of the Lords in
certain (very rare) circumstances.
The process of passing a Public Bill is
similar in each House. On presentation the
Bill is considered, without debate, to have
been read for a first time and is printed. After
an interval, which may be between one day
and several weeks, a Government Bill will
receive its second reading debate, during
w hich the general principles of the Bill are
discussed.
If it gets a second reading in the Commons,
a Bill will normally be passed to a standing
committee (see p. 55) for detailed examination
and amendment. In the Lords, the committee
stage usually takes place on the floor of the
House, and this procedure may also be
followed in the Commons if MPs decide to do
so (usually in cases where there is a need to
pass the Bill quickly or where it raises matters
of constitutional importance).
The committee stage is followed by the
report stage (‘consideration’) on the floor of
the House, during which further amendments
may be made. In the Commons, the report
stage is usually followed immediately by the
third reading debate, when the Bill is reviewed
in its final form; in the Lords, the third
reading debate usually takes place on a
different day. Substantive amendments to a
Bill cannot be made at third reading.
After completing its third reading in one
House, a Bill is sent to the other House, where
it passes through all its stages once more and
where it is, more often than not, further
amended. Amendments made by the second
House must be agreed by the first, or a
compromise reached, before a Bill can go for
Royal Assent.
In the Commons the House may vote to
limit the time available for consideration of a
Bill. This is done by passing a ‘timetable’
motion proposed by the Government,
commonly known as a ‘guillotine’. There are
special procedures for Public Bills w hich bring
together pieces of existing legislation.
Royal Assent
When a Bill has passed through all its
parliamentary stages, it is sent to the Queen
for Royal Assent, after w hich it becomes an
Act of Parliament and is part of the law of the
land. The Royal Assent has not been refused
since 1707. In the 1999-2000 session 45 Public
Bills were enacted.
Limitations on the Power of the Lords
The main legislative function of the non-
elected House of Lords is to act as a revising
chamber, complementing but not rivalling the
elected House of Commons. As a result, it has
some limitations on its powers.
Most Government Bills introduced and
passed in the Lords go through the Commons
w ithout difficulty, but a Lords Bill
unacceptable to the Commons would normally
be amended before it became law. The Lords,
on the other hand, do not usually prevent Bills
from being enacted which the Commons are
53
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
keen to pass, although they will often amend
and return them to the Commons for further
consideration.
The Lords pass Bills authorising taxation or
national expenditure without amendment as a
formality. A Bill which deals only with taxation
or expenditure must become law within one
month of being sent to the Lords, whether or
not the Lords agrees to it, unless the Commons
directs otherwise. If no agreement is reached
between the two Houses on a non-financial
Commons Bill, the Lords can delay the Bill for
a period which, in practice, amounts to at least
13 months. Following this the Bill may be
presented to the Queen for Royal Assent,
provided it has been passed in the current
session and previous session by the Commons.
There is one important exception: any Bill to
lengthen the life of a Parliament needs the full
assent of both Houses.
Private Members’ Bills
Early in each session backbench members of
the Commons ballot (draw lots) for the chance
to introduce a Bill on one of the Fridays when
such Bills have precedence over government
business. The first 20 members whose names
are drawn win this privilege, but it does not
guarantee that their Bills will pass into law.
Members may also present a Bill on any day
without debate, while on most Tuesdays and
Wednesdays when the Commons is sitting
MPs may introduce a Bill under the ‘ten
minute rule’ which gives an opportunity for a
brief speech by the member proposing the Bill
(and by one who opposes it).
In most sessions some become law (six in
the 1999-2000 session). Private Members’
Bills do not often require public expenditure;
but if they do they cannot go forward to
committee stage unless the Government
decides to provide the necessary money. Peers
may introduce Private Members’ Bills in the
House of Lords at any time. A Private
Member’s Bill passed by one House will not
proceed in the other unless taken up by a
member of that House.
Private and Hybrid Bills
Private Bills are promoted by people or
organisations outside Parliament (often local
authorities) to give them special legal powers.
They go through a similar process to Public
Bills, but most of the work is done in
committee, where procedures follow a semi¬
judicial pattern. Hybrid Bills are Public Bills
which may affect private rights, for example,
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill, which was
passed in 1996. As with Private Bills, there are
special arrangements for the passage of Hybrid
Bills through Parliament which allow those
affected to put their case.
Delegated Legislation
To reduce unnecessary pressure on
parliamentary time, primary legislation (that is
the law as set out in an Act of Parliament)
often gives ministers or other authorities the
power to make minor, technical changes to an
Act by means of secondary or ‘delegated’
legislation (usually in the form of ‘statutory
instruments’). Such powers are normally
delegated only to authorities directly
accountable to Parliament or to the devolved
legislatures, so that the risk of undermining
the authority of Parliament is kept to a
minimum. Acts which allow for delegated
legislation usually give Parliament the
opportunity to agree to or disagree with any
resulting statutory instruments, while some
also require that organisations affected must
be consulted before rules and orders can be
made.
A joint committee of both Houses reports
on the technical propriety of these ‘statutory
instruments’. In order to save time on the
floor of the House, the Commons uses
standing committees to debate the merits of
instruments; actual decisions are taken by the
House as a whole. In the Lords, debates on
statutory instruments take place on the floor
of the House. The House of Lords has
appointed a delegated powers scrutiny
committee which examines the
appropriateness of the powers to make
secondary legislation in Bills.
Parliamentary Committees
Committees of the Whole House
Either House may vote to turn itself into a
‘Committee of the Whole House’ in order to
54
6: GOVERNMENT
consider Bills in detail after their second
reading. This allows unrestricted discussion:
the general rule that an MP or peer may speak
only once on each motion does not apply in
committee.
Standing Committees
House of Commons standing committees
debate and consider Public Bills at the
committee stage. The committee examines the
Bill clause by clause, and may amend it before
reporting it back to the House. Ordinary
standing committees do not have names but
are called simply Standing Committee A, B, C
and so on; a new set of members is appointed
to them to consider each Bill. Each committee
has between 16 and 50 members, with a party
balance reflecting as far as possible that in the
House as a whole. The standing committees
currently still include two Scottish standing
committees, and the Scottish, Welsh and
Northern Ireland Grand Committees.
The Scottish Grand Committee comprises
all 72 Scottish MPs (and may be convened
anywhere in Scotland as well as at
Westminster). It may consider the principle of
any Scottish Bill at the second and third
reading stages, where such a Bill has been
referred to the Committee by the House for
that purpose. It also debates other matters
concerning Scotland. In addition, its business
includes questions tabled for oral answer,
ministerial statements and other debates,
including those on statutory instruments
referred to it.
The Welsh Grand Committee, consisting
of all 40 Welsh MPs and up to five others who
may be added from time to time, may consider
Bills referred to it at second reading stage,
questions tabled for oral answer, ministerial
statements, and other matters relating
exclusively to Wales.
The Northern Ireland Grand Committee
considers Bills at the second and third reading
stages, takes oral questions and ministerial
statements, and debates matters relating
specifically to Northern Ireland. It includes all
sitting Northern Ireland MPs and up to 25
others as nominated by the committee of
selection. The Belfast Agreement allows for
the Northern Ireland Grand and Select
Committees to scrutinise the responsibilities
of the Secretary of State.
There is a Standing Committee on
Regional Affairs, consisting of all Members
sitting for constituencies in England, plus up
to five others. It was revived in April 2000.
There are also standing committees to
debate proposed European legislation, and to
examine statutory instruments and draft
statutory instruments brought forward by the
Government.
In the Lords, various sorts of committees
on Bills may be used instead of, or as well as, a
Committee of the Whole House. Such
committees include Public Bill Committees,
Special Public Bill Committees, Grand
Committees, Select Committees and Scottish
Select Committees.
Select Committees
Select committees are appointed for a
particular task, generally one of enquiry,
investigation and scrutiny. They report their
conclusions and recommendations to the
House as a whole; in many cases they invite a
response from the Government, which is also
reported to the House. A select committee
may be appointed for a Parliament, or for a
session, or for as long as it takes to complete
its task. Parliament is helped in controlling the
executive by 15 committees, set up by the
House of Commons to examine aspects of
public policy, expenditure and administration
across the main government departments and
their associated public bodies. The Foreign
Affairs Select Committee, for example,
‘shadows’ the work of the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office. Each committee is
constituted on a basis which is in approximate
proportion to party strength in the House.
Other regular Commons select committees
include those on Public Accounts, Standards
and Privileges, and European Legislation.
‘Domestic’ select committees also cover the
internal workings of Parliament.
Each House has a select committee to keep
it informed of EU developments, and to
enable it to scrutinise and debate EU policies
and proposals, while three Commons standing
committees debate specific European
legislative proposals. Ministers also make
regular statements about EU business.
55
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
In their examination of government
policies, expenditure and administration,
committees may question ministers, civil
servants, interested bodies and individuals.
Through hearings and published reports, they
bring before Parliament and the public an
extensive amount of fact and informed opinion
on many issues, and build up considerable
expertise in their subjects of inquiry.
In the House of Lords, besides the Appeal
and Appellate Committees in which most of
the House’s judicial work is carried out, there
are two major select committees: on the
European Community and on Science and
Technology. From time to time other
committees may also be set up to consider
particular issues (or, sometimes, a particular
Bill), and ‘domestic’ committees—as in the
Commons—cover the internal workings of the
House.
Joint Committees
Joint committees, with a membership drawn
from both Houses, are appointed in each
session to deal with Consolidation Bills10 and
statutory instruments (see p. 54). The two
Houses may also agree to set up joint select
committees on other subjects.
Unofficial Party Committees
The Parliamentary Labour Party comprises all
members of the party in both Houses. When
the Labour Party is in office, a parliamentary
committee, half of whose members are elected
and half of whom are government
representatives, acts as a channel of
communication between the Government and
its backbenchers in both Houses. When the
party is in opposition, the Parliamentary
Labour Party is organised under the direction
of an elected parliamentary committee, which
acts as the ‘shadow cabinet’.
The Conservative and Unionist Members’
Committee (the 1922 Committee) consists of
the backbench membership of the party in the
House of Commons. When the Conservative
10 A Consolidation Bill brings together several existing Acts into
one, with the aim of simplifying the statutes.
Party is in office, ministers attend its
meetings by invitation and not by right.
When the party is in opposition, the whole
membership of the parliamentary party may
attend meetings. The leader appoints a
consultative committee, which acts as the
party’s ‘shadow cabinet’.
Other Forms of Parliamentary Control
In addition to the scrutiny by select
committees, both Houses offer a number of
other opportunities for the examination of
government policy by the Opposition and the
Government’s own backbenchers. In the
House of Commons, these include:
> Question Time, when for 55 minutes on
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, ministers answer MPs’
questions. The Prime Minister’s
Question Time takes place for half an
hour every Wednesday when the House
is sitting. Parliamentary Questions are
one means of finding out about the
Government’s intentions. They are also a
way of raising complaints brought to
MPs’ notice by constituents. MPs may
also put questions to ministers for written
answer; the questions and answers are
published in Hansard. There are about
40,000 questions every year.
> Adjournment debates, when MPs use
motions for the adjournment of the
House to raise constituency cases or
matters of public concern. There is a
half-hour adjournment period at the end
of the business of the day, and
opportunities for several adjournment
debates on Wednesday mornings. Since
November 1999, under experimental
measures to modernise and reform
parliamentary procedures, a second
chamber, Westminster Hall (see p. 51),
has also been widely used for
adjournment debates. In addition, an MP
wishing to discuss a ‘specific and
important matter that should have urgent
consideration’ may, at the end of
Question Time, ask for an adjournment
of the House. On the very few occasions
when this action is successful, the matter
56
6: GOVERNMENT
is debated for three hours in what is
known as an emergency debate, usually
on the following day.
> Early day motions (EDMs) are another
way in which backbench MPs may
express their views on particular issues.
A number of EDMs are tabled each
sitting day; they are very rarely debated
but can be useful in measuring the
amount of support for the topic by the
number of MPs who add their signatures
to the EDM.
^ On 20 days in each session (sometimes
divided into half-days) opposition parties
choose the business to be discussed. Of
these days, 17 are allocated to the Leader
of the Opposition and three are at the
disposal of the leader of the second
largest opposition party.
> Debates on three days in each session on
details of proposed government
expenditure, chosen by the Liaison
Committee (a select committee largely
made up of select committee chairmen,
which considers general matters relating
to the work of select committees).
> Procedural opportunities for criticism of
the Government also occur during the
debate on the Queen’s Speech at the
beginning of each session; on motions of
censure for which the Government
provides time; and in debates on the
Government’s legislative and other
proposals.
In the House of Lords, similar
opportunities for criticism and examination of
government policy come at daily Question
Time, during debates and by means of
questions for written answer.
Control of Finances
The main responsibilities of Parliament, and
more particularly of the House of Commons,
in overseeing the revenue of the State and
public expenditure, are to authorise the raising
of taxes and duties, to decide on the various
areas of spending and to allocate the amount
to be spent on each. Parliament also has to be
sure that the sums granted are spent only for
the purposes which it intended. No payment
out of the central government’s public funds
can be made, and no taxation or loans
authorised, except by Act of Parliament.
However, limited interim payments can be
made from the Contingencies Fund.
The Finance Act is the most important
piece of annual legislation. It authorises the
raising of revenue and is based on the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s Budget
statement (see p. 387). Scrutiny of public
expenditure is carried out by House of
Commons select committees (see p. 55).
Forcing the Government to Resign
As a final act of parliamentary control, the
House of Commons may force the
Government to resign by passing a resolution
of‘no confidence’. The Government must
also resign if the House rejects a proposal
which the Government considers so vital to its
policy that it has declared it a ‘matter of
confidence’ or if the House refuses to vote the
money required for the public service.
Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration
The Parliamentary Ombudsman—officially
known as the Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration—investigates complaints from
members of the public (referred to him bv
MPs) alleging that they have been unfairly
treated through inefficiency of the system. The
Ombudsman is independent of government
and reports to a select committee of the House
of Commons. The Ombudsman’s area of
authority covers central government
departments and agencies, and a large number
of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs—
see p. 61). He cannot investigate complaints
about government policy, the content of
legislation or relations with other countries.
In making investigations, the
Commissioner has access to all departmental
papers, and has powers to call before him
those from whom he wishes to take evidence.
When an investigation is completed, he sends
a report with his findings to the MP who
referred the complaint (with a copy for the
complainant). When a complaint is upheld,
the Ombudsman normally recommends that
the department or other body makes some
57
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
kind of compensation (which might be
financial in appropriate cases). There is no
appeal against the Ombudsman’s decision.
The Ombudsman received 1,721 new
complaints in 2000-01 (an increase of 7% over
the previous year). He settled 1,787
complaints and completed 247 full
investigations. Complaints against the then
Department of Social Security accounted for
42% of the total received.
The Parliamentary Ombudsman also
investigates complaints arising from breaches
of the Code of Practice on Access to
Government Information (see p. 63).
Separate arrangements for a Scottish
Parliamentary Commissioner for
Administration and a Welsh Administration
Ombudsman have been set up to deal with
complaints about the Scottish Executive, the
National Assembly for Wales and devolved
public bodies. Complaints to the Scottish
Commissioner are referred through Members
of the Scottish Parliament; complaints to the
Welsh Administration Ombudsman can be
made direct.
Parliamentary Privilege
To ensure that Parliament can carry out its
duties without hindrance, certain rights and
immunities apply collectively to each House
and its staff, and individually to each member.
They include freedom of speech; first call on
the attendance of its members, who are
therefore free from arrest in civil actions and
excused from serving on juries, or being
forced to attend court as witnesses; and the
right of access to the Crown, which is a
collective privilege of the House. Further
privileges include the rights of the House to
control its own proceedings (so that it is able,
for instance, to keep out ‘strangers’11 if it
wishes); to decide upon legal disqualifications
for membership and to declare a seat vacant on
such grounds; and to punish for breach of its
privileges and for contempt. Parliament has
the right to punish anybody, inside or outside
the House, who commits a breach of privilege
—that is, offends against the rights of the
11 All those who are not members or officials of either House.
House. The privileges of the House of Lords
are broadly similar to those of the Commons.
Her Majesty’s Government
Her Majesty’s Government are those
ministers responsible for the conduct of
national affairs. The Queen appoints the
Prime Minister, and all other ministers are
appointed by the Queen on the recom¬
mendation of the Prime Minister. Most
ministers are members of the Commons,
although the Government is also fully
represented by ministers in the Lords. The
Lord Chancellor is always a member of the
House of Lords.
The composition of governments can vary
both in the number of ministers and in the
titles of some offices. New ministerial offices
may be created, others may be abolished, and
functions may be transferred from one
minister to another (see box on p. 62).
Prime Minister
The Prime Minister is also, by tradition, First
Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the
Civil Service. The Prime Minister’s unique
position of authority comes from majority
support in the House of Commons and from
the power to appoint and dismiss ministers.
By modern convention, the Prime Minister
always sits in the Commons.
The Prime Minister presides over the
Cabinet (see p. 59), is responsible for
allocating functions among ministers and, at
regular meetings with the Queen, informs her
of the general business of the Government.
The Prime Minister’s other responsibilities
include recommending a number of
appointments to the Queen. These include:
Church of England archbishops, bishops and
certain deans and some 200 other clergy in
Crown ‘livings’; senior judges, such as the
Lord Chief Justice; Privy Counsellors; and
Lords Lieutenants. He also recommends
certain civil appointments, such as Lord High
Commissioner to the General Assembly of the
Church of Scotland (after consultation with
the First Minister of the Scottish Parliament),
The Poet Laureate, The Constable of the
Tower (of London), and some university
58
6: GOVERNMENT
posts; and appointments to several public
boards and institutions, such as the BBC
(British Broadcasting Corporation), as well as
various royal and statutory commissions.
The Prime Minister’s Office supports him
in his role as head of government. This
includes providing policy advice, tracking the
delivery of government commitments and
initiatives, and ensuring effective
communications to Parliament, the media and
the public. Following the 2001 General
Election, several new units, including the
Delivery Unit, the Forward Strategy Unit and
the Office of Public Services Reform, have
been set up within the Cabinet Office to assist
the Prime Minister in these tasks.
Departmental Ministers
Ministers in charge of government
departments are usually in the Cabinet; they
are known as ‘Secretary of State’ or may have
a special title, as in the case of the Chancellor
of the Exchequer.
Non-departmental Ministers
The holders of various traditional offices,
namely the President of the Council, the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the
Lord Privy Seal, the Paymaster General and,
from time to time, Ministers without
Portfolio, may have few or no departmental
duties. They are therefore available to carry
out any duties the Prime Minister may wish to
give them. In the present administration, for
example, the President of the Council is
Leader of the House of Commons, and the
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is
Minister for the Cabinet Office.
Lord Chancellor and Law Officers
The Lord Chancellor holds a special position,
as both a minister with departmental functions
and the head of the judiciary (see p. 222). The
three Law Officers of the Crown advising the
UK Government are the Attorney-General
and the Solicitor-General (for England and
Wales) and the Advocate-General for
Scotland.
Other Ministers
Ministers of State are middle-ranking
ministers. They normally have specific
responsibilities, and are sometimes given titles
which reflect these functions, for example,
‘Minister for Housing and Planning’ or
‘Minister for E-Commerce and
Competitiveness’.
The most junior ministers are
Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State (or,
where the senior minister is not a Secretary of
State, simply Parliamentary Secretaries).
They may be given responsibility, directly
under the departmental minister, for specific
aspects of the department’s work.
Ministerial Salaries
The salaries of ministers in the House of
Commons (from July 2001) range from
£78,657 a year for junior ministers to
£119,979 for Cabinet ministers (inclusive of
their parliamentary salaries—see p. 46). The
Prime Minister receives a salary of £165,418
and the Lord Chancellor £173,875.
Ministerial salaries in the House of Lords
(as at April 2001) range from £58,961 for
junior ministers to £88,562 for Cabinet
ministers.
The Leader of the Opposition in the
Commons receives a salary of £114,301
(inclusive of his parliamentary salary); two
Opposition whips in the Commons and the
Opposition Leader and Chief Whip in the
Lords also receive additional salaries.
The Cabinet
About 20 ministers (the number can vary)
chosen by the Prime Minister sit in the
Cabinet; these may include both departmental
and non-departmental ministers. The Cabinet
balances ministers’ individual duties with their
collective responsibility as members of the
Government and takes the final decisions on
all government policy.
Cabinet Meetings
The Cabinet meets in private and its business
is confidential, although after 30 years Cabinet
59
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
papers may become available for inspection in
the Public Record Office at Kew, Surrey.
Normally the Cabinet meets weekly when
Parliament is sitting, and less often when it is
not. Cabinet Committees take some of the
pressure off the full Cabinet by settling issues
among smaller groups of people or at a lower
level, or at least by clarifying them and
defining points of disagreement. Committees
let those ministers most closely concerned
come to decisions in a way which ensures that
the Government as a whole can accept full
responsibility for them. This delegated
responsibility means that Cabinet Committee
decisions have the same formal status as those
taken by the full Cabinet.
Cabinet Committees include those dealing
with defence and overseas policy, economic
policy, home and social affairs, the environment,
and local government. The membership and
terms of reference of all ministerial Cabinet
Committees are published. Where appropriate,
the Secretary of the Cabinet and other senior
Cabinet Office officials go to meetings of the
Cabinet and its Committees.
The Cabinet Office
The Cabinet Office, together with HM
Treasury and the Prime Minister’s Office, is
at the centre of UK Government.
The Secretary of the Cabinet (a senior civil
servant who reports directly to the Prime
Minister) manages the Cabinet Secretariats,
which together serve ministers in carrying out
Cabinet business and coordinating policy at
the highest level. Since 1983, the Cabinet
Secretary has also had the role of Head of the
Home Civil Service.
A new Office of the Deputy Prime Minister
has been set up in the Cabinet Office (see
p. 62). This oversees the work of the Social
Exclusion Unit and has responsibility for the
Regional Coordination Unit and the
Government Offices for the Regions (GOs—
see p. 11). It also assists the Deputy Prime
Minister in the role he plays in support of the
Prime Minister on issues such as Northern
Ireland and climate change. The current
Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is also
Minister for the Cabinet Office and has
ministerial responsibility for the Prime
Minister’s new Delivery Unit, regulation and
e-Government (see p. 402).
The Cabinet Office is responsible for
current policies to:
> modernise and simplify government so
that it works more effectively for the
benefit of the people;
> work with departments to improve the
delivery of public services; and
> provide the central strategic management
of the Civil Service.
Ministerial Responsibility
‘Ministerial responsibility’ refers both to the
collective responsibility for government policy
and actions which ministers share, and to
ministers’ individual responsibility for the
work of their own departments.
‘Collective responsibility’ means that all
ministers unanimously support government
policy once it has been settled. The policy of
departmental ministers must agree with the
policy of the Government as a whole. Once
the Government has decided its policy on a
particular matter, each minister is expected to
support it or resign. On rare occasions,
ministers are allowed free votes in Parliament
on important issues of principle or conscience.
Ministers are individually accountable for
the work of their departments and agencies,
and have a duty to Parliament to answer for
their policies, decisions and actions.
Departmental ministers normally decide all
matters within their responsibility. However,
many issues cut across departmental
boundaries and need the agreement of more
than one minister. The full Cabinet or a
Cabinet Committee considers proposals where
the issue is one which raises major policy
concerns, is likely to lead to significant public
comment or criticism, or where the
departmental ministers concerned have been
unable to agree.
On taking up office ministers resign
directorships in private and public companies,
and must ensure that there is no conflict
between their public duties and private
interests. Detailed guidance on handling
ministers’ financial interests is set out in the
Ministerial Code.
60
6: GOVERNMENT
Government Departments
The main role of government departments
and their agencies is to implement government
policy and advise ministers. They are staffed
by politically impartial civil servants and
generally receive their funding from money
provided by Parliament. They often work
alongside local authorities, non-departmental
public bodies, and other government-
sponsored organisations.
The structure and functions of
departments are sometimes reorganised if
there are major changes in government policy
(see box on p. 62 for new departments and
responsibilities following the June 2001
General Election). A change of government,
however, does not necessarily affect the
functions of departments.
The work of some departments (for
instance, the Ministry of Defence) covers the
UK as a whole. Other departments, such as
the Department for Work and Pensions, cover
England, Wales and Scotland, but not
Northern Ireland. Others again, such as the
Department for Transport, Local
Government and the Regions, are mainly
concerned with affairs in England. (For
changes in responsibilities associated with
devolution, see chapters 3, 4 and 5.)
The Regional Co-ordination Unit is
responsible for considering government
initiatives with a regional or local dimension
and for promoting closer links between
government activity in the regions with that
done centrally.
The nine Government Offices (see pp.
10-11) are the key arms of government in the
English regions, responsible for the effective
delivery of government programmes
regionally and locally. Their staff represent
seven government departments: DTI, DIES,
DWP, DTLR, HO, DCMS and DEFRA.
W orking together and with regional partners,
including local authorities and Regional
Development Agencies (RDAs), the
Government Offices are best placed to ensure
that government policies are coordinated at a
regional level.
RDAs were formally launched in eight
English regions in April 1999. The ninth, in
London, followed in July 2000 when the new
Greater London Authority took up its full
powers and responsibilities. The RDAs
provide coordinated regional economic
development and regeneration, and help the
English regions to improve their
competitiveness relative to their European
counterparts.
Voluntary regional chambers have been
established in each region. They provide a
means through which the RDAs can consult
on their proposals and give an account of their
activities.
Most departments are headed by ministers.
However, some are non-ministerial
departments headed by a permanent office
holder and ministers with other duties are
accountable for them to Parliament. For
example, the Secretary of State for Education
and Skills accounts to Parliament for the work
of the Office for Standards in Education
(OFSTED). OFSTED is headed by HM
Chief Inspector of Schools in England, who is
largely independent of the Secretary of State.
The functions of the main government
departments and agencies are set out in
Appendix 1, pp. 537-546.
Non-departmental Public Bodies
A non-departmental public body (NDPB
sometimes known as ‘quango’) is a national or
regional public body, working independently
of ministers to whom they are accountable.
There are two main types of NDPB:
> Executive NDPBs are those with
executive, administrative, commercial or
regulatory functions. They are typically
engaged in a wide variety of activities and
are set up in a number of different ways.
Executive NDPBs carry out set functions
within a government framework but the
degree of operational independence
varies. Examples include the Arts
Council of England, the Environment
Agency and the Health and Safety
Executive.
> Advisory NDPBs are those set up by
ministers to advise them and their
departments on particular matters.
Examples include the Committee on
Standards in Public Life and the Low

Cabinet Office (CO)
The Cabinet Office, which now includes a new
Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, oversees
the development of government policy,
including at regional level, and cross-
departmental matters such as social exclusion
and leads the drive to improve the delivery of
public services. The Social Exclusion Unit, the
Regional Coordination Unit and the
Government Offices for the Regions report to
the Deputy Prime Minister.
Department for Culture, Media and Sport
(DCMS)
Gambling, licensing, censorship, video
classification and planning for the Queen’s
Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002 have come
to the DCMS from the Home Office.
Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (DEFRA)
This new Department is in charge of
promoting ‘green issues’ and the countryside.
It has taken over responsibility for agriculture,
food and fisheries from the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF)
which now no longer exists. It has taken control
of government policy for the environment, the
countryside and sustainable development from
the former Department of the Environment,
Transport and the Regions (DETR), and
animal welfare and hunting from the Home
Office.
Department for Education and Skills (DfES)
This new Department has taken over the
responsibilities of the former Department for
Education and Employment (DfEE) for
education and has a particular remit to raise
standards, increase higher education
participation and improve work-based training
and lifelong learning.
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
New responsibilities taken on by the D 11
following departmental reorganisation include
sponsorship of the construction industry
(previously under the former DETR) and the
Regional Development Agencies. It has
acquired a number of responsibilities from the
former DfEE relating to equality, including
the Race Relations Equality Advisory Service
markets and chartered fairs, and the
calendar has transferred from the Home
Office.
Department for Transport, Local Government and
the Regions (DTLR)
In addition to taking over responsibility for the
fire service and electoral law from the Home
Office, this new Department is in charge of
most of the policy areas of the former DETR
except those dealing with environmental
matters.
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
The welfare and pensions responsibilities of the
former Department of Social Security (DSS)
now come under this new Department,
together with the employment and disability
portfolios from the former DfEE. From
October 2001, it will be responsible for a new
agency, Jobcentre Plus, which will bring
together the functions of the Employment
Service and those parts of the Benefits Agency
which provide services for people of working
age.
Lord Chancellor’s Department (LCD)
As part of the reorganisation of departmental
responsibilities, the LCD has taken over
responsibility from the Home Office for open
government, including freedom of information
and data protection; royal, Church and
hereditary issues and Lords Lieutenants;
Crown Dependencies; and human rights issues.
Ministry of Defence (MoD)
The MoD has taken over responsibility for the
Security Services Group from the Cabinet
Office and the War Pensions Agency from the
former DSS.
Home Office (HO)
Although it has lost some of its less central
responsibilities in the reorganisation (see
entries above), the HO has taken control of the
UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordination Unit, which
previously came under the Cabinet Office. It
has also taken on responsibility for the issue of
work permits from the former DfEE.

There are currently over 1,000 NDPBs in
the UK. A list of all NDPBs is held centrally
by the Cabinet Office and is issued annually in
the publication Public Bodies. An electronic
directory is available via the Cabinet Office
website.
The Lobby
As press adviser to the Prime Minister, the
Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman and
other staff in the Prime Minister’s Press
Office have direct contact with the
parliamentary press through regular meetings
with the Lobby correspondents. The Lobby
correspondents are a group of political
journalists with the special privilege of access
to the Lobby of the House of Commons,
where they can talk privately to government
ministers and other members of the House.
The Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman is
the accepted channel through which
information about parliamentary business is
passed to the media.
Modernising Government
The Government has taken a number of
measures as part of its long-term programme
to modernise and improve public services.
These include:
^ drawing up Public Service Agreements
(PSAs) with government departments
(see p. 402) to set a clear framework of
policy objectives and resource allocation,
and provide a way of measuring and
monitoring effectiveness;
> a coherent programme for more
responsive and higher quality public
services, including schemes like Charter
Mark to promote excellence (see p. 64);
> the establishment of the Prime Minister’s
Delivery Unit to drive improvements in
health, education, crime reduction and
transport, and the creation of the Centre
for Management and Policy Studies to
improve policy-making, draw on external
experience and strengthen the skills of
civil servants;
> making all government services available
electronically by 2005 so that they are
more responsive to the needs of citizens
and businesses and encourage greater
government efficiency. By the end of
2000, 42% of public services were online
with over 70% planned to be available by
2002; and
> a reform programme to create a more
open, diverse and professional Civil
Service.
Freedom of Information
The Freedom of Information Act 2000
replaces a non-statutory Code of Practice on
Access to Government Information and
creates a statutory right of access to recorded
information held across the public sector,
including Parliament, government
departments, and local authorities, health
trusts, doctors’ surgeries, publicly funded
museums and other organisations.
The main features of the Act are:
> a right of wide general access to
information, subject to clearly defined
exemptions and conditions;
> a requirement to consider discretionary
disclosure in the public interest even
when an exemption applies;
> a duty to publish information; and
> powers of enforcement through an
independent Information Commissioner
and Information Tribunal.
National Statistics
In line with the Government’s commitment to
greater openness and accessibility of publicly
held information, the UK’s independent
national statistical service makes available all
its online data free of charge. National
Statistics, set up in June 2000, aims to provide
an accurate, up-to-date, comprehensive and
meaningful picture of the UK economy and
society to support the formulation and
monitoring of economic and social policies by
government at all levels.
63
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The National Statistician is the Head of
National Statistics, Head of the Government
Statistical Service, Director of the Office for
National Statistics, Registrar General for
England and Wales, and the UK
Government’s chief professional adviser on
statistical matters. He has professional
responsibility for the quality of the outputs
comprising National Statistics and maintains
and publishes a National Statistics Code of
Practice to help achieve this.
A new Statistics Commission has also been
set up. It is an independent, non-executive
advisory body whose role includes presenting
the comments of users and suppliers on the
National Statistics work programme, advising
ministers of areas of widespread concern about
the quality of official statistics and reviewing
the need for statistical legislation. It is
required to produce an annual report which is
laid before Parliament.
Charter Mark
A key objective of the Government’s future
plans is to improve the delivery of public
services with more emphasis on the consumer.
The Charter Mark scheme aims to help
public service organisations become more
focused on the needs of users. The scheme
applies to all public services, at both national
and local level. It sets out clear standards of
service, ensures consultation with users, has
an easy-to-use complaints procedure and
works with other providers to ensure better
services which are simple to use and well
coordinated.
Committee on Standards in Public Life
This Committee was set up in 1994 against a
background of increasing public concern about
standards in many areas of public life. Its
standing terms of reference are ‘to examine
current concerns about standards of conduct
of all holders of public office, including
arrangements relating to financial and
commercial activities, and make
recommendations as to any changes in present
arrangements which might be required to
ensure the highest standards of propriety in
public life’.
The Committee has published seven
reports. The first, in 1995, led to the
appointment of a Parliamentary Commissioner
for Standards and a Commissioner for Public
Appointments (see p. 65).
Reports in 1996 and 1997 examined
standards of conduct in local public spending
bodies and conduct in local government, and
called for a radical change in the ethical
framework within which local government
operates. A proposal was made for a new
criminal offence of misuse of public office.
In 1997 the Prime Minister gave the
Committee additional terms of reference to
review the funding of political parties. The
Committee’s report, published in 1998, called
for a new regulatory regime, overseen by an
independent Electoral Commission, for
political party funding in the UK. Provisions
in the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000 (see p. 49) have now
addressed these matters.
In January 2000, the Committee published
Reinforcing Standards, a major review of public
sector ethics, which concluded that, although
the process of raising standards had been a
success, more still needed to be done. Its
recommendations, the majority of which were
accepted by the Government in July 2000,
called for:
> changing the rules on the conduct of
MPs and disciplinary procedures;
> amending the Ministerial Code to make it
clear that a minister, having had the
advice of his or her Permanent Secretary
on potential conflicts of interest, must
take full responsibility for any
subsequent decision;
> ensuring that staff appointed on
secondments or short-term contracts are
alert to ethical issues within the public
sector and limiting the total number of
special advisers that can be appointed
within Government;
> strengthening the guidance on lobbying
and self-regulation by lobbyists;
> disclosing in departmental annual
reports, and to the public on request,
details of sponsorship of government
activities by the private and voluntary
sectors; and
64
6: GOVERNMENT
> establishing an agreed definition of a task
force, specifying, among other things,
that if it ran for more than two years, it
should be disbanded or reclassified as an
advisory NDPB.
The Committee’s latest report—Standards
of Conduct in the House of Lords—was
published in November 2000. It made a
number of recommendations for changes to
the rules and procedures governing conduct in
the House of Lords. A working group set up
by the House to consider the report
unanimously accepted the recommendations
for mandatory registration of all peers’
relevant interests and a short code of conduct.
In July 2001 the House passed a resolution to
adopt a new Code of Conduct with effect from
31 March 2002.
Commissioner for Public
Appointments
The Commissioner for Public Appointments
is independent of government and is
responsible for monitoring, regulating and
auditing approximately 12,500 ministerial
appointments to a range of public bodies
including NDPBs, public corporations,
nationalised industries, National Health
Service (NHS) Trusts and utility regulators.
The Commissioner has issued a Code of
Practice which covers the seven principles to
be applied to these appointments—ministerial
responsibility, merit, independent scrutiny,
equal opportunities, probity, openness and
transparency, and proportionality.
Civil Service Commissioners
The Civil Service Commissioners are
responsible for ensuring that recruitment to
the Civil Service should be on merit and based
on fair and open competition. The
Commissioners, who are independent of
government, produce a mandatory
Recruitment Code and audit the recruitment
policies and practices of departments and
agencies to ensure that they comply. They also
approve appointments through external
recruitment to the Senior Civil Service, and
hear and determine appeals in cases of concern
about propriety and conscience under the
Civil Service Code.
The Civil Service
The constitutional and practical role of the
Civil Service is to help the Government of the
United Kingdom, the Scottish Executive or
the National Assembly for Wales formulate
their policies, carry out decisions and
administer public services for which they are
responsible.
Civil servants are servants of the Crown; in
effect this means the Government of the
L nited Kingdom, the Scottish Executive and
the National Assembly for Wales. The
executive powers of the Crown are generallv
exercised by ministers of the Crown, Scottish
ministers and ministers of the National
Assembly for Wales, who are in turn
answerable to the appropriate Parliament or
Assembly. The Civil Service as such has no
separate constitutional personality or
responsibility. The duty of the individual civil
servant is first and foremost to the minister in
charge of the department in which he or she is
serving. A change of minister, for whatever
reason, does not involve a change of staff.
Cabinet ministers may each appoint a
maximum of two special advisers. The Prime
Minister approves all appointments. There are
about 80 such advisers in the present
administration. The advisers are paid from
public funds. Their appointments come to an
end when the Government’s term of office
finishes, or when the appointing minister
leaves the Government or moves to another
appointment.
The Civil Service Code, introduced in
1996, is a concise statement of the role and
responsibilities of civil servants. It was revised
in May 1999 to take account of devolution.
The Code includes an independent line of
appeal to the Civil Service Commissioners on
alleged breaches of the Code.
Civil servants constitute about 2% of the
working population in employment, and about
10% of all public sector employees. The
number of permanent civil servants fell from
751,000 in 1976 to 478,500 in October 2000.
These figures include the Senior Civil
Service, which comprises around 3,000 of the
65
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
most senior managers and policy advisers.
Part-time working has increased over recent
years with 13.4% of civil servants working
part time at October 2000.
About half of all civil servants provide
services to the public. These include paying
benefits and pensions, running employment
services, staffing prisons, issuing driving
licences, and providing services to industry
and agriculture. A further quarter are
employed in the Ministry of Defence and its
agencies. The rest are divided between central
administrative and policy duties; support
services; and largely financially self-
supporting services, for instance, those
provided by the Royal Mint. Four-fifths of
civil servants work outside London.
Approximately 11,000 civil servants work in
the Scottish Executive and 2,700 in the
National Assembly for Wales.
Northern Ireland Civil Service
The Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) is
modelled on its counterpart in Great Britain,
and has its own Civil Service Commission.
There were about 24,000 civil servants in the
NICS in September 2001. There is a degree of
mobility between the NICS and the Home
Civil Service.
The Diplomatic Service
The Diplomatic Service, a separate service of
some 6,000 people, provides staff for the
Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO see
p. 96) in London and at British diplomatic
missions abroad.
Terms and conditions of service are
comparable, but take into account the special
demands of the Service, particularly the
requirement to serve abroad. Home civil
servants, members of the armed forces and
individuals from the private sector may also
serve in the FCO and at overseas posts on loan
or attachment.
Equality and Diversity
The Civil Service aims to create a culture in
which the different skills, experience and
expertise that individuals bring are valued and
used. Its equal opportunities policy states that
there must be no unfair discrimination on the
basis of age, disability, gender, marital status,
sexual orientation, race, colour, nationality,
ethnic or national origin or (in Northern
Ireland) community background. The Civil
Service is committed to achieving greater
diversity, particularly at senior levels, where
women, people from ethnic minorities and
those with disabilities are under-represented.
In October 2000, the overall proportion of
women in the Civil Service was 50%; ethnic
minority representation was 6%; and at least
3.6% of staff employed were disabled.
Progress is monitored and reported on
regularly by the Cabinet Office.
Central Management
As Minister for the Civil Service, the Prime
Minister is responsible for central
coordination and management of the Civil
Service. He is supported by the Head of the
Home Civil Service who chairs the Civil
Service Management Board. (The function of
official Head of the Home Civil Service is
combined with that of Secretary of the
Cabinet.) The Cabinet Office oversees the
central framework for management of the
Civil Service. Day-to-day responsibility for a
wide range of terms and conditions has been
delegated to departments and agencies, the
Scottish Executive and the National Assembly
for Wales.
Executive Agencies
Executive agencies were introduced to deliver
government services more efficiently and
effectively within available resources. They are
part of the Civil Service, but under the terms
of individual framework documents they have
greater delegation of financial, pay and
personnel matters. Agencies are headed by
chief executives who are normally directly
accountable to ministers but are personally
responsible for day-to-day operations.
Abolition, privatisation, contracting-out,
merger or rationalisation of a given
government function are all options considered
before an agency is set up. These options are
66
6: GOVERNMENT
reconsidered for each agency and NDPB when
they are reviewed, which normally happens
every five years.
Local Government
Local Authorities’ Powers
Local authorities only work within the pow ers
laid dow n under various Acts of Parliament.
Their functions are far-reaching. Some are
mandatory, w hich means that the authority
must do what is required by law; others are
discretionary, allow ing an authority to provide
services if it wishes. In certain cases, ministers
have powers to secure uniformity in standards
in order to safeguard public health or to
protect the rights of individual citizens.
Where local authorities exceed their statutory
powers, they are regarded as acting outside the
law and can be challenged in court.
The main link between local authorities
and central government in England is the
Department for Transport, Local
Government and the Regions. How ever, other
departments, such as the Department for
Education and Skills, the Department for
Work and Pensions, the Department of Health
and the Home Office, are also concerned w ith
various local government functions. In
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland local
authorities now deal mainly with the devolved
Parliament and Assemblies.
Reform of Local Government
Structure
A major reform of local government took place
in 1974 in England and W ales and in 1975 in
Scotland. This created tw o main tiers of local
authority throughout England and Wales:
counties and the smaller districts. Local
government in London had been reorganised
along the same lines in 1965. In Scotland
functions were allocated to regions and districts
on the mainland; single-tier authorities were
introduced for the three Islands areas. In
Northern Ireland changes w ere made in 1973
w hich replaced the tw o-tier county council and
urban/rural council system with a single-tier
district council system.
The Local Government Act 1985 abolished
the Greater London Council and the six
metropolitan county councils in England.
Most of their functions were transferred to the
London boroughs and metropolitan district
councils respectively in 1986 (see below).
Further restructuring of local government
later took place in non-metropolitan England
and in Scotland and Wales. In 1992 the Local
Government Commission was set up to review7
the structure, boundaries and electoral
arrangements of local government in England
and to carry out electoral reviews at regular
intervals. In its reviews of local government in
non-metropolitan England, the Commission
considered whether the two-tier structure
should be replaced by single-tier (‘unitary’)
authorities in each area; for the most part it
recommended keeping two-tier government,
but suggested unitary authorities for some
areas, especially the larger cities. Parliament
approved reorganisation in 25 counties,
creating a total of 46 new7 unitary councils
(see map on p. 8). The reorganisation was
completed in 1998.
In Scotland 29 new unitary councils replaced
the previous system of nine regional and 53
district councils in 1996; the three Islands
councils remained in being. In Wales 22 unitarv
authorities replaced the previous eight county
councils and 37 district councils, again in 1996.
Principal Types of Local Authority
Greater London
Greater London is made up of the 32 London
boroughs and the City of London, each w ith a
council responsible for a number of key local
services in its area. The Greater London
Authority (GLA), led by the Mayor for
London, sets key strategies on a range of
London-wide issues, such as transport,
economic development, strategic and spatial
development and the environment (see p. 9).
English Metropolitan County Areas
The six metropolitan county areas—Tyne and
Wear, West Midlands, Merseyside, Greater
Manchester, West Yorkshire and South
Yorkshire—have 36 district councils, but no
67
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
county councils. The district councils are
responsible for all services apart from those
which have a statutory authority over areas
wider than the individual boroughs and
districts—for example, waste disposal (in
certain areas); the fire services, including civil
defence; and public transport. These are run
by joint authorities composed of elected
councillors nominated by the borough or
district councils.
English Non-metropolitan Counties
Before the recent reforms, local government in
England—outside Greater London and the
metropolitan areas—was divided into counties
and sub-divided into districts. All the counties
and districts had locally elected councils with
separate functions. County councils provided
large-scale services, while district councils were
responsible for the more local ones. These
arrangements are broadly continuing in areas
where two-tier local government remains.
County councils are responsible for
transport, planning, highways, traffic
regulation, education, consumer protection,
refuse disposal, the fire service, libraries and
the personal social services. District councils
are responsible for environmental health,
housing, decisions on most local planning
applications, and collection of household waste.
Both tiers of local authority have powers to
provide facilities such as museums, art galleries
and parks; arrangements depend on local
agreement. In areas where the new unitary
authorities have been set up, county and
district level functions have joined together.
In addition to the two-tier local authority
system in England, over 10,000 parish councils
provide and manage local facilities such as
allotments and village halls, and act as agents
for other district council functions. They are
also a forum for discussion of local issues.
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
In Scotland the 32 single-tier councils are
responsible for the full range of local
government services. In Wales the 22 single¬
tier councils have similar functions, except
that fire services are provided by three
combined fire authorities. In addition, about
750 community councils in Wales have
functions similar to those of the parish
councils in England (see above); Scotland has
community councils to represent the views of
their local communities to local authorities
and other public bodies in the area. In
Northern Ireland 26 district councils are
responsible for delivering services to their
local communities.
Fire Services in the UK
Every part of the UK is covered by a local
authority fire service. Each of the 59 fire
authorities must by law provide a firefighting
service and maintain a brigade to meet all
normal requirements. Each fire authority
appoints a Chief Fire Officer (Firemaster in
Scotland) who has day-to-day control of
operations. The fire services in England and
Wales employ around 56,000 staff and spend
about £1.5 billion each year.
Election of Councils
Local councils consist of elected councillors.
In England and Wales each council elects its
presiding officer annually. Some districts have
the ceremonial title of borough, or city, both
granted by royal authority. In boroughs and
cities the presiding officer is normally known
as the Mayor, or in Scotland the Provost. In
the City of London and certain other large
cities, he or she is known as the Lord Mayor.
In Scotland the presiding officer of the council
of the four longest established cities—
Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and
Glasgow—is called the Lord Provost.
Councillors are elected for four years. Whole
council elections are held every four years in all
county councils in England, borough councils
in London, and about two-thirds of non¬
metropolitan district councils. In the remaining
districts (including all metropolitan districts)
one-third of the councillors are elected in each
of the three years when county council
elections are not held. Unitary authorities in
non-metropolitan districts and London
boroughs have a pattern of elections similar to
that in metropolitan districts.
In Scotland whole council elections are
held every three years, with the next elections
68
6: GOVERNMENT
due in 2002. In Wales whole council elections
are held every fourth year, with the next due
in 2003.
County, district and unitary authority
councillors are paid a basic allowance but may
be entitled to additional allowances and
expenses for attending meetings or taking on
special responsibilities.
Electoral Areas and Procedure
Counties in England are divided into electoral
divisions, each returning one councillor.
Districts in England and Northern Ireland are
divided into wards, returning one or more
councillors. In Scotland the unitary councils
are divided into wards and in Wales into
electoral divisions; each returns one councillor
or more. Parishes (in England) and
communities (in Wales) may be divided into
wards, returning at least one councillor.
The procedure for local government voting
in Great Britain is broadly similar to that for
parliamentary elections. In Northern Ireland
district councils are elected by proportional
representation because it allows for the
representation of sizeable minorities.
Eligibility rules for voters are also similar to
those for parliamentary elections, except that
citizens of other member states of the EU may
vote. To stand for election, candidates must
also either be registered as an elector or have
some other close connection within the
electoral area of their candidature, such as
their principal place of employment.
The electoral arrangements of local
authorities in England are kept under review
by the Local Government Commission (see
p. 67), and in Wales and Scotland by the Local
Government Boundary Commissions.
Electoral arrangements in England and Wales
for parishes and communities can be reviewed
by local councils.
Provision of Local Services
In recent years, there has been a move away
from direct service provision, to a greater use
of private contractors, and an increase in what
is often called the ‘enabling’ role. Local
authorities now carry out many functions in
partnership with both public and private
organisations.
The Government considers that councils
should not be forced to put their services out
to tender, but equally it sees no reason why a
service should be delivered directly if more
efficient means are available elsewhere. The
Local Government Act 1999 therefore places a
duty on local authorities to achieve best value.
The Best Value programme encourages
local accountability and involves local
communities in deciding the quality, level and
cost of the services they receive. Local
authorities are expected to set themselves
challenging targets for the improvement of
services following regular reviews of their
performance. Local people may see how well
their authority is performing through the
publication of annual performance plans.
The Government of Wales Act 1998
requires the National Assembly to set up a
Partnership Council to oversee relations
between the Assembly and local government.
A Commission to establish effective relations
between local government and the new
Scottish Parliament has been set up (see
chapter 4).
Internal Organisation of Local
Authorities
The Local Government Act 2000 requires
local authorities to implement new decision¬
taking structures, including the possibility of a
directly elected mayor. These arrangements
replace the traditional committee system of
decision-taking for most council functions. In
most authorities the arrangements are based
on one of three executive frameworks: a mayor
and cabinet; a council leader and cabinet; or a
mayor and council manager. Within these
options local authorities have considerable
flexibility to work within a constitution which
reflects local circumstances. Small shire
district councils with a population of fewer
than 85,000 have, in addition to executive
arrangements, the choice of reforming their
existing committee system.
All new constitutions are required to
incorporate rigorous arrangements for review
and scrutiny of councils’ policies and the
decisions they make. Some decisions, such as
the acceptance of policies and the budget, are
reserved for the full council, but most of those
69
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
relating to the implementation of policy are
for the executive. T he executive is also
responsible for preparing the policies and
budget to propose to the council. Decisions
may be taken by the executive collectively, by
individual members of the executive, by
committees of the executive or by officers of
the authority. The executive is also able to
delegate decision-making to area committees
and to enter into partnership arrangements
with other authorities.
The new arrangements are designed to
ensure that people know who in the council is
responsible for taking decisions, how they can
make their input into decision-making and
how to hold decision-makers to account.
Public Access
Under the Local Government Act 2000, the
public (including the press) is admitted to
meetings of the executive when key decisions
are being discussed. They also have access to
agendas, reports and minutes of meetings and
certain background papers. In addition, local
authorities must publish a Forward Plan
setting out the decisions which will be taken
over the coming months. Local authorities
may exclude the public from meetings and
withhold papers only in limited
circumstances.
Employees
About 2.2 million people12 are employed by
local authorities in the UK. These include
school teachers, police, firefighters and other
non-manual and manual workers. Education is
the largest service with 1.3 million full-time
equivalent jobs. Councils are individually
responsible, within certain national legislative
requirements, for deciding the structure of
their workforces.
The elected councillors usually make senior
staff appointments. More junior appointments
are made by heads of departments. The
Secretary of State for Education and Skills
sets the pay and conditions of school teachers,
after receiving recommendations from the
12 Full-time equivalents.
School Teachers’ Pay Review Body. Police
pay is determined by a formula tied to median
private sector non-manual pay settlements.
Other pay and conditions of service are usually
a matter for each council, although
firefighters’ pay increases are set by a formula
linked to the upper quartile of male manual
workers’ earnings. For other workers, most
authorities follow the scales recommended as a
result of national negotiation between
authorities and trade unions.
Local Authority Finance
Local government expenditure accounts for
about 25% of public spending. In 2000-01
expenditure by local authorities in the UK
was about £91.1 billion. Current expenditure
amounted to £76.8 billion; capital
expenditure, net of capital receipts, was
£7.0 billion; and debt interest £3.2 billion.
Local government capital expenditure is
financed primarily by borrowing within limits
set by central government and from capital
receipts from the disposal of land and
buildings.
Local authorities in Great Britain raise
revenue through the council tax (see chapter
23), which meets about 25% of their revenue
expenditure. Their spending is, however,
financed primarily by grants from central
government (the devolved administration in
Scotland) and by the redistribution of revenue
within each country from their national non¬
domestic rate, a property tax levied on
businesses and other non-domestic properties.
District councils in Northern Ireland
continue to raise revenue through the levying
of a domestic rate and business rates.
Financial Safeguards
Local councils’ annual accounts must be
audited by independent auditors appointed by
the Audit Commission in England and Wales,
or in Scotland by the Accounts Commission
for Scotland. In Northern Ireland the chief
local government auditor carries out this role.
Local electors have a right to inspect the
accounts to be audited. T hey may also ask
questions and lodge objections with the
auditor.

Local Government Complaints System
Local authorities are encouraged to settle
complaints through internal mechanisms, and
members of the public often ask their own
councillor for help in this. Local authorities
must also appoint a monitoring officer, whose
duties include ensuring that the local authority
acts lawfully when carrying out its business.
Complaints against inefficient or badly
managed local government may be
investigated by independent Commissions for
Local Administration, often known as ‘the
Local Ombudsman service’. There are three
Local Government Ombudsmen in England,
and one each in Wales and Scotland. A report
is issued on each complaint fully investigated
and, if injustice is found, the Local
Ombudsman normally proposes a solution.
The council must consider the report and
reply to it. In 2000—01 the Local Government
Ombudsmen for England received 19,179
complaints, 9% more than in 1999-2000.
In Northern Ireland a Commissioner for
Complaints deals with complaints alleging
injustices suffered as a result of
Non-domestic Revenue
maladministration by district councils and
certain other public bodies.
Pressure Groups
Pressure groups are informal organisations
which aim to influence the decision-making of
Parliament and Government, to the benefit of
their members and the causes they support.
There is a huge range of groups, covering
politics, business, employment, consumer
affairs, ethnic minorities, aid to developing
countries, foreign relations, education,
culture, defence, religion, sport, transport,
social welfare, animal welfare and the
environment. Some have over a million
members; others only a few. Some bring
pressure to bear on a number of different
issues; others are concerned with a single
subject. Some have come to play a recognised
role in the way the UK is governed; others
attempt to influence through radical protest.
Pressure groups operating at a national level
may affect how the UK is governed. Their
actions may simply highlight a particular
71
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
problem or their membership may point to
broad representation in a specific field. Ministers
have a duty to give fair consideration and due
weight to informed and impartial advice from
civil servants, so pressure groups often try to
guide the views of civil servants and in this way
influence the briefing they give to ministers.
Consultation to win the agreement and
cooperation of as wide a range of organisations
as possible and to ensure that laws and
regulations work properly is an important
principle in the UK government system.
In some cases a department has a legal
obligation to consult interested groups. The
Government has a duty to consult organised
interests, providing the pressure groups
involved have a broad enough membership for
them to represent a majority view, and that
they keep their discussions with the
department confidential. Members of pressure
groups often have direct expertise and an
awareness of what is practicable, and can
therefore offer useful advice to the
Government in forming policy or drafting
legislation. The contacts between civil
servants and pressure group representatives
may be relatively informal—by letter,
telephone or e-mail—or more formal, through
involvement in working parties or by giving
evidence to committees of inquiry.
Pressure Groups and Parliament
Lobbying—which means approaching MPs or
peers, persuading them to act on behalf of a
cause, and helping them do so by providing
advice and information—has substantially
increased in recent years. A common pressure
group approach is to ask members of the
public to write to their MP about an issue—
for example, the conditions in which certain
countries hold political prisoners—in order to
raise awareness and win the MP’s support in
Parliament.
Parliamentary Lobbyists
Many pressure groups employ full-time
parliamentary workers or liaison officers,
whose job is to develop contacts with MPs and
peers sympathetic to their cause, and to brief
them when issues affecting the group are
raised in Parliament. In 1998 the Government
issued guidance to civil servants who come
into contact with groups and people outside
the Government.
Some public relations and political
consultancy firms specialise in lobbying
Parliament and Government. They are
employed by pressure groups—as well as by
British and overseas companies and
organisations—to monitor parliamentary
business, and to promote their clients’
interests where they are affected by legislation
and debate.
Raising Issues in Parliament
Other ways through which pressure groups
may bring influence to bear include:
> suggesting to MPs or peers subjects for
Private Members’ Bills (see p. 54); many
pressure groups have ready-drafted bills
waiting to be sponsored;
> approaching MPs or peers to ask
Parliamentary Questions as a means of
gaining information from the
Government and of drawing public
attention to an issue;
> suggesting to MPs subjects for Early Day
Motions (see p. 57) and suggesting to
peers subjects for debates; and
> organising public petitions as a form of
protest against government policy, or to
call for action.
The UK in the European
Union
As a member of the European Union, the UK
is bound by the various types of European
Community (EC) legislation and wider
policies (for policies, see chapter 7). Almost all
UK government departments are involved in
EU-wide business, and European legislation is
an increasingly important element of
government.
The Community enacts legislation which is
binding on the national governments of the 15
member states or, in certain circumstances, on
individuals and companies within those states.
72
6: GOVERNMENT
British government ministers take part in the
discussions and decision-making, and the final
decision is taken collectively by all the
member states.
The UK Representative Office (UKREP),
based in Brussels, conducts most of the
negotiations on behalf of the UK
Government. The devolved administrations of
Scotland and Wales are also represented by
UKREP. In October 1999 an office
specifically aimed at helping to promote
Scotland’s interests within the EU opened in
Brussels; an office fulfilling the same role for
Wales opened in May 2000. Both operate in
close cooperation with UKREP.
There are three legislative bodies:
The Council of the European Union is
the main decision-making body. Member
states are represented by the ministers
appropriate to the subject under discussion.
When, for instance, education matters are
being discussed, the UK’s Secretary of State
for Education and Skills attends with his or
her European counterparts. The Presidency of
the Council changes at six-monthly intervals
and rotates in turn among the 15 member
states of the Union.
In some cases Council decisions must be
unanimous; in others taken by qualified
majority voting (a qualified majority being the
number of votes required for a decision to be
adopted) with votes weighted according to a
country’s population—currently ten each for
Germany, France, the United Kingdom and
Italy; eight for Spain; five each for Belgium,
Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal; four
each for Austria and Sweden; three each for
Denmark, Finland and the Irish Republic; and
two for Luxembourg. The threshold for the
qualified majority is set at 62 votes out of 87.
The European Council, which is not a
legislative body and usually meets twice a
year, comprises the heads of State or
Government accompanied by their foreign
ministers and the President of the European
Commission and one other Commissioner.
The Council defines general political
guidelines.
The European Commission is the
executive body. It implements the Council’s
decisions, initiates legislation and ensures that
member states put it into effect. Each of the 20
Commissioners, who are drawn from all
member states (there are two from the UK), is
responsible for a specific policy area, for
example, education, transport or agriculture.
The Commissioners are entirely independent
of their countries, and serve the EU as a whole.
The European Parliament, which plays
an increasingly important role in the
legislative process, has 626 directly elected
members (MEPs), including 87 from the
UK. The Parliament is consulted about
major decisions and has substantial shared
power with the Council of the European
Union over the EC budget. In areas of
legislation, its role varies between
consultation, where it can influence but does
not have the final say in the content of
legislation; the cooperation and assent
procedures, where its influence is greater;
and co-decision (introduced by the Maastricht
Treaty and extended in the Amsterdam
Treaty—see chapter 7), where a proposal
requires the agreement of both the Council
and the European Parliament.
Elections to the Parliament take place
every five years, most recently in June 1999.
In the UK, these were held under a
proportional voting system,13 bringing the
country in line with the other member states.

Wales, under which an elector may cast his or her vote for a
party list of candidates. England is divided into nine regions while
Scotland and Wales each constitute one region. These I I
regions each return between four and I I MEPs, depending on
the size of the electorate of each region. Northern Ireland,
which also constitutes one region, continues to use the single
transferable vote system to return its three MEPs.
73
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The European Parliament meets in full
session in Strasbourg for about one week
every month, although its committee work
normally takes place in Brussels.
EC legislation is issued in some areas
jointly by the Council of the European Union
and the European Parliament, by the Council
in other areas, or by the Commission under
delegated powers. It consists of Regulations,
Directives and Decisions.
> Regulations are directly applicable in all
member states, and have the force of law
without the need for implementing
further measures;
> Directives are equally binding as to the
result to be achieved but allow each
member state to choose the form and
method of implementation; and
> Decisions, like Regulations, do not
normally need national implementing
legislation. They are binding on those to
whom they are addressed.
Other EU Institutions
Each member state provides one of the judges
to serve in the European Court of Justice,
which is the final authority on all aspects of
Community law. Its rulings must be applied
by member states, and fines can be imposed
on those failing to do so. The Court is assisted
by a Court of First Instance, which handles
certain cases brought by individuals and
companies. The UK is also represented on the
Court of Auditors, which examines
Community revenue and expenditure, to see
that it is legally received and spent.

The United Kingdom is a democratic country with global foreign policy
interests and an economy heavily dependent on international trade and
investment. The Government supports the maintenance of an open and stable
international order. UK membership of the United Nations (UN), the European
Union (EU), the Commonwealth, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO) and other major international organisations remains central to policy
to achieve this objective.
INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS
United Nations
The UK is a founder member of the UN and
one of the five permanent members of the
Security Council, along with China, France,
Russia and the United States. It supports the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter,
including the maintenance of international
peace and security, the development of
friendly relations among nations, the
achievement of international cooperation on
economic, social, cultural and humanitarian
issues, and the protection of human rights and
fundamental freedoms. The UK is the fifth
largest contributor to the UN regular budget
and to peacekeeping operations, and one of the
biggest voluntary contributors to UN funds,
programmes and agencies. In order to enhance
the UN’s effectiveness, the UK is advocating
modernisation of the organisation, including
reform of the Security Council’s composition.
The L K is also committed to the
reinforcement of the UN’s role in preventing
and resolving conflicts around the world.
European Union
The UK is a member of the EU (see also pp.
72 and 81—5), which promotes social and
economic progress among its members, a
common foreign and security policy,
European citizenship and police and judicial
cooperation in criminal matters. The other
14 EL Member States are Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
the Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
The Commonwealth
There are 54 members of the Commonwealth,
including the UK. It is a voluntary association
of independent states, nearly all of which were
75
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
once British territories, and includes almost
one in three people in the world. The
members are Antigua and Barbuda, Australia,
the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belize,
Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, Cameroon,
Canada, Cyprus, Dominica, Fiji,1 The
Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guyana, India,
Jamaica, Kenya, Kiribati, Lesotho, Malawi,
Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Nauru, New Zealand,
Nigeria, Pakistan,2 Papua New Guinea, St
Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the
Grenadines, Samoa, Seychelles, Sierra Leone,
Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Sri
Lanka, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tonga, Trinidad
and Tobago, Tuvalu, Uganda, United
Kingdom, Vanuatu, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The Queen is head of the Commonwealth
and is head of state in the UK and 15 other
member countries. The Commonwealth
Secretariat, based in London, is the main
agency for multilateral communication
between member governments on matters
relevant to the Commonwealth as a whole.
The Secretariat promotes consultation and
cooperation, disseminates information, and
helps host governments to organise Heads of
Government Meetings (normally held
biennially), ministerial meetings and other
conferences. It administers assistance
programmes agreed at these meetings,
including the Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Cooperation, which provides
advisory services and training to
Commonwealth developing countries.
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
Membership of NATO is central to UK
defence policy (see p. 100). NATO’s stated
functions are to:
> help provide security and stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area;
> provide a transatlantic forum for
Member States to consult on issues of
common concern;
1 Fiji was suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth in
June 2000 following a declaration of martial law by the Fiji
military in response to an internal security crisis.
2 Pakistan was suspended from the councils of the
Commonwealth in October 1999 following a military coup.
> deter and defend against any threat to the
territory of any NATO member state;
> contribute to crisis management and
conflict prevention on a case-by-case
basis; and
> promote partnership, cooperation and
dialogue with other countries in the
Euro-Atlantic area.
Each of the 19 Member States—Belgium,
Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary , Iceland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland,
Portugal, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom
and the United States—has a permanent
representative at NATO headquarters in
Brussels. The main decision-taking body is the
North Atlantic Council. It meets at least twice a
year at foreign minister level, and weekly at the
level of permanent representatives. Defence
ministers also meet at least twice a year.
Group of Eight
The UK is one of the Group of Eight (G8)
leading industrialised countries. The other
members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Russia (included as a full member from
1998, although the other countries continue to
function as the G7 for some discussions) and
the United States. The G8 is an informal group
with no secretariat. Its Presidency rotates each
year among the members, the key meeting being
an annual summit of heads of government.
Originally formed in 1975 (as the G7) to discuss
economic issues, the G8 agenda now includes a
wide range of foreign affairs and international
issues such as terrorism, nuclear safety, the
environment, UN reform and development
assistance. Heads of state or government agree a
communique issued at the end of summits. I he
G8 summit meeting in July 2001 was hosted by
the Italian Government in Genoa.
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The UK is a member of the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE),
a regional security organisation whose 55
participating states are from Europe, Central
Asia and North America. All decisions are

taken by consensus. The OSCE is based in
\ ienna, where the UK has a permanent
delegation. The main areas of work are:
> early warning and prevention of potential
conflicts through field missions and
diplomacy and the work of the OSCE
High Commissioner on National
Minorities;
> observing elections and providing advice
on human rights, democracy and law,
and media;
> post-conflict rehabilitation, including
civil society development; and
> promoting security through arms control
and military confidence-building.
Council of Europe
The UK is a founding member of the Council
of Europe, which is open to any European state
accepting parliamentary democracy, the rule of
the law and fundamental human rights. There
are 43 full Member States. One of the Council’s
main achievements is the European Convention
on Human Rights in 1950 (see p. 92).
Other International Bodies
The UK belongs to many other international
bodies, including: the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), which regulates the international
financial system and provides credit for
member countries facing balance-of-payments
difficulties; the World Bank, which provides
loans to finance economic and social projects
in developing countries; the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD), which promotes economic growth,
support for less developed countries and
worldwide trade expansion; and the World
Trade Organisation (WTO—see p. 418).
Other organisations to which Britain belongs
or extends support include the regional
development banks in Africa, the Caribbean,
Latin America and Asia, and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
OVERSEAS TERRITORIES
The UK’s Overseas Territories (OTs) have a
combined population of nearly 180,000. The
territories are listed on p. 80. Most have
considerable self-government, with their own
legislatures. Governors appointed by the
Queen are responsible for external affairs,
internal security and defence. Most domestic
matters are delegated to locally elected
governments and legislatures. Ultimate
responsibility for government rests with the
UK. The British Indian Ocean Territory, the
British Antarctic Territory, and South
Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands have
non-resident Commissioners, not Governors.
The UK aims to provide the OTs with
security and political stability, ensure efficient
and honest government, and help them
achieve economic and social advancement.
None of the Territories has expressed a desire
for independence from the UK.
The UK Government is proposing to offer
British citizenship to all those OT residents
who do not already have it and who wish to
take it up.:' The necessary legislation is
currently before Parliament.
Offshore financial service industries are of
major importance in several of the Territories.
The UK Government’s policy is to ensure that
international standards of regulation are met and
that effective steps are taken to combat financial
crime and regulatory abuse. An independent
review of financial regulation in the Caribbean
OTs and Bermuda, commissioned jointly by the
OT Governments, Foreign & Commonwealth
Office (FCO—see p. 96) and HM Treasure, was
published in October 2000.
An OT Department within the FCO
provides a single focus and direct point of
contact with the UK Government, although
Gibraltar, because of its EU status, is dealt
with primarily by the FCO’s European
Departments. The Department for
International Development (DFID—see
pp. 93-7) also has an OT Unit, which
administers aid to Anguilla, the British Virgin
Islands, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos
Islands, St Helena (and Ascension Island and
Tristan da Cunha) and Pitcairn. An OT
3 The offer of right of abode is on a non-reciprocal basis, as the
territories do not have the capacity to absorb uncontrolled
numbers of new residents. The UK Government’s decision on
this follows the precedent set by Gibraltar and the Falkland
Islands, whose existing right of abode is also non-reciprocal.

7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Consultative Council, comprising the Chief
Minister or equivalent from each territory and
British ministers (and chaired by the relevant
FCO minister), convened its second annual
meeting in October 2000.
Falkland Islands
The Falkland Islands are the subject of a
territorial claim by Argentina. The UK
Government does not accept the Argentine
claim and is committed to defending the
Islanders’ right to live under a government of
their own choice. This right of self-
determination is enshrined in the 1985
Falkland Islands Constitution.
The UK and Argentina, while sticking to
their respective positions on sovereignty,
maintain diplomatic relations and continue to
discuss their common interests in the South
Atlantic region, such as fisheries conservation
and the exploitation of oil reserves.
Gibraltar
Spain ceded Gibraltar to Britain in perpetuity
under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht but has long
sought its return. However, the UK is
committed to the principle, set out in the
preamble to the 1969 Gibraltar Constitution,
that it will never enter into arrangements under
which the people of Gibraltar would pass under
the sovereignty of another state against their
freely and democratically expressed wishes.
Gibraltar has an elected House of
Assembly, and responsibility for a range of
"defined domestic matters’ is devolved to
elected local ministers. The Territory is
within the EU, as part of the United Kingdom
Member State, although it is outside the
common customs system and does not
participate in the Common Agricultural or
Fisheries Policies or the EU’s value added tax
arrangements. The people of Gibraltar have
been declared UK nationals for EU purposes.
EUROPEAN UNION
The Treaties
The Union had its origins in the post-Second
World War resolve by Western European
nations, particularly France and Germany, to
prevent further conflict and establish lasting
peace and stability.
Rome Treaty
The 1957 Rome Treaty, establishing the
European Community, defined its aims as the
harmonious development of economic
activities, a continuous and balanced economic
expansion and an accelerated rise in the
standard of living. These objectives w ere to be
achieved by the creation of a common internal
market, including the elimination of customs
duties between Member States, free
movement of goods, people, services and
capital, and the elimination of distortions in
competition within this market. These aims
were reaffirmed by the 1986 Single European
Act, which agreed measures to complete the
single market (see p. 83). The UK joined the
European Community in 1973.
Under the Rome Treaty, the European
Commission speaks on behalf of the UK and
the other Member States in international trade
negotiations. The Commission negotiates on a
mandate agreed by the Council of the
European Union. (For further information on
overseas trade, see chapter 24.)
Maastricht Treaty
The 1992 Maastricht Treaty amended the
Rome Treaty and made other new
commitments, including moves towards
economic and monetary union (see p. 82). It
established the European Union (EU), which
comprises the European Community and
intergovernmental arrangements for a
Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CF SP—see p. 84) and lor increased
cooperation on justice and home affairs policy
issues (see p. 85). It also enshrined the
principle of subsidiarity under which, in areas
where the Community and Member States
share competence, action should be taken at
European level only if its objectives cannot be
achieved by Member States acting alone and
can be better achieved by the Community. In
addition, the Treaty introduced the concept of
EU citizenship as a supplement to national
citizenship.
81
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Amsterdam Treaty
In 1996 an intergovernmental conference
considered further treaty amendments. This
resulted in the Amsterdam Treaty, which
entered into force in 1999. It provides for the
further protection and extension of citizen’s
rights; integration of the social chapter (a
separate protocol to the Maastricht Treaty)
into the Treaty, following its adoption by the
UK; new mechanisms to improve the
coordination and effectiveness of the CFSP;
an increase in the areas subject to co-decision
between the Council of Ministers and
European Parliament, and simplification of
the co-decision procedure (see p. 73); and a
binding protocol on subsidiarity.
Treaty Ratification
Any amendments to the Treaties must be
agreed unanimously and must then be ratified
by each Member State according to its own
constitutional procedures. In the UK, Treaty
ratifications must be approved by Parliament
before they can come into force.
Economic and Monetary Union
The Maastricht Treaty envisaged the
achievement of economic and monetary union
in preparatory stages, culminating in the
adoption on 1 January 1999 of a single
currency (the euro). In May 1998 a meeting of
EU heads of state and government agreed that
11 of the 15 EU Member States (excluding the
UK, Denmark, Greece and Sweden) would
take part in the single currency from its launch
date. It also agreed the establishment of the
European Central Bank (ECB) from June
1998.
On 1 January 1999 conversion rates
between currencies of qualifying countries and
the euro were legally fixed. The euro became
the legal currency in those countries and the
ECB assumed responsibility for formulating
the monetary policy of the euro area. Since no
euro banknotes or coins will be available until
1 January 2002, national currencies will
continue to exist in parallel with the euro and
national banknotes and coins will be used for
all cash transactions.
Nice Treaty
This Treaty was agreed in December 2000
at the Nice European Council and signed in
February 2001. Subject to ratification, it
would introduce changes to the EU’s
institutional machinery in preparation for
enlargement (see below). From 2005 the
number of votes for each EU country in the
Council of the European Union (see p. 73)
would be altered to take account of
prospective new members, the total
number rising from the 87 votes for the
current 15 Member States up to 342 votes
for 27 Member States. The UK, Germany,
France and Italy would each have 29 votes.
The total needed for a qualified majority
would increase from 62 to 255, and lor a
blocking minority from 26 to 88. Qualified
majority voting would be extended to a 5
more areas, including trade in some
services, aspects of asylum and immigration
policy, regulation of the European Court of
Justice, and decisions on senior EU
appointments. Also from 2005 the
European Commission would be composed
of one member from each country, up to
27. The Treaty would create amended
arrangements for groups of countries
within the EU to pursue closer cooperation
on certain issues without involving every
Member State.
Greece, having earlier failed the economic
convergence criteria, joined the euro zone on
1 January 2001. The UK Government’s policy
towards joining the single currency is
described in chapter 22 (see p. 385).
Enlargement
Enlargement of the EU—to include those
European nations sharing its democratic
values and aims, which are functioning market
economies, able to compete in the EU and to
take on the obligations of membership—is a
key policy objective for the Union. In 1998 an
accession process with the applicant states was
launched, and formal negotiations started with
Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Estonia, Cyprus
and the Czech Republic. Then, in 1999, the
82
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
EL agreed to invite six other countries—
Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania
and Slovakia—to open accession negotiations
(which were launched in February 2000), and
also confirmed Turkey’s candidature for
membership.
In 1999 the European Council agreed the
EL's budgetary arrangements for the period
2000-06 (see below), including making
financial provision for the first new Member
States to join the Union in that period.
Following an EL intergovernmental
conference, convened in February 2000, the
Treaty of Nice was negotiated, which would
provide (upon its entry into force) for the
institutional changes necessarv for
enlargement.
European Community Budget
The Community’s revenue consists of levies
on agricultural imports from non-member
countries, customs duties, the proceeds of
value added tax (VAT) receipts and
contributions from Member States based on
gross national product (GNP).
In 1999 the European Council agreed on
budgetary amendments. The ‘own resources’
system for financing the EU maintains the
current ceiling of 1.27% of GNP; but,
progressively from 2001, more revenue will be
raised from contributions linked to GNP and
less from \ AT receipts and customs
payments. It was also agreed that the UK’s
annual budget rebate (in place since 1984, and
without which the British net contribution
would be far greater than that justified by its
share of Community GNP) would remain.
Single Market
The single European market, providing for
the free movement of people, goods, services
and capital within the EU, came into effect in
1993 (see also p. 417). It covers, among other
benefits, the removal of customs barriers, the
liberalisation of capital movements, the
opening of public procurement markets and
the mutual recognition of professional
qualifications.
Under the European Economic Area (EEA)
Agreement, which came into force in 1994,
most of the EU single market measures have
been extended to Iceland, Norway and
Liechtenstein. EEA Member States comprise
the world’s largest trading bloc, accounting for
40% of all global trade.
Agriculture and Fisheries
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) was
designed to secure food supplies and to
stabilise markets. It also, however, created
overproduction and unwanted food surpluses,
placing a burden on the Community’s budget.
The Common Fisheries Policy is concerned
with the conservation and management of
fishery resources. See chapter 26 for further
details of these policies, and of the UK’s
support for radical CAP reform to meet the
challenges posed by the WTO and bv
enlargement.
Regional and Infrastructure
Development
The economic and social disparities within the
EU are considerable, and will become more
evident with further enlargement. To address
the regional imbalances there are Structural
Funds designed to promote economic
development in underdeveloped regions and
regenerate regions affected by industrial
decline (see also p. 393).
Infrastructure projects and industrial
investments are financed by the European
Regional Development Fund. The European
Social Fund supports training and employment
measures for the unemployed and young
people. The Guidance Section of the European
Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund
supports agricultural restructuring and some
rural development measures. The Financial
Instrument of Fisheries Guidance promotes the
modernisation of the fishing industry. A
Cohesion Fund, set up under the Maastricht
Treaty, provides financial help to reduce
disparities between EU members’ economies.
Other initiatives promote new economic
activities in regions affected by the
restructuring of traditional industries, such as
steel, coal and shipbuilding. There are also
funds to help prepare the candidate countries
for accession to the EU.
83
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Funding levels for the Structural and
Cohesion Funds in the financial period
2000-06 were agreed by the European Council
in 1999. The UK will receive over £10 billion.
The European Investment Bank, a non-
profit-making institution, lends at competitive
interest rates to public and private capital
investment projects in the EU and in
candidate countries. It also provides money
through the European Investment Fund for
venture capital initiatives.
Economic Reform
In March 2000 the Portuguese Presidency
hosted a special European Council in Lisbon
on Economic Reform, Employment and Social
Inclusion. Member States agreed the UK’s
proposal that the EU should set itself the
target of becoming, by 2010, the most
competitive and dynamic knowledge-based
economy in the world, capable of sustainable
economic growth with more and better jobs
and greater social cohesion. The objectives of
the programme include:
> expanding access to the Internet and
e-commerce;
> improving the internal market in
services, updating public procurement
rules, and reducing state aids;
> improving coordination of national
research and development (R&D)
programmes, and adopting by the end of
2001 a Community patent;
> removing barriers to small business
growth;
> promoting education, training and
employability, giving higher priority to
lifelong learning and basic IT skills;
> combating social exclusion and poverty
through targeting specific groups (such
as minorities or the disabled); and
> modernising social protection systems (in
particular, pensions).
The European Council in Stockholm in
March 2001 (the first of regular Council
sessions reviewing economic reform to be held
every spring) focused on the ten-year
programme set out at Lisbon. 1 he Council
agreed, in particular, on rapid implementation
of a comprehensive plan to liberalise financial
services, and made a commitment to open up
EU energy markets. The European Council in
Gothenburg in June 2001 agreed a strategy for
sustainable development to add an
environmental dimension to the process of
economic reform.
Common Foreign and Security Policy
The intergovernmental CFSP, dating from
1993, provides for EU Member States to agree
unanimously common policies and/or joint
actions on a wide range of international issues.
The Treaty of Amsterdam introduced
changes to make the policy more effective,
including the appointment of a High
Representative to help with the formulation,
preparation and presentation of CFSP policy
decisions, and the establishment of a Policy
Planning and Early Warning Unit in the
Council Secretariat to sharpen the preparation
and focus of CFSP decisions. The Amsterdam
Treaty preserves the principle that all policy
should be decided by unanimity, but states
that decisions implementing common
strategies, which are themselves agreed by
unanimity, will be by qualified majority
voting. A Member State may prevent a vote
being taken by qualified majority voting for
‘important and stated reasons of national
policy’. It may also abstain and stand aside
from an EU decision/action when its interests
are not affected.
European Security and Defence Policy
In 1998 the UK launched an initiative to
strengthen the EU’s capacity to respond to
crises, on the basis that, if the Emion is to play
a coherent and effective political role, this
needs to be underpinned by a credible
European military capability. Hitherto, the
EU had looked to the Western European
Union (WEU)4 to carry out such military
crisis management activity on its behalf.
4 WEU ministers agreed in November 2000 to close down the
WEU as an operational body, to be replaced by a smaller
residual structure in 2001.
84
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
In support of this initiative, the European
Council in December 1999 agreed to develop
by 2003 the capability to deploy up to 60,000
ground troops, with naval and air support as
appropriate, able to deal with the full range of
crisis management tasks. At the maximum
scale of operation, the UK could contribute up
to 12,500 ground troops, 18 warships and 72
combat aircraft. Collective defence remains
the responsibility of NATO, which will also
continue to have a major role in crisis
management (see also p. 100).
Justice and Home Affairs
The Maastricht Treaty established
intergovernmental arrangements for increased
cooperation among EU states on justice and
home affairs issues. These issues include visa,
asylum, immigration and other policies related
to free movement of people; and police,
customs and judicial cooperation in criminal
matters (including cooperation through
EUROPOL—see p. 93). This is a growing
aspect of EU work and, since the entry into
force of the Amsterdam Treaty, has both
Community-based and intergovernmental-
based areas of cooperation. A protocol annexed
to the Amsterdam Treaty recognises the UK’s
right to exercise its own frontier controls.
REGIONAL RELATIONS
Central and Eastern Europe and
Central Asia
European Security
In 1990 the UK and its NATO allies, together
with former adversaries in the Warsaw Pact
Communist bloc, set up the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council to promote
understanding. In 1994 NATO invited the
non-Alliance states in Central and Eastern
Europe and Central Asia to join a Partnership
for Peace programme, a form of association
which, among other things, enlists the
Partners’ assistance in peacekeeping
operations. The Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council was set up in 1997 to develop closer
political and military links between NATO
countries and non-members.
The UK played a significant role in
negotiations leading to:
> the 1997 Founding Act between NATO
Member States and Russia, introducing
new mechanisms for a permanent
relationship;
> a NATO-Ukraine partnership charter,
also signed in 1997; and
> the accession to NATO in 1999 of the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.
Economic Help
The UK and other Western countries
continue to help deal with the economic
problems following the fall of Communism,
and to promote the development of market
economies. The IMF provides support for
stabilisation programmes and the World Bank
finance for structural reform to nearly all
countries in the region. This is further
bolstered by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development’s
investments and its role in facilitating
additional private investment. The EU’s
PHARE scheme5 is primarily devoted to
aiding Central European countries in the
process of reform and development of their
infrastructure. A new aid programme—
Community Assistance for Association,
Democratisation and Stabilisation
(CARDS)—is focused on countries in the
Western Balkans. Countries of the former
Soviet Union (excluding Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania) and Mongolia receive help through
a parallel programme (TACIS),6 which
concentrates on democratisation, financial
services, transport, energy (including nuclear
safety) and public administration reform.
The UK’s Export Credits Guarantee
Department (ECGD) provides insurance
cover for exporters to a number of these
countries.
5 An aid programme for economic restructuring in Central
Europe, which consists of many individual projects and
operations to underpin the process of reform. It was initially
applicable to Poland and Hungary, but has since been extended
to other countries in Central Europe.
6 An EU aid programme providing technical assistance to
recipient countries.
85
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Association and Co-operation Agreements
The EU has strengthened relations with
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,
Slovakia and Slovenia by signing Europe
(Association) Agreements with them. The
agreements provide an institutional framework
to support the process of integration, and
anticipate accession of these countries to the
EU when they are able to assume the
obligations of membership (see p. 82).
EU Partnership and Co-operation
Agreements are in force with Russia, Ukraine,
Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. Trade
and Co-operation Agreements with Albania
and Macedonia are also in force. The purpose
of these agreements is to reduce trade barriers,
develop wide-ranging cooperation and
increase political dialogue.
The EU is promoting closer links through
Stabilisation and Association Agreements
(SAA) with states in south-eastern Europe,
provided that they meet the EU’s conditions
on democracy, electoral and media reform,
and respect for human rights. The first
Stabilisation and Association Agreement, with
Macedonia, was signed in April 2001. An SAA
with Croatia was initialled in May 2001.
Middle East
Arab-lsraeli Peace Process
The UK supported the breakthrough in the
Middle East peace process in 1993, when
Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation (PLO) agreed to mutual
recognition and signed a declaration on
interim self-government for the Palestinians in
Israeli-held territories occupied since 1967.
The first stage of the declaration was
implemented in 1994, when the Palestinians
adopted self-government in the Gaza Strip
and the Jericho area. A peace treaty between
Israel and Jordan was also signed in that year.
The UK has continued to encourage peace
talks between Israel, Syria and Lebanon.
In 1995 Israel and the PLO reached an
agreement providing for a phased Israeli
troop withdrawal from occupied Palestinian
areas of the West Bank and for elections to
a new Palestinian Council with legislative
and executive powers. The UK took part in
the EU-coordinated observation of the
Palestinian elections in 1996.
Progress in the process since then has been
far from smooth, with frequent disruptions
over political and security concerns. The UK
has sought to complement the mediation
efforts of the United States, based on the
conviction that a lasting resolution must both
protect Israel’s security and provide a just
exchange of land for peace; and, with its EU
partners, it has reaffirmed the Palestinian
right to self-determination including the
option of statehood.
The British Government has expressed its
concern over the serious escalation of violence
between Israelis and Palestinians which has
continued since September 2000 and is
undermining prospects for peace.
Iraq
The UK condemned Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait
in 1990 and supported all UN Security Council
resolutions designed to force Iraqi withdrawal
and restore international legality. Because of
Iraq’s failure to withdraw, its forces were
expelled in 1991 by an international coalition
led by the United States, the UK, France and
Saudi Arabia, acting under a UN mandate.
UN sanctions against Iraq, imposed at that
time, still remain in force (although with
substantial humanitarian exemptions), because
Iraq has failed to comply with the relevant
Security Council resolutions, particularly those
relating to the supervision of the elimination of
its weapons of mass destruction. In 1999 the
UK drafted and co-sponsored a further
Security Council resolution creating the UN
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission (as the successor organisation to
the former UN Special Commission on Iraq, or
UNSCOM). The same resolution lifted the
ceiling on Iraq’s oil exports and expanded the
humanitarian programme for Iraq.
In order to protect the Shia minority in
southern Iraq and the Kurdish population in
the north against attacks by Iraqi regime forces,
UK and US warplanes continue to patrol ‘no-
fly’ zones over southern and northern Iraq,
established after the war in 1991.
86
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Mediterranean
The UK and other EU Member States are
developing, on the basis of the Barcelona
Declaration of 1995, closer links with 12
Mediterranean partners with the aim of
promoting peace and prosperity in the region.
Libya has also been invited to sign up to the
Declaration. Association Agreements covering
political dialogue, free trade and cooperation
in a number of areas are already in force with
several Mediterranean countries. In
November 2000 EU and Mediterranean
ministers reaffirmed the goal of a free trade
area by 2010.
Asia-Pacific Region
The UK has well-established relations with
Japan, China, the Republic of Korea, many
South East Asian nations, Australia and New
Zealand, and has defence links with some
countries in the region. British commercial
activity has developed through increased trade
and investment and the setting up of business
councils, joint commissions or industrial
cooperation agreements. The UK is also
taking advantage of increased opportunities
for English language teaching, cooperation in
science and technology, and educational
exchanges.
The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process
was inaugurated in 1996. ASEM is intended to
foster closer economic and political ties
between EU countries and Brunei, China,
Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines,
Thailand and Vietnam. The third ASEM was
hosted in Seoul by the Government of the
Republic of Korea in October 2000.
Agreement was reached between the UK
and North Korea in December 2000 to
establish diplomatic relations.
The UK and its EU and G8 partners
continue to encourage India and Pakistan to
join international nuclear non-proliferation
regimes (see p. 90) and reduce bilateral tension
over the disputed territory of Kashmir.
In 1998 Britain rejoined the South Pacific
Commission, having withdrawn from
membership in 1995. The Commission
provides technical advice and assistance to its
Pacific Island members, with which the UK
has long-standing and Commonwealth ties.
Hong Kong
In 1997 the UK returned Hong Kong to
Chinese sovereignty under the provisions of
the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which
guarantees that Hong Kong’s way of life,
including its rights and freedoms, will remain
unchanged for 50 years from the handover. As
set out in the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong is
a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China. The SAR Government enjoys a high
degree of autonomy, except in foreign affairs
and defence, which are the responsibility of
the Chinese Government in Beijing.
The UK is represented in Hong Kong by
one of the largest British diplomatic posts in
the world. It continues to have responsibilities
towards Hong Kong and the 3.5 million
British passport holders living there. Hong
Kong is the UK’s second largest export
market in Asia.
The Americas
The British Government considers that the
close transatlantic links between the UK, the
United States and Canada remain essential to
guarantee the security and prosperity of
Europe and North America.
The UK and the US cooperate closely on
nuclear, defence and intelligence matters. As
founding members of NATO, Britain and the
US are deeply involved in Western defence
arrangements and, as permanent members of
the UN Security Council, work closely
together on major international issues. In
addition, there are important economic links.
1 he US is the UK’s largest trading partner—
UK exports of goods and services in 1999
amounted to £39.8 billion. Also, the UK and
US are each other’s biggest source of inward
investment—in 1999 UK investment
represented 18.6% of total foreign direct
investment in the US, while 18.7% of total
US overseas investment (36% of US
investment in Europe) was in the UK.
Strong political and economic links are
maintained with Canada, with which the UK
shares membership of the Commonwealth,
NATO and other key international
87
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
organisations. The UK is the second largest
investor in Canada (after the US) and Canada
is the fifth largest investor in the UK.
Important British connections with Latin
America date from the participation of British
volunteers in the wars of independence in the
early 19th century. Greater democracy and
freer market economies in the region have
enabled Britain to strengthen its relations with
Latin America. The UK is now one of the
largest investors in the region after the United
States. The first summit of EU, Latin
American and Caribbean heads of state and
government (representing 48 countries) was
held in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, with the aim of
building a strategic partnership between the
two regions based around a political,
economic and cultural dialogue. Progress
will be reviewed at the next summit in Spain
in 2002.
The first UK/Caribbean Forum, held in
1998 in Nassau, Bahamas, marked the
beginning of a new longer-term process of
cooperation between the UK and the
countries of the region. The second meeting,
hosted by the British Government, in London
in May 2000, agreed initiatives to encourage
new investment in the Caribbean region, and
to promote educational and judicial links.
Africa
The UK Government is giving political and
practical support to efforts to prevent or end
African conflicts; promoting trade, reducing
debt and supporting development for lasting
prosperity; and supporting African
governments, organisations and individuals
espousing the principles of democracy,
accountability, the rule of law and human
rights. The first EU-Africa summit was held
in Cairo, Egypt, in 2000.
Since the abolition of apartheid and the
election of the first African National Congress
government in 1994, South Africa’s relations
with the UK have broadened into areas
ranging from development assistance to
military advice, and from sporting links to
scientific cooperation. There has also been a
steady flow of state and ministerial visits to
and from South Africa. The UK is South
Africa’s largest single trading partner, and
largest foreign investor. Both countries are
committed to build on this relationship by
promoting the further expansion of bilateral
trade and investment. A trade, development
and cooperation agreement between the EU
and South Africa was signed in 1999,
providing for the creation of a free trade area
and for further substantial development
assistance from the EU.
PEACEKEEPING
The UN is the principal body responsible for
the maintenance of international peace and
security. At the end of 2000 there were some
42,800 troops, military observers and police
officers from 89 nations deployed to 16
peacekeeping operations around the world.
As the fifth largest contributor to the UN’s
peacekeeping budgets, meeting around 7% of
the estimated US$2.5 billion costs, the UK
has provided civilian police, military observers
and troops for a wide range of UN missions.
The UK contributes personnel to UN-led or
UN-authorised operations in Bosnia, Kosovo,
Iraq, Cyprus, Democratic Republic of Congo,
East Timor, Georgia and Sierra Leone.
Cyprus
The UK has a contingent of 314 troops in the
UN Force in Cyprus, established in 1964 to
help prevent the recurrence of fighting
between Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Since
the hostilities of 1974, when Turkish forces
occupied the northern part of the island, the
Force has been responsible for monitoring the
ceasefire and for control of a buffer zone
between the two communities.
Iraq/Kuwait
In 1991 UN Security Council Resolution 687
established a demilitarised zone extending 10
km into Iraq and 5 km into Kuwait to deter
violations of the boundary and to observe
hostile or potentially hostile actions. The UK,
with the other permanent members of the
Security Council, contributes 11 personnel to
the UN Iraq/Kuwait observer mission.
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Sierra Leone
In May 2000 there was a serious deterioration
in the security situation in war-torn Sierra
Leone as members of the UN peacekeeping
mission there were taken hostage by rebel
forces. In response, the UK Government
rapidly deployed to Sierra Leone around 600
British soldiers from the Parachute Regiment,
supported by a Royal Navy amphibious group
including 600 Royal Marines. Their objectives
were to evacuate entitled personnel and to
secure the main airport near the capital,
Freetown, while the UN forces (UNAMSIL)
were built up. Having achieved these aims, the
British force was withdrawn and British
training teams were deployed from June 2000
to help establish new, accountable Sierra
Leone armed forces and a police force. By
September 2001 around 8,500 soldiers had
been trained and equipped by the UK, which
continues to help the Government of Sierra
Leone and UNAMSIL to regain control over
the whole country and prepare for democratic
elections.
Bosnia and Herzegovina
The UK supports the establishment of a
peaceful, multi-ethnic and democratic
Bosnia and Herzegovina, and is helping to
implement the 1995 Dayton/Paris Peace
Agreement. The Stabilisation Force (SFOR),
around 20,000-strong in mid-2001, comprises
troops from NATO nations and other
contributing countries, including Russia and a
number of other Partnership for Peace
members (see p. 100). The UK contributes
some 1,700 troops to SFOR and around 80
British police officers to the UN International
Police Task Force in Bosnia.
The main task of SFOR is to ensure
continuing compliance with the military
aspects of the Dayton Agreement, including
monitoring the actions of the armed forces
within the territory and inspecting weapon
sites. It also provides support to the main
organisations responsible for the civil aspects
of the Agreement, including the Office of the
High Representative, the International Police
Task Force, the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, the OSCE and the UN Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The UK is helping the International
Criminal Tribunal in The Hague, which was
set up to try those indicted for war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia. With other SFOR
contributors, British forces have detained
several of those indicted. As well as
contributing to the funding of the Tribunal,
the UK provides staff, information and
forensic science expertise.
The UK is spending over £16 million in
humanitarian and reconstruction aid in
1999-2002; it also contributes through the
EU, OSCE and UN.
Kosovo
From early 1998 there was increasing
international concern over the deteriorating
situation in the province of Kosovo in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY—
comprising Serbia and Montenegro) and its
implications for regional stability in south¬
eastern Europe. Excessive repression by
Serbian security forces against the
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population,
and terrorism by Kosovo Albanian extremists,
prompted widespread condemnation and calls
for a peaceful solution based on the territorial
integrity of the FRY and autonomy for
Kosovo.
The situation worsened at the beginning of
1999, and a peace conference broke up in mid-
March with the refusal of the Yugoslav
delegation to accept settlement proposals.
Later that month the UK and other NATO
countries began intensive air operations
against targets in the FRY in pursuit of a
resolution to the Kosovo crisis.
In June 1999 the Yugoslav Parliament and
Government accepted peace terms presented
by special EU and Russian envoys. These
entailed the withdrawal of Serbian security
forces from Kosovo and deployment of an
international security presence (with NATO
participation at its core), enabling the return
of displaced persons and refugees to their
homes. With the subsequent authorisation of
the UN, a multinational force (KFOR—
including around 10,000 British troops)
deployed into Kosovo with the task of
restoring peace to the province. About 3,500
UK troops were still in Kosovo in mid-2001.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The UK is also providing some 200 civilian
police, specialist officers, local government
administrators and judicial experts to the UN-
led civilian administration, which is helping to
establish self-government in the province.
Other Developments in the Balkans
The UK welcomed the overthrow of the
regime of Slobodan Milosevic in the FRY in
October 2000 and the establishment of an
elected, democratic government. The
Government pressed the new FRY
administration under President Kostunica to
hand Milosevic over to the International
Criminal Tribunal in The Hague (p. 89) to
stand trial for war crimes, and in June 2001
he was extradited.
All five states that emerged from the
former Yugoslavia have now elected
democratic leaders, but tensions remain. From
February 2001, incursions into Macedonia
from Kosovo developed into serious armed
conflict between ethnic Albanian groups and
the Macedonian security forces. In March
2001 EU leaders expressed support for the
Government and territorial integrity of
Macedonia, and condemned the Albanian
insurgency. In August and September UK
forces participated in a NATO deployment to
collect and destroy weapons from ethnic
Albanian groups. This operation, approved at
the end of June 2001, took place while a
framework agreement providing a lasting
constitutional solution was under debate in the
Macedonian Parliament.
ARMS CONTROL
Because of the global reach of modern
weapons, the UK has a clear national interest
in preventing proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and promoting international
control.
Weapons of Mass Destruction
Nuclear Weapons
The main instrument for controlling
nuclear weapons is the 1968 Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),
to which the UK Government is committed.
The UK helped secure its indefinite extension
in 1995, and played an active role in the sixth
review conference in 2000 (where, for the first
time since 1985, all participants agreed a final
document which reviewed progress on nuclear
non-proliferation and disarmament over the
previous five years, and set out an agenda for
the next five).
The UK was also involved in the
negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), which it signed in 1996 and
ratified in 1998. The CTBT, with its
permanent verification system, will come into
force upon ratification by the remaining 13 of
44 named states. The UK Government is also
pressing for the negotiation of a treaty banning
the future production of fissile material for use
in nuclear weapons.
While large nuclear arsenals and risks of
proliferation remain, the Government
considers that the UK’s minimum nuclear
deterrent (see p. 103) remains a necessary and
continuing element of the UK’s security.
Biological Weapons
The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
provides for a worldwide ban on such
weapons, but there are no effective compliance
mechanisms. The UK is participating in
negotiations to strengthen the Convention.
Chemical Weapons
The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention,
which came into force in 1997, provides for a
worldwide ban on chemical weapons. The
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons is responsible for verification. All
the necessary British legislation is in place to
license the production, possession and use of
the most toxic chemicals and to implement the
Convention’s trade controls.
Conventional Armed Forces
The UK continues to work with its NATO
partners and other European countries to
develop and improve agreements to enhance
90
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
stability in Europe in the light of the changed
security environment. The main agreements
reached are:
> the Conventional Armed Forces in
Europe (CFE) Treaty (signed originally
in 1990 and adapted at an OSCE summit
in 1999),7 which limits the numbers of
heavy weapons in the countries of NATO
and the former Warsaw Pact, and
includes a verification regime. The CFE
Treaty is widely regarded as a linchpin of
European security;
> the Vienna Document, developed under
the auspices of the OSCE, which is a
politically binding agreement on the
promotion of stability and openness
on military matters in Europe; revised
in 1999, it contains confidence- and
security-building measures, and
verification arrangements; and
> the 1992 Open Skies Treaty, which
provides for the overflight and
photography of the entire territory of the
27 participating states to monitor their
military capabilities and activities.
Ratification by the Russian parliament in
April 2001 enables the Treaty to enter
into force.
The UN Register of Conventional Arms,
which came into effect in 1992, is intended to
allow greater transparency in international
transfers of conventional arms and to help
identify excessive arms build-ups in any one
country or region.
Landmines
The UK signed the Ottawa Convention
banning the use, production, trade, transfer
and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines in
1997. The Convention, which Britain ratified
in 1998, entered into force on 1 March 1999.
The UK destroyed its stockpile of anti¬
personnel mines by October 1999. It has a
programme to support humanitarian demining
In the light of Russia s breach of CFE limits through its military
action against separatists in Chechnya, ratification of the 1999
revision by the UK and its NATO allies will depend on the level
of all parties' compliance with the limits that have been agreed.
activities, which is focused on helping affected
countries develop the capacity to clear
landmines and on improving the coordination
of international demining resources.
Small Arms
The UK attaches great importance to
international efforts to curb small arms
proliferation and participated in the July 2001
UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small
Arms and Light Weapons.
Export Controls
The UK is a founding member of all the
international export control regimes which
govern the export of conventional arms,
technology associated with weapons of mass
destruction, missiles, and ‘dual-use’ goods
(those having a legitimate civil use as well
as a potential military application).
In 1997 the UK Government issued new
criteria for assessing licence applications for
arms exports, one of which is that licences will
not be granted if there is a clearly identifiable
risk that weapons might be used for internal
repression or international aggression. At the
same time it banned the export of certain
items for which there is clear evidence of use
for torture or other abuses; it also declared its
commitment to preventing British companies
from manufacturing, selling or procuring such
equipment and to pressing for a global ban. In
1998 EU Member States agreed on a Code of
Conduct on Arms Exports, setting similar
common standards to which all EU members
would adhere.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The UK Government has stated its
commitment to working for improvements in
human rights standards across the world and,
in September 2001, published its fourth annual
human rights report describing the activities
and initiatives pursued during the previous
year. The ^6.5 million Human Rights Project
Fund, launched in 1998, provides flexible and
direct financial assistance for grass-roots human
rights projects around the world.
91
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
International Conventions
United Nations
Universal respect for human rights is an
obligation under the UN Charter. Expressions
of concern about human rights do not,
therefore, constitute interference in the
internal affairs of another state.
The UK Government promotes the
standards set out in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, which was adopted by the
UN General Assembly in 1948. Since this is
not a legally binding document, the General
Assembly adopted two international covenants
on human rights in 1966, placing legal
obligations on those states ratifying or
acceding to them. The covenants came into
force in 1976, the UK ratifying both in the
same year. One covenant deals with economic,
social and cultural rights and the other with
civil and political rights. Other international
instruments to which the UK is a party
include those on:
> the elimination of racial discrimination;
> the elimination of all forms of
discrimination against women;
> the rights of the child;
> torture and other cruel, inhuman or
degrading treatment or punishment;
> the prevention of genocide;
> the abolition of slavery; and
> the status of refugees.
Council of Europe
The UK is also bound by the Council of
Europe’s Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
(ECHR), which covers areas such as:
> the right to life, liberty and a fair trial;
> the right to marry and have a family;
> freedom of thought, conscience and
religion;
> freedom of expression, including
freedom of the press;
> freedom of peaceful assembly and
association;
> the right to have a sentence reviewed by a
higher tribunal; and
> the prohibition of torture and inhuman
or degrading treatment.
The rights and obligations of the ECHR
were enshrined in UK law upon the
implementation of the Human Rights Act
1998 in October 2000 (see p. 214).
Organisation for Security and
Co-operation in Europe
The OSCE’s Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights (in Warsaw)
promotes participating states’ adherence to
commitments on human rights, democracy
and the rule of law, and takes a lead in
monitoring elections within the OSCE area.
The Office provides a forum for exchanges of
experts on the building of democratic
institutions and the holding of elections in
participating states. It also provides expertise
and training on human rights, constitutional
and legal matters, and promotes practical
measures to strengthen civil administration.
International Criminal Court
The UK has supported the establishment of
an International Criminal Court to try cases of
genocide, crimes against humanity and war
crimes. The Government signed the Court’s
Statute in 1998, and parliamentary legislation
to enable ratification was enacted in May
2001.
CRIME AND TERRORISM
The UK supports international efforts to
combat illegal drugs, working with producer
and transit countries, especially those where
drug production and trafficking represent a
direct threat to the UK. Over 60 drug liaison
officers are stationed in UK missions in key
countries, in cooperation with the host
authorities. Working with its EU partners, the
UK is helping Latin American, Caribbean and
Central Asian states to stem the transit of
drugs across their territories. It also
participated in the negotiation of the EU
92
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
drugs strategy for 2000-04, which was
endorsed by the European Council in 1999.
The UK is involved in the United Nations
drug control structure, and is one of the
largest contributors to the UN International
Drug Control Programme.
Britain contributes to international efforts
to counter financial crime, for example
through its membership of the Financial
Action Task Force against money laundering,
and through its support for regional anti¬
money laundering groups.
Together with its EU partners, the UK is
confronting serious and organised international
crime through, for example, the European
Police Office (EUROPOL) which supports
investigations and operations conducted by
national law enforcement agencies. EUROPOL
powers and duties are set out in the
Terrorist Attack on the United
States
On 11 September 2001 terrorists launched
suicide attacks on US landmarks using
hijacked civil airliners. Two aircraft were
flown into the twin towers of New York’s
World Trade Centre, which subsequently
collapsed, and another plane hit the
Pentagon (Defence Department) in
Washington. A fourth jet crashed in
Pennsylvania before reaching any specific
target. Around 6,000 people are thought to
have died in the attacks and ensuing
devastation, including British citizens. The
US Government condemned the attacks as
an act of war and pledged military
retaliation against known terrorist
networks and their state sponsors. In the
UK, Parliament was recalled on 14
September to debate the atrocity. The
Prime Minister emphasised Britain’s
solidarity with the United States and its
support for an international alliance against
terrorism. NATO invoked the article in its
treaty which states that an attack on any of
its members is an attack on all. On 21
September EU Pleads of Government
declared that Member States were ready to
engage in targeted action against states
supporting terrorism.
EUROPOL Convention, which entered into
force in 1998. EU Member States also belong
to the International Criminal Police
Organisation (INTERPOL). UK liaison with
INTERPOL is provided by the National
Criminal Intelligence Service (see p. 219).
The UK participated in the negotiation of
the UN Convention Against Transnational
Crime, and three protocols covering the
smuggling of migrants, trafficking in human
beings and illegal firearms. The Convention
was signed by 120 states, including the UK, in
December 2000.
The British Government has stressed its
condemnation of all terrorist acts, its opposition
to concessions to terrorist demands and its
commitment to ensuring that terrorists do not
benefit from their acts. It works bilaterally with
other like-minded governments, and
multilaterally through the UN, EU and G8, to
promote closer international coordination
against terrorism. The UK is party to a series of
international counter-terrorism conventions
agreed since 1963. It ratified the most recent—
the International Convention for the
Suppression of Financing of Terrorism—in
February 2001, upon the entry into force of the
Terrorism Act 2000. Under the provisions of
Act, the UK Government also proscribed 21
foreign terrorist organisations with effect from
28 March 2001 (see p. 218).
DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION
The UK’s development aid policy is focused
on its continuing commitment to the
international development targets, agreed by
the world’s governments at UN conferences in
the 1990s, to halve the proportion of people
living in abject poverty by 2015. The UK
Government believes that, if properly
managed, the wealth now being created by
globalisation—involving, for example,
increased flows of goods, services, capital,
trade, people and information—can provide
new opportunities for the elimination of world
poverty and for equitable and environmentally
sustainable growth in the poorest countries.
However, these countries need to be brought
into the global economy so that they can gain
greater access to knowledge and technology,
new trade and investment.
93
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
UK official development assistance will rise
from 0.26% of GNP in 1997 to 0.33% in
2003-04, with the longer-term objective of
attaining the UN target of 0.7%. In line with
this, the budget for the Department for
International Development (DFID) will reach
almost £3.6 billion in 2003-04, a 45% increase
in real terms on 1997-98.
Poverty Reduction
DFID supports poorer countries in developing
and implementing national strategies for
poverty reduction (based on growth, equity and
security) which have broad political support
and meet local needs. DFID considers that
growth requires market-based policies, with a
commitment to economic reform and
liberalisation together with support for effective
governance and institutions. Poor people s
participation in growth, using their own assets
and capabilities, requires tackling inequalities of
opportunity, especially access to education,
information, and health, transport and financial
services. It may also necessitate measures to
redistribute income and assets. Physical and
economic vulnerability must also be addressed.
Debt Relief
The heavy burden of servicing debt reduces
the ability of the poorest countries to tackle
poverty effectively. The UK is focusing on
accelerating the implementation of the revised
1999 Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) debt initiative designed to deliver
wider and faster relief to countries committed
to poverty reduction. At least 23 HIPC
countries will receive debt relief by 2002
(reducing their debts by two-thirds on
average). All aid debts owed to the UK by the
poorest countries—some £1.2 billion—have
been cancelled. In 1999 the Government
announced that it would provide full debt
relief on the remaining ECGD debt—about
£2 billion—for countries when they qualify
for the HIPC initiative.
Good Governance and Human Rights
The quality of governance has a major impact
on economic growth and the effectiveness of
In December 2000 the Government
published a White Paper, Eliminating
World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work
for the Poor. This set out an agenda to help
bring sustainable benefits to the one in five
of the world’s population (1.2 billion
people) who live in extreme poverty. It
announced:
> the ending, from 1 April 2001, of the
practice of providing aid on condition
that a proportion of the goods and
services were from UK companies;
> financial support for the eradication of
polio from the world within five years;
> help for African countries to trade
more effectively;
> new opportunities for investing in
developing countries;
> strong action against corruption;
> the establishment of a commission on
intellectual property rights to protect
the interests of developing countries;
and
> an increase in support for world
environmental initiatives.
services. DFID is focusing on issues such as
democratic accountability (bringing poor
people into the democratic process);
fundamental freedoms (including rights to
education, health and an adequate livelihood);
combating child labour; tackling corruption
and money laundering; better revenue and
public finance management; access to basic
services; and personal safety and security in
the community with access to justice.
Women’s Empowerment
An estimated 70% of the world’s poor are
female. Removing gender discrimination and
supporting measures to improve women’s
equality are fundamental to reducing poverty
and upholding human rights. A priority in
DFID assistance is the promotion of equal
access to education for all girls and boys.
94
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
Health
Since 1997 DFID has committed around
£1 billion to improving basic health systems in
developing countries. The improvement of
poor people’s access to healthcare and to new
and existing drugs and vaccines needs
substantial investment (including from the
private sector) in health service infrastructure,
and financial and human resources. The
impact of major communicable diseases, such
as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, on the poor
is a major obstacle to social and economic
development. The UK is working with the G8
countries, developing countries and the UN to
establish a Global Health Fund to increase
access to effective treatments against these
diseases. It is planned that this fund will have
become operational by the end of 2001.
Education
About 113 million children around the world
do not go to school and a further 150 million
drop out before attaining useful levels of basic
education. Almost 900 million adults are
illiterate, two-thirds of them women. DFID

resources are being focused on basic and
primary education. Nearly 80% of UK
current commitments—£800 million—are
now in this area, with two-thirds going to 11
of the poorest countries in sub-Saharan Africa
and South Asia.
The UK is working with governments to
develop well-integrated and sustainable
education systems, helping them to provide
high-quality primary education for all their
children, especially girls. To increase the
supply of teachers, the UK is initiating
programmes and working with the
Commonwealth of Learning (an
intergovernmental organisation created by the
Commonwealth) to encourage the use of
distance learning and information technology
programmes for teacher training and the
sharing of skills.
The Environment
DFID’s main priority is to promote better
environmental management that can
contribute to poverty reduction—by trying to
reverse trends in environmental degradation,

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
and reducing poor people’s vulnerability to
the effects of global environmental trends
(particularly climate change).
Conflict and Natural Disasters
Conflict and natural disasters are major
barriers to development in many of the
world’s poorest countries. More than half of
the 40 poorest countries are either in the midst
of armed conflict or have only recently
emerged from it. DFID’s objectives are to
reduce the tensions that lead to conflict, limit
the means of waging warfare, and provide the
assistance and support needed to help societies
cope and eventually rebuild.
DFID’s humanitarian assistance is targeted
at improving the quality and speed of response
to a disaster; promoting effective recovery and
early transition from emergency assistance to
rehabilitation and reconstruction; and helping
countries to reduce their vulnerability to
natural, environmental and industrial
disasters. DFID provides humanitarian
assistance through governments, UN agencies
and non-governmental organisations. Between
1997_98 and 1999-2000, UK expenditure on
humanitarian assistance rose from £186
million to £323 million.
During 2000-01 the UK responded to a
number of natural disasters, including
flooding in Mozambique and earthquakes in
India and El Salvador. It also funded winter
relief for Serbia, as well as assistance for
refugees in West Africa, Sudan, Afghanistan,
Indonesia and the Middle East.
ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN
POLICY
Foreign & Commonwealth Office
The FCO is in charge of foreign policy. It is
headed by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Secretary, who is responsible for the work of
the department and the Diplomatic Service
(see p. 66). Diplomatic, consular and
commercial relations are maintained with 190
countries (compared with 136 in 1968), and
the UK has 224 diplomatic posts worldwide.
British diplomatic missions also employ nearly
8,000 locally engaged staff. Staff overseas deal
with political, commercial and economic work;
entry clearance to the UK and consular work;
aid administration; and information and other
activities, such as culture, science and
technology.
The FCO’s executive agency, Wilton Park
International Conference Centre in West
Sussex, contributes to the solution of
international problems by organising
conferences in the UK, attended by
politicians, business people, academics and
other professionals from all over the world.
An important function of the FCO is to
promote understanding of British foreign
policies and to project an up-to-date image of
the UK worldwide, beyond the sphere of
government-to-government diplomacy. Key
elements of FCO-funded public diplomacy
work include:
> publications, television and radio
programmes, and the FCO and Planet
Britain websites (www.fco.gov.uk and
www.planet-britam.org)',
> scholarship schemes for overseas
students (see p. 145) and programmes for
influential foreign visitors;
> the BBC World Service (see p. 272);
> the British Council (see p. 97);
> the London Radio Service and British
Satellite News, used extensively by
overseas radio and television broadcasters
to supplement their news coverage;
> International Press Section, the FCO’s
specialist link with foreign journalists,
both visiting and based in the UK; and
> the London Press Service, which
supplies material for publication
overseas.
In autumn 2000 the FCO, British Council,
Design Council, British Trade International
(see p. 421) and British Tourist Authority
established the Britain Abroad Task Force to
coordinate the projection of a modern image
of the UK overseas.
Other Departments
Several other government departments are
closely involved with foreign policy issues. The
96
7: OVERSEAS RELATIONS
DFID administers the UK’s development aid
programmes. It is also responsible for the UK’s
relations with the World Bank and international
organisations concerned with development.
The Ministry of Defence maintains military
liaison with the UK’s NATO and other allies.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
has an important influence on international
trade policy and commercial relations with
other countries, including EU Member States.
The joint work of the FCO and DTI in support
of British trade and investment overseas is
coordinated through British Trade
International. HM Treasury is involved in
British international economic policy and is
responsible for the UK’s relations with the
International Monetary Fund.
BRITISH COUNCIL
The British Council is the UK’s principal
agency for cultural relations overseas. Its
purpose is to promote a wider knowledge of
the UK and the English language and to
encourage cultural, scientific, technological
and educational cooperation between the UK
and other countries. Its work also supports the
FCO’s objective of increasing respect and
goodwill for the UK. The Council:
> helps people to study, train or make
professional contacts in the UK;
> enables British specialists to teach, advise
or establish joint projects abroad;
> teaches English and promotes its use;
> provides library and information services;
> supports legal reform overseas and works
to enhance the protection of human
rights;
> promotes scientific and technical
training, research collaboration and
exchanges; and
> encourages appreciation of British arts
and literature.
In 2000—01 the Council worked in 229
towns and cities in 111 countries. It issued
nearly 8 million books and videos to 350,000
British Council library members, and dealt
with almost 2 million enquiries in its libraries
and information centres. It also organised
more than 1,500 science events in over 60
countries; managed or supported 3,000 arts
events worldwide; administered 700,000
professional and academic examinations;
helped 13,000 young people take part in
exchange projects; and supported over 4,000
trainers and trainees for vocational projects
across Europe.
It is financed partly by a grant from the
FCO and partly by income from revenue¬
earning activities, such as English language
teaching, the administration of examinations,
and bilateral and international aid contract
work. Some of the training and education
programmes organised by the Council as part
of the British aid programme receive funding
from the DFID.
In November 2000 the Council announced
a new five-year strategy to realign its global
operations—increasing its activities in
‘transitional’ countries such as China and
Russia, and investing in information
technology to provide a better service to
a wider audience.
Educational Exchanges
The British Council recruits teachers for work
overseas, organises short overseas visits by
British experts, encourages cultural exchange
visits, and organises academic interchange
between British universities and colleges and
those in other countries.
The British aid programme has helped
fund certain Council programmes, such as:
> recruitment of staff for overseas
universities;
> secondment of staff from British higher
education establishments; and
> organisation of short-term teaching and
advisory visits.
The British Council’s Central Bureau for
International Education and Training aims to
raise standards in UK education and training
through international partnership and
exchange. This is achieved by the promotion
of international mobility, vocational training
and development, linking and exchange
programmes, lifelong learning and multilateral
partnerships. The government-funded Bureau
97
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
is the UK national agency for many EU
education and training programmes. It also
hosts the Secretariat of the new UK National
Commission for UNESCO (UN Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation),
inaugurated at the start of 2001.

The defence of the United Kingdom, as well as its economic and other wider
interests, is linked with the stability of Europe. The primary means of ensuring
British and European security is NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation), of which the UK is a founder member and to which its armed
forces are assigned. The Government is involved in the development of a
European military capability as a complementary role to NATO in crisis
operations in which NATO as a whole is not engaged. The armed forces also
contribute to the peacetime security of the UK and its Overseas Territories,
and assist in humanitarian and peacetime operations throughout the world.

which set out the changes required for the
UK’s armed forces to meet the needs of new
strategic issues in the 21st century, remains the
foundation of the country’s defence policy and
plans for reshaping and modernising the
services and their support. The SDR
concluded that there was no direct military
threat to the UK or its Overseas Territories,
but that the end of the Cold War had
introduced instability and uncertainty. There
remained the potential threat of the
proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons, organised crime and the break-up of
existing states with attendant ethnic and
religious conflict. The SDR laid out a force
structure in which the armed services would be
able to respond to a major international crisis.
This might involve operations of a similar scale
and duration to the Gulf War, or of more
extended overseas deployment on a lesser scale
(such as in Bosnia and Kosovo), while retaining
the ability to mount a second, substantial
deployment (up to a combat brigade and
supporting naval and air forces).
This assessment was confirmed and
restated in the 1999 Defence White Paper and
in later analyses—Defence Policy 2001 and The
Future Strategic Context for Defence—in 2001.
The growth and type of planned and
coordinated missions undertaken by UK
forces since 1997 have indicated the increasing
likelihood of the armed services conducting
smaller, but frequent assignments—often
simultaneous and sometimes prolonged, and
some at short notice—rather than preparing
for one large-scale warfighting operation.
The changes outlined in the SDR are
designed to reinforce the UK’s contribution to
international peace and security through
NATO and the European Union (EU—see
99
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
p.75), and through other international
organisations such as the United Nations
(UN—see p. 75) and the Organisation for
Security and Co-operation in Europe
(OSCE—see p. 76).
Defence Missions
Defence missions which underpin the UK’s
defence planning are:
> peacetime security;
> security of the Overseas Territories;
> defence diplomacy (see p. 103);
> support to wider British interests;
> peace support and humanitarian
assistance operations;
> contributing forces for a regional conflict
outside the NATO area;
> providing forces to respond to regional
aggression against NATO; and
> responding to strategic attack on NATO.
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY
ORGANISATION
The UK is a founding member of NATO,
membership of which is the cornerstone of
British defence policy, and most of the UK’s
forces are assigned to it. The Alliance
embodies the transatlantic relationship that
links North America and Europe in a unique
defence and security partnership. The number
of members was increased to 19 with the
accession of the Czech Republic, Hungary and
Poland in 1999. The Alliance remains open to
new members willing and able to assume the
obligations and responsibilities of
membership. Nine countries (Albania,
Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia)
have expressed an interest in joining NATO.
The Alliance is committed to reviewing
enlargement by the autumn 2002 summit to be
held in Prague.
Adaptation of NATO
NATO is adapting to the changed security
environment in Europe, d he Partnership for
Peace programme, aimed at enhancing both
political consultation and practical military
cooperation between NA10 and Partner
states, and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council, which provides the framework for
cooperation between NAd O and its Partner
countries, are key to the development of the
security relationship between NATO and
other countries in Europe. Following the 1999
NATO summit, measures were put in place to
increase the ability of Partner countries to
operate effectively in NATO-led crisis
management operations, d'hese include
European Defence
While NATO is the primary means of
ensuring UK and European security and
defence, operations such as in Bosnia and
Kosovo (see p. 89) have led the EU to
decide that it needs to make a stronger and
more coherent contribution to the Alliance,
and to improve the collective capability to
undertake EU-led crisis management
operations where NATO as a whole is not
engaged. At the Helsinki European Council
in December 1999, on the basis of
proposals developed by the UK, Italy and
France, EU member states committed
themselves to the goal of modernising their
armed forces so that by 2003 they would
have a pool of deployed units from which a
force up to corps level (50,000 to 60,000
personnel, together with appropriate air
and naval elements) could be swiftly
assembled for a crisis management
operation, as well as for humanitarian,
rescue, and peacekeeping tasks (see also
p. 84). This force would be sustainable for
at least a year. The UK contribution to an
individual operation could be up to 12,500
ground troops, 18 warships and 72 combat
aircraft. A crucial priority in achieving this
objective is the setting up of permanent
arrangements for consultation and
cooperation with NATO and for drawing
on NATO planning and other capabilities.
Collective defence remains the
responsibility of NATO, which will also
continue to have a major role in crisis
management.

greater involvement of the 27 non-NATO
Partner states in the political consultation and
decision-making process and in the
operational planning and command
arrangements. NATO is also committed to
the sustained development of its relationship
with Russia and Ukraine, following
consultation and cooperation agreements
signed in 1997.
NATO has also undertaken a period of
internal adaptation, including a major review of
the military command structure and the
implementation of the Combined Joint Task
Force concept. At the 1999 summit the allies
approved an updated strategic concept for
NATO to reflect the changed political
environment and the launch of an initiative to
improve its defence capability and effectiveness
in all multinational Alliance missions.
DEFENCE TASKS
The UK and its Overseas Territories
The armed forces are responsible for
safeguarding Britain’s territory, airspace and
territorial waters. They also provide for the
security and reinforcement of the Overseas
Territories and for support to the civil
authorities in both the UK and the Overseas
Territories.
Maritime Defence
The Royal Navy aims to ensure the integrity
of the UK’s territorial waters and the
protection of its rights and interests in the
surrounding seas, and of British interests
around the world. The maintenance of a 24-
hour, year-round presence in waters around
the British Isles provides reassurance to
merchant ships and other mariners, as well as
security of the seas. The Royal Air Force
(RAF) also contributes to maritime
requirements, for instance through the
Nimrod force, which provides air surveillance
of surface vessels and submarines.
Land Defence
The British Army aims to provide, through
either the deployment of the whole or
appropriate elements of its available forces, the
capability to defend the UK and its Overseas
Territories. In addition, the Army is
committed to such tasks as giving military aid
to peace support and humanitarian operations,
responding to regional conflict outside the
NATO area and contributing forces to
counter a strategic attack on NATO.
Air Defence
Air defence of the UK and the surrounding
seas is maintained by a system of layered
defences. Continuous radar cover is provided
by the Air Surveillance and Control System
(ASACS) supplemented by the NATO
Airborne Early Warning Force, to which the
RAF contributes six aircraft. The RAF also
provides Five squadrons of Tornado F3 air
defence aircraft, supported by tanker aircraft
and, in wartime, an additional F3 squadron.
Royal Navy air defence destroyers can also be
linked to the ASACS, providing radar and
electronic warfare coverage and surface-to-air
missiles. Ground-launched Rapier missiles
defend the main RAF bases. Naval aircraft
also contribute to British air defence.
Overseas Garrisons
The UK maintains garrisons in Gibraltar, the
Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus, the Falkland
Islands and Brunei. Gibraltar provides
headquarters and communications facilities for
NATO in the western Mediterranean, while
Cyprus provides strategic communications
facilities as well as a base for operations in the
eastern Mediterranean and beyond. The
garrison on the Falkland Islands is a tangible
demonstration of the Government’s
commitment to uphold the right of the
islanders to determine their own future (see
p. 81). The garrison in Brunei is maintained at
the request of the Brunei Government. In
addition, a jungle warfare-training unit is
maintained in Belize.
Northern Ireland
The armed forces provide support to the
police in Northern Ireland (see p. 19) in
101
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
maintaining law and order and countering
terrorism. The number of units deployed at any
one time is dependent on the prevailing
security situation. The Royal Navy patrols
territorial waters around Northern Ireland and
its inland waterways in order to deter and
intercept the movement of terrorist weapons.
The Royal Marines provide troops to meet
Navy and Army commitments, while the RAF
provides elements of the RAF Regiment and
Chinook, Wessex and Puma helicopters.
Other Tasks
Other tasks include the provision of:
> military assistance to civil ministries, for
example in maintaining the essentials of
life in the community, carrying out
fishery protection duties and helping in
the fight against drugs;
> military aid to the civil community,
including during emergencies; and
> military search and rescue.
Britain in NATO
Maritime Forces
Most Royal Navy ships are committed to
NATO. Permanent contributions are made to
NATO’s Immediate Reaction and Rapid
Reaction Forces in the Atlantic, the English
Channel and the Mediterranean. The UK also
contributes to NATO’s Maritime
Augmentation Forces, which are held at the
lowest state of readiness and in peacetime
comprise ships mainly in routine refit or
maintenance.
The main components of the Fleet available
to NATO are:
> three aircraft carriers operating Joint
Force Harrier aircraft and Sea King
anti-submarine helicopters;
> 32 destroyers and frigates, and 22 mine
counter-measure vessels;
> 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines;
and
> amphibious forces, including a
commando brigade of the Royal Marines,
two assault ships and a helicopter carrier.
Land Forces
The multinational Allied Command Europe
Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) is the key land
component of NATO’s Rapid Reaction
Forces. Capable of immediately deploying up
to four NATO divisions, the ARRC is
commanded by a British general, and some
55,000 British regular troops are assigned to it.
The UK provides two of the ten divisions
available to the Corps—a division of three
armoured brigades stationed in Germany, and
a division of three mechanised brigades based
in Britain. An air-mobile brigade, assigned to
one of the Corps’ multinational divisions, is
also sited in the UK.
Air Forces
The RAF contributes to NATO’s Immediate
and Rapid Reaction Forces. Around 100
aircraft and 40 helicopters are allocated to
them. Tornado F3, Harrier and Jaguar
aircraft, and Rapier surface-to-air missiles
form part of the Supreme Allied Commander
Europe’s Immediate Reaction Force, while
Harrier, Jaguar and Tornado GR1/ 4 aircraft
provide offensive support and tactical
reconnaissance for the Rapid Reaction h orce.
Chinook and Puma helicopters supply troop
airlift facilities for the ARRC or other
deployed land forces. The RAF provides
Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft and search
and rescue helicopters.
Wider Security Interests
Military tasks to promote the UK’s wider
security interests may be undertaken by
British forces whether working within NATO,
assisting the United Nations, in coalition with
allies, or acting alone. Contingents are
deployed on UN operations in Cyprus,
Georgia, East Timor, Bosnia, Sierra Leone,
the Democratic Republic of Congo and on the
Iraq/Kuwait border. Over Iraq (see p. 86),
Tornado GRl/4s and Jaguars, supported by
VC-10s, are policing the no-fly zones to
ensure that Iraq does not resume repression of
minorities and that it does not threaten its
neighbours. The Royal Navy is deployed to
the Gulf to enforce UN sanctions against Iraq.
102
8: DEFENCE
A substantial British contingent is deployed in
Kosovo to help implement a peace agreement
following the conclusion of air operations over
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999
(see p. 89).
The number of operations against
trafficking in illicit drugs has increased in
recent years, for example in the Caribbean,
where a Royal Navy destroyer or frigate works
closely with the authorities of the United
States, the Overseas Territories and the
Regional Security System to combat drug
trafficking. Although primary responsibility
for this task rests with the local law
enforcement agencies or other government
departments, the armed forces assist where
they can do so without detriment to the
performance of their other military tasks.
In recent years, British forces have taken
part in international evacuation or
humanitarian relief operations in Rwanda,
Somalia, Angola, Eritrea, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone,
Mozambique, East Timor, the Caribbean and
Central America.
Defence diplomacy—the use of defence
assets to build and promote stability and assist
in the development of democratically
accountable armed forces—is an established
defence mission. British service personnel and
civilians working in defence are involved in a
range of non-operational activities including:
help in verifying arms control agreements
(see p. 90);
> outreach programmes of bilateral
assistance and cooperation with other
countries in areas such as English
language training, advice on the
management of defence training and
provision of short-term military training
teams to assist in modernising and
reforming armed forces; and
> training of some 4,000 military and
civilian students from over 100 countries
each year at UK defence establishments.
NUCLEAR FORCES
Although the four Trident submarines are
retained as the ultimate guarantee of national
security, the UK and other members of
NATO have radically reduced their reliance
on nuclear weapons. The UK is committed to
pressing for progress in the negotiations
towards mutual, balanced and verifiable
reductions in nuclear weapons (see p. 90).
When satisfied that verified progress has been
made towards the goal of global elimination of
nuclear weapons, the Government has said it
will ensure that the British nuclear weapons
are included in the talks.
The Government undertook a fundamental
re-examination of all aspects of Britain’s
nuclear position in the SDR and concluded that
fewer than 200 operationally available nuclear
warheads were needed—a reduction of one-
third. Therefore, the UK now has only one
Trident submarine on patrol at a time. It carries
a reduced load of up to 48 warheads compared
with the previously announced ceiling of 96.
The submarine’s missiles are not targeted and
it is normally at several days’ ‘notice to fire’.
FORCE STRUCTURES AND
CAPABILITIES
To achieve its policy objectives, the UK needs
forces with a high degree of mobility, at
sufficient readiness and with a clear sense of
purpose, for combat operations, conflict
prevention, crisis management and
humanitarian activities. These forces must
therefore be flexible and able to undertake the
full range of military tasks.
Measures to increase a joint-service
approach to defence, outlined in the SDR,
have led to the establishment of:
Joint Rapid Reaction Forces, a pool of
deployable forces (including 50 warships
and support vessels, four army brigades
and 100 combat aircraft), able to carry
out a range of short-notice missions from
warfighting to peacekeeping operations,
and to provide a first stage of a larger
deployment;
> Joint Force Harrier, a joint command of
Royal Navy and RAF Harrier aircraft
able to operate from aircraft carriers or
land bases;
> a new helicopter command of some 350
battlefield helicopters—Navy commando
103
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
helicopters, Army helicopters (including
Apache attack helicopters entering
service) and RAF support helicopters;
> a joint nuclear, biological and chemical
defence regiment; and
> a joint doctrine and concepts centre for
the development of defence doctrine.
These initiatives should enhance the
services’ ability to work together efficiently
and effectively and to project power to
potential trouble spots and crises. As well as
addressing the equipment requirements for
the services, the SDR sought to improve the
way they are supported by:
> creating a Defence Logistics Organisation,
under a new post of Chief of Defence
Logistics, covering all three services;
> establishing two logistic lines of
communication, each with a Joint Force
Logistic Component Headquarters,
which will each be able to provide
support to an operation of the type
conducted in Bosnia and in Kosovo; and
> restructuring of management and
organisation of the Defence Medical
Services (including closer integration
with the National Health Service) and a
commitment to spend an additional ^140
million on medical support to deployed
forces in the period to March 2002.
All of these joint organisations have been
established, and most are up to their full
operational capability.
Royal Navy
The focus for the Navy will continue to move
from large-scale, open-ocean warfare to force
projection and offshore operations in
conjunction with the other services, based on:
> two new large aircraft carriers, capable
of operating up to 50 aircraft and
helicopters, which will enter service
from 2012;
> a force of 32 destroyers and frigates, with
the Type 42 destroyer being replaced by
the Type 45 from 2008, and 22 mine
counter-measure ships; and
> ten attack submarines, able to fire
Tomahawk land-attack missiles by 2008.
Army
Among measures aimed at improving
mobility, firepower and the projection of
forces are:
> an increase in the number of the
armoured or mechanised brigades from
five to six through the conversion of the
airborne brigade to a mechanised brigade;
> the creation of a new, powerful air assault
brigade (combining two battalions of the
Parachute Regiment) equipped with the
new Apache attack helicopter;
> the creation of an additional armoured
reconnaissance regiment from an existing
armoured regiment, which will be
brought back from Germany;
> the conversion of the tank regiments
from eight units to six larger ones, with
significantly more personnel and tanks; and
> increasing the operational utility of the
Territorial Army (TA—see p. 106).
RAF
The emphasis of the new plans is on the
ability to deploy appropriate types of aircraft
rapidly to crises. Measures include:
> the procurement of new air-to-air, anti¬
armour and air-to-surface missiles for
Tornado, Harrier and Eurofighter
aircraft;
> improving the capability of the Nimrod
reconnaissance aircraft to support both
peacekeeping and warfighting
operations; and
> modernising the strategic airlift capability
of the air transport fleet, in the short term
by the leasing of four Boeing C-17 aircraft
and, later in the decade, by the acquisition
of 25 Airbus A400M aircraft.
DEFENCE EQUIPMENT
Modern equipment is essential if one of the
key aims of Britain’s force restructuring
104
8: DEFENCE
programme is to be achieved, namely that of
increasing the flexibility and mobility of its
armed forces.
Improvements for the Royal Navy
equipment programme include:
> the fourth Trident submarine (now in
service) and the building of the Astute-
class attack submarines;
> new aircraft, replacing the current Sea
Harriers, for the two new aircraft carriers;
> a modernised destroyer and frigate fleet,
including the introduction of the Type
45 destroyer, which will deploy an anti¬
air missile system developed with France
and Italy;
> new amphibious shipping to strengthen
the amphibious force; and
> the Merlin anti-submarine helicopter.
The Army front line is being strengthened by:
> the introduction of the Challenger 2 tank;
> Apache attack helicopters equipped with
new anti-tank missiles;
> improved Rapier and new Starstreak air
defence missiles;
> new bridging equipment to increase
mobility and flexibility; and
> a range of advanced surveillance, target
acquisition and reconnaissance equipment.
Improvements for the RAF include:
> upgrading the Tornado GR1 fleet;
> upgrading the Jaguar aircraft until it is
replaced, together with the Tornado F3
aircraft, by the Eurofighter;
> new Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft;
> orders for new air-launched missiles and
guided bombs; and
> the introduction of EH 101 and additional
Chinook support helicopters and of
improved Hercules aircraft.
Defence Procurement
Some £10 billion is spent each year on
military equipment, including the
procurement of spares and associated costs.
When assessing options, consideration is given
to the initial costs of a project and to those
necessary to support it throughout its service
life. Competition for contracts takes place
wherever possible. Measures to improve the
procuring of defence equipment, identified by
the SDR’s ‘smart procurement’ initiative, are
the introduction of integrated teams,
including representatives from industry, to
closely control a project throughout its life.
Equipment is to be acquired incrementally,
with the basic equipment entering into service
quickly and then being upgraded as
technology improves. All defence acquisition
projects are run on ‘smart procurement’ lines.
The involvement of the private sector through
Public-Private Partnerships is a major element
of procurement strategy: under this policy,
capital investment with a value of some £1
billion is being undertaken.
International Procurement Collaboration
The UK is a member of NATO’s Conference
of National Armaments Directors, which
promotes equipment collaboration between
NATO nations. It is also a founder member of
OCCAR, an armament cooperation
organisation formed with France, Germany
and Italy for managing joint procurement
activities. Current collaborative programmes
in which the UK participates include:
> development of the Eurofighter (with
Germany, Italy and Spain);
> a maritime anti-air missile system
(France and Italy);
> a battlefield radar system (France and
Germany);
> the EH101 helicopter (Italy);
> a multi-role armoured vehicle (France
and Germany); and
> the large transport Airbus A400M
aircraft (Belgium, France, Germany,
Italy, Spain and Turkey).
THE ARMED FORCES
Commissioned Ranks
Commissions, either by promotion from the
ranks or by direct entry based on educational
105
GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS
and other qualifications, are granted for short,
medium and long terms. All three services
have schemes for school, university and
college sponsorships.
Commissioned ranks receive initial training
at the Britannia Royal Naval College,
Dartmouth; the Commando Training Centre,
Lympstone (Devon); the Royal Military
Academy, Sandhurst; or the Royal Air Force
College, Cranwell. This is followed by specialist
training, which may include degree courses at
service establishments or universities. Courses
of higher training for officers, designed to
emphasise the joint approach to the tactical and
operational levels of conflict, are provided at the
Joint Services Command and Staff College at
Shrivenham (Wiltshire).
Non-commissioned Ranks
Engagements for non-commissioned ranks
vary widely in length and terms of service.
Subject to a minimum period, entrants may
leave at any time, giving 18 months’ notice
(12 months for certain engagements).
Discharge may also be granted on
compassionate or medical grounds.
In addition to their basic training, non¬
commissioned personnel receive supplementary
specialist training throughout their careers.
Study for educational qualifications is
encouraged, and service trade and technical
training leads to nationally recognised
qualifications. New vocational training and
educational initiatives to improve recruitment
and retention were announced in the SDR.
The Army Foundation College offers a 42-
week course combining military training and

the opportunity to acquire national
qualifications. The course is intended to attract
high-quality recruits who will go on to fill
senior posts in front-line roles.
Reserve Forces
The Reserve Forces serve alongside the regular
forces and are integral to the ability to expand
the services in times of crises. For example,
under the current commitment, around 10%
of UK forces in Bosnia are reservists at any one
time. In particular, reserves can provide skills
and units not available or required in peacetime.
The reserves include former members of the
regular armed forces liable for service in an
emergency (regular reserve) and volunteer
reserves, recruited directly from the civilian
community—the Royal Naval Reserve, the
Royal Marines Reserve, the TA and the
Reserve Air Forces (which comprise the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force and the Royal Air Force
Reserve).
The main contribution of reserves—both
individuals and formed units—is to support
regular forces in clearly identifiable and
worthwhile roles. This requires their full
integration into regular formations and ready
availability for service, where necessary
through selective compulsory call-out during
situations short of a direct threat to the UK.
Reserves should also be able to serve in peace
support operations. A Reserve Training
Mobilisation Centre at Chilwell near
Nottingham has been set up for this purpose.
Under the SDR, Royal Naval and RAF
volunteer reserve numbers will increase, and,
while the strength of the TA has been reduced
from 56,000 to 41,200, it is more closely
integrated with the Regular Army, with
greater emphasis on combat support.
ADMINISTRATION
The Defence Budget
The defence budget for 2001-02 is £23.8
billion, rising to £24.2 billion in 2002-03 and
£25.4 billion in 2003-04. The Ministry of
Defence believes these increases will allow it
to build on the measures outlined in the SDR,
while also taking into account the lessons
learned from recent operations and other

priorities such as accommodation and the
retention of personnel.
Defence Management
The Ministry of Defence is both a
Department of State and the highest-level
military headquarters. The Secretary of State
for Defence is responsible for the formulation
and conduct of defence policy and for
providing the means by which it is
conducted.Three junior ministers support the
Secretary of State and have responsibilities for
operational and policy issues for all armed
services; defence equipment procurement,
equipment collaboration and research; and
defence estate, environmental and public
services respectively.
Ministers are in turn supported by two key
officials: the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)
and the Permanent Secretary. The CDS is the
professional head of the armed forces and the
principal military adviser to the Secretary of
State and the Government. The Permanent
Secretary is the Government’s principal
civilian adviser on defence and has primary
responsibility for policy, finance and
administration of the department. The
Permanent Secretary is also personally
accountable to Parliament for the expenditure
of all public money voted for defence
purposes.
A number of senior-level committees
underpin the management of defence:
> the Defence Council, the highest
departmental committee with a range of
statutory and prerogative powers vested
in it. Chaired by the Secretary of State, it
provides the formal legal basis for the
conduct of defence;
> the Defence Management Board, which
provides senior-level leadership and
strategic management of defence and is
chaired mainly by the Permanent
Secretary; and
^ the Chiefs of Staff Committee, chaired
by the CDS and the forum in which
collective military advice is given to the
Secretary of State and the Government.
An integrated civilian and military staff
support ministers, senior officials and top-
level committees in the day-to-day
management of defence. The department is
divided into a number of budget areas
responsible for the major functions of the
Ministry. These include the operational and
personnel arms of each service; the Defence
Logistics Organisation; and the Defence
Procurement Agency, which is responsible for
the acquisition and support of defence
equipment. A large proportion of the Ministry
of Defence’s support activities is undertaken
by defence agencies (see p. 540).

The structure of the UK population is changing, with increases in life
expectancy and lower fertility rates leading to an ageing population. Family life
is more diverse—although the majority of men and women still get married,
marriage has declined and cohabitation has increased while the proportion of
people living alone has also risen. Women have contributed heavily to the
growth of the labour force. Technological change has been rapid and telephone,
radio, television and the Internet have all transformed communications.
POPULATION PROFILE
The population of the UK in mid-2000 was
estimated to be 59.8 million, the second largest
in the European Union (EU) and the 20th
largest in the world. Projections, based on an
analysis of recent demographic trends, suggest
that population growth in the UK will
continue until it peaks at nearly 65 million
people in 2036, before gradually declining.
In mid-2000, 50.0 million people lived in
England (about 84% of the UK population).
Northern Ireland had the smallest population of
the four countries, at 1.7 million (3%). The
population density in England was the highest,
with about 383 inhabitants per square kilometre.
The ten-year Census of Population was
held on 29 April 2001 (see pp. 34-6).
Age and Gender
The UK has an ageing population. The
proportion of the population aged 65 and over
increased from one person in 20 in 1901 to just
over one in six in 2000. Projections suggest that
this trend will continue so that by 2016 it is
expected that the number of people aged 65
and over will exceed those under the age of 16.
Although more boys are born each year
than girls, in 2000 there were about 838,000
more women in the UK than men. Men
outnumbered women in the younger age
groups, until around the age of 50 when the
numbers of men and women were about equal.
Above this age women increasingly
outnumbered men. This reflects the longer
life expectancy of women. In 1999 the
expectation of life at birth was 75 years for
males and just under 80 years for females.
However, life expectancy has been increasing
faster for males than females—about two years
every decade for males and one-and-a-half
years for females.
Births and Deaths
The annual number of births in the UK
peaked following both of the World Wars.
The highest number of births in any year of
108

the 20th century was 1.1 million in 1920,
shortly after the end of the First World War.
A lower peak of 1.0 million was reached after
the Second World War and the most recent
peak was in 1964. The number of births has
been relatively stable since 1984 and in 2000
there were 679,000 live births in the UK,
representing 11.4 live births per 1,000
population.
Although the number of deaths in the UK
remained relatively constant throughout the
20th century, this masks large declines in
mortality rates. There were nearly 611,000
deaths registered in 2000, a death rate of 10.3
per 1,000 population. Infant and childhood
mortality declined considerably during the
20th century, while in recent years the death
rates among older people have also fallen.
Rising standards of living and developments
in medical technology help to explain the
decline in mortality rates. The infant mortality
rate (deaths of infants under one year old per
1,000 live births) was 6.1 for boys and 5.1 for
girls in 2000. In general, in all age groups,
death rates are higher for males than females,
and this helps to explain the gender imbalance
among the older population.
Changes in the causes of death have
accompanied this improvement in mortality.
Sharp peaks in mortality occurred around the
First World War, when deaths were mainly
due to respiratory and infectious diseases.
Such diseases now account for a relatively
small proportion of all deaths. They have been
overtaken by causes such as cancer and
circulatory diseases which are much less
responsive to modern preventive and curative
medicine and whose incidence is concentrated
at older ages.
HOUSEHOLDS AND FAMILIES
The number of households in Great Britain rose
by almost half between 1961 and 1999, from 16.3
million to 24.1 million. Over the same period the
population increased by 13% and the average
household size fell from 3.1 to 2.4 people per
household. If recent trends continue, official
projections in England suggest that household
size will continue to decline to 2.2 in 2021.
Household composition has been
transformed in recent decades. Although most
people still live in a couple household, an
increasing proportion of people are living on

their own. In spring 2000 almost three in ten
households in Great Britain comprised one
person living alone, which was two-and-a-half
times the proportion in 1961. During the
1970s and 1980s there was emphasis on the
provision of first public, and then private,
housing which enabled households to occupy
separate accommodation. There is also
evidence that lone parents, who historically
were more likely than other families to live in
multi-family households, increasingly became
one-family households during the period.
Households containing a lone parent family
living on their own formed one in 17 of all
households in 1961, but one in 11 in 2000.
Cohabitation, Marriage and Divorce
The pattern of partnership formation has
changed since the mid-1970s. Although the
majority of men and women still get married,
the proportion who marry has been declining
and the proportions who cohabit or live outside
a relationship have increased. It was estimated
that there were just over 1.5 million cohabiting
couples in England and Wales in 1996—
representing about one in six of the adult non-
married population; the number of cohabiting
couples is projected to double by 2021.
Some people never marry and this
proportion has also increased over the last few
decades. Among people born in the 1940s, 4%
of men and 8% of women had neither married
nor been in a cohabiting relationship by the
time they were 50. If current trends continue,
official projections suggest that this will be the
case for over 10% of women and 16% of men
born in the 1960s.
In 1999 there were 301,000 marriages in the
UK, one of the lowest numbers in the 20th
century. Of the marriages that took place in
1999, 179,000 were first marriages for both
partners, less than half the number in the peak
year of 1970. First marriages accounted for
83% of all marriages in 1970 but only 59% in
1999. In 1970 the average age at first marriage

for both partners in England and Wales was
24 for men and 22 for women; by 1999 this
had risen to 29 and 27 respectively.
Although there was a long-term rise in the
number of divorces in the UK each year, the
number has recently been declining. Around
155,000 divorces were granted in 2000—14%
below the peak in 1993. The divorce rate in
England and Wales similarly peaked in 1993,
at 14.2 per 1,000 married people, and has since
fallen slightly. Provisional figures suggest that
the rate in 2000 was 12.7 per 1,000 married
people, the lowest since 1984.
Family Formation
In general, fertility rates for older women have
increased since the early 1980s while those for
younger women have declined. Women in
their late twenties still have the highest
fertility rates, although the rate continued to
fall in 2000 when there were 96 births per
1,000 women aged 25 to 29 in England and
Wales. The fertility rate for those aged 35 to
39 continued its slow but steady increase,
nearly doubling between 1981 and 2000 to
41 births per 1,000 women in this age group,
although it still remains lower than in 1961.
Mothers giving birth are now on average
nearly three years older than in the early
1970s—in 2000 the mean age of mothers at
birth was 29.1 years, compared with 26.2
in 1972.
The average completed family size has
fallen from a recent peak of 2.4 children per
woman born in the mid-1930s and is projected
to fall below two children per woman for
women born around 1960. Throughout the
1980s and 1990s fertility fell below' the level
needed for long-term natural replacement of
the population. Average completed family size
is expected to continue declining and
eventually level off for women born after 1970
at 1.8 children per w oman.
Not all couples have children and the
proportion of women remaining childless has
risen. About 16% of women born in 1924
were childless by the age of 45. It is projected
that over 20% of women born in or after 1965
w ill remain childless.
Most children are born to married couples
but an increasing proportion of births occur
outside marriage. Almost two-fifths of all
births in the United Kingdom in 2000
occurred outside marriage, around five times
greater than in 1971. Much of this grow th is
accounted for by the increase in births to
cohabiting couples. In 2000, 81% of all births
outside marriage were jointly registered by
both parents. For just over three-quarters of
these—62% of all births outside marriage—
the parents were living at the same address.
The proportion of births outside marriage
has always been higher for teenagers; in 2000,
almost 90% of births to w omen under 20
occurred outside marriage. In the same year,
28% of births to teenagers were sole
registrations compared with only 4% of
births to w omen in their late thirties or early
forties.
MIGRATION
Population movements occur both within the
UK and internationally. The most mobile age-
group w ithin the UK is young adults in their
twenties, when many young people leave their
parental home to study, work or set up their
ow n home. During the second half of the 20th
century there w as a movement of population
from the coal, shipbuilding and steel industry
areas in the north of England and Wales to the
light industries and services of the south of
England and the Midlands.
International Migration
During most of the 20th century the net natural
change in the UK population (the difference
between births and deaths) exceeded the effects
of net migration and other changes. How ever,
in recent years net inward migration has
become an increasingly important determinator
of population growth. Betw een 1991 and 1999
net natural change was almost matched by net
migration and other changes. In 1999 an
estimated 182,000 more people migrated to the
UK than emigrated from the UK. This was the
highest on record and nearly double the figures
for 1997 (92,000) and for 1996 (93,000). The
net gain of EU citizens in 1999 was 7,000; this
was just a quarter of the number in the
previous year.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Immigration into the UK is largely
governed by the Immigration Act 1971 and
the Immigration Rules made under it. I he
Rules set out the requirements to be met by
those who are subject to immigration control
and seek entry to, or leave to remain in, the
UK. The 1971 Act has been amended by
subsequent legislation, including the
Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Most of
the key provisions of the 1999 Act have
already been implemented and the
implementation of the remainder is
continuing. The major provisions of the Act
include:
> modernising immigration control with
the aim of helping it to deal with
increasing passenger traffic and make
enforcement of the control more
effective;
> introducing measures to tackle
clandestine entry, including a new civil
penalty for drivers of lorries and other
vehicles found to contain clandestine
entrants, and strengthening the carriers’
liability regime;
> replacing the existing multiple rights of
appeal with a single, comprehensive right
of appeal;
> creating new arrangements to support
asylum seekers who are considered to be
in genuine need, involving a new national
system, separate from the main benefits
system. Accommodation is being
provided on a ‘no choice’ basis, with
other support generally being provided in
kind;
> strengthening enforcement of the
immigration control by extending powers
of immigration officers, extending and
strengthening the existing immigration
offences of deception and facilitation, and
extending fingerprint powers; and
> providing greater safeguards for those
who are detained, including putting the
management and operation of detention
centres on a statutory footing.
In implementing the Act, priority has been
given to the provisions relating to the new
asylum support arrangements, and to the civil
penalty for carrying clandestine entrants. The
single, comprehensive right of appeal was
introduced on 2 October 2000 to coincide with
the implementation of the Human Rights Act
1998 (see p. 214). The 1999 Act also
introduced changes to the Marriage Act 1949
which applies in England and Wales. These
changes came into effect on 1 January 2001
and consist of:
> a common 15-day notice procedure
(which may only be waived in exceptional
circumstances on application to the
Registrar-General);
> a requirement for both parties to a
marriage to personally give notice of their
intention to marry, including a
declaration of their nationality; and
> powers for registration officers to request
evidence of name, age, marital status and
nationality from couples, underpinned by
a power to refuse to give authority for the
marriage when a registration officer is not
satisfied that a person is free, legally, to
contract the marriage.
The 1999 Act also places a duty on
registration officers to report to the Home
Office those marriages suspected of having
been arranged for the purpose of evading
immigration controls.
In 2000 some 125,000 people were accepted
for settlement, 28,000 more than in 1999.
When analysed by nationality there were
substantial increases in acceptances from
Africa (see Table 9.3). Africa, which
accounted for 36% of total acceptances in
2000, was the leading region, followed by the
rest of Asia, the Indian subcontinent and then
Europe.
Under the Immigration Rules, nationals of
certain specified countries or territorial entities
must obtain a visa before they can enter the
UK. Other nationals subject to immigration
control require entry clearance when coming to
work or settle in the UK. Visas and other entry
clearances are normally obtained from the
nearest or other specified British diplomatic
post in a person’s home country.
Nationals of the European Economic Area
(EEA)—EU Member States plus Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein—are not subject to
substantive immigration control. They may
work in the UK without restriction. Provided

Asylum
The UK has a tradition of granting protection
to those in need, and is a signatory to the 1951
In January 2001 the Home Office
published research on the social and
economic impacts of migration. Its key
findings included:
> migrants experience mixed success in
the labour market, but on average earn
more than the existing population,
contributing to economic growth;
> there is little evidence that migration
damages the employment prospects of
existing resident workers;
migrants make significant cultural and
social contributions to UK society,
including the contributions of many
notable figures in the arts, academia,
medicine, science and sport; and
reduced transport and transaction costs
and increased economic integration, as a
result of globalisation, have led to
increased flows of people around the
world in recent years, both to and from
the UK.
United Nations Convention, and its 1967
Protocol, relating to the Status of Refugees.
These provide that refugees lawfully resident
should enjoy treatment at least as favourable as
that accorded to the indigenous population. In
the late 1980s applications for asylum (based
on the principal applicant) started to rise
dramatically from around 4,000 a year during
1985 to 1988 to 44,800 in 1991, and reached a
record 80,300 in 2000 (provisional data). The
main nationalities applying for asylum in the
UK in 2000 were people from Iraq (9%), Sri
Lanka (8%), the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (8%), Afghanistan (7%) and Iran
(7%). In the first six months of 2001,
applications for asylum averaged 5,550 a
month. This was 15% lower than in the same
period a year earlier. Between January and
June 2001 an average of 720 applications a
month were received from people from
Afghanistan; an average of 495 applications a
month were from Iraq and 460 from Somalia.
An estimated 109,205 asylum decisions
were made in 2000, more than three times the
number in 1999, reflecting a drop in the backlog
of cases. In 2000, 11% of these decisions were
grants of asylum, less than a third of the
proportion in 1999. A further 12% were grants
of exceptional leave to remain. Many failed
asylum seekers appeal against their refusal
decision. Nearly 19,400 appeals were
determined by independent adjudicators in
2000, of which 3,340 (17%) were successful.
113
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
On 3 April 2000 the National Asylum
Support Service took over responsibility for
the provision of support for those asylum
seekers who are destitute. The new
arrangements apply to those seeking asylum
on or after this date. Support will be provided
until the asylum claim is finally decided.
Those granted refugee status or who are
allowed to remain exceptionally on
humanitarian grounds are entitled to claim
public funds.
Support under the new system is provided
principally in kind, with vouchers issued to
enable asylum seekers to obtain essential living
needs. Where accommodation is provided,
this is on a 'no choice’ basis and dispersal is
throughout the UK. Legal advice for asylum
seekers is available from immigration law
advisers and firms of solicitors contracted to
provide immigration services under the
Community Legal Services Fund (formerly
the Legal Aid scheme). They will provide
advice on the initial claim and any appeal.
NATIONAL IDENTITY AND ETHNIC
GROUPS
Citizenship
Under the British Nationality Act 1981 there
are three main forms of citizenship:
> British citizenship for people closely
connected with the UK;
> British Dependent Territories citizenship
for people connected with the dependent
territories (now commonly referred to as
‘Overseas Territories’—see p. 79); and
> British Overseas citizenship for those
citizens of the UK and Colonies who did
not acquire either of the other citizenships
when the 1981 Act came into force.
British citizenship is acquired automatically
at birth by a child born in the UK if his or her
mother or, if legitimate, father is a British
citizen or is settled in the UK. A child
adopted in the UK by a British citizen is also a
British citizen. A child born abroad to a
British citizen born, adopted, naturalised or
registered in the UK is generally a British
citizen by descent. The Act safeguards the
citizenship of a child born abroad to a British
citizen in Crown service, certain related
services, or in service under an EU institution.
British citizenship may also be acquired:
> by registration for certain children,
including those born in the UK who do
not automatically acquire such
citizenship at birth, or who have been
born abroad to a parent who is a citizen
by descent;
> by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens, British Overseas
citizens, British subjects under the Act,
British Nationals (Overseas) and British
protected persons after five years’
residence in the UK, except for people
from Gibraltar who may be registered
without residence;
> by registration for stateless people and
those who have previously renounced
British nationality;
> by registration for British Dependent
Territories citizens connected with the
Falkland Islands;
> by registration for certain women who
are, or have previously been, married to
men who served in the defence of Flong
Kong during the Second World War;
> by registration for certain British
nationals who are ordinarily resident in
Hong Kong; and
> by naturalisation for all other adults aged
18 or over.
Naturalisation is at the Home Secretary’s
discretion. Requirements include five years’
residence, or three years if the applicant’s
spouse is a British citizen. Those who are not
married to a British citizen are also required to
have a sufficient knowledge of English, Welsh
or Scottish Gaelic; they must in addition
intend to have their main home in the UK or
be employed by the Crown, or by an
international organisation of which the UK is
a member, or by a company or association
established in the UK.
In 2000 around 82,000 people were granted
British citizenship in the UK, compared with
55,000 in 1999. Some 6,800 were refused in
2000, 2,900 more than in 1999. A little over
one in four of all successful applications were

from citizens of Indian subcontinent
countries, with Africa accounting for a similar
proportion and Europe about one in seven.
The largest nationalities were Pakistan and
India (10% each), and Bangladesh and Nigeria
(7% each). Residence in the UK continued to
be the most frequent basis on which persons
were granted British citizenship in 2000,
amounting to 45% of the total, while marriage
to a British citizen accounted for 35%.
Ethnic Groups
For centuries people from overseas have
settled in the UK, either to escape political or
religious persecution or in search of better
economic opportunities. The Irish have long
formed a large section of the population.
Jewish refugees who came to the UK towards
the end of the 19th century and in the 1930s
were followed by other European refugees
after 1945. Substantial immigration from the
Caribbean and Indian subcontinent dates
principally from the 1950s and 1960s, when
the Government encouraged immigration as a
means of addressing labour shortages, while
many people of South Asian descent entered
the UK as refugees from Kenya, Malawi or
Uganda in the 1960s and 1970s.
An analysis of the Labour Force Survey by
the Office for National Statistics found that,
on average between the spring 2000 and
winter 2000-01 quarters, over 4 million people
in Great Britain described themselves as
belonging to an ethnic group other than
‘White’, about one person in 14. In general,
minority ethnic groups tend to have a younger
age profile than the White population,
reflecting past immigration and fertility
patterns.
In spring 2000 members of minority ethnic
groups were heavily concentrated in the most
populous areas of England, with relatively
small numbers in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Over half lived in the South
East of England. The highest concentration
was in the London borough of Newham,
where over 60% of the local population were
not from the White group. There were also
variations in the regional concentrations of
particular ethnic groups. Nearly two-thirds of
people from Black ethnic groups lived in
Figure 9.4:

London, compared with over a third of
Indians and about a sixth of Pakistanis.
Outside London there were relatively high
concentrations of Indians in Leicester,
Wolverhampton and Birmingham, and
relatively high concentrations of Pakistanis in
Birmingham, Greater Manchester and West
Yorkshire.
Alleviating Racial Disadvantage
Many members of the Black and Asian
communities are concentrated in the inner
cities, where there are problems of deprivation
and social stress. Unemployment rates for
some of these groups are well above the
national average. For example, on average
between spring 2000 and winter 2000-01, the
unemployment rate was around 17% for both
Black and Pakistani/Bangladeshi men,
compared with 13% for White men and 8%
for Indian men.
However, some progress has been made in
tackling racial disadvantage over the last 20
years. For example, young people from some
minority ethnic groups are leading the way for
participation in education. In 2000-01, 86% of
Indian, and 95% of Black, 16 year olds were in

Many individuals have achieved distinction
in their careers and in public life, and the
proportion of people from minority ethnic
groups occupying professional and managerial
positions is increasing. In July 2001 there were
12 Members of the House of Commons from
minority ethnic groups.
The Home Office has overall responsibility
within the Government for race equality
policy and the legislation that is in place to
help achieve that. Central and local
government have economic, environmental,
educational and health programmes that are
intended to combat disadvantage. There are
also special allocations that channel extra
resources into specific projects including, for
example, the provision of specialist teachers
for children needing English language tuition.
The Government promotes equal
opportunities through training programmes,
including provision for unemployed people
who need training in English as a second
language. The Northern Ireland Executive has
established a unit to promote equality of
opportunity and good relations between
people of different ethnic backgrounds.
Race Relations Legislation
In Great Britain the Race Relations Act 1976,
as amended by the Race Relations
(Amendment) Act 2000, makes it unlawful for
anybody to discriminate on grounds of race,
colour, nationality (including citizenship), or
ethnic or national origin (referred to as ‘racial
grounds’). The legislation applies to
employment, training, education and the
provision of goods and services. Legislation
along similar lines to the 1976 Act was
introduced in Northern Ireland in 1977.
The Race Relations (Amendment) Act
imposed a statutory general duty on listed
public authorities to have due regard in
carrying out their functions to the need to
eliminate unlawful discrimination and to
promote equality of opportunity and good
relations between people of different racial
groups. Secondary legislation will detail
specific actions which key public bodies need
to take in order to comply with this duty. The
Commission for Racial Equality (see below)
will be issuing codes of practice for public
bodies. The Northern Ireland Act 1998
similarly requires public authorities to have
due regard to the desirability of promoting
good relations between people of different
ethnic backgrounds.
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 created
racially aggravated versions of a number of
existing offences in England and Wales,
including assault, criminal damage and
harassment. These racially aggravated offences
carry a higher maximum penalty. Other
provisions in criminal law prohibit incitement
to racial hatred and the publication or
dissemination of materials that are likely to
incite racial hatred.
Commission for Racial Equality
The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE),
established by the 1976 Race Relations Act, is a
publicly funded independent organisation
working in Great Britain to tackle racial
116
9: THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
discrimination and promote racial equality. It
also helps individuals with complaints about
racial discrimination; in 2000 about 11,000
people approached the CRE for advice on such
matters, and 1,553 applications for assistance
were received. It has the power to investigate
unlawful discriminatory practices and to issue
non-discrimination notices requiring such
practices to cease. It also has an important
promotional and educational role and can
undertake or fund research. In Northern
Ireland equivalent responsibilities for tackling
racial discrimination and promoting racial
equality rest with the Equality Commission for
Northern Ireland, which also covers other types
of unlawful discrimination.
The CRE supports the work of nearly 100
racial equality councils. These are autonomous
voluntary bodies set up across the UK to
promote equality of opportunity and good race
relations at local level. The Commission helps
to pay the salaries of officers employed by the
racial equality councils, most of which also
receive funds from their relevant local
authority.
ECONOMIC CHANGES
The trend in the UK’s standard of living, using
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per head at
constant market prices as an indicator, has
generally been one of steady growth since 1971.
However, within this long-term trend the UK
is subject to cycles of weaker and stronger
growth. The year-on-year growth rates for
GDP in volume terms at constant prices
suggest that the UK’s economy contracted
during the mid-1970s, at the time of the oil
crisis, and again in the early 1980s and early
1990s. However, growth has exceeded 4% a
year 11 times in the post-war period, most
recently in 1994. The long-term average annual
growth rate was 2.5% between 1948 and 2000.
GDP per head shows marked variations
between the regions of the UK. In 1999, it was
highest in London, at £16,900 per head (30%
higher than the UK average). The South East
and East were the only other regions above the
UK average. The North East had the lowest
regional GDP per head in 1999—£10,000 
followed by Northern Ireland, at £10,100, and
Wales at £10,400.
Income and Wealth
Real household disposable income per head
doubled between 1971 and 2000. During the
1970s and early 1980s growth fluctuated, and
there were some year-on-year falls. Since
then, there has been growth each year with the
exception of 1998 when there was a slight fall.
The gap between those on high and low
disposable incomes grew rapidly during the
second half of the 1980s, and then fell slightly
in the first half of the 1990s, although this
only reversed a small part of the rise seen in
the previous decade. The latest figures show
that the gap rose again in the late 1990s.
The spread of income distribution is
uneven. Individuals living in lone parent
families are more than twice as likely as the
average individual to be in the bottom fifth of
the income distribution. Pensioners are also
over-represented in the bottom two-fifths. In
1999-2000, over 40% of individuals living in
lone parent families were in the bottom fifth of
the income distribution and around half of
pensioners were in the bottom two-fifths.
Children are also disproportionately present in
low-income households. In 1999-2000, 23%
of children—around 3 million—were living in
households below 60% of median income
(before housing costs) in Great Britain.
Wages and salaries remain the main source
of household income for most households,
although the proportion they contribute has
declined, from 59% in 1987 to 56% in 1999.
The main sources of household income differ
considerably in their importance between
different types of household. The largest
source of income for pensioners is social
security benefits. In 1999-2000 benefits
accounted for 56% of the income of a single
pensioner under the age of 75 and 68% of the
income of a single pensioner over that age.
Students, on the other hand, received 24% of
their income from student loans in 1998-99,
16% from parental contributions, 14% from
grants, 12% from earnings and the rest from a
variety of sources such as gifts, overdrafts and
withdrawal of savings.
The tax and benefit system redistributes
income from households on high incomes to
those on lower incomes. Households make
payments through direct and indirect taxes,
and social security contributions, while
117
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
benefits are received through both cash
payments and provision of benefits in-kind,
such as the National Health Service.
Households with high incomes tend to pay
more in taxes than they receive in benefits,
while those on low incomes benefit more than
they are taxed. The average original income of
the top fifth of households in 1999-2000—
£54,400—was 19 times the average of the
bottom fifth—£2,800. Benefits and, to a lesser
extent, taxes reduce this inequality so that the
ratio for final income is four to one. The types
of household that tend to be net beneficiaries
from the redistribution of taxes and benefits
include lone parent families, families with
three or more children, and retired
households. Wealth continues to be much
more unequally distributed than income, with
the most wealthy 10% of the adult population
owning 56% of the total marketable wealth of
the household sector in 1998.
Social Exclusion
Social exclusion is the term given to what can
happen when individuals or areas suffer from
a combination of linked problems, such as
unemployment, poor skills, low incomes, poor
housing, high crime environments, bad health
and family breakdown. A Social Exclusion
Unit (SEU) was set up in the Cabinet Office in
1997 to coordinate and improve government
action to reduce social exclusion in England. It
looks at issues that involve a range of
government departments. There is close liaison
with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland
devolved administrations which have their own
strategies for tackling social exclusion. 1 he
Social Exclusion Unit has produced reports on
five main areas which have led to new policies
on truancy and school exclusion, rough
sleeping, a national strategy for neighbourhood
renewal, teenage pregnancy and 16 to 18 year
olds not in employment, education or training.
The Government’s approach is intended to
prevent people from becoming socially
excluded, to help people to get back on their
feet if they have become excluded, and to
ensure that there is a necessary framework of
minimum standards in areas including health,
education, employment, in-work income and in
tackling crime.
The SEU’s current projects are:
> Young runaways—a report published by
the SEU in March 2001 suggests that by
the age of 16 one in nine school-age
children in England will run away for at
least one night; a quarter of those who
run away sleep on the streets and one in
14 survive through begging, stealing,
drug dealing and prostitution; 80% of
young people run away because of family
problems.
> Children in care and education—in
England, those who have been children
in care are over-represented among
rough sleepers, prisoners and runaways.
In 1997, 75% of children in care left
school with no formal qualifications.
Children in care are ten times more likely
to be excluded from school; a quarter of
all prisoners and up to a third of rough
sleepers have been in care; and children
in care are two-and-a-half times more
likely to become teenage parents.
> Transport and social exclusion—two-
thirds of the poorest fifth of the
population in the UK have no car and
depend on public transport. If public
transport is unavailable or does not meet
their needs this can be a barrier to
inclusion. The SEU is working with
other government departments to analyse
the nature of the transport barriers that
make it difficult for people to get to
work, or to access critical services,
including healthcare, learning and shops.
> Reducing reoffending by ex-prisoners—
the SEU is working with other
government departments to cut rates of
re-offending by ex-prisoners, in particular
by boosting levels of employment and
reducing homelessness. Poor literacy and
numeracy skills mean that 90% of those
leaving prison do so without any
immediate prospect of employment, while
two-fifths will be homeless.
Neighbourhood Renewal
The Neighbourhood Renewal National
Strategy Action Plan sets out how the
118
9: THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
Government is responding to problems such
as unemployment, educational failure and
crime in England’s most deprived
communities.
The aim is to narrow the gap between
deprived areas and the rest of the country, so
that within 10 to 20 years no one should be
seriously disadvantaged by where they live.
The specific objectives are to ensure:
> economic prosperity;
> safe communities;
> high-quality schools;
> decent housing; and
> better health.
The emphasis is on attacking the core
problems of deprived areas, such as weak
economies and poor schools; harnessing the
power of all sectors to work in partnership;
and focusing existing programmes more
explicitly on these areas.
By 2004, annual expenditure will be
increased by: £10 billion on education;
£1.6 billion on the police; and £1.6 billion
on housing. This additional funding is
underpinned by minimum targets which mean
that, for the first time, government
departments will be judged on the areas where
they are doing worst, and not on the national
average. In 2001 a new Neighbourhood
One of the priorities of the National
Strategy is to get better information about
neighbourhoods in order to provide
evidence of the problems they face, to
assess need, and to monitor progress. The
Office for National Statistics is leading the
development of a new Internet-based
service—the Neighbourhood Statistics
Service {www.statistics.gov.uk/neighbourhood)
—which has the aim of meeting these
information needs. It will be developed
over several years in partnership with the
many organisations that collect the kind of
data that can inform the National Strategy
for Neighbourhood Renewal. The
information will come from making better
use of existing administrative data and
from developing methodologies and
estimates to meet other requirements.
Renewal Unit in the Department for
Transport, Local Government and the
Regions took over the leadership of the
Neighbourhood Renewal National Strategy
from the Social Exclusion Unit.
SOCIAL TRENDS
Women and Men
Employment and Income
The economic and domestic lives of women
have changed considerably in the last 30 years
and women have taken an increasingly
important role in the labour market.
According to the 1971 Census, 91% of men of
working age, compared with 56% of women,
were economically active in the UK. By spring
2001 the rate for women had increased to 72%
of women of working age, while the rate for
men had declined to 84%. The number of
women in the UK labour force increased from
10 million in 1971 to nearly 13 million in spring
2001; projections indicate that the number will
rise by 1.1 million between 1999 and 2011. The
increase in the female labour force came mainly
from a strong rise in the participation of
married women. By spring 2001, 75% of
married or cohabiting women were
economically active. The likelihood of being
economically active varies considerably
according to whether or not they have
dependent children; activity rates are lowest for
those with a child under the age of five, at 57%.
Despite the growth in female employment
in recent years, women and men still tend to
work in different occupations and pay rates are
considerably lower in sectors dominated by
women. In spring 2001 women employees
outnumbered men in clerical and secretarial
occupations by four to one, while there were
more than twice as many men as women
managers and senior officials. Around 41% of
male employees and 29% of female employees
had some form of managerial or supervisory
responsibility in spring 2001.
The average individual income of men was
higher than that of women in all age bands in
1999-2000, largely because of their higher
levels of earnings, self-employment income
and their longer hours of working. Gross
income varied across age bands and was

elected to the Westminster Parliament,
slightly fewer than the record number in the
1997 election. Women represented 18% of the
total number of seats in June 2001, below the
EU average of 25% for lower houses. Women
account for 37% of the Members of the
Scottish Parliament, 42% of the Welsh
Assembly and 14% of the members of the
Legislative Assembly in Northern Ireland. In
July 2001 seven women sat in the UK
Cabinet.
Ministerial responsibility for women’s
issues changed following the 2001 General
Election. There is a separate Minister for
Women, who reports to a Cabinet minister
with responsibility for this subject among her
other duties, but the Minister for Women now
has responsibility for coordinating a wider
range of gender equality issues, including
Source: Individual Income Series, Department for Work and Pensions
highest for women aged 25 to 29, compared
with the age group 35 to 39 for men. Across all
income levels, women contribute on average
less than a third of the family income. The gap
between male and female earnings has been
closing but the differential remains, with
female full-time employees earning around
82% of the corresponding male hourly rate in
April 2000. However, the difference in weekly
earnings was even greater—women only
earned 75% of men’s weekly earnings—
because men tend to work longer hours than
women, and are more likely than women to
receive overtime payments.
Public Policy
In the June 2001 General Election, 118

sexual orientation. She chairs the Cabinet
Committee on Equality and has day-to-day
responsibility for the Women and Equality
Unit (formerly the Women’s Unit) in the
Cabinet Office, which remains the sponsor
department for the Women’s National
Commission—an advisory committee
ensuring that women’s views are heard and
considered by government.
In Scotland, four out of 11 Cabinet
ministers are women and the Scottish
Executive has established an Equality Unit to
take forward its work in this area. The
Northern Ireland Executive has established a
Gender Policy Unit whose remit covers the
promotion of equality between men and
women, people of different sexual orientation,
people with and without dependants and
people of different marital status.
The Government is working to ensure that
the perspective of women is automatically
taken into account in the development of
government policies. It is also encouraging the
development of‘family-friendly’ employment
policies and practices (see chapter 11).
Equal Opportunities
The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 makes
discrimination between men and women
unlawful, with certain limited exceptions, in
employment, education, training and the
provision of housing, goods, facilities and
services, and protects complainants and their
supporters from victimisation. Discrimination
against married people and discriminatory job
recruitment advertisements are also unlawful.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, women in
Great Britain are entitled to equal pay with
men when doing work that is the same or
broadly similar, work which is rated as
equivalent, or work which is of equal value.
Parallel legislation on sex discrimination and
equal pay applies in Northern Ireland.
The Equal Opportunities Commission
(EOC), an independent statutory body, has
the duties of working towards the elimination
of sex discrimination; promoting equality of
opportunity between women and men;
promoting equality of opportunity in the fields
of employment and vocational training for
people who intend to undergo, are undergoing
or who have undergone gender reassignment;
and keeping under review the working of, and
proposing amendments to, the Sex
Discrimination Act and the Equal Pay Act. It
provides advice to individuals and in some
cases provides legal representation for
individuals to bring sex discrimination and
equal pay claims. The EOC runs an ‘Equality
Exchange’, with around 800 members, which
enables employers to exchange information on
good practice. In Northern Ireland equivalent
responsibilities for tackling discrimination and
promoting gender equality rest with the
Equality Commission for Northern Ireland.
The remit of this Commission also includes
race, religious and political beliefs, age, marital
status, sexual orientation, disability and people
w ith dependants.
Further details of the Government’s equal
opportunities policies may be found in chapter
6, p. 66.
The Voluntary and Community Sector
Across the UK there are many thousands of
voluntary and community organisations,
ranging from national bodies to small local
groups. Serving the community through
volunteering and more informal involvement
is a long-established tradition. One in five
adults interviewed in the 1998 British Social
Attitudes Survey said that they had taken part
in unpaid charitable work in the previous year.
Many volunteers are involved in activities
which improve the quality of life in their local
communities, or give their time to help
organise events or groups in areas as diverse as
social welfare, education, sport, heritage, the
environment and the arts.
The Government is keen to encourage
productive partnerships between the statutory
and voluntary and community sectors and also
wants to see a greater public involvement in
community life. It funds a number of
initiatives to support this aim. It is particularly
keen to encourage more involvement by
younger people, older people and employees,
and to work with voluntary organisations to
improve the delivery of public services. In
January 2001 the Government announced an
additional ^300 million in funding to support
voluntary and community activity over the

next three years. In July 2001 it also
announced that the Cabinet Office
Performance and Innovation Unit would carry
out a review of voluntary sector law and
regulation, with the intention of bringing
forward proposals for reform.
Charities
The Charity Commission for England and
Wales, a non-ministerial government
department, is responsible for the registration,
monitoring and support of organisations that
are charitable in law. The Commission does
not make grants. There are over 185,000
charities in England and Wales sharing a
combined annual income of over £24 billion.
The financial wealth of registered charities,
measured by annual income, is concentrated
in a few very large charities. The Commission
gives advice to trustees of charities on their
administration, and has a statutory
responsibility to ensure that charities make
effective use of their resources. Recent
legislation has strengthened the
Commissioners’ powers to investigate and
supervise charities. These include measures to
protect charities and donors from bogus fund¬
raisers and a new framework for charity
accounts and reports. In the reporting period
from January 1999 to March 2000, 8,300
applications were received for registration
from organisations, of which 5,400 were
accepted and placed on the Public Register
of Charities. As part of the duty to
investigate allegations of abuse or
maladministration and evaluate them for
cause for concern, 1,300 evaluations were
carried out in the 12 months to March 2000.
Where these show a cause for concern, a
formal inquiry is opened—255 formal
inquiries were completed in the year.
Funding
Voluntary organisations may receive income
from several sources, including:
> central and local government grants;
> contributions from individuals,
businesses and trusts;
> earnings from commercial activities and
investments; and
> fees from central and local government
for services provided on a contractual
basis.
The introduction of the National Lottery
(see p. 123) has given charities and voluntary
122
9: THE SOCIAL FRAMEWORK
organisations the opportunity to secure
substantial new funding for projects across a
range of activities.
CAF (Charities Aid Foundation) is a
registered charity that works to increase
resources for the voluntary sector in the UK
and overseas. As well as providing services
that are both charitable and financial, CAF
undertakes a comprehensive programme of
research, and is established as a leading source
of information on all aspects of the sector.
Another valuable source of revenue for
charities is through tax relief and tax
exemptions. The Gift Aid scheme provides
tax relief on one-off and regular cash
donations of any amount, while under the
Payroll Giving scheme, employees and those
drawing a company pension can make tax-free
donations from their earnings. In addition,
gifts of quoted stocks and shares are free of
capital gains tax and can be offset against
income.
National Lottery
National lotteries have existed in Britain
intermittently since 1569. The National
Lottery, launched in 1994, currently
comprises a twice weekly draw, a weekly draw
and scratchcard games.
Tickets or scratchcards are available from
around 36,000 retail outlets. Camelot Group
pic, the current private sector consortium
operating the Lottery, has been awarded a new
seven-year licence, which will start on 27
January 2002. In the 1999-2000 Family
Expenditure Survey, 53% of households
reported participating in the Saturday or
Wednesday night Lottery draws during the
two-week diary-keeping period following
interview. Those households that played spent
an average of £4.00 a week on the Lottery. In
1999 the British Gambling Prevalence Survey
was carried out by the National Centre for
Social Research. Overall, 68% of men and
62% of women said that they had participated
in the National Lottery Draw in the previous
year and 22% of both men and women said
that they had bought scratchcards.
Of every pound spent on the National
Lottery, an average of around 28 pence goes to
good causes. By the end of June 2001 some
£11.0 billion, including interest, had been
raised for good causes and over 92,000 awards
totalling £9.4 billion had been made. Bv
October 2001 the amount raised for good
causes is expected to have reached at least
£11.6 billion, around £2.6 billion more than
originally forecast. Almost three-quarters of
the awards have been for less than £50,000.
The average size of a lottery grant is now
£49,000, down from a peak of more than
£250,000 in 1995-96. Lottery money is shared
among several areas—health, education,
environment, arts, sport, heritage and
charities.
The National Lottery Commission
regulates the Lottery. It is headed by five
commissioners and its duties are to protect
players’ interests, to ensure the Lottery is run
with propriety, and—subject to satisfying
those two criteria—to maximise the amount
raised for good causes. Its functions include
selecting the Lottery operator, setting the
terms of its licence and ensuring that it
complies with those terms; vetting individuals
and companies associated with the National
Lottery to ensure they are ‘fit and proper’;
licensing individual games that form part of
the National Lottery; and ensuring that the
operator pays the right amount of money to
the good causes.
Leisure Trends
The most common leisure activities are home-
based, or social, such as visiting relatives or
friends. Television viewing is by far the most
popular leisure pastime, with average viewing
time for all people aged four and over being
around 24 hours a week for males and around
27 hours for females. In a poll in September
2000 by the British Film Institute the all-time
favourite British television programme was
Fa why Towers which ran for two series made
in 1975 and 1979. It has been shown again on
several occasions and also sold to over 70
countries. Nearly all households have one
television set or more, and almost nine in ten
have a video recorder. In 1999-2000, 32% of
households had satellite television.
Despite the increasing number of television
channels in recent years, the proportion of
people listening to the radio has remained
123
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
fairly stable, with about nine in ten adults
reporting listening in the four weeks prior to
interview. The average amount of time spent
listening to the radio in 1999 for people aged
four and over was around 20 hours for males
and 18 hours for females. Purchases of
compact discs (CDs) have risen rapidly, and
72% of households had a CD player in
1999-2000.
Other popular pursuits include reading,
do-it-yourself home improvements, gardening
and going out for a meal, for a drink or to the
cinema. Taking part in sporting activities
remains a popular way of spending leisure
time. Around two-fifths of adults said that
they had been walking or rambling for 2 miles
or more in the four weeks prior to interview in
the General Household Survey and the
Continuous Household Survey. Football is the
most common team sport among men—10%
had played in the previous four weeks.
Results from the 1998-2000 National Travel
Survey show that men in Great Britain
travelled, on average, 9,200 miles a year, making
an average of 1,087 trips a year. Women made a
similar number of trips (1,048) but travelled far
less distance (6,213 miles a year). Part of this
difference is related to the different types of
trips that men and women make. Travel to work
trips account for a high proportion of men’s
trips, while shorter trips, such as shopping and
escorting children to school, account for a
higher proportion of women’s trips. Men also
make more trips than women as a car driver—
59% compared with 39%. More men than
women have driving licences—82% compared
with 60% respectively—and men are more
often than women the main car driver in
households with only one car. Car ownership
increased steadily from three out of ten
households in Great Britain in the early 1960s to
seven out of ten households in 2000. Whereas
the proportion of households with one car has
changed little since the end of the 1960s, the
proportion with two or more cars has grown
from 2% in the early 1960s to 27% in 2000.
Technological Change
The rapid expansion of communication and
technology has dramatically changed the way in
which people in Britain live and work. The
number of communication tools have increased
as mobile telephones, e-mail and the Internet
have become more affordable. Very few
households are now without a home telephone,
and mobile telephones have become
increasingly popular. In 1999—2000, 95% of
households in the UK had a home telephone
and 44% had at least one mobile telephone.
Some mobile telephones are now more than
just a means of talking to someone as
technological advances have allowed people to
send and receive e-mail and access the Internet
through them. The number of households
owning home computers in the UK has almost
tripled since 1985 to 38% in 1999—2000. In the
first quarter of 2001, 9.2 million households
could access the Internet from home. This
amounts to 37% of all UK households and is
just over three times the number two years
earlier (see p. 286). Half of adults in Great
Britain have accessed the Internet at some time,
the equivalent of 23.0 million adults. Two-
fifths of adults had accessed the Internet in the
preceding month. Men were more likely to
have ever used the Internet than women. The
proportion steadily decreased with age—from
82% of all 16 to 24 year olds to 16% of those
aged 65 and over. Although there is a range of
technology available, virtually all those—
930/0—wi10 used the Internet for personal use
had done so mostly or exclusively using a
computer. Among those who had accessed the
Internet for personal use, three-quarters of
adults had done so from their own home.
Holidays
Although the proportion of British residents
who did not take a holiday of four days or
more has remained relatively unchanged over
the past three decades (41% in 1998), the
proportion taking two or more holidays
increased from 15% in 1971 to 25% in 1998.
The number of holidays taken in Great Britain
has been broadly stable over the last decade
while the number taken abroad has grown.
France overtook Spain as the most popular
holiday destination abroad in 2000. The
United States and Irish Republic were the
next most popular destinations. Among adult
residents of Great Britain who spent their
holiday (of four nights or more) in Great

Parents in the United Kingdom are required by law to see that their children
receive full-time education until the age of 16. About 70% of young people
choose to stay in full-time education after this age, either at school or further
education colleges. Around 10% of 16 year old school leavers go into work and
the remainder are guaranteed a place on government training programmes.
About a third of all young people enter universities or other institutions of
higher education.
Increasing emphasis is being placed on lifelong learning as a way of creating
skills and improving employment prospects in a changing labour market.
People who move more frequently between jobs and careers will need to be able
to change and update their qualifications.
At the beginning of the 20th century school
attendance was compulsory but the average
class size was 50 and most pupils left by the
age of 14. Many teachers were not
professionally trained and much learning was
done by rote. In England and Wales, local
authorities became responsible for state
schooling in 1902 and the 1944 Education Act
subsequently led to an expansion of secondary
education. Eleven year olds took a test (the
‘11-plus’) which determined the type of
secondary school that they attended. Those
who passed (about 20%) went to grammar
schools and the rest to secondary modern or
technical schools. In the 1960s a new system of
comprehensive education was adopted by
most education authorities. The emphasis
switched to mixed ability teaching and the
11-plus was largely abandoned, although it
continued in Northern Ireland. Since the
1980s approved national curricula have been
introduced and pupils are assessed against the
level of attainment expected at certain ages.
Measures have also been taken to increase
parental choice and involvement.
ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENTS
State schools in England and Wales are
maintained by local government education
authorities (LEAs). With a few exceptions,
this is also the position in Scotland. In
Northern Ireland five education and library
boards fund all controlled and maintained
schools and the Department of Education
funds voluntary grammar and grant-
maintained integrated schools (see p. 128).
Further education colleges in the UK are
controlled by autonomous governing bodies,
126
10: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
with representation from businesses and the
local community. Universities and higher
education colleges are legally independent
corporate institutions with individual
governing bodies.
A number of central government
departments are responsible for education
policy:
> the Department for Education and Skills
(DfES) in England;
> the National Assembly for W ales
Training and Education Department
(NATED);
> the Scottish Executive Education
Department (primary and secondary
education) and the Scottish Executive
Enterprise and Lifelong Learning
Department; and
> the Department of Education and the
Department for Employment and
Learning in the Northern Ireland
Executive.
The Government published a White Paper
in September 2001: Schools: Achieving
Success. This proposes a number of
reforms to improve standards, encourage
innovation, reduce and simplify
regulations, enhance the diversity of
secondary education and improve the
ability of that sector to respond to the
talents and aspirations of individual
students. The policy objectives in the
W hite Paper are for England, but the
legislation that is planned to achieve these
goals will cover England and W ales. Many
of the provisions will be enabling in
character and, in accordance with the
principles of the devolution settlement, the
National Assembly for W ales will decide
whether they should apply in Wales.
The education service in Great Britain is
financed in the same way as other local
government services (see chapter 6, p. 68),
with education authorities funding schools
largely on the basis of pupil numbers. Specific
central government grants are made to
education authorities in Great Britain in order
to improve school performance in literacy,
numeracy and information and
communications technology (ICT). The
Government also allocates some resources
direct to schools for them to use as they wish.
The costs of education and library boards are
met directly by the Northern Ireland
Executive.
In England, public funding is given to
further education colleges by the Learning
and Skills Council and in Whales by the
National Council for Education and Training
for W ales. Colleges in Northern Ireland are
financed through the Northern Ireland
Executive. Government finance is distributed
to higher education institutions by higher
education funding councils in England,
Scotland and Wales and by the Department
for Employment and Learning in Northern
Ireland.
Planned spending on education in the UK
as a proportion of Gross National Product in
2001-02 is 5% and will rise to a projected
5.3% in 2003-04.
SCHOOLS
Parents are required by law to see that their
children receive full-time education between
the ages of 5 and 16 in England, Scotland and
W ales and between 4 and 16 in Northern
Ireland. About 94% of pupils receive free
education from public funds, while the others
attend independent fee-paying schools or are
educated at home.
In England and Wales, schools supported
by public funds are now classified into three
broad categories. Community schools consist
in the main of schools that were traditionally
owned and funded by LEAs. Foundation
schools include many of the former grant-
maintained schools. Many schools in the
voluntary category are connected to a
particular religious faith. The White Paper
proposes that new faith schools should be
encouraged where there is local support and
where they would add to the inclusiveness and
diversity of the school system. More generally,
schools would be encouraged to work with
external partners—for example from the
voluntary, private or faith-based sectors—and
LEAs would advertise when a new school is

In Northern Ireland all schools must be
open to all religions. In practice, however,
most Protestant children attend one of the 643
controlled schools, managed by education and
library boards, while most Roman Catholic
children attend one of 542 voluntary
maintained schools. There are, in addition 54
voluntary grammar schools (which tend to be
Catholic or non-denominational in character).
The 44 integrated schools aim to educate
Roman Catholic and Protestant children
together. These schools are controlled or
grant-maintained. The Government has a
statutory duty to encourage integrated
education as a way of breaking down sectarian
barriers. Publicly financed schools can apply
to become integrated, following a majority
vote by parents.

Pre-school Education
Pre-school education is expanding
considerably in order to ensure that all
children begin school with a basic foundation
in literacy and numeracy. The proportion of
three and four year olds enrolled in UK
schools rose from 21% in 1970—71 to 63% in
2000-01. Private and voluntary providers have
also increased their provision.
National Child Care Strategy
The National Child Care Strategy was
launched in 1998 to address the need for good
128
10: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
quality affordable childcare for working
parents. The aim is to provide childcare places
for 1.6 million children in England by 2004.
Some 45,000 new daycare places will be
created in neighbourhood nursery centres.
Similar strategies apply in Wales and Scotland.
Sure Start
The Sure Start Programme supports local
projects for families with children under four
years of age. The aim is to establish 500 local
programmes in England by 2004: this will
cover 400,000 children. By September 2001,
437 programmes had been announced, 192 of
which had started delivering services. Core
services include visits to new parents within
two months of a birth, support for improved
childcare, play, early learning and access to
health care. Parents also receive advice on
ante-natal support, healthy eating and help to
find work. Similar Sure Start programmes
cover the rest of the UK.
England
In January 2000, 97% of four year old
children in England whose parents wanted one
had a free part-time early education place.
Half of three year olds are also in early
education and it is intended to make a place
available to every three year old by 2004.
Scotland
Every four year old child whose parents want
one has a part-time pre-school place, as do
80% of three year olds. The Scottish
Executive has set a number of targets, which
include making a nursery place available to
every three year old by April 2002, training
more childcare workers and expanding
provision outside of schools.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland the aim is to provide a
year of pre-school education for every child
whose parents wish them to have one. A
phased expansion programme is increasing
free provision from 45% in 1997-98 to 85% in
2001-02.
Primary Schools
Age Ranges
In England and Wales, infant schooling begins
at age five, primary schooling at age seven and
secondary education at age 11. However, some
schools cater for different age ranges. Primary
education in Scotland starts at the age of five
and continues until the age of 12. School
classes are organised by age group, from
primary 1 to primary 7. In Northern Ireland,
children attend primary school for seven years
from the beginning of the school year
following their fourth birthday.
Class Sizes
In recent years steps have been taken to reduce
the size of infant school classes. In England, for
example, only 2% of infants were in classes of 31
or more in January 2001, compared with 29% in
January 1998. The overall average class size in
primary schools is 26.8 in England (January
2001) and 24.4 in Scotland.
Secondary Schools
England and Wales
Over 87% of the 3,180,000 state secondary
pupils in England and all pupils in Wales
attend comprehensive schools. These largely
take pupils without reference to ability or
aptitude, providing a wide range of secondary
education for all or most of the children in a
district. Some are middle schools with a pupil
age range of 8 to 14. Some 600,000 pupils
attend non-maintained schools, including
independent fee-paying schools.
Scotland
Scottish state secondary education is non-
selective, without reference to ability or
aptitude. Nearly all the schools cover ages 12
to 18. In 2000-01 there were 317,704 pupils in
state secondary schools and a further 17,537
attended private schools.
Northern Ireland
Secondary education is organised largely on
selective lines, with grammar schools
129
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
admitting pupils on the basis of tests in
English, mathematics and science. In 2000-01,
62,574 pupils attended grammar schools (40%
of secondary pupils) and 92,979 attended
non-grammar secondary schools, of whom
8,688 were educated in integrated schools
(see p. 128).
City Technology Colleges and City Academies
There are 15 City Technology Colleges
situated in English cities. They are state-
funded independent schools run by private
sponsors, operating outside the normal local
government framework. They provide free
education for 11 to 16 year olds in inner city
areas with a curriculum focusing on science,
mathematics and technology.
City Academies are publicly funded
independent schools involving sponsors from
the private and voluntary sectors. 4 heir aim is
to offer new responses to the persistent school
failure that sometimes occurs in city areas.
The initiative was launched in March 2000
and 13 partnerships had been announced by
September 2001. The White Paper proposes
at least 20 City Academies by 2005 and an
extension of the model to rural as well as
urban areas.
State Specialist Schools
An increasing number of state secondary
schools in England have been designated as
specialist schools. This status can be achieved
by raising private sector sponsorship,
preparing development plans for the teaching
of specialist subjects and sharing resources
and good practice with other schools and the
local community. The schools specialise in
technology, mathematics and science; modern
foreign languages; sport; or the arts—in
addition to providing the National
Curriculum (see p. 132). New specialisms will
be introduced in September 2002.
By September 2001 there were 685 specialist
schools in England: 367 technology colleges,
126 language colleges, 101 sports colleges and
91 arts colleges. Some are located in Excellence
in Cities areas and Education Action Zones
while some are Beacon Schools (see p. 131).
From September 2002, high performing
schools can become Advanced Specialist
Colleges with an additional focus, for example,
on teacher and leadership training.
The White Paper proposes a new target of
at least 1,500 specialist schools by 2005.
Schools will be able to apply for ‘working
towards’ status and be offered support to
develop a distinct specialism.
Excellence in Cities
Excellence in Cities was launched in England
by the Government in 1999 to address
educational problems in the big cities. By
September 2001 it included 1,000 schools and
one-third of all secondary age pupils. The
programme has six elements:
> Learning Mentors—paid staff who help
pupils overcome learning obstacles;
> over 1,000 Learning Support Units
where pupils with problems can be
taught until they are ready to return to
the classroom;
> a network of new school-based City
Learning Centres which share their latest
ICT facilities with other schools;
> more Beacon and specialist schools;
> small Education Action Zones; and
> extended opportunities for gifted and
talented pupils.
Education Action Zones
Education Action Zones have been formed in
deprived areas in order to help raise
educational standards. A zone is typically
made up of two or three secondary schools,
with their associated primary and special
school provision, working in partnership with
parents, schools, businesses, the LEA, the
local Learning and Skills Council (see p. 138)
and others. Each zone is run by an action
forum comprising these partners.
Latest figures indicate that 1,650 schools
with 583,000 pupils are participating in 113
zones. In September 2001 about one in ten
schools was in a zone.
130
10: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Beacon Schools
The Beacon Schools initiative is intended to
raise standards by sharing and spreading good
practice. As part of Excellence in Cities, the
initiative is supporting schools in the most
under-achieving areas. Beacon Schools are
given extra funding to build partnerships with
other schools in order to foster the exchange
of knowledge between professionals. By
September 2001, there were 1,000 Beacon
Schools in England, including 250 secondary
schools. 1 he White Paper proposes an
expansion of secondary Beacon Schools to
400 by 2005.
Independent Schools
Independent schools providing full-time
education for five or more pupils of
compulsory school age must register by law
with the appropriate government department
and are subject to inspection. There are about
2,400 independent schools in the UK
educating over 600,000 pupils. Independent
schools are not funded by the state and obtain
most of their finances from fees paid by
parents and income from investments. Some
of the larger independent boarding schools are
known as public schools.
Under the Music and Ballet Schools
Scheme, the Government gives income-
related help with fees to 800 pupils at five
music schools, three ballet schools and for 80
choristers attending cathedral choir schools.
Some 1,900 children attend the music and
ballet schools.
School Management
England and Wales
All state schools work in partnership with, and
receive recurrent funding from, LEAs, while
managing 85% of their budgets and staffing.
They are run by governing bodies, comprising
parents, school staff, LEA and local
community representation. The White Paper
proposes giving schools more flexibility by
replacing some of the current legislative
requirements in respect of school governance
with statutory guidance, and by removing
barriers to cooperation between schools.
LEAs and school governing bodies
responsible for pupil admissions are expected to
work with head teachers, the churches and
others in local forums to coordinate admission
arrangements, taking account of statutory codes
of practice. Any disagreements on school
organisation or admissions in England are
referred to an independent Adjudicator; those
regarding religious or denominational admission
criteria are referred to the Secretary of State for
Education and Skills. In Wales the National
Assembly decides all cases of disagreement.
Admission authorities are not allowed to
introduce selection by ability, unless it is for
sixth form admission or is designed to ensure
that pupils of all abilities are admitted and that
no one level of ability is over- or under¬
represented. Where existing partial selection
by ability is challenged, the Adjudicator (in
Wales the National Assembly) decides
whether it should continue.
In England local parents are allowed to
petition for a ballot and (if sufficient numbers
locally wish it) to vote on whether to keep
selective admission arrangements in the case
of the 164 designated grammar schools which
select pupils by high ability.
Scotland
Nearly all Scottish schools are education
authority schools financed by the authorities
and central government. The head teacher is
responsible for decision-making on at least
80% of school-level expenditure. A review of
devolved school management is nearing
completion.
In May 2000, 83% of eligible education
authority schools had a school board consisting
of elected parents and teachers and members
coopted from the local community. In addition
to promoting contact between parents, the
school and the community, they are involved in
procedures to appoint senior staff and for the
community use of school premises. They may
also take on further executive functions by
delegation from their education authority.
Seven grant-aided schools, for children with
special educational needs, are run by boards of
managers who receive government grants.
131
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Northern Ireland
Boards of governors are responsible for the
management of individual schools and include
elected parents and teachers among their
members. Virtually all schools have delegated
budgets under which school governors
determine spending priorities.
pupil attendance/absence, 5-14 attainment
targets and results, and the destinations of
school leavers. Schools are required to provide
parents with information about their
children’s attainment in each subject, pupil
attainment targets and teachers’ comments on
their progress.
Rights of Parents
England and Wales
Parents have a statutory right to information
about schools and to express a preference for a
school for their child. There is an appeal
system (see p. 131) if their choice is not met.
The information to which they are entitled
includes:
> annual national performance tables on a
school-by-school basis;
> an annual prospectus, including
summaries of the school s results in
National Curriculum assessment tests,
public examinations, vocational
qualifications (if applicable) and rates of
pupil absence.
Parents must be given a written annual report
on their child’s achievements in all subjects,
including results of tests and examinations.
Arrangements must also be made for the
discussion of reports with teachers.
Parents are also entitled to see or be
provided with a copy of their child s pupil
record within 15 school days of making a
written request. Unless there is a court order
preventing it, all parents have a right to
participate in decisions about their child’s
education.
Home/school agreements set out the
responsibilities of schools, pupils and parents
and are a statutory requirement for all
maintained schools.
Scotland
Parents have a statutory right to express their
choice of school and the education authority
must meet this request except in certain
circumstances set out in law. Information is
published on school costs, examination results,

The system of reporting to parents is broadly
similar to that in England and Wales, except
that no annual performance tables on a school-
by-school basis are published.
School Curriculum
England and Wales
Subjects taught to children between the age of
5 and 16 are largely determined by the
National Curriculum which has four Key
Stages (see Table 10.4). At each Key Stage the
core subjects of English (and in W ales,
Welsh), mathematics and science must be
taught. History, geography, art/design and
music are also compulsory in the earlier
stages but become optional at Key Stage 4.
A modern foreign language is compulsory at
Key Stages 3 and 4, although this is optional
at Key Stage 4 in Wales. Physical education,
design/technology and information and
communications technology are also
compulsory at all four Key Stages. In
2002 the subject of ‘citizenship’ will become
compulsory at Key Stages 3 and 4.
Other subjects, such as drama, dance and
classical languages, are optional. It is intended
that over time every primary school child
should have the opportunity to learn to play a
musical instrument and explore one of a range
of sports.

10: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
The National Curriculum contains
programmes of study for each Key Stage
outlining what pupils should be taught as well
as targets setting out expected standards of
pupil performance.
Religious education—all state schools must
provide religious education. Locally agreed
syllabuses must reflect Christianity while
taking account of the other main religions
practised in the UK. Parents have the right to
withdraw their children from religious
education classes.
Sex education—state secondary schools are
required to provide sex education for all
pupils, including education about HIV/AIDS
and other sexually transmitted diseases.
Parents are entitled to withdraw their children
from sex education classes other than those
required by the National Curriculum. All state
schools must provide information to parents
about the content of their sex education
courses.
Assessment and testing—at the ages of 7,
11 and 14, school pupils are assessed by their
teachers on their progress in the core subjects
of English, mathematics and science (and
Y\ elsh in Welsh medium schools in Wales).
They also take tests in English and
mathematics at these ages, and in science at
11 and 14. The results are shown as a level on
the National Curriculum scale. A typical seven
year old is expected to achieve level two, a
typical 11 year old level four, and a typical
14 year old between levels five and six. At 14,
pupils are also assessed in other subjects.
Literacy and numeracy—the Government
has set national targets to improve literacy and
numeracy for 11 year olds in England. These
are for 80% of them to reach the standards for
their age (level four in Key Stage 2) in English
and 75% in mathematics by 2002. The
Government has proposed higher targets for
2004 and will be consulting about these in
late 2001.
Summer schools are available to help those
11 year olds who have failed to meet national
standards in mathematics and literacy. In 2001
funding was provided for 2,200 such schools,
assisting 66,000 pupils. New tests have been
introduced to monitor the progress of these
pupils in the first year of their secondary
education.
Following a pilot covering 205 schools, a
Key Stage 3 National Strategy is being
introduced in order to raise standards in the
early years of secondary education. The
strategy is beginning with English and
mathematics but will be extended to science
and ICT. Targets have been set for the
proportion of pupils achieving level five or
above at the end of Key Stage 3 in both 2004
and 2007. The White Paper proposes that
national results for 14 year olds and new
measures of progress between the ages of 11
and 14 should be published.
In Wales the National Assembly has adopted
targets for attainments in English, Welsh (first
language), mathematics and science.
Qualifications—the General Certificate of
Secondary Education (GCSE) is the main
examination taken by pupils at the age of 16.
GCSE short courses are also available in a
limited range of subjects, occupying half the
time of full GCSEs. In addition, the Part One
General National Vocational Qualification
(GNVQ) is available for 14 to 16 year olds. It
covers arts and design, business, engineering,
health and social care, ICT, leisure and
tourism, and manufacturing. In a bid to
expand vocational opportunities, GNVQs will
be replaced in 2002 by vocational GCSEs.
All GCSE and other qualifications offered
to pupils in state schools must be approved by
the Government. Syllabuses and assessment
procedures must comply with national
guidelines and be approved by the
Qualifications and Curriculum Authority
(QCA) in England and by its Welsh
counterpart, ACCAC. Both are independent
government agencies responsible for ensuring
that the curriculum and qualifications are of
high quality, coherent and flexible.
The proportion of final-year pupils achieving
five or more GCSE grades A* to C or equivalent
in the United Kingdom was over 50% in 2000,
compared with just over 46% in 1997. Extra
assistance will be given to every school with
under 25% achieving these results.
Scotland
There is no statutory national curriculum in
Scotland. National guidelines for pupils aged
5—14 set out the ground to be covered and the
133
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
way pupils’ learning should be assessed and
reported. Progression is measured by
attainment of five levels, based on the
expectation of the performance of the majority
of pupils at certain ages between 5 and 14. It is
recognised that pupils learn at different rates
and that some will reach the various levels
before others. There are curriculum
guidelines for languages, mathematics, ICT,
environmental studies, expressive arts,
religious and moral education, health
education, and personal and social
development.
Pupils can study a modern European
language during the last two years of primary
education. There are 57 units in primary
schools where education takes place through
the Gaelic language. There are some other
schools where Gaelic can be learned as a
second language.
Education authorities must ensure that
pupils are given religious instruction, though
parents can withdraw their children if the\
wish. Government guidance on sex education
is given to education authorities and head
teachers.
Pupils are assessed by their teachers in all
aspects of the curriculum through primary
years and the first two years of secondary
education. In addition, teachers select and
administer tests in reading, writing and
mathematics from a national catalogue. Tests
can take place at any time during the school
year and at any age.
Pupils take National Qualifications (NQ) at
Standard Grade after four years of secondary
education at the age of 16. These examinations
are conducted by the Scottish (Qualifications
Authority (SQA). In 2000 some 34% of these
pupils gained five or more Standard Grades at
levels 1-2; the proportions of those achieving
these grades at levels 1-4 and 1-6 were 76%
and 89% respectively.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland curriculum,
compulsory in all publicly financed schools,
consists of six broad areas of study: English,
mathematics, science and technology, the
environment and society, creative and
expressive studies and, in secondary schools
and some primary schools, language studies.
The main churches have approved a core
syllabus for religious education which must be
taught in all grant-aided schools.
There are also a number of cross-curricular
themes, including cultural heritage, education
for mutual understanding, health education
and information and communications
technology. Secondary schools have two
additional themes, namely, economic
awareness and careers education.
Sex education is taught through the
compulsory science study programme and the
health education cross-curricular theme.
Statutory pupil assessment is broadly in
line with practice in England and Wales,
taking place at 8, 11, 14 and 16. The GCSE
examination is used to assess 16 year old
pupils.
The Northern Ireland curriculum is
currently under review.
Educational Standards
England and Wales
The Office for Standards in Education
(OFSTED) in England and the Office of Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector in Wales (Estyn) aim
to improve the quality and standards of
education through independent inspections and
advice. Schools are inspected at least once in six
years, but more often where weaknesses have
been identified in an earlier inspection. Schools
must produce an action plan to address the key
issues raised in the inspection report.
In cases where inspectors find that a school
is failing to provide an acceptable education
and is in need of special measures to turn it
round, OFSTED inspectors make regular
visits to the school to monitor implementation
of the action plan. The average time for a
school to come off these special measures is
just under two years. If the school does not
improve during this period, the Secretary ol
State for Education and Skills can require the
LEA to close the school and replace it with a
Fresh Start school which receives further
targeted finance and professional support.
Since OFSTED inspections began in 1993,
nearly 800 schools have improved and been
taken off special measures.
134
10: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
The Government has announced plans to
allow weak or failing schools to be managed
by private or voluntary sponsors, including
other successful schools. The White Paper
(see p. 127) proposes new powers to replace
governing bodies with an interim executive
board if the former are part of the problem.
LEAs would be expected to invite external
partners to help turn round failing schools.
OFSTED data indicate that teaching has
improved in all types of school over the past
five years. Unsatisfactory teaching has been
reduced from one lesson in five to one in 20
and good teaching increased from 40% of
lessons to 60%.
Scotland
HM Inspectorate of Education began
operating as an executive agency of the
Scottish Executive in April 2001. It inspects,
reviews and reports on state and independent
schools, further education colleges and the
education functions of local authorities.
Reports are published and are usually followed
up within two years.
Northern Ireland
The purpose of inspection is to help promote
the highest possible standards of education
and professional practice, and to provide
information and policy advice to the
Department of Education, the Department of
Culture, Arts and Leisure, and the
Department for Employment and Learning.
Children with Special Educational
Needs
A child is said to have special educational
needs (SEN) if he or she has significantly
greater difficulty in learning than other
children of the same age or a disability which
makes it difficult to use normal educational
facilities. Each SEN child has the right to
receive a broad and balanced education. State
schools must publish information for parents
about their SEN policy.
England and Wales
In January 2001 approximately 1.8 million
pupils were identified as having special
educational needs. If an LEA believes that it
should determine the education for an SEN
child, it must draw up a formal statement of
the child’s special needs and the action it
intends to meet them. About 260,000
children with SEN have these statements.
The LEA is required to comply with the
parents’ choice of school unless this is
inappropriate for the child or incompatible
with the efficient education of other children
or with the efficient use of resources. Parents
have a right of appeal to the Special
Educational Needs Tribunal if they disagree
with certain LEA decisions about their child.
The Tribunal’s verdict is final and binding
on all parties. Over 60% of SEN pupils with
statements are educated in mainstream
schools while most of the others are educated
in special schools.
In March 2001 the Government announced a
£25 million package to improve the prospects of
children with SEN. Much of the money will be
used to train specialist child care and
educational needs officers, including 850 area
specialists. Regional networks of SEN experts
are to be set up to work with local authorities.
Legislation was passed in 2001 covering
England, Scotland and Wales. It states that
LEAs and schools must not treat disabled
pupils less favourably, without justification,
than non-disabled pupils. Reasonable steps
will have to be taken in cases where education
arrangements have placed a disabled pupil at
a substantial disadvantage compared with non¬
disabled pupils. The legislation will also
strengthen the right of SEN children to be
educated in mainstream schools where parents
wish it and where the interests of other
children can be protected.
LEAs are required to provide parents of
SEN children with advice and information
and a means of resolving disputes with schools
and LEAs. They must also comply, within a
prescribed period, with any order made by the
SEN Tribunal.
Information and Communications
Technology in Schools
England and Wales
The National Grid for Learning programme
was launched in 1998 in order to increase the
135
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
use made by pupils and teachers of computer
(and especially Internet) resources. By 2001,
96% of primary and 99% of secondary schools
were connected to the Internet and schools
had achieved computer to pupil ratios of
1:12.6 in primary and 1:7.9 in secondary
schools. By 2001 nearly one in eight teachers
had received a subsidised computer through
various government schemes.
The National Grid for Learning has
commissioned courses in mathematics, Latin
and Japanese at Key Stage 3 to be delivered
using ICT and has also launched a Grid Club
for 7-11 year olds.
Scotland
Learning & Teaching Scotland provides
independent advice to Scottish ministers on the
use of ICT in schools and supports research
work on ICT and the school curriculum. All
schools will be connected to the Internet in 2001.
In September 2000 there was one computer for
every 18 primary school pupils and one for every
seven secondary pupils. A National Grid for
Learning is also being developed in Scotland.
Northern Ireland
All schools are connected to the Internet
through the Northern Ireland Network for
Education, the local arm of the National Grid
for Learning. Computer to pupil ratios range
from 1:14 at Key Stage 1 to 1:6.5 at Key Stage
5 and 1:5 in special schools. About 12,000
laptop computers have been provided to
facilitate teacher training and to improve their
competence in ICT.
Teachers
England and Wales
New teachers in state primary and secondary
schools are required to be graduates and must
hold Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). There
are two main ways to become a teacher:
> by taking a Bachelor of Education degree
at a university or college of higher
education. The course includes subject
and professional studies, combined with
practical teaching experience in schools
where students teach a limited timetable
under the supervision of an experienced
teacher; or
> by enabling graduates to take a one-year
Postgraduate Certificate in Education
course leading to QTS. All postgraduate
courses focus on professional preparation
for teaching in a chosen subject and
include the National Curriculum.
A third route into the profession will allow
undergraduates on traditional academic
degrees to take education modules and so gain
part of a teacher education qualification.
Other programmes offer the opportunity
for people aged 24 and over to earn a salary
while following a teacher training programme
in a school. These programmes are
particularly suitable for overseas-trained
teachers who do not hold QTS, mature career
changers, school support staff and people who
have had previous teaching experience.
Revised arrangements for the development
of the teaching profession in England were
implemented from September 2000. Key
aspects include the creation of the National
College for School Leadership (responsible for
training head teachers); the introduction of a
new pay system; and measures to attract high-
quality graduates to teaching and to move
outstanding teachers quickly through the
profession.
All teachers working in state schools must
be registered with the General Teaching
Council for England, a teachers’ professional
body which, among other things, has power to
strike a teacher from the register on grounds
of professional misconduct or incompetence.
Similar reforms are taking place in Wales,
including the establishment of a General
Teaching Council for Wales in 2000.
The White Paper (see p. 127) states that the
Government will be examining the potential for
providing more time during the working week
for planning, preparation and management.
Scotland
All teachers in education authority schools
must be registered with the General Teaching
Council for Scotland. The Council gives advice
to the Scottish Executive on teacher supply and
136
10: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
the professional suitability of teacher training
courses. It is also responsible for disciplinary
procedures under which a teacher guilty of
professional misconduct may be removed
temporarily or permanently from the register.
Teacher qualification procedures are
similar to those in England and Wales,
including the Bachelor of Education degree
and the Postgraduate Certificate in Education.
There is also a combined degree, sometimes
known as a concurrent degree. All pre-service
courses are validated by a higher education
institution accredited by the Council and
approved by the Scottish Executive. The
Education Inspectorate has powers to inspect
teacher education and training.
Northern Ireland
All entrants to teaching in grant-aided schools
are graduates and hold an approved teaching
qualification. Initial teacher training is
integrated with induction and early in-service
training, the latter covering a period of three
years. A Professional Qualification for
Headship is being developed, equivalent to the
arrangements in England and Wales. A General
Teaching Council is also being established. The
main teacher training courses are Bachelor of
Education Honours (four years) and the one-
year Postgraduate Certificate of Education.
The education and library boards have a
statutory duty to provide curricular support
services and in-service training.
Careers
All young people in full-time education are
entitled to career information, advice and
guidance.
In England the current work of school
careers services with 13 to 19 year olds will be
subsumed within the new Connexions Service
which is being implemented across the
country by 2002—03. It coordinates careers,
youth and other statutory and voluntary
services for young people and is delivered by a
network of personal advisers based in a variety
of settings, including schools and colleges.
The National Assembly for Wales launched
Careers Wales—an information, advice and
guidance service for all age groups—in April
2001. Additional help will be aimed at those
most at risk of failing to realise their potential.
In Northern Ireland careers education forms
part of the secondary school curriculum (see
p. 134).
All secondary schools in England and
Wales, and primary and secondary schools in
Northern Ireland, provide leavers with a
Record of Achievement setting out their
attainments, including public examination and
National Curriculum assessment results. The
Record is not compulsory in Scotland.
Education Business Links
The Learning and Skills Council (ESC—see
p. 138) is responsible for developing education
business links in England. Local and national
organisations have formed local consortia in
each of the 47 LSC areas to help the Council
to carry out this responsibility. The aim is to
ensure that all young people have high-quality
work experience during their time at school in
order to raise standards, develop key skills and
prepare effectively for adult and working life.
Careers Wales works with schools and
colleges to ensure that all young people
undertake work experience placements and
have the opportunity to learn about business
and enterprise. Business support for the
delivery of the curriculum is organised by
the National Council for Education and
Training.
In Northern Ireland, links are fostered
through the Northern Ireland Business
Education Partnership, which supports a
network of local partnerships and five area
partnerships aligned to the five education and
library boards.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AFTER 16
After compulsory education is finished, young
people can choose to stay on at school, attend
college or take part in work-based learning.
About 70% of 16 year olds continue in full¬
time education in school sixth forms, sixth
form colleges or further education colleges.
The Government is keen to promote
lifelong learning and the Learning and Skills

Council was established in April 2001 in order
to play a lead role in planning and funding all
post-16 learning outside higher education.
Under the Welfare-to-Work programme
(see p. 154), all young unemployed people are
guaranteed education and training, while those
with poor basic skills can take part in full-time
study on an approved course.
As part of a pilot programme in one-third
of England, there is a weekly Education
Maintenance Allowance (EMA) for 16 and 19
year olds who continue their education.
Students can qualify for allowances of up to
£30 a week with bonuses for achievement.
England and Wales
Students may continue to study for
examinations leading to higher education,
professional training or vocational qualifications.
They can also take non-examination courses.
The academic General Certificate of
Education Advanced (GCE A) level is usually
taken at the age of 18 after two years’ full-time
study; it is graded on a scale from A to E. The
Advanced Subsidiary (AS) qualification is
worth 50% of the marks of an A level; it is
designed to encourage the take up of more
subjects, particularly in the first year of post-
16 study, and to help the transition from
GCSE into advanced level study.
New GCE A level specifications were
introduced in 2000, made up of six units and
offering candidates the choice of end-of-
course or staged assessment. Figure 10.6
shows increases in A level or equivalent
achievements.
National Vocational Qualifications
England, Wales and Northern Ireland have a
wide range of National Vocational
Qualifications (NVQs), awards which
recognise work-related skills and knowledge in
areas such as business, engineering and health
and social care. Prepared by industry and
business, including representatives from trade
unions and professional bodies, N\ Qs are
based on national standards of competence
and can be achieved at levels 1 to 5. \ ocational
A levels replaced Advanced GNVQs in
September 2000. The remaining two classes of
GNVQjtre to be replaced by Vocational
GCSEs.
The Qualifications and Curriculum
Authority is responsible for supervising
academic and vocational qualifications in
England. Corresponding bodies in Wales
(ACCAC) and Northern Ireland perform
similar functions.
Learning and Skills Council
In England, the Learning and Skills Council
(ESC) is responsible for planning, funding,
monitoring and improving the quality of post-
16 education and training up to higher
education level. Its remit covers basic skills,
higher level skills in further education, work-
based training for young people and adult and
community education. From 2002-03 it will
also take on responsibility for school sixth
form funding. The Council has a statutory

duty to encourage participation in learning
and works with employers and others to
promote workforce development and
economic regeneration. There is a network of
47 local LSC offices.
National Council for Education and
Training for Wales
The National Council has a very similar remit
to the LSC. It is responsible for post-16
education and training, with the exception of
higher education. There are 21 local voluntary
partnerships (Community Consortia for
Education and Training) linking LEAs,
schools, colleges, voluntary organisations,
private training providers, employers and
trade unions. The National Council and the
Higher Education Funding Council for Wales
operate together under the name Education
and Learning Wales.
Scotland
In Scotland education for those aged 16 to
18 has been reformed. Traditional, fairlv
academic Highers (Higher Grade Scottish
Certificate of Education) have been replaced
by National Qualifications (NQ) courses and
units offering students greater flexibility and,
through a revised assessment system, more
opportunities to demonstrate academic and
139
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
vocational achievement. It is intended that the
new system should be fully in place by 2003.
The Scottish Qualifications Authority is
the national accreditation organisation.
Further Education Colleges
People over the age of 16 can take courses in
further education colleges with a choice of
academic and vocational provision. Many
colleges offer government-sponsored training
programmes. Most students attend part-time,
either by day release or block release from
employment or during the evenings. The
sector has an important role in promoting
economic development and social inclusion,
and has strong ties with commerce and
industry.
Colleges in the UK are controlled by
autonomous governing bodies, with
representation from business and the local
community. In England, public funding is
given to colleges by the ESC and in Wales by
the National Council for Education and
Training for Wales. Colleges in Northern
Ireland are financed through the Northern
Ireland Executive.
The ESC is providing 3CIOO million over
the next three years to help colleges meet the
economy ’s rising skill needs by developing
centres of vocational excellence in subjects
such as construction, engineering, electronics
and ICT. By 2003-04, 50% of general further
education colleges will have a specialism.
An online National Learning Network links
all further education colleges to super JANET,
the UK’s education and research network.
Independent inspectors assess the quality
of education provided by colleges, which are
required to explain how they will put things
right if there are major criticisms. In England
OFSTED (see p. 134) inspects provision for
16 to 19 year olds in schools and colleges and
the Adult Learning Inspectorate performs the
same function for post-19 provision in
colleges and for work-based learning for all
post-16s.
In Scotland colleges are inspected by Her
Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education (see
p. 135); in Northern Ireland by the Education
and Training Inspectorate and in Wales by
Estyn.
Student Support
Support for further education students in
England includes a subsidy towards course
fees for 16-18 year olds, fee remission for
those aged 19 or over on low incomes and a
discretionary access fund (£62 million in
2001-02) to help meet the costs of books,
equipment, travel and fees. The Child Care
Support Fund (£30 million in 2001-02)
provides discretionary child care support for
students.
Higher Education
Around 30% of young people in England and
Wales, 40% in Scotland and 45% in Northern
Ireland take degree and other advanced
courses in universities and other colleges. An
increasing number of mature students also
study for these qualifications.
Universities and Higher Education Colleges
The UK’s 87 universities enjoy academic
freedom, appoint their own staff, admit
students and award their own degrees. The
universities of Oxford and Cambridge date
from the 13th century and the Scottish
universities of St Andrews, Glasgow and
Aberdeen from the 15th century. The
University of Edinburgh was established in
the 16th century. All the other universities
were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries.
In addition, there are 64 higher education
colleges which have different backgrounds and
missions. Some are very specialised, such as
art and design, teacher education and
agriculture colleges, while others are multi¬
disciplinary. Some award their own degrees
and qualifications, while in others these are
validated by a university or national body.
Applications for first degrees are usually
made through the Universities and Colleges
Admission Service (UCAS).
Students at university in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland usually spend three
years of study, leading to a Bachelor’s degree,
for example Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor
of Science (BSc). There are some four-year
courses and medical and veterinary courses
normally require five or six years. A full-time
140
10: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
first degree in Scotland generally takes four
years for Honours and three years for the
broad-based Ordinary degree.
In 2000, some 265,300 students gained a
first degree in the UK compared with 232,200
in 1995. Of these, 31,900 graduated with a
first degree in business and administration, by
far the highest category. From 2001 new
foundation degrees will be introduced
allowing students to combine work with study.
Some students go on to do postgraduate
studies. These usually lead to a Masters
degree, for example Master of Arts (MA) or
Master of Science (MSc) or a doctorate (PhD).
The Open University
The Open University (OU) is a non-
residential university offering 186 degree and
other courses for adult students who wish to
study in their own time. Teaching is through a
combination of printed texts, correspondence
tuition, television broadcasts, audio/video
cassettes and, for some courses, short
residential schools. Some 110,000 of its
students are online from home and many OU
learning resources are delivered on interactive
CD-ROM or computer software. There is a
network of local tutorial centres for contact
with part-time tutors and fellow students.
Students do not need formal academic
qualifications to register for most courses.
Its first degrees are the BA (Open) and the
BSc (Open) which are awarded on a system of
points for each course completed. Either
degree can be awarded with honours. The OU
offers honours degrees in named subject areas
and an MEng degree to enable students to
achieve the highest professional status of
Chartered Engineer. There are a number of
certificates and diplomas. Higher degrees are
also available.
Finance
Government finance is distributed to higher
education institutions by higher education
funding councils in England, Wales and
Scotland, and in Northern Ireland by the
Department for Employment and Learning.
The private University of Buckingham does
not receive public funds.
Institutions also charge tuition fees, which
are partly funded by students. In addition,
they provide paid training, research or
consultancy for commercial firms. Many
establishments have endowments or receive
grants from foundations and benefactors.
Student Support
Support for higher education students in
England and Wales includes:
> help to pay tuition fees—a maximum fee
contribution of £1,050 is charged per
student, but the amount paid depends on
student and family income; more than
half of students do not pay any fees;
> student loans—these are the main form
of help for students in meeting living
costs. The maximum loan in 2001-02
for full-time students is £4,590. Loans
are repaid on the basis of income after
the student has completed his/her
course;
> a number of additional grants, allowances
or bursaries—available to students from
disadvantaged backgrounds, disabled
students, young people leaving local
authority care and students with children
or other dependants; and
> hardship funds—made at the discretion
of the institution, the amount depending
on the student’s individual
circumstances.
The Department for Education and Skills
has announced a review of student support
arrangements.
The Scottish Executive has introduced a
new support scheme for full-time higher
education. The main feature is that tuition
fees are no longer payable by eligible full-time
Scottish-domiciled students or EU students
studying in Scotland. Student loan
entitlement may be reduced, however,
because any assessed parental or spouse
contribution is set against the means-tested
student loan entitlement rather than tuition
fees.
In Northern Ireland support for higher
education students generally operates on a
parity basis with England and Wales.
141
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Training
Several programmes are available to help
increase work-related skills. These are offered
as alternatives to academic education for 16 to
19 year olds or as part of an existing
employee’s training.
Modern Apprenticeships
Modern Apprenticeships (MAs) provide
structured learning programmes for young
people in which workplace training is
integrated with off-the-job learning. They are
available at Foundation and Advanced levels.
Foundation MAs (National Traineeships in
Wales) lead to NVQjtt level 2. Advanced MAs
lead primarily to NVQJevel 3 and above and
are designed to increase the number of young
people trained to technician, supervisory and
equivalent levels. Over 400,000 people have
started an MA at this level since 1995. The
quality of MAs is being improved through
technical certificates that develop knowledge
and understanding, and through an
Apprenticeship diploma. Every young person
with the necessary aptitude and ability will be
entitled to a Modern Apprenticeship and there
will be better access from an MA to higher
education.
Other Training Schemes
Other workplace training includes:
> The right for 16 and 17 year old
employees with few, if any, qualifications
to reasonable paid time off work to study
or train for an approved qualification at
NVQJevel 2 or equivalent.
> Career development loans to help people
pay for vocational education or training
in Great Britain. Loans of between £300
and £8,000 are provided through major
banks; interest payments on the loan
during training and one month after
training are funded by the Government.
They help to pay for courses lasting up to
two years. Since the scheme began in
1988, over 154,000 loans have been made
with an average value of £3,391.
> Small Firms Training Loans which help
firms with 50 or fewer employees to meet
a range of vocational training-related
expenses, including training consultancy.
Loans of between £500 and £125,000 are
available through major banks and
repayments can be deferred for between
six and 12 months. Since the scheme
began in 1994, nearly £3.8 million has
been lent to 574 small firms.
> Work-based learning for adults is open to
those aged 25 and over who have been
unemployed for six months or longer.
In Wales, Skill Build, targeted at those
young people who are most at risk in the
labour market, aims to develop social skills,
literacy, numeracy, ICT and other skills. A
new programme—the Modern Skills Diploma
for Adults—has been introduced to provide
skills training for people aged over 25 who are
in employment.
In Scotland all young people aged between
16 and 17 are entitled to training under the
government-funded Skillseekers scheme. Its
key elements are:
> training leading to a recognised
qualification, up to Scottish Vocational
Qualification (SVQ) level 3;
> an individual training plan; and
> employer involvement.
A network of Local Enterprise Companies
are responsible for the delivery of the Scottish
Executive’s national training programmes.
They run under contract to two non-
departmental public bodies: Scottish Enterprise
and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. This
system is currently under review.
In Northern Ireland the Jobskills
Programme is available to all 16—17 year olds.
It provides training to NVQJevel 2 with
progress routes to NVQJevel 3 through
Modern Apprenticeship arrangements.
National Training Organisations
National Training Organisations (N I Os) are
employer-led bodies responsible for the
development of skills to meet the business
needs of employers throughout the UK. In
142
10: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
particular, they encourage employer
involvement in the development and uptake of
competence-based standards, education,
training and qualifications in order to help
businesses improve their competitiveness in
UK and overseas markets. There are 72
NTOs covering 90% of the workforce.
New Technology Institutes
The Government is planning to develop New
Technology Institutes in each English region
to boost the supply of ICT and other high
technology skills and to help transfer this
know-how to small and medium-sized
businesses.
Information and Advice
There are 75 Information, Advice and
Guidance partnerships in England. Working
closely with the Learning and Skills Council,
their role is to coordinate information about
opportunities in learning or work and to
provide a free service to all members of the
community. Particular attention is given to the
needs of disadvantaged clients.
Learndirect
This is a new national online and distributed
network making learning available to people
at home, in the workplace and at over 1,200
centres throughout England, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Its primary objective is to
stimulate demand for lifelong learning among
adults and small and medium-sized
enterprises and to increase the availability of
high-quality learning through the use of ICT.
There is a learndirect telephone helpline and
a learndirect website {n>n>n>.learndirect.co.uk).
The Scottish University for Industry is
developing a similar network called
learndirect Scotland. Careers Wales provides
free information and advice on learning
options to all adults, plus more in-depth
guidance for some people not covered by the
New Deal (see chapter 11). These services are
delivered face to face or by the learndirect
freephone service.
UK Online Centres
A network of 6,000 UK online centres is being
established by the end of 2002 in order to
reduce the gap between those who have access
to ICT and those who do not. Internet and
e-mail access is provided and there is support
from staff, who help clients develop ICT skills
and explore opportunities for learning. The
network is underpinned by the learndirect
helpline and website.
Individual Learning Accounts
The Government helps people plan and pay
towards the cost of their learning through
Individual Learning Accounts.
This national network was launched in
September 2000. Some ^150 million is being
used to contribute £150 each to the first
million account holders to book eligible
learning, provided that the individual pays at
least £25. People also receive 20% and 80%
discounts on the costs of learning; the 20%
discount can be used on a wide range of
learning while the 80% discount is mainly
restricted to ICT, literacy, basic mathematics
and (in Wales) learning Welsh. By May 2001
over 1 million people in the UK had opened
an Individual Learning Account.
Union Learning Fund
In 1998 the Government introduced the
Union Learning Fund. This assists some
3,250 trade union learning representatives to
promote learning in the workplace, especially
among people with basic skills needs. The
Government is consulting on a proposal that
these representatives be given formal
recognition in the workplace.
The Wales Union Learning Fund,
launched in 1999, has funded over 40 projects.
Adult Education
Education for adults is provided by further
education colleges, adult education centres
and colleges run by LEAs, community
organisations and voluntary bodies such as the
Workers’ Educational Association. The duty
143
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
to secure such education rests with the
Learning and Skills Council in England and
the National Council for Education and
Training for Wales. Adult education in
Scotland is a statutory duty of education
authorities and is generally known as
community learning or community education.
In Northern Ireland it is provided by the
further education sector, supplemented by the
work of a range of non-statutory providers.
General adult education courses include
languages, physical education/sport/fitness
and practical craft skills such as embroidery or
woodwork.
The National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education (NIACE) and the Basic Skills
Agency (BSA) jointly manage the Adult and
Community Learning Fund on behalf of the
Department for Education and Skills; the
Fund supports innovative learning
opportunities and aims to encourage people
who have been reluctant to participate in
learning in the past and who may be
disadvantaged as a result.
Skills for Life
The Government has launched Skills for Life,
a programme designed to help the 7 million
adults who have problems with literacy or
numeracy. This funds community and
workplace provision, teacher training in
literacy and numeracy, and support for adults
with learning difficulties. A new curriculum
and standardised tests are being introduced in
nine pathfinder areas. A new university-based
national research centre will help develop best
practice in teaching methods. In addition, a
network of up to 2,000 fully equipped learning
centres will be established to provide courses
at colleges, workplaces and schools.
National Targets for Education and
Training in England
In 1998 the Government launched its
National Learning Targets for England for
the year 2002. They cover key stages of
people’s lives and progress is measured every
autumn. The targets state that 85% of 19 year
olds should be qualified to NVQlevel 2
(equivalent to five GCSEs at grades A* to C)
and 60% of 21 year olds to NVQJevel 3
(equivalent to 2 GCE A levels). Some 75% of
19 year olds and 54% of 21 year olds met
these standards in 2000.
A set of targets also exists for adults of
working age. The first states that by the year
2002, 50% of the workforce should be
qualified to NVQJevel 3. The second states
that 28% of the workforce should have a
professional, vocational, management or
academic qualification at NVQJevel 4 or
above (which is equivalent to a first degree).
By 2000, 47% and 26% of adults had achieved
levels 3 and 4 respectively.
LINKS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
Large numbers of people from other countries
come to the UK to study, and many British
people work and train overseas. The British
aid programme (see chapter 7) encourages
links between educational institutions in the
UK and developing countries.
European Union Schemes
Exchange of students is promoted by the EU’s
SOCRATES-ERASMUS programme which
provides grants enabling university students
from the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein,
Central and Eastern European and EU pre¬
accession countries (see pp. 82-3) to study in
other states. All academic subjects are
covered, the study period normally lasting
between three and 12 months. Between 1995
and 2000, some 512,000 students participated,
of whom 65,000 were from the UK.
The SOCRATES programme also
supports partnerships between schools,
language learning, mobility opportunities for
educational staff and a range of multinational
projects, including open and distance learning
and adult education. Competence in another
European language is supported in all
activities.
The LEONARDO D A VINCI programme
supports vocational training policies and
practices through multinational pilot projects,
placements and exchanges and research
projects. Between 1995 and 2000, 1,188 projects
144
10: EDUCATION AND TRAINING
were supported in the UK. Of these, 578 were
placement-type projects through which 12,212
young people undertook part of their vocational
training in another Member State.
The YOUTH Programme supports youth
exchanges and volunteering activities
throughout the EU, the European Economic
Area and pre-EU accession countries.
Between 1995 and 2000 some 513,000 young
people took part, including 56,000 from
the UK.
EU member states have created ten
European schools, including one at Culham,
Oxfordshire, for pupils aged between 4 and 19
in order to provide a multilingual education
for the children of staff employed in EU
institutions. Around 16,000 pupils attend
these schools.
Overseas Students in the UK
About 341,900 overseas students follow
courses in the UK at higher and further
education institutions. Most of them pay fees
covering the full costs of their courses.
Nationals of other EU states generally pay the
lower level of fees applicable to British home
students.
Government Scholarship Schemes
The Government makes provision for foreign
students and trainees through its overseas aid
programme and other award and scholarship
schemes. Around 2,450 receive awards from
schemes, funded in part by the Foreign &
Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the
Department for International Development
(DFID). These are:
> British Chevening Awards, a worldwide
programme offering outstanding
graduate students and young
professionals the opportunity to spend
time studying at British universities and
other academic institutions; and
> the Commonwealth Scholarship and
Fellowship Plan, offering scholarships for
study in other Commonwealth countries.
In the UK these scholarships are for
postgraduate study or research for one to
three years at a higher education
institution.
The FCO is also increasing the number of
scholarships jointly funded with British or
foreign commercial firms, and with academic
and other institutions.
Other Schemes
The Overseas Research Students Award
Scheme, funded by the higher education
funding councils, provides help for overseas
full-time postgraduate students with
outstanding research potential. In addition,
most British universities and colleges offer
bursaries and scholarships for which graduates
of any nationality are eligible. Other public
and private scholarships are available to
students from overseas and to British students
who want to study in other countries.
THE YOUTH SERVICE
The youth service is a partnership between
local government and voluntary organisations
concerned with the informal personal and
social education of young people aged 11 to 25
(5 to 25 in Northern Ireland).
Local authorities manage their own youth
centres and clubs and provide most of the
public support for local and regional
organisations. In England, the service is
estimated to reach around 3 million young
people, with the voluntary organisations
contributing a significant proportion of overall
provision.
The DfES in England gives grants to the
National Youth Agency, the National Council
for \ oluntary Youth Services and to the
headquarters of some 80 national voluntary
youth organisations. Funded primarily by
local government, the National Youth Agency
supports those working with young people
and provides information and publishing
services. In 2001 the DfES published a
consultation document about the future of the
Youth Service {Transforming Youth Work).
The National Assembly for Wales sponsors
the Welsh Youth Agency which pays grant aid
to national youth service bodies with
headquarters in Wales, and accredits training
145
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
and staff development for youth workers. The
Assembly also supports the work of CWVYS
(the Council for Wales of Voluntary Youth
Services). In autumn 2000 the Assembly
launched a consultation document Extending
Entitlement: supporting young people in Wales,
which proposed a new framework for young
people aged 11-25. These proposals are now
being taken forward.
In Scotland the youth service is part of
community education provision made by local
authorities. It is also promoted by Community
Learning Scotland.
In Northern Ireland the education and
library boards provide and fund youth clubs
and outdoor activity centres. They assist with
the running costs of registered voluntary
youth organisations and provide advice and
support for youth groups. In addition, they
help young people visit the rest of the UK,
the Irish Republic and overseas. The Youth
Council for Northern Ireland advises the
education system and other bodies on the
development of the youth service. It
encourages cross-community activity and
pays grants to the headquarters of voluntary
bodies.
Voluntary Youth Organisations
National voluntary organisations work mainly
through local groups which raise most of their
day-to-day expenses by their own efforts.
Many receive financial and other help from
local authorities. They vary greatly in character
and include uniformed organisations such as
the Scouts and Girl Guides, church-based and
other religious organisations and particular
interest groups. In Wales, Urdd Gobaith
Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth) provides
cultural, sporting and language-based activities
for young Welsh speakers and learners.
Many voluntary organisations and local
authorities provide services for young
unemployed people, young people from ethnic
minorities, young people in inner city or rural
areas and those in trouble or especially
vulnerable. Many authorities have youth
committees on which official and voluntary
bodies are represented. They employ youth
officers to coordinate youth work and to
arrange in-service training.
Youth Workers
In England and Wales a two-year training
course at certain universities and higher
education colleges produces qualified youth
and community workers; several
undergraduate part-time and postgraduate
courses are also available. In Scotland courses
lasting between one and three years are
provided at teacher education institutions.
Students from Northern Ireland attend
courses at universities and colleges in the UK
and the Irish Republic.
Other Organisations
Many grant-giving foundations and trusts
provide finance for activities involving young
people. The Prince’s Trust and the Royal
Jubilee Trust provide grants and practical
help to individuals and organisations; areas of
concern include urban deprivation,
unemployment, homelessness and young
offenders. Efforts are also made to assist
ethnic minorities.
The Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme
challenges young people from the UK and
other Commonwealth countries to meet
certain standards in activities such as
community service, expeditions, social and
practical skills and physical recreation.

In recent years the United Kingdom labour market has seen a growth in
employment, which now exceeds 28 million. Both full-time and part-time
employment have risen. The increase in employment has been predominantly
in the service sector, in which over three-quarters of employees now work.
Unemployment, on the other hand, has fallen considerably since the last peak
at the end of 1992 and is at its lowest level since the introduction of the
International Labour Organisation measure of unemployment in 1984.
PATTERNS OF EMPLOYMENT
The Office for National Statistics (ONS)
carries out the Labour Force Survey (LFS) on
a continuous basis. The LFS shows that, on a
seasonally adjusted basis, 29.6 million people
aged 16 and over were economically active1 in
the UK in spring (March to May) 2001. The
economic activity rate was 63.3% for all
persons aged 16 and over and 78.8% for those
of working age (men aged 16 to 64 and women
aged 16 to 59). Among the working-age group,
some 7.7 million people were economically
inactive, of whom 5.5 million people did not
want a job and 2.2 million people wanted a job
but were either not seeking work or not
available to start work.
The number of people aged 16 and over in
employment2 rose by 267,000 in the year to
1 Defined as those who are either in employment (employee,
self-employed, unpaid family worker or on a government-
supported training programme) or unemployed and actively
seeking work.
2 There are two main measures of employment: the number of
people in employment and the number of jobs; they represent
different concepts, as one person can have more than one job.
spring 2001 to 28.2 million (see Table 11.1):
some 15.5 million men and 12.7 million
women. Employment was up by 1% during
the year: 1.2% for women and 0.8% for men.
The employment rate (among those of
working age) was 74.9%, close to the high
achieved in 1990.
Unemployment
The UK unemployment rate is similar to that
for the major G7 group of nations and
substantially below the EU average. In spring
2001, 1.5 million people were unemployed, a
fall of 12.5% since spring 2000. This represents
4.9% of the labour force, compared with 5.6%
in the same period of 2000, according to the
International Labour Organisation (ILO)
definition of unemployment. The rate in spring
2001 is the lowest since the adoption of the
ILO definition of unemployment in 1984.
Unemployment has been falling in all regions—
areas with the lowest levels of unemployment
include the South East and East of England.

There have been substantial falls in long-term
unemployment. In spring 2001 some 379,000
people had been unemployed for a year or
more, of whom 218,000 had been out of work
for two years or more. These figures represent
falls of 15.6% and 13.5% respectively since
spring 2000.
The picture for youth unemployment is
similar, with some 380,000 people aged 18 to
24 unemployed in spring 2001, 7.3% lower
than in spring 2000. Much larger percentage
falls were recorded for those who had been out
of work for one year or more (17.9%) and two
years or more (35.7%).
In June 2001 the claimant count (the count
of claimants of unemployment-related benefit,
such as Jobseeker’s Allowance—see chapter
12) was 963,100, a rate of 3.2% of the total of
workforce jobs and the number of claimants.
It is below 1 million for the first time since
1975.
The number of workless households
(among working-age households) was 3.1
million in spring 2001, 6,000 fewer than in
spring 2000 and 384,000 fewer than five years
earlier. This represented a rate of worklessness
of 16.3% in spring 2001, compared with
18.9% in spring 1996.
Women in Employment
One of the main long-term trends in the
labour market has been the growth in the
number of women in employment. Among the
key figures illustrating this trend are:
> the number of women in work in spring
2001 was 12.6 million—an increase of
nearly 1.1 million, or 9.5%, over ten
years;
> nearly 70% of women of working age are
working;
> 65% of women with dependent children
are in work; and
> the number of women in permanent jobs
has risen by around 347,000 (6.0%) in
the three years to spring 2001.
Among several reasons for the greater
involvement of women in the workplace is that
more women are putting off having children
until their thirties. When they do have
children, they are far more likely to return to
work, making use of a range of childcare
options (see chapter 12).
Part-time Working
Another major long-term trend in
employment has been a move towards people
working part time, and women are more likely
to do so than men. In spring 2001, 7.0 million
people aged 16 and over, 25% of those in
employment, worked part time. About 44% of
women in employment work part time,
compared with 9% of men.

professional occupations, whereas skilled
trades occupations, elementary occupations
and process, plant and machine operatives
have generally experienced declines. Two
sectors experiencing change include
occupations related to information and
communications technology (ICT) and
customer service occupations. Between winter
1996-97 and summer 2000 in England and
Wales employment in ICT-related
occupations grew substantially. In particular,
employment of IT operations technicians
increased by 138%, and IT user support
technicians by 70% in this period. The
number of people working in ‘traditional’
customer service occupations, such as counter
clerks and telephonists, has been declining,
but ‘newer’ customer service occupations have
been rising: between winter 1996-97 and
summer 2000 employment of call centre
operatives in England and Wales rose by
220%, customer care occupations by 60% and
telephone sales persons by 50%.
Second Jobs and Temporary
Employment
Around 1.2 million people had a second job in
spring 2001. The most common industries in
which people have second jobs are education,
health and social work, and hotels and
restaurants.
About 1.7 million (7% of employees) were
engaged in temporary jobs (see Table 11.2).
Temporary employment is lower in the UK
than in most other EU countries. The recent
rise in employment as a whole has been
concentrated in permanent jobs, and the
number of temporary employees was virtually
the same in spring 2001 as a year earlier. Of
temporary employees in spring 2001, 480,000
(28%) worked in temporary jobs because they
could not find a permanent one, and 522,000
(30%) worked in temporary jobs because they
preferred to do so.
Teleworking
Teleworking’—people w orking from home
using ICT—is continuing to grow, although
from a relatively low level. In spring 2001
some 347,000 people were classed as
teleworkers whose main job was primarily in
their own home; extending the definition to
cover those working in different places using
home as a base and those who spent at least
one day a week working from home raised the
number to 1.8 million. In a survey in Great
Britain in 2000 around 22% of workplaces
reported that they had staff who worked from
home, usually professional and managerial
staff and mostly on an occasional basis.
Self-employment
In spring 2001 nearly 3.2 million people were
self-employed in the UK: 15% of men and
7% of women in employment were self-
employed. Agriculture and fishing, and
construction had the highest proportions of
self-employed people, while relatively few' of
those engaged in manufacturing and public
administration were self-employed.
The private sector share of employment
rose from 71% in 1981 to 76% (21.5
million) in spring 2001. A separate analysis
by ONS of public and private sector jobs
showed that in June 2000, 82% of the 29
million jobs in the UK were in the private
sector. Jobs in the private sector rose by 5%
to 23.9 million in the ten years to June
2000. In the same period jobs in the public
sector fell by 16% (959,000) to 5.1 million,
of which 873,000 were in central
government and 2.7 million in local
government (including education and the
police). The main falls occurred in public
corporations, excluding National Health
Service (NHS) Trusts, mainly as a result of
the privatisation of former nationalised
industries, and in education. Employment
in public corporations (excluding NHS
Trusts) fell by 400,000 to 385,000 and in
education by 131,000 to 1.3 million.
However, in the 12 months to June 2000
jobs in education rose by about 60,000 and
there was also a rise in employment in
NHS Trusts in this period, of 14,000 to
1.145 million.

Employment by Sector
The major long-term trend in employment by
sector in the UK has been a big increase in
employment in service industries (see Table
11.4). Between March 1981 and March 2001
the number of workforce jobs in service
industries increased from 16.8 million to 22.5
million, a rise of 34%, compared with a rise in
the total number of jobs of 11%. Growth in
finance and business services was particularly
strong, up by 86% in this period, although
recently growth has been slower.
Transport and communications is one
service sector where growth in the number of
jobs has been below the average for the
economy as a whole. However, in the year to
March 2001 jobs in this sector grew by 4.1%,
compared with a rise of 1.5% in finance and
business services and of 1.1% in services as
a whole.
In recent years most other sectors have
experienced falling levels of employment.
Traditional manufacturing industries, such as
steel, shipbuilding and textiles, have recorded
particularly large falls in employment. By
March 2001 manufacturing accounted for 14%
of workforce jobs, compared with 24% in 1981.
Agriculture and fishing has also seen a fall in the
number of jobs, and in the year to March 2001
jobs in the sector fell by 5%. The biggest long¬
term decline though has been in energy and
water (see Table 11.4), reflecting, among other
things, a big fall in jobs in the coal industry.
LABOUR MARKET POLICY
In March 2001 the Government published a
Green Paper, Towards Full Employment in a
Modern Society, setting out its strategy on
labour market policy. This aims to ensure
employment opportunity for all who can work,
encourage flexible labour markets and raise
skills. The Government’s strategy for ensuring
employment opportunity for all is based on:
> helping people to move from welfare to
work, through extending the series of
‘New Deals’ (see pp. 154-5);
> easing the transition into work by
removing barriers to working and
ensuring that people are financially
secure when moving from welfare to
work;
> making paid work more attractive,
through promoting incentives to work
and reforming the tax and benefit system
(see chapters 23 and 12); and
> securing progression in work, through
lifelong learning (see chapter 10), to
ensure that people are well trained and
able to adapt to changing economic
circumstances.
In June 2001 the Government established a
new Department for Work and Pensions (see
also chapter 12). The Department combines
the employment and disability responsibilities
of the former Department for Education and
152
11: THE LABOUR .MARKET
Employment (now the Department for
Education and Skills) with the welfare and
pensions responsibilities of the former
Department of Social Security. It will be
responsible for Jobcentre Plus (see box).
Jobcentre Plus
From October 2001, the Government plans
to launch a new Agency, Jobcentre Plus.
This will bring together the Employment
Service, which runs Jobcentres, and those
parts of the Benefits Agency providing
services to people of working age. It will
start with around 50 ‘pathfinder’ offices
across England, Scotland and Wales. It will
deal with all people’s work and benefits
needs, providing a single point of contact
for all working-age people to access
Jobseeker’s Allowance and other social
security benefits (see chapter 12) and will:
> offer practical job-finding assistance
through a personal adviser service;
> ensure those people unable to work
receive the correct benefits on time;
and
> help employers to fill their vacancies,
including assistance in recruiting new
groups of potential employees.
RECRUITMENT AND JOB-FINDING
Government Employment Services
The Employment Service (wipw.
employmentservice.gov.uk) provides a range of
services to jobseekers including:
^ a network of over 1,000 local offices, at
which people can find details of job
vacancies;
> advice and guidance so that people can
find the best route back into
employment, for example, by training;
and
> a range of special programmes, including
those for people with disabilities.
^ The Employment Service has a budget in
Great Britain of over £1 billion for 2001-02.
In 2000—01 it placed 1.23 million unemployed
people into jobs. It has a key role in the
delivery of the Government’s Welfare-to-
Work measures (see p. 154).
Advisory Services
Through the main Jobcentre services,
unemployed people have access to vacancies,
employment advice and training
opportunities. Employment Service advisers
see all jobseekers when a claim is made for
Jobseeker’s Allowance (see p. 176) to assess
their eligibility and to provide advice about
jobs, training and self-employment
opportunities. To receive the allowance, each
unemployed person has to complete a
Jobseeker’s Agreement, which sets out his or
her availability for work, the types of job for
which he or she is looking, and the steps
which, if taken, offer the best chance of
securing work. Jobseekers are required to
attend a job search review each fortnight and
periodic intensive advisory interviews to assess
their situation and see what additional help, if
any, is needed and, if appropriate, to revise the
Jobseeker’s Agreement.
Programme Centres have been introduced
nationally and are gradually replacing
traditional fixed-length job search courses
with a modular approach that addresses the
needs of individual jobseekers, and allows
providers to take a flexible approach so that
job search help can be adapted for local
delivery. Other programmes include Jobclubs
(offering guidance on jobseeking, interview
skills and other practical assistance), Jobplan
workshops (a mandatory five-day programme
of individual assessment) and work trial,
where jobseekers spend up to a maximum of
15 days in an actual vacancy.
The Employment Service is implementing
a modernisation programme using information
and communications technology with the
intention of improving its services to
jobseekers and employers. All of the Service’s
vacancies are now available over the Internet,
on one of the largest job banks in the world.
\ acancies are also available through electronic
touch-screen kiosks, known as ‘Jobpoints’,
which are replacing traditional vacancy display
boards in Jobcentres. In March 2001 the
Employment Service began the phased
153
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
introduction, which is expected to be
completed by early 2002, of a new service,
Employer Direct, to provide a single national
telephone number for employers to have their
vacancies advertised on the Internet and on all
Jobpoint terminals.
In Northern Ireland arrangements for the
joint delivery of services between the
Department for Employment and Learning
and the Social Security Agency are under
consideration.
Welfare-to-Work
The Government’s Welfare-to-Work
programme is a series of measures, including a
number of New Deals, designed with the aim
of promoting an efficient labour market and
tackling structural unemployment, economic
inactivity and social exclusion. Common
features of the measures for those seeking
employment include the assistance of personal
advisers, providing a single point of contact
and help; and an emphasis on trying to obtain
sustainable employment.
The Welfare-to-Work programme was
originally funded by a windfall tax on the
excess profits of the privatised utilities. Since
April 2001 it has been funded from the new
Employment Opportunities Fund, bringing
together the remaining windfall tax receipts
and additional resources allocated in the
Spending Review 2000. Planned expenditure
on Welfare-to-Work from the Fund is £1.05
billion in 2001-02, rising to £1.4 billion in
2002-03. In 2001-02 the provision for
expenditure on New Deals includes £350
million on the New Deal for Young People,
£190 million for the 25 plus programme,
£100 million for lone parents and £50 million
for disabled people.
Young People
The New Deal for Young People is available
to those aged 18 to 24 who have been
unemployed for more than six months. It
begins with an intensive period of up to four
months, of counselling, advice and guidance—
the ‘gateway’. If a young person has not left
the gateway after that time, he or she must
choose one of five options:
> a job attracting a wage subsidy of £60 a
week, payable to employers for up to six
months;
> self-employment;
> a work placement with a voluntary
organisation;
> a six-month work placement with an
Environment Task Force; and
> for those without basic qualifications,
a place on a full-time education and
training course, which might last for up
to one year.
All these options include an element of
education and training. By the end of June
2001 there had been 669,300 starts on this
New Deal since its launch in April 1998:
577,700 people had left, of whom 39% had
entered sustained unsubsidised jobs.
Long-term Unemployed
Under the New Deal for the long-term
unemployed, which started in 1998, employers
receive a subsidy of up to £75 a week for 26
weeks if they employ anyone who has been
unemployed for two years or longer. From
April 2001 the programme was extended
and renamed the New Deal 25 plus
programme, with eligibility reduced to 18
months for those aged 25 and over. The
programme includes:
> a gateway period, lasting up to four
months, aimed at getting people into
work through an intensive period of
weekly interviews and job search support
from a personal adviser;
> a period of full-time activity where
individuals are able to choose a mix,
based on their needs, of subsidised
employment, work-focused training,
work experience, help with job search or
help with moving into self-employment;
> a period for those who do not find work
through the full-time activity period
involving intensive help to take
advantage of their experience and move
into work; and
> benefit penalties, if individuals do not
take advantage of this assistance.
154
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
By the end of June 2001 there had been
358,600 starts on this New Deal since its
launch in April 1998: 322,800 people had left,
with 73,600 people in jobs, of which 60,800
were sustained jobs.3
Lone Parents
The New Deal for Lone Parents provides for
all lone parents on Income Support to meet a
personal adviser and receive guidance to help
improve their employment prospects.
From autumn 2001 eligibility will gradually
be extended to all lone parents who are not in
work, or work l@ss than 16 hours a week but
are not on Income Support. The Government
is also phasing in, from 2001—02, compulsory
meetings with a personal adviser for lone
parents claiming Income Support who have a
youngest child of five or over. This was
piloted in three areas (Shropshire, South
Tyneside and Fife) from October 2000. The
2001 Budget announced that the meetings
would be extended to all lone parents on
Income Support from April 2002, with an
additional interview at the six-month stage of
the claim. Intended further enhancements to
this provision will include a new outreach
service to attract more lone parents to the New
Deal, help with starting up in self-
employment, and extra childcare support.
Disabled People
Under the New Deal for Disabled People
(NDDP), a wide range of innovative
approaches in helping people on incapacity
benefits were tested. From September 1998 to
June 2001, 24 innovative schemes and 12
Personal Adviser Pilots, covering a range of
disabilities and areas of the country, tested
ways of helping disabled people and carers
who want to work. In July 2001 the NDDP
was extended throughout Great Britain, and a
new network of job brokers is providing
services and support to sick and disabled
people who want to work, so as to help them
find and keep paid work. The extended
service will continue to be tested and
evaluated.
3 Figures relate to pre-April 2001 entrants to the New Deal.
Partners
The New Deal for Partners is a voluntary
programme available to partners of those
claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance. Since
23 April 2001 it has also been available to
partners of those receiving Income Support,
Invalid Care Allowance, Severe Disablement
Allowance and Incapacity Benefit. The New
Deal aims to ensure that they have the
opportunity to receive help to return to work;
those involved are able to improve their skills
and employability through employment
programmes and training.
SO Plus
New Deal 50 plus was introduced nationally
from April 2000. This programme helps
people of 50 or over after they or their
partners have been on benefits for six months
or more and provides an Employment Credit
payment of £60 a week for full-time work (30
hours or more a week) or £40 a week for part-
time work (29 hours or less a week). This is
paid for up to 52 weeks.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland there is a broadly similar
system to Welfare-to-Work, although
programmes such as ONE (see p. 156) may
be at a different stage of development.
Responsibility for administration of
programmes and services rests with the
Northern Ireland Department for
Employment and Learning and the
Department for Social Development and their
executive agencies.
Employment Zones
Pilot Employment Zones began running in
April 2000 in 15 areas of Great Britain with
unemployment rates above the national
average. New approaches to tackle
unemployment—including financial help for
individual jobseekers through personal job
accounts and the use of personal advisers—are
being adopted and are being provided by
public, private and voluntary sector
organisations selected to run the zones by
155
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
open competition. Originally £112 million was
made available to support this initiative,
providing help to around 48,000 long-term
unemployed jobseekers aged 25 and over,
between April 2000 and March 2002. In
February 2001 the Government announced a
one-year extension to the Employment Zones
until March 2003; this is expected to benefit
up to an additional 29,000 jobseekers at a cost
of £81 million.
ONE
ONE is a pilot initiative for people of working
age who work for less than 16 hours each week
on average, to help them find jobs, training,
benefits and a range of other advice and
support to become independent. It is managed
in partnership by the Benefits Agency (BA),
Employment Service and local authorities in
the 12 pilot areas.
Four of these pilots started in June 1999,
testing delivery through existing Employment
Service and BA outlets and local authority
premises, and eight other pilots began in
November 1999, with four testing the use of
call centre technology and four innovative
private/voluntary sector methods of delivery.
The pilots, which are being evaluated, are
expected to run until March 2002.
Individuals who wish to claim one or more
of the ONE benefits must attend a work-
focused meeting with a personal adviser at the
outset of the claim, and thereafter at intervals
as long as they remain on benefits. The
purpose of the meeting is to identify the state
of readiness for work, and any help or support
the individual might need to help him or her
move towards independence. Apart from those
who claim Jobseeker’s Allowance, there is no
obligation on individuals to actively seek work,
although they are encouraged to draw up an
action plan and follow up their commitments.
However, failure to attend, and participate in,
the work-focused meeting without good cause
can result in reduction or withdrawal of benefit
until the condition is met.
Action Teams
In October 2000 Action Teams were set up,
initially for one year, in 40 communities in the
UK with the lowest employment and highest
unemployment, including the 15 Employment
Zones. From October 2001 there will be 38
Teams led by the Employment Service and
from January 2002, 25 Teams led by private
sector contractors. Funding of £135 million
from October 2001 to March 2004 will enable
the Teams to work with jobless people in the
most deprived wards in the most deprived
local authority areas of England, Wales and
Scotland. The aim of the Teams is to remove
the barriers to employment faced by jobless
people and, by working with employers, to
move them into suitable vacancies. The
Teams will look at innovative ^ays of
achieving their aim.
Job Transition Service
The Job Transition Service became
operational from April 2001 and a number of
initiatives are being piloted. It is led by the
Employment Service working with local
partners. The Service aims to provide
additional help and support to those being
made redundant, particularly where a
significant redundancy has been recognised.
This is done by working with employers in the
local and national labour markets to identify
skill shortages and to put in place
arrangements to equip the redundant
workforce for these opportunities. Where
appropriate, the Service can also provide
support to families and the wider community,
to cope with the impact.
Employment Agencies
There are many private employment agencies,
including several large firms with significant
branch networks. The law governing the
conduct of employment agencies is less
restrictive than in many other EU countries,
but agencies must comply with legislation
which establishes a framework of minimum
standards designed to protect agency users,
both workers and hirers. Following a review of
the regulatory framework by the Department
of Trade and Industry (DTI) in 1999, a
revised series of regulations should be in force
by the end of 2001, providing, among other
things, greater protection for temporary
156
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
workers from exploitation. Another objective
is to make it easier for temporary workers to
move to permanent work status by removing
current barriers within the market.
PAY AND CONDITIONS
Earnings
Average gross weekly earnings of full-time
employees on adult rates in Great Britain
whose pay was unaffected by absence were
£411 in April 2001, according to the ONS
New Earnings Survey. Average earnings for
men were £453 and for women £338.
Earnings were higher for non-manual
employees (£452) than for manual employees
(£324), with managerial and professional
groups the highest paid.
Minimum Wage
The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 set
out the regulatory framework for the national
minimum wage which was introduced on
1 April 1999. Minimum wage rates, from
1 October 2001, are:
^ £‘310 an hour for those aged 22 or above;
and
> £3.50 an hour for workers aged 18 to 21,
and for those aged 22 or over in the first
six months of a new job with a new
employer, and receiving accredited
training.
The Government has agreed in principle
that the rates will increase to £4.20 and £3.60
respectively on 1 October 2002, subject to
favourable economic conditions.
Almost all workers who are 18 or over are
covered by the minimum wage—there are no
exemptions for casual workers, agency
workers, part-time workers, overseas workers
or workers in small businesses. The only
workers to whom the national minimum wage
does not apply are the self-employed, people
under 18 years of age, prisoners, voluntary
workers, members of the armed forces, family
members of the employer living in the
employer’s home, and unrelated people living
in their employer’s home w'ho are treated as
part of the family (for example, au pairs).
Apprentices and trainees are exempted for the
first year of their training.
Around 1.5 million low-paid workers are
estimated to have become entitled to higher
pay following the introduction of the national
minimum w age, some two-thirds of w hom are
women. This includes around 140,000 young
people. Sectors most affected have been
hospitality (hotels and catering), retailing,
cleaning, hairdressing, social care, footwear
and clothing manufacture, and private
security.
Fringe Benefits
Fringe benefits are used by many employers to
provide additional rewards to their employees.
They include schemes to encourage financial
participation by employees in their companies,
pension schemes, medical insurance,
subsidised meals, company cars and childcare
schemes.
By the end of March 2000, 3,790 profit-
related pay schemes, w hich link part of pay to
changes in a business’s profits, were registered
with the Inland Revenue, covering around
1.6 million people. Many companies have
adopted employee share schemes, where
employees receive free shares or options to
buy shares at a discount from their employer
without paying income tax. A new all¬
employee share ownership plan was
introduced in 2000, allowing employees to buy
shares from their pre-tax salary and to receive
free shares, wdth tax incentives for longer-term
shareholding.
Hours of Work
Most full-time employees have a basic
working week of between 34 and 40 hours, and
work a five-day week. When overtime is taken
into account, average weekly hours worked by
full-time workers in their main job in the UK
in spring 2001 were 38 hours: 40 hours for
men and 34 hours for women. For part-time
workers the average was 16 hours.
Both male and female full-time employees
tend to work more hours than people in other
EU countries. Hours worked tend to be
longest in agriculture, construction, and
157
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
transport and communications, and shortest in
public administration, education and health.
Self-employed people work, on average,
longer hours than full-time employees.
Holiday entitlements have generally been
determined by negotiation. In spring 2001 the
average paid holiday entitlement for full-time
workers was just under five weeks. However,
some employees, such as part-time and
temporary employees, may have much less
holiday entitlement.
Regulations implementing two EC
Directives, on working time and on young
workers (in relation to hours of work of
adolescents), came into force in the UK in
1998. They apply to full-time, part-time and
temporary workers, although workers in certain
sectors—including transport, sea fishing, other
work at sea, and doctors in training—are
currently exempt. They provide for:
> a maximum working week of 48 hours
(on average), although individual workers
can choose to work longer;
> a minimum of four weeks’ annual paid
leave;
> minimum daily and weekly rest periods;
> a limit for night workers of an average
eight hours’ work in a 24-hour period;
and
> a right for night workers to receive free
health assessments.
There are specific provisions for adolescent
workers in respect of these rights and
entitlements.
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS
Around 36% of employees in Great Britain in
2000 were in workplaces covered by collective
bargaining, which is generally more prevalent
in large establishments and in the public
sector. Collective bargaining mainly concerns
pay and working conditions. In general,
negotiations are now conducted more at a local
level, although many large firms retain a
degree of central control over the bargaining
process. There are relatively few industry¬
wide agreements; where they do exist, they are
often supplemented by local agreements in
companies or factories (plant bargaining). The
EC’s European Works Councils Directive
requires firms with 1,000 or more employees
and which operate in two or more member
states to establish European-level information
and consultation procedures. Regulations
implementing the Directive in the UK took
effect in January 2000. About 100 UK-based
companies have a European Works Council.
The Government is encouraging
partnership at work by supporting the spread
of best practice and promoting changes to
workplace relations designed to benefit
employees, business and the competitiveness
of the UK economy. The Partnership Fund
was launched in 1999 and is providing £5
million over four years to support partnership
at work projects. Among 76 projects approved
by July 2001 are schemes designed to reduce
harassment and bullying at work, improve
work-life balance, and implement modern
manufacturing techniques through
partnership.
Investors in People
Investors in People is the National Standard
which sets a level of good practice for
improving an organisation’s performance
through its people. It is designed to improve
business performance by linking the training
and development of employees to an
organisation’s business objectives. Reported
benefits include increased productivity, higher
profits, lower rates of absenteeism, and
improved morale. Investors in People UK,
which is responsible for the promotion,
quality assurance and development of the
Standard, has carried out an extensive review
to simplify the Standard and make it more
accessible, especially for small firms. At the
end of March 2001, 24,259 organisations in
the UK had been recognised as Investors in
People. Over 5 million employees work in
recognised organisations, covering around
24% of the UK workforce.
Individual Employment Rights
Employment protection legislation provides a
number of safeguards for employees. For
example, most employees have a right to a
written statement setting out details of the
158
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
main conditions, including pay, hours of work
and holidays. Employees with at least two
years of continuous employment with their
employer are entitled to lump-sum
redundancy payments if their jobs cease to
exist and their employers cannot offer suitable
alternative work.4
Minimum periods of notice are laid down
for both employers and employees. Most
employees who believe they have been
unfairly dismissed have the right to complain
to an employment tribunal (see p. 160),
subject to the general qualifying period of one
year’s continuous service. If the complaint is
upheld, the tribunal may make an order for re¬
employment or award compensation.
Legislation prohibits discrimination on
grounds of sex or marital status (see p. 121) or
disability or on grounds of race, nationality
(including citizenship) or ethnic or national
origin (see p. 116), in employment, training
and related matters. In Northern Ireland
discrimination in employment on grounds of
religious belief or political opinion is unlawful.
Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, women in
Great Britain are entitled to equal pay with
men when doing work that is the same or
broadly similar, work which is rated as
equivalent, or work which is of equal value.
Despite this, there is a continuing pay gender
gap. Among men and women working full¬
time the gap between their hourly earnings has
narrowed since the mid-1970s. In March 2001
the Government announced a review of
women’s employment and pay.
Under the Disability Discrimination Act
1995, disabled people have the right not to be
discriminated against in employment.
Employers with 15 or more employees have a
duty not to discriminate against disabled
employees or applicants. The Disability-
Rights Commission (see p. 167) has pow ers to
investigate cases of discrimination at w ork
against people w ith disabilities, and to ensure
employers comply with the appropriate legal
regulations.
All pregnant employees have the right to
statutory maternity leave with their non-wage
4 The statutory redundancy payment is calculated according to a
formula based on a person’s age, the number of years of
continuous service and his or her weekly pay. However, many
employers pay more than the statutory amount.
contractual benefits maintained, and
protection against detriment and dismissal
because of pregnancy. Statutory maternity pay
is payable by an employer for up to 18 w eeks
to women with at least six months’ service
with that employer.
New Rights
The Employment Relations Act 1999, and in
Northern Ireland the Employment Relations
(NI) Order 1999, introduced a package of
family-oriented employment rights. With later
modifications, the key elements are:
> a minimum of 18 weeks’ maternity leave
for all pregnant employees (in line w ith
statutory maternity pay), with additional
maternity leave for women after one
year’s service (reduced from the previous
two years);
> 13 weeks’ unpaid parental leave after one
year’s service for mothers and fathers—
Follow ing a government review of the
issues surrounding maternity rights and
paternity leave, several new measures have
been announced, including:
> an increase in the flat rate of Statutory
Maternity Pay (SMP) and Maternity
Allow ance (see chapter 12)—from
2003 women w ill receive 90% of their
previous earnings if that is less than
the flat rate;
^ an extension of the period of maternitv
pay from 18 weeks to 26 w'eeks from
2003;
^ an extension of additional maternity
leave to 26 w eeks, enabling mothers to
take up to a year’s maternity leave;
> the right to tw o weeks of paid
paternity leave for working fathers
from 2003;
> an increase in the Sure Start Maternity
Grant in April 2002, for 215,000 low-
income families a year; and
> an increase in the amount of parental
leave for parents of disabled children
from 13 weeks to 18 weeks.
159
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the leave can be taken in the first five
years following the child’s birth or
adoption;
> being able to return to the same job, or
its equivalent, at the end of maternity
and parental leave;
> clarification of the status of an
employee’s employment contract during
periods of paternal or maternity leave;
> a reasonable amount of unpaid time off
to deal with an emergency or unexpected
problem involving a dependant; and
> protection against dismissal or detriment
for exercising any of these rights.
Trade Union and Industrial Relations
Law
Among the legal requirements governing
industrial relations are:
> All individuals have the right not to be
dismissed or refused employment (or the
services of an employment agency)
because of membership or non¬
membership of a trade union.
> Where a union is recognised by an
employer for collective bargaining
purposes, union officials are entitled to
paid time off for undertaking certain
trade union duties and training. The
employer is also obliged to disclose
information to the union for collective
bargaining purposes.
> A trade union must elect every member
of its governing body, its general
secretary and its president. Elections
must be held at least every five years and
be carried out by a secret postal ballot
under independent scrutiny.
> If a trade union wishes to set up a political
fund, its members must first agree in a
secret ballot a resolution adopting those
political objectives as an aim of the union.
The union must also ballot its members
every ten years to maintain the fund.
Union members have a statutory right to
opt out of contributing to the fund.
> For a union to have the benefit of statutory
immunity when organising industrial
action, the action must be wholly or
mainly in contemplation or furtherance of
a trade dispute between workers and their
own employer. Industrial action must not
involve workers who have no dispute with
their own employer (so-called
‘secondary’ action) or involve unlawful
forms of picketing. Before calling for
industrial action, a trade union must
obtain the support of its members in a
secret postal ballot.
Recent Changes
Various changes to industrial relations
legislation are being implemented through the
Employment Relations Act 1999 and in
Northern Ireland the Employment Relations
(NI) Order 1999. For example, there are new
statutory procedures, which came into force in
June 2000, for trade unions to seek recognition
in organisations with more than 20 employees
where the majority of the workforce is in
favour. Parties are encouraged to reach a
voluntary agreement where possible, but if this
proves impossible the Central Arbitration
Committee (CAC) will decide the issues con¬
cerned. In the first year, 80 applications were
made to the CAC. Other provisions include:
> extended protection against unfair
dismissal for employees taking part in
lawfully organised official industrial
action which started on or after 24 April
2000;
> a legal right for employees to be
accompanied by a fellow employee or
trade union representative in serious
disciplinary and grievance hearings;
> powers to prohibit the blacklisting of
trade unionists; and
> a new Partnership Fund (see p. 158) to
contribute to the training of managers
and employee representatives in order to
assist and develop partnerships at work.
Employment Tribunals
Employment tribunals in Great Britain have
jurisdiction over complaints covering a range
of employment rights, including unfair
dismissal, redundancy pay, equal pay, and sex
160
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
and race discrimination. New tribunal
regulations, including provisions designed to
deter cases with weak claims and defences,
took effect in July 2001. Tribunals received
130,000 applications in 2000-01. Northern
Ireland has a separate tribunal system.
Labour Disputes
In the past 20 years there has been a
substantial decline in working days lost
through labour disputes. In 2000 there were
212 stoppages of work arising from labour
disputes, and 499,000 working days were lost
as a result. Although this was the highest
annual total since 1996, it was below the
average of 660,000 days lost in the period 1990
to 1999. Stoppages over pay accounted for
77% of days lost in 2000. Some 49% of
stoppages lasted for no more than one working
day. The UK has a good record in
employment relations: in 1999 only 10 days
were lost per 1,000 employees to labour
disputes, compared with the EU average of 37.
Trade Unions
Trade unions have members in nearly all
occupations. As well as negotiating pay and
other terms and conditions of employment
with employers, they provide benefits and
services, such as educational facilities,
financial services, legal advice and aid in work-
related cases.
In autumn 2000 there were 7.3 million
trade union members in Great Britain,
according to the Labour Force Survey, 17%
fewer than in 1990, although there were small
increases in membership in 1999 and 2000.5
The proportion of those in employment who
are union members was 27.0% in autumn
2000 (compared with 33.9% in 1990), and the
proportion among employees was 29.4% in
2000 (38.1% in 1990). Trade union
membership is more prevalent among older
employees, those with long service and those
5 There are two main sources of information on trade union
membership: the ONS Labour Force Survey and data provided
by trade unions to the Certification Office. Differences in
coverage can result in different estimates. For example, the
Certification Officer’s figure for trade union membership in
1999-2000 was 7.9 million, compared with the Labour Force
Survey figure in autumn 2000 of 7.3 million members among
those in employment.
in the public sector. By occupation, union
membership is most prevalent among
professionals, half of whom were trade union
members in 2000. The long-term decline in
membership has been particularly noticeable
where membership has traditionally been
high—among male employees, manual
workers and those in production industries.
Public administration has the highest density
of union members, around 60% of all
employees. Sectors with relatively few union
members include agriculture, forestry and
fishing, hotels and restaurants, and wholesale
and retail trade.
The largest union in the United Kingdom is
Unison with around 1.3 million members. Other
unions with membership over 500,000 are:
> the Transport and General Workers
Union;
> the Amalgamated Engineering and
Electrical Union; and
> the GMB—a general union with
members in a wide range of industries.
At the end of March 2001 there were 206
trade unions on the list maintained by the
Certification Officer, who, among other
duties, is responsible for certifying the
independence of trade unions. To be eligible
for entry on the list a trade union must show
that it consists wholly or mainly of workers
and that its principal purposes include the
regulation of relations between workers and
employers or between workers and employers’
associations. A further 22 unions were known
to the Certification Officer.
The national body of the trade union
movement is the Trades Union Congress
(TUC), founded in 1868. At the beginning of
2001 its affiliated membership comprised 74
trade unions, which together represented
some 6.7 million people.
There are six TUC regional councils for
England and a Wales Trades Union Council.
The annual Congress meets in September to
discuss matters of concern to trade unionists.
A General Council represents the TUC
between annual meetings.
In Scotland there is a separate national
central body, the Scottish Trades Union
Congress, to which UK unions usually
affiliate their Scottish branches. Nearly all
161
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
trade unions in Northern Ireland are
represented by the Northern Ireland
Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade
Unions (ICTU). Most trade unionists in
Northern Ireland are members of unions
affdiated to the ICTU, while the majority also
belong to unions based in Great Britain, which
are affiliated to the TUC.
The TUC participates in international
trade union activity, through its affiliation to
the International Confederation of Free Trade
Unions and the European Trade Union
Confederation. It also nominates the British
workers’ delegation to the annual International
Labour Conference.
The TUC initiated the TUC Partnership
Institute in spring 2001 to provide an advisory
and training service to help unions and
employers establish partnerships at work.
Employers’ Organisations
Many employers in the UK are members of
employers’ organisations, some of which are
wholly concerned with labour matters,
although others are also trade associations
concerned with commercial matters in
general. Employers’ organisations are usually
established on an industry basis rather than a
product basis, for example, the Engineering
Employers’ Federation. A few are purely local
in character or deal with a section of an
industry or, for example, with small
businesses; most are national and are
concerned with the whole of an industry. At
the end of March 2001, there were 98
employers’ associations on the list maintained
by the Certification Officer and a further 94
were known to the Certification Officer.
Most national organisations belong to the
CBI (see p. 397), which represents around
200,000 businesses.
ACAS
The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration
Service (ACAS) is an independent statutory
body with a general duty of promoting the
improvement of industrial relations. ACAS
aims to operate through the voluntary
co-operation of employers, employees and,
where appropriate, their representatives. Its
main functions are collective conciliation;
provision of arbitration and mediation;
advisory mediation services for preventing
disputes and improving industrial relations
through the joint involvement of employers
and employees; and the provision of a public
enquiry service. ACAS also conciliates in
disputes on individual employment rights, and
in April 2001 introduced a new voluntary
arbitration system for resolving unfair
dismissal claims.
In Northern Ireland the Labour Relations
Agency, an independent statutory body,
provides services similar to those provided by
ACAS in Great Britain.
HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK
There has been a long-term decline in injuries
to employees in the UK, partly reflecting a
change in industrial structure away from the
traditional heavy industries, which tend to have
higher risks. In 1999-2000 the number of
deaths of employees and the self-employed from
injuries at work was 220, which represented a
fatal injury rate of 0.8 per 100,000 workers.
About 6.5 million working days were lost in
1997-98 as a result of work-related injuries.
The principal legislation is the Health and
Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. It imposes general
duties on everyone concerned with work
activities, including employers, the self-
employed, employees, and manufacturers and
suppliers of materials for use at work.
Associated Acts and regulations deal with
particular hazards and types of work. Employers
with five or more staff must prepare a written
statement of their health and safety policy and
bring it to the attention of their staff.
In June 2000 the Government announced
targets to cut workplace deaths, injuries and
illness. It aims to:
> cut deaths and major injury accidents by
10% by 2010;
> reduce the rate of work-related ill-health
by 20% by 2010;
> cut working days lost per 100,000
workers due to work-related injury and
ill-health by 30% by 2010; and
> achieve half of the above improvements
by 2004.
A new Safety Bill is planned, which will
include proposals to meet these targets as well
162
11: THE LABOUR MARKET
as proposals aimed at making travel by air,
rail, sea and road safer (see chapter 21).
Health and Safety Commission
The Health and Safety Commission (HSC)
has responsibility for developing policy on
health and safety at work in Great Britain,
including proposals for new or revised
regulations and approved codes of practice.
Recent work has concentrated on a simpler
and more effective system of regulation.
The HSC has advisory committees
covering subjects such as toxic substances,
genetic modification and the safety of nuclear
installations. There are also several industry
advisory committees, each covering a specific
sector of industry.
Health and Safety Executive
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the
primary instrument for carrying out the
HSC’s policies and has day-to-day
responsibility for enforcing health and safety
law, except where other bodies, such as local
authorities, are responsible. Its field services
and inspections are carried out by the Field
Operations Directorate, which includes the
Railway Inspectorate, the Safety Policy
Directorate, the Health Directorate and the

The HSE’s Technology Division provides

(HSL), an agency of the HSE, aims to ensure
that risks to health and safety from work
activities are properly controlled. This
involves HSL in two main areas: operational
support through incident investigations and
studies of workplace situations; and longer-
term work on analysis and resolution of
occupational health and safety problems.
In premises such as offices, shops,
warehouses, restaurants and hotels, legislation
is enforced by inspectors appointed by local
authorities, working under guidance from the
HSE. Some other official bodies work under
agency agreement with the HSE.
Northern Ireland
The general requirements of health and safety
legislation in Northern Ireland are broadly
similar to those for Great Britain and are
enforced by the Health and Safety Executive
for Northern Ireland (HSENI) and the district
councils, with the latter having an
enforcement role similar to that of local
authorities in Great Britain.

The responsibility for delivering social care support to children, older people,
those who are physically disabled and sensorily impaired, people with learning
disabilities or mental health problems, and to the carers of such individuals, falls
to local authorities and voluntary organisations, working within a policy
framework set out by central government. The Department for Work and
Pensions was established in June 2001 to continue the reform of the welfare state.
Provisions in the Care Standards Act 2000 aim to improve standards in care
services, set new checks on private healthcare and reform regulation of early
years childcare and education. The National Service Framework for Older
People sets standards for preventing illness and improving care of older people.
The Adoption and Children Bill seeks to improve the performance of the
adoption service and promote greater use of adoption, putting the needs of
children first. Through the Criminal Justice and Services Act 2000, the
Government has changed the law to protect children from paedophiles when
using the Internet.
Personal Social Services
Personal social services help older people,
people with disabilities, children and young
people, those with mental health problems or
learning disabilities, their families and carers.
Major services include residential, day care,
short-break and domiciliary services (provided
for people needing support to live in their own
homes). In certain circumstances direct cash
payments may be made to enable individuals
to obtain relevant services for themselves.
Services are administered by local authorities,
but central government is responsible for
establishing national policies, issuing guidance
and overseeing standards.
Much of the care given to older people and
disabled people comes from families and self-
help groups. One in eight adults gives informal
care and one in six homes has a carer. Many of
these carers are elderly themselves. There are
around 6 million informal carers in the UK,
about 58% of whom are women. The Carers
and Disabled Children Act 2000 ensures for the
first time that support is specifically directed at
carers, bringing their needs in line with those of
the person they are looking after.

Table 12.1).
The Care Standards Act 2000 aims to raise
the standards in care services in England and
W ales, to monitor private healthcare provision
and reform the regulation of care for young
people. Under the Act, the National Care
Standards Commission (NCSC) was
established in April 2001. The NCSC takes
over its regulatory functions in April 2002 and
will be responsible for regulating social care
services as well as private and voluntary
healthcare. Its remit includes all care homes,
children’s homes as well as private hospitals
and clinics. The independent Commission has
strong powers of enforcement to make sure
that services meet required standards.
The Act also establishes a General Social
Care Council (GSCC) which will operate from
October 2001. This will raise professional and
training standards for the social care workforce
and offer an increased level of protection to
users of social care services in England. It will
regulate the social care workforce by
publishing Codes of Practice for workers and
their employers and by registering the
workforce, beginning with social workers.
Equivalent bodies are being established in
Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.
Alongside the GSCC, the Government is
also to establish the Social Care Institute for
Excellence (SCIE), which will help to raise the
standard of social care provision in England
and Wales. SCIE will establish a database of
knowledge about what works in social care,
drawing on existing practice, user and carer
experience and the results of Social Services
Inspectorate and Joint Review inspections.
The information that SCIE gathers will be
rigorously reviewed and SCIE will produce
Best Practice guidelines based on this review
process. These guidelines will be disseminated
across the social care sector in order to
eliminate variations in quality and standards.
The improvement of training standards will
be taken forward by the Training Organisation
for the Personal Social Services (TOPSS),
which is responsible for developing and
promoting the National Occupational
Standards for care work.
Older People
Older people represent the fastest growing
section of the community. Services are
165
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
designed to help them live at home whenever
possible. These services may include advice and
help given by social workers, domestic help, the
provision of meals in the home, sitters-in, night
attendants and laundry services, as well as direct
payments, day centres, lunch clubs and
recreational facilities. The Warm Homes Act
2000 addressed the issue of fuel poverty. As a
result, schemes have been set up in the different
countries of the UK to provide free central
heating and free insulation.
Adaptations to the home can overcome a
person’s difficulties in moving about. A range
of equipment is available for people with poor
hearing or eyesight and for those with physical
disabilities. Alarm systems help older people
obtain assistance in an emergency. In some
areas ‘good neighbour’ and visiting services
are arranged by the local authority or a
voluntary organisation.
Over the past few years, there has been a
fall in the number of residential places
provided for older people by the public sector
(see Table 12.1). In 1994, the public sector
provided 29% of places for older people. This
had fallen to 22% in 1999. Older people who
live in residential care homes or nursing
homes are subject to means-test charging.
Local authorities contribute to care costs for
those who cannot pay the full charge.
Better Care for all our futures, published by
the Scottish Executive in April 2001, sets out
pre-legislative consultation on a range of
proposals to develop long-term care in
Scotland. The proposals include:
> measures to extend joint working on
health and social care between local
authorities and health bodies;
> expansion of direct payments made by
local authorities allowing people to
purchase non-residential care services;
> optional deferred payment agreement
with local authorities to give people the
choice of whether to sell their home in
order to pay for their residential care;
> enabling certain people in care homes
funded by local authorities to top up the
fees if they choose a more expensive
home; and
> improving consistency of charging for
non-residential care by local authorities.
The National Service Framework
(NSF) for Older People
This NSF, published in 2001, sets
standards for preventing illness and
improving care among older people in
England. (NSFs for mental health and
coronary heart disease were published in
September 1999 and March 2000
respectively—see chapter 13.) The NSF
for older people contains eight standards
on: rooting out age discrimination; person-
centred care; intermediate care; general
hospital care; stroke; falls; mental health in
older people; and promoting an active
healthy life.
The standards will be delivered locally
and monitored by independent bodies,
including the National Care Standards
Commission.
Implementation of free personal and
nursing care for older people in Scotland will
begin in April 2002.
Following publication of Improving Health
in Wales—A Plan for the NHS with its Partners
and the introduction of the Health and Social
Care Act 2001, the National Assembly for
Wales is also implementing a policy to ensure
that the services of a Registered Nurse are free
of charge in all care settings.
The development of a strategy for older
people is being taken forward by the National
Assembly for Wales. The main purpose
of the strategy is to provide a structured basis
for the Assembly and other public bodies to
develop future policies and plans which reflect
the needs of older people and recognise
changing demographic and social
circumstances. The strategy will be completed
for consultation by spring 2002 and will
include a review of the consequences of
introducing free personal care in Wales.
People with Disabilities
Over the past decade there has been increasing
emphasis on rehabilitation and the provision of
day, domiciliary and respite support services to
enable disabled people to live independently in
the community whenever possible.
166
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
Local authority social services departments
help with social rehabilitation and adjustment
to disability. They are required to identify the
number of disabled people in their area and to
provide and publicise services. These may
include advice on personal and social
problems arising from disability, as well as
occupational, educational, social and
recreational facilities, either at day centres or
elsewhere. Other services provided may
include adaptations to homes (such as ramps
for wheelchairs, stairlifts and ground-floor
toilets), the delivery of cooked meals, support
with personal care at home and direct
payments with which disabled people can
purchase support to meet their assessed need.
Local authorities and voluntary organisations
may provide severely disabled people with
residential accommodation, either on a
permanent basis or temporarily in order to
relieve their existing carers. Special housing
may be available for those able to look after
themselves. Some authorities provide free or
subsidised travel for disabled people on public
transport, and they are encouraged to provide
special means of access to public buildings.
The Department for Work and Pensions is
responsible for disability issues. The
department manages WORKSTEP
(previously called the Supported Employment
Programme). This exists to recognise the right
of disabled people to the same work
opportunities as others and, where possible, to
allow them to move from supported
employment to open employment. Quality
standards will be developed to ensure
consistency throughout the programme for
those employers who take part.
A Disability Rights Commission (DRC),
established in Great Britain in April 2000, aims
to eliminate discrimination against disabled
people, promote equal opportunities, encourage
good practice and advise the Government on
the operation of the Disability Discrimination
Act 1995 and the Disability Rights Commission
Act 1999. The Equality Commission (see
p. 117) has a similar role in Northern Ireland.
People with Learning Disabilities
The Government encourages the development
of local services for people with learning
disabilities and their families through
cooperation between health authorities, local
authorities, education and training services
and voluntary and other organisations.
Local authority social services departments
are the leading statutory agencies for planning
and arranging such services. They provide or
arrange short-term care, support for families
in their own homes, residential
accommodation and support for various types
of activity outside the home. People with
learning disabilities may also be able to receive
direct payments. The main aim is to ensure
that, as far as possible, they can lead full lives
in the community. They form the largest
group for local authority-funded day centre
places and the second largest group in
residential care. The National Health Service
(NHS) provides specialist services when the
ordinary primary care services cannot meet
healthcare needs. Residential care is provided
for those with severe or profound disabilities
whose needs can effectively be met only by the
NHS. The White Paper A new strategy for
Learning Disability for the 21st Century was
published in March 2001. The proposals are
intended to result in improvements to
education, social services, health,
employment, housing, and support for people
with learning disabilities, their families and
carers in England.
In May 2000, the Scottish Executive
published The Same As You?, its review of
services for people with a learning disability.
By focusing on inclusion, it aims to improve
the lives of people with learning disabilities
and their families.
People with a Mental Health Problem
Government policy aims to ensure that people
with mental health problems should have
access to all the services they need as locally as
possible. Under the Care Programme
Approach, each patient should receive an
assessment leading to the formulation of an
agreed care plan. A care coordinator is
appointed to keep in touch with him or her,
and the care plan is regularly reviewed in the
light of the individual’s changing needs. The
separate Welsh Mental Health Strategy
employs many of the same principles in
167
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
delivering services in Wales. In Scotland, each
health board works with its local authority
care partners, with users of mental health
services and with their carers in order to
develop joint strategies and provide local and
comprehensive mental health services.
While the total number of places for people
with mental health problems in the large
hospitals has continued to fall, the provision of
alternative places has increased. More people
are now cared for in smaller NHS hospitals,
local authority accommodation and private
and voluntary sector homes. In 1999 there
were 37,100 places available in independent
sector (private sector and voluntary sector)
residential care homes for people with mental
health problems in the UK, compared with
20,900 places in 1994 (see Table 12.1).
Arrangements made by social services
authorities for providing care in the
community include direct payments, day
centres, social centres and residential care.
Social workers are increasingly being
integrated with NHS staff in community
mental health teams under single
management. This includes the newer
functional teams specified in the NHS Plan—
assertive outreach, crisis resolution, home
treatment and early intervention. Social
workers help patients and their families with
problems caused by mental illness. In some
cases they can apply for a mentally disordered
person to be compulsorily admitted to and
detained in hospital. Special bodies provide
safeguards for patients to ensure that the law
is used appropriately.
Currently supervision registers for
discharged patients most at risk are
maintained by the providers of services for
mentally ill people. However, mental health
provider trusts will be allowed to discontinue
their supervision registers once Regional
Offices are satisfied that they have suitable
arrangements for delivering the Care
Programme Approach.
In December 2000 the Government set out
detailed plans covering the reform of the
Mental Health Act (1983), in the White Paper
Reforming the Mental Health Act. This set out
new arrangements for managing dangerous
people with severe personality disorders,
including significant programmes of research
and service development. Modern mental
health legislation will make it possible to treat
people with severe mental disorder either in
their own best interest or to protect the wider
public. The legislation will also introduce new
safeguards for patients subject to compulsory
care and treatment and enable people to be
treated in the community, where appropriate,
rather than being detained in hospital.
Help to Families
Local authorities and Health and Social
Services—HSS—Trusts in Northern Ireland
are required to safeguard the welfare of any
child in need and promote the upbringing of
such children by their families. The services
provided to achieve these aims include advice,
guidance, counselling, help in the home and
family centres. Help is available to the
immediate family of the child in need or to
any other member of the family, if this will
safeguard the child’s welfare. Local authorities
can provide these services directly or arrange
them through another agency such as a
voluntary organisation. They are also required
to publicise the help available to families in
need. Many local authorities and specialist
voluntary organisations run refuges for
women whose home conditions have become
intolerable because of, for example, domestic
violence. The refuges provide short-term
accommodation and support for women and
children while attempts are made to relieve
the longer-term problems.
Day Care for Children
Day care facilities are provided for young
children by childminders, voluntary agencies,
private nurseries and local authorities. In 2000
in England and Wales, there were 334,000
childminder places for children under eight;
275,000 day nursery places; 149,000 out-of¬
school clubs; and 377,000 playgroup places.
In allocating local authority places, priority
is given to children with special social,
learning or health needs. In September 2001
the newly formed Early Years Directorate of
OFSTED (see p. 134) took over responsibility
from local authorities for the regulation of day
care providers for children aged under eight.
168
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
In Scotland, local authority responsibility
transferred to the new Scottish Commission
for the Regulation of Care in April 2001.
Regulation has been extended to cover
provision for children up to the age of 16.
Child Protection
Child protection is the joint concern of a
number of different agencies and professions.
Local authority area child protection
committees determine how the different
agencies should cooperate to help protect
children from abuse and neglect in their area.
In Scotland, a review of child protection was
announced in March 2001. The report of the
review will be published by June 2002.
New guidance for schools in England has
been issued by the Department for Education
and Skills on protection against paedophiles
using the Internet. It covers e-mails for pupils,
filtering systems, school websites and chat
rooms, and stipulates that no child be
identified by name or other personal details.
The Government announced in March
2001 that a new taskforce would be established
to help improve the protection of those using
the Internet in the UK, particularly children.
The taskforce will include representatives
from the Internet industry, child welfare
organisations, the police and government.
In January 2001, the Government changed
the law to tackle Internet crime in England
and Wales. Through the Criminal Justice and
Court Services Act 2000, the age below which
children are protected under the Indecency
with Children Act 1960 was raised from 14 to
16. The same Act also significantly increased
the maximum sentences for child pornography
offences. Through the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the police will
undertake computer network investigations
and forensic examinations of suspects’ and
victims’ computers in order to secure evidence
to bring before a court.
Children in Care
Local authorities and HSS Trusts must
provide accommodation for children who have
no parent or guardian, who have been
abandoned, or whose parents are unable to
provide for them. They can also be
accommodated by a local authority through a
voluntary agreement with their parents.
In England and Wales a child may be
brought before a family proceedings court if
he or she is neglected or ill-treated, exposed to
moral danger, beyond the control of parents,
or not attending school. The court can commit
children to the care of a local authority under a
care order. Certain pre-conditions have to be
satisfied to justify such an order. These are
that the children are suffering or are likely to
suffer significant harm because of a lack of
reasonable parental care or because they are
beyond parental control. However, an order is
made only if the court is also satisfied that this
will positively contribute to the children’s
well-being and be in their best interests. In
court proceedings children are entitled to
separate legal representation. All courts have to
treat the welfare of children as the paramount
consideration when reaching any decision
about their upbringing. There is a general
principle that, wherever possible, children
should remain at home with their families.
In Scotland children who have committed
offences or are in need of care and protection
may be brought before a Children’s Hearing,
which can impose a supervision requirement
on a child. Under these requirements, most
children are allowed to remain at home under
the supervision of a social worker, but some
may live with foster parents or in a residential
establishment while under supervision.
Supervision requirements are reviewed at least
once a year until ended by a Children’s
Hearing.
The Government has set up the Quality
Protects programme in England to improve
the management and delivery of children’s
social services and hence improve the life
chances of children in need, including
children in care. This is a key part of the wider
strategy for tackling social exclusion (see
p. 118). A special grant of £885 million over
five years from April 1999 is supporting this
programme. Payment of each local authority’s
share of the grant is subject to the preparation
and achievement of satisfactory action plans.
In Wales the National Assembly’s Children
First programme has similar objectives.
169
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Fostering and Children’s Homes
Local authorities and HSS Trusts have a duty
to ensure that the welfare of children being
looked after away from home is properly
safeguarded. This includes their health,
education and contact with their families and
way of life. When appropriate, children in care
are placed with foster parents, who receive
payments to cover the child’s living costs.
Alternatively, the child may be placed in
residential care. Children’s homes may be
provided by local authorities, voluntary
organisations or private companies or
individuals. Voluntary children’s homes,
which are registered by the Department of
Health, are inspected by the Social Services
Inspectorate. Local authority social services
departments inspect the children’s homes that
they are responsible for registering.
Under the Care Standards Act (see p. 165),
all children’s homes are required to register
with the NCSC. The Commission will also
inspect all children’s homes, including small
private children’s homes accommodating three
or fewer children, which are not currently
subject to any inspection process.
Local authorities are as far as possible
expected to work in partnership with the
parents of children who are in their care. They
are required to produce a plan for the future
of each child in their care and to prepare a
child for leaving care. Local authorities are
also expected to have a complaints procedure
for considering representations about
children’s services. The Children Act 1989
requires the involvement of an independent
person at each stage of consideration of a
representation or complaint. The Children
(Leaving Care) Act 2000 (see below)
introduced a 14-day resolution stage for
complaints brought under this Act; if the
complaint is not resolved by that deadline the
same procedure applies as for the Children Act
complaints process.
The number of children looked after by
local authorities in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland increased from 55,000 in
1994 to 61,000 in 1999. The number of
children placed in foster homes increased by
around 13% over the same period and the
number placed in children’s homes declined by
19%. Scotland has a different definition of
children in care which means data are not
comparable with the rest of the UK. Social
services also help children who are considered
to be at risk of abuse and hold a central register
of such children. At 31 March 2000, 34,200
children in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland were on child protection registers.
Young People Leaving Local
Authority Care
Improving the life chances of young people
living in and leaving local authority care is the
principal aim of the Children (Leaving Care)
Act 2000, which will be implemented from
October 2001. The Act:
> imposes a new duty on local authorities
to assess and meet the needs of eligible
people aged 16 or 17 who are in care or
care leavers. Wherever the young person
lives in England or Wales the local
authority must keep in touch with them
until they are at least 21;
> ensures that, on or shortly after becoming
16, every eligible young person in or
leaving care has a plan mapping out a
clear route to independence;
> ensures that local authorities provide all
eligible 16 to 17 year olds who are in care
or care leavers with personal and
practical support to meet the objectives
identified in their pathway plans;
> ensures each young person has a young
person’s adviser to coordinate provision
of support and assistance. Emphasis will
be placed on helping the young person
into education, training or employment;
> ensures a new financial regime for care
leavers; and
> ensures continuing assistance for care
leavers aged 18 to 21, especially with
education and employment. Assistance
with education or training continues to
the end of the agreed programme, even if
it takes someone past the age of 21.
The Act applies to England and Wales,
although regulations are made separately for
the two countries. Scotland intends to bring in
similar legislation as soon as parliamentary
time allows. In Northern Ireland a
170
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
consultation document on proposals for a
Children Leaving Care Bill was published by
the Department of Health, Social Services and
Public Safety in March 2001.
Adoption
Local authority social services departments
and HSS Trusts are required by law to
provide an adoption service, either directly or
by arrangement with approved voluntary
adoption societies. Adoption is one way
children in care are able to leave care—around
a third of all children adopted are looked after
by a local authority prior to their adoption.
Around 5,000 children were entered on the
Adopted Children Register in 2000 in England
and Wales.
In August 2001, the final National Adoption
Standards for England were published. The
Standards have been developed to ensure that
children, prospective adopters and birth
families receive a consistent and high-quality
adoption service no matter where they live.
Adoption Standards for Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland will be issued at a later date.
At the same time, the Adoption Register for
England and Wales was launched in England
(the launch in Wales will follow later). It will
hold information on children waiting to be
adopted and approved adoptive families from
across England and Wales. The Register will
tackle delays in finding suitable adoptive
families for children from across the country
where a local family cannot be found, or the
child needs to move away from the area.
The Adoption and Permanence Taskforce
is a new source of practical help for
authorities. Its function is to help councils to
improve their performance and to spread best
practice. A Partnership Council has also been
established to support this work and act as a
sounding board for the Government on
adoption issues.
In April 2001 provisions in the Adoption
(Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999 came into
force in England and Wales. These placed a
duty on local government to provide an inter¬
country adoption service and made it an
offence to bring a child into the UK for the
purposes of adoption without complying with
prescribed procedures including the usual
Adoption and Children Bill
An Adoption and Children Bill will be
introduced during the current session of
Parliament. It will implement the
proposals in the White Paper Adoption—a
new approach, published in December
2000, and underpin the Government’s
drive to improve the adoption service and
promote greater use of adoption. It will
include provisions to:
^ introduce a new duty on local authorities
to provide an adoption support service
and a right for adoptive families to
request and receive an assessment of
their needs for adoption support
services;
> establish an independent review
mechanism for applicants who consider
they are being turned down unfairly;
> legally underpin the new Adoption
Register for England and Wales; and
> improve the legal controls on inter¬
country adoption and advertising
children for adoption, and make clear the
steps in relation to adoption which may
only be taken by an adoption agency.
In Scotland, the Adoption Policy Review
was announced in April 2001. This will
look at adoption law and practice.
assessment and approval arrangements.
Scotland brought the same provisions into
force in July 2001.
Finance
In 1998-99, gross expenditure on personal
social services was £12.4 billion in Great
Britain. In England local authorities’
expenditure on services for older people and
children accounted for nearly three-quarters
of all expenditure on personal social services
in 1998—99 (see Figure 12.2).
Social Security
The social security system is designed to
secure a basic standard of living for people in

financial need. It provides income during
periods of inability to earn (including periods
of unemployment), help for families and
assistance with costs arising from disablement.
Social security is the largest single area of
government spending. In each year from
1995-96 to 2000-01 spending on social
security benefits in Great Britain represented
about 29% of total government expenditure.
At 2000-01 prices, spending grew from
£100.8 billion to £105.5 billion over this five-
year period, representing a growth rate of
about 0.9% a year on average.
MODERNISING THE SYSTEM
Welfare Reform
The Government’s central aim for welfare
reform is to promote an ethic of work and
savings. The Welfare Reform and Pensions
Act 1999 came into force in November 1999.
Its main measures are: the introduction of new
stakeholder pension schemes (see below);
pension sharing for divorced couples;
revisions to benefits for widows and widowers;
a single gateway to the benefit system for
those of working age; and a new benefits
structure for people with disabilities or long¬
term illness.
The Government aims to support and
strengthen the framework for occupational
pensions. The new stakeholder pensions were
introduced in April 2001. They will provide a
new pension option for those earners who do
not have access to a good occupational
pension. All employers, if they do not have an
occupational pension scheme or contribute at
least 3% to their employees’ personal pension,
must provide their employees with access to a
stakeholder pension scheme. Employers are
exempt if they have fewer than five
employees.
Stakeholder pensions, which are provided
by private sector companies, must satisfy a
number of minimum government standards to
ensure that they offer value for money and
flexibility. These standards include:
> not charging more than 1% a year on the
value of each member’s funds;
> enabling members to transfer into or out
of a stakeholder pension, or stop payment
for a time, without facing any charge;
> accepting contributions of £20 or more,
weekly, monthly or at less regular
intervals; and
> being run in the interest of their
members by trustees or scheme
managers.
The Government also plans to reform the
state earnings-related pension scheme
(SERFS) (see p. 175) in 2002 to provide a
more generous additional state pension for low
and moderate earners, and certain carers and
people with a long-term illness or disability.
This will be called the State Second Pension.
The statutory framework necessary to
establish State Second Pensions is contained
in the Child Support, Pensions and Social
Security Act 2000. For the first time, carers,
others with domestic responsibilities who were
unable to contribute to a second pension in
their own right, and people suffering a long¬
term illness or disability with broken work
records would benefit from additional pension
provision. It is expected that about 11 million
people nationwide will be better off when they
retire as a result of these changes.
172
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
Other measures in the Act will strengthen
arrangements for child maintenance (see
p. 178). These include:
> giving the Child Support Agency (CSA)
far-reaching powers to enforce
maintenance payments;
> introducing fines of up to £1,000 for
absent parents who deliberately try to
evade the CSA; and
> requiring absent parents to pay 15% of
their wages for a single child, rising to
20% for two children and 25% for three
children or more.
Fighting Fraud
Around £2 billion is lost each year in Great
Britain where social security benefit fraud is
known to have taken place. To combat this,
the Benefits Fraud Inspectorate was set up in
1997 to strengthen the administration and
security of benefits through inspection,
reporting and monitoring and support of
delivery organisations. The Inspectorate
covers the Department for Work and
Pensions’ agencies and the benefits
administered by local authorities. It also
carries out work for the Social Security
Agency in Northern Ireland.
Among the provisions included in the
Social Security Fraud Act 2001 are those to
obtain and share information; withdraw or
reduce benefits for repeat offenders; and use
penalties as an alternative to prosecution.
ADMINISTRATION
In June 2001 the Department for Work and
Pensions (DWP) was formed (see p. 62). The
Department will:
5* provide a single point of delivery for jobs,
benefits advice and support through
Jobcentre Plus—a new service which will
begin to operate in October 2001 (see
p. 153);
help employers to fill job vacancies;

Advice about Benefits
The DWP produces a range of information
material in English and other languages as well
as in different formats (audio and videotapes,
braille and large print). There are telephone
helplines, and a website provides general
information on entitlement and liability.
CONTRIBUTIONS
Entitlement to National Insurance benefits
such as Retirement Pension, Incapacity
Benefit and contributory Jobseeker’s
Allowance is dependent upon the payment of
contributions. The amount an employee can
earn before employer NI contributions (NICs)
are charged is aligned with the personal
allowance for income tax (see p. 406). There
are six classes of contributions. The rates given
below are effective from April 2001 to April
2002:
> Class 1—paid by employees and their
employers. No NICs are payable for
employees earning less than £72 a week.
Employees earning between £72 and £87
a week are liable to make contributions,
but at present they do not make any
payments. Contributions on earnings at
or above £87 a week in non-contracted-
out employment are at the rate of 10%
up to the upper earnings limit of £575 a
week. Employers’ contributions are at the
>
>
173
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
rate of 11.9% and are charged on
everything earned at or above £87 per
week. There is no upper earnings limit
for employers’ contributions.
> Class 1A—paid by employers who
provide their employees with a variety of
benefits in kind.
> Class IB—paid by employers who enter
into a PAYE Settlement Agreement with
the Inland Revenue for tax.
> Class 2—paid by self-employed people.
Contributions are at a flat rate of £2 a
week. The self-employed may claim
exemption from Class 2 contributions if
their net earnings are expected to be
below £3,955 for the 2001-02 tax year.
Self-employed people are not eligible for
unemployment and industrial injuries
benefits.
> Class 3—paid voluntarily to safeguard
rights to some benefits. Contributions are
at a flat rate of £6.75 a week.
> Class 4—paid by the self-employed on
their taxable profits over a set lower limit
(£4,535 a year), and up to a set upper limit
(£29,900 a year) in addition to their Class
2 contribution. Class 4 contributions are
payable at the rate of 7%.
Employees who work after pensionable age
(currently 60 for women and 65 for men) do
not pay contributions but the employer
continues to be liable. Self-employed people
over pensionable age do not pay contributions.
BENEFITS
Social security benefits can be grouped into
three types:
> means-tested, available to people whose
income and savings are below certain
levels;
> contributory, paid to people who have
made the required contributions to the
National Insurance Fund,1 from which
benefits are paid; and
1 The National Insurance Fund is a statutory fund into which all
Nl contributions payable by employers, employees and self-
employed people are deposited, and from which contributory
benefits and their administration costs are paid.
Figure 12.3:
Social Security Benefit Expenditure,
Great Britain, 2001-02:
by Broad Groups of Beneficiaries

Source: Department for Work and Pensions
> benefits which are neither means-tested
nor contributory (mainly paid to cover
extra costs, for example of disability, or
paid universally, for example Child
Benefit).
General taxation provides over half the
income for the social security programme,
employers’ NI contributions around a quarter
and employees’ NI contributions about a fifth.
For most contributory benefits there are
two conditions. First, before benefit can be
paid at all, a certain number of contributions
must have been made. Second, the full rate of
benefit cannot be paid unless contributions
have been made or credited to a specific level
over a set period. A reduced rate of benefit
may be payable, dependent on the level of
contributions made or credited. For example,
a great many of those receiving retirement
pensions and widows’ benefits receive a
percentage-based rate of benefit. Benefits are
increased annually in line with percentage
increases in retail prices. The main benefits
(payable weekly) are summarised on
pp. 175-182. Rates given are those effective from
April 2001 until April 2002.

Retirement
A state Retirement Pension is a taxable
weekly benefit payable, if the contribution
conditions have been met, to women from the
age of 60 and men from the age of 65.
Legislation was introduced in 1995 to equalise
the state pension age for men and women at
65. The change will be phased in over ten
years, starting from April 2010. Women born
before 6 April 1950 will not be affected; their
pension age will remain at 60. The new
pension age of 65 will apply to women born
on or after 6 April 1955. Pension age for
women born between these dates will move
up gradually from 60 to 65.
The state pension scheme consists of a
basic weekly pension of £72.50 for a single
person and £115.90 for a married couple on a
standard rate pension, together with an
additional earnings-related pension (SERFS).
Pensioners may have unlimited earnings
without affecting their pensions. Those who
have put off their retirement during the five
years after state pension age may earn extra
pension, but they will not get any pension for
the weeks they gave up.
A non-contributory retirement pension of
£43.55 a week is payable to people who are
over 80, satisfy certain residence conditions
and are either not entitled to a retirement
175
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
pension or are entitled to one of less than
£43.30 a week. People whose pensions do not
give them enough to live on may be entitled to
the Minimum Income Guarantee (see p. 177).
Rights to basic pensions are safeguarded for
people whose opportunities to work are
limited while they are looking after a child or a
sick or disabled person. Men and women may
receive the same basic pension, provided they
have paid full-rate NI contributions when
working. The earnings-related pension
scheme will eventually be calculated as 20%
rather than 25% of earnings, and is being
phased in over ten years from 1999. However,
the pensions of people w ho retired in the 20th
century will be unaffected.
Occupational and Personal Pensions
Employers may ‘contract out’ their employees
from SERFS and provide a pension via their
own occupational pension instead.
Contracted-out salary-related schemes must
meet a statutory test of overall quality and
offer benefits that are broadly the same as, or
better than, SERFS. They receive a flat-rate
refund of National Insurance contributions
and an age-related top-up based on a
percentage of earnings between the lower and
upper earnings limit on w hich National
Insurance contributions are based.
Membership of an employer’s contracted-out
scheme is voluntary; the State remains
responsible for the basic pension.
Occupational pension schemes currently
have over 10.3 million members accruing
pension rights. The occupational pension
rights of those who change jobs before
pensionable age and are unable or do not want
to transfer their contracted-out salary-related
pension rights are now offered some
protection against inflation. Most workers
leaving a scheme at least a year before its
pension age and with two years’ pensionable
service have the right to a fair transfer value.
The trustees or managers of pensions have to
provide full information about their schemes.
Occupational schemes must provide equal
treatment between male and female members.
As an alternative to their employer’s
scheme or SERFS, people are entitled to
choose a personal pension available from a
bank, building society, insurance company or
other financial institution.
Employees can also contract out of SERFS
using a personal pension plan rather than an
occupational scheme. A personal pension used
this way is called an appropriate personal
pension and it also receives National
Insurance rebates which are age-related.
The Pensions Ombudsman deals with
complaints of maladministration against
occupational and personal pension schemes
and adjudicates on disputes. A pensions
registry helps people trace lost benefits.
Unemployment
Jobseeker’s Allowance
Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) is a benefit for
unemployed people seeking work. Claimants
must be capable of, available for, and actively
seeking work. They must normally be aged at
least 18 years and under pension age. JSA can
be either contribution-based or income-based:
> Contribution-based jfSA\ those who have
paid enough NI contributions are entitled
to a personal JSA for up to six months
(£53.05 a week for a person aged 25 or
over), regardless of any savings or
partner’s income.
> Income-based JfSA: those on a low income
are entitled to an income-based JSA,
payable for as long as the jobseeker
requires support and continues to satisfy
the qualifying conditions. The amount a
claimant receives comprises an age-
related personal allowance (£53.05 a
week for a person aged 25 or over),
allowances for dependent children and
premium payments for those with extra
expenses, for example, disabled children.
Income-based JSA’s benefit rates are
determined by circumstances on a basis
similar to Income Support (see p. 177).
Back to Work Bonus
Recipients of JSA and people aged under 60
who receive Income Support can benefit from
a Back to Work Bonus. The aim of the scheme
176
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
is to encourage people to keep in touch with
the labour market by undertaking small
amounts of work while claiming benefit.
The Back to Work Bonus scheme allows
people to accrue a tax-free lump sum of
between £5 and £1,000 if working part-time
while in receipt of Income Support or
Jobseeker’s Allowance.
To begin accruing the Bonus, the person
must have been entitled to Income Support or
Jobseeker’s Allowance for at least 91 days.
Back to Work Bonus can be accrued by either
member of a couple and is payable if their
benefit ceases due to starting remunerative
work or increasing their earnings.
Remunerative work is defined as 16 hours or
more of employment for the claimant or 24
hours or more for the partner.
An amount equal to half of any earnings
above the appropriate weekly earnings
disregard (normally £5 for a single person,
£10 for couples, and £20 for single parents,
disabled people and some people in special
occupations) will count towards the bonus.
Income Support
Income Support is payable to certain people
aged 16 or over who are not required to be
available for work, and whose income and
savings are below certain set levels. They
include lone parents, pensioners, carers and
long-term sick and disabled people. Income
Support is made up of: a personal allowance
based on age and on whether the claimant is
single, a lone parent or has a partner; age-
related allowances for dependent children and
additional sums known as premiums; and
housing costs. From this total amount other
income, including some other social security
benefits, is deducted. Income Support for
people aged 60 and over is now known as the
Minimum Income Guarantee.
Income Support is not payable if savings
exceed £8,000. Savings between £3,000 and
£8,000 will reduce the amount received. For
people living permanently in residential care
or a nursing home, the allowance is not
payable if savings exceed £16,000; and savings
between £10,000 and £16,000 will affect the
amount received. For people aged over 60,
Income Support is not payable if savings
exceed £12,000, while savings between £6,000
and £12,000 will reduce the amount received.
Families
Most pregnant working women receive
Statutory Maternity Pay directly from their
employer. It is paid for a maximum of 18
weeks to any woman who has been working
for the same employer for 26 weeks and who
earns on average at least £72 a week. She will
receive 90% of her average weekly earnings
for the first six weeks and a rate of £62.20 a
week for the remaining 12 weeks.
Women who are not eligible for Statutory
Maternity Pay because, for example, they are
self-employed, or have recently changed jobs
or left their job, may qualify for a weekly
Maternity Allowance, which is payable for
up to 18 weeks and is based on average
earnings. If average weekly earnings are equal
to or more than the lower earnings limit, this
amounts to £62.20 a week. If average weekly
earnings are at least £30 a week but less than
the lower earnings limit, the sum paid is 90%
of average earnings. All pregnant employees
have the right to take a minimum of 18 weeks
maternity leave.
A Sure Start Maternity Grant of up to
£200 may be made if the mother or her
partner receive Income Support, income-
based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Working
families I ax Credit or Disabled Person’s
1 ax Credit and have savings under £500
(£1,000 for people aged 60 and over). It is also
available if a baby is adopted.
The main social security benefit for
children is Child Benefit. This is a tax-free,
non-contributory payment of £15.50 a week
for the eldest qualifying child of a couple, and
£10.35 for each other child. Child Benefit is
payable for children up to the age of 16, and
for those up to 19 who continue in full-time
non-advanced education. It is generally not
payable to people whose entry into the UK is
subject to immigration control.
People claiming Child Benefit for an
orphaned child they have taken into their
family may be entitled to Guardian’s
Allowance. I his is a tax-tree non¬
contributory benefit of £9.70 a week for the
eldest child and £11.35 for each other child

who qualifies. In certain circumstances
Guardian’s Allowance can be paid even if one
parent is still alive.
Child Support Agency (CSA)
An estimated 1 million lone parents in the UK
bring up 1.7 million children in households
where no one is working. If any person is
living with and caring for a child, and one, or
both, of the child’s parents are living elsewhere
in the UK, he or she may apply to have child
support maintenance assessed and collected by
the CSA (or its Northern Ireland counterpart).
If that person or their present partner claims
Income Support or income-based Jobseeker’s
Allowance, they may be required to apply for
child support maintenance if asked to do so by
the CSA (or its Northern Ireland counterpart).
Assessments for child support maintenance
are made using a formula which takes into
account each parent’s income and makes
allowance for essential outgoings. (A system of
departures from the formula allows the
amount of maintenance payable to be varied in
a small number of cases.) A child maintenance
bonus worth up to £1,000 may be payable to
parents living with and caring for a child who
have been in receipt of Income Support or
income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance and in
receipt of child maintenance when they leave
benefit for work.
Working Families’ Tax Credit
Working Families’ Tax Credit (WFTC)
gives working families with children
additional financial help. It is administered by
the Inland Revenue and paid through workers’
pay packets. Families (couples or lone parents)
are eligible if they:
> have one or more children;
> work at least 16 hours a week;
> are resident and entitled to work in the
UK; and
> have savings of £8,000 or less.
WFTC is made up of:
> basic credit—£59.00;
> credit for working over 30 hours per
week—£11.45;
> tax credit for each child
—£26.00 (aged up to 15 years)
—£26.75 (aged 16 to 18);
> a childcare tax credit—up to 70% of
eligible costs up to a maximum of £135
for one child and £200 for two or more
children;
> a disabled child tax credit of £30.00 for
each child who gets Disability Living
Allowance, or who is registered blind or
who has left the register in the last 28
weeks; or a child enhanced disability tax
178
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
credit of ^41.05 for each child who gets
the higher care component of Disability
Living Allowance; and
> an adult enhanced disability tax credit of
^16.00 where applicants or their partner
get the higher rate care component of
Disability Living Allowance.
The WFTC award, which normally lasts
for 26 weeks, is calculated by adding the
credits together. If the family income (after tax
and National Insurance contributions) is above
£92.90 per week, this is reduced by 55 pence
for each £1 above £92.90.
Social Fund
Payments, in the form of loans or grants, may
be available to people on low incomes to help
with expenses which are difficult to meet out
of regular income. There are two kinds of
payment. Discretionary payments are:
> budgeting loans for important
intermittent expenses;
> community care grants to help, for
example, people resettle into the
community from care, or to remain in the
community, to ease exceptional pressure
on families, to set up home as part of a
planned resettlement programme and to
meet certain travel expenses; and
> crisis loans to help people in an
emergency or as a result of a disaster
where there is serious risk to health or
safety. People do not have to be receiving
any form of benefit to qualify for this.
The Social Fund also provides regulated
payments (payments that are not cash-limited)
to help people awarded certain income-related
benefits with the costs of maternitv or
funerals, or with heating during very cold
weather and winter fuel payments.
Widows and Widowers
Bereavement Payment. Widows under the
age of 60, and widowers under the age of 65 
or those over 60/65 whose spouses were not
entitled to a category A state Retirement
Pension when they died—receive a tax-free
single payment of £2,000 following the death
of their spouses, provided that their spouses
have paid a minimum number of National
Insurance contributions. Those whose spouses
have died of an industrial injury or prescribed
disease may also qualify, regardless of whether
their spouses have paid NI contributions.
Widowed Parent’s Allowance is a
taxable benefit of £72.50 a week, and is
payable to widowed parents with at least one
child for whom they are getting Child Benefit.
Additional tax-free amounts of £9.70 for a
child for whom the higher rate of Child
Benefit is payable, and £11.35 for each
subsequent child, are available. Entitlement to
this benefit is dependent on the NI
contributions of the spouse, and it ceases if the
parent moves in with a partner or re-marries,
or once entitlement to Child Benefit ends.
Widowed Mother’s Allowance is a
benefit for mothers who were widowed before
April 2001, and it is paid on terms similar to
those for Widowed Parent’s Allowance.
Bereavement Allowance is a taxable
benefit of £72.50 a week payable to widows
and widowers without dependent children,
who are 55 or over when their spouse dies. It
is payable for 52 weeks following the date of
widowhood. A percentage of the full rate is
payable to widows and widowers who are aged
between 45 and 54. Entitlement to this benefit
is dependent on the NI contributions of the
spouse, and it ceases after 52 weeks of the date
of widowhood or if the widow or widow er
moves in w ith a partner, or re-marries before
the 52-week date has been reached.
Widow’s Pension is a taxable weekly
benefit of £72.50 payable to a woman who was
widowed before April 2001, and was 55 or
over when her husband died or when her
entitlement to Widowed Mother’s Allowance
ends due to her entitlement to Child Benefit
ceasing. A percentage of the full rate is payable
to a widow aged between 45 and 54 when her
husband dies, or when her entitlement to
\\ idowed Mother’s Allowance ends due to her
entitlement to Child Benefit ceasing. Special
rules apply for widows whose husbands died
before April 1988. Entitlement continues
unless the widow moves in with a partner or
re-marries or until she begins to draw
Retirement Pension.
179
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Sickness and Disablement
A variety of benefits are available for people
unable to work because of sickness or
disablement. Employers are responsible for
paying Statutory Sick Pay to employees
from the fourth day of sickness for up to a
maximum of 28 weeks. There is a single rate
of Statutory Sick Pay for all qualifying
employees provided their average gross weekly
earnings are at least £12 a week. The weekly
rate is £62.20.
Incapacity Benefit is also for people who
become incapable of work. Entitlement to
Incapacity Benefit begins when entitlement to
Statutory Sick Pay ends or, for those who do
not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, from the
fourth day of sickness. There are three types:
> short-term benefit for people under
pension age—a lower rate of £52.60 a
week for the first 28 weeks; and a higher
rate of £62.20 a week between the 29th
and 52nd week;
> short-term benefit for people over
pension age—lower rate of £66.90; and a
higher rate of £69.75; and
> long-term benefit rate of £69.75 a week
(after 52 weeks of incapacity).
Extra benefits may be paid for dependent
adults and children. Incapacity Benefit is
taxable from the 29th week of incapacity.
The medical test of incapacity for work
usually applies after 28 w eeks’ sickness. It
assesses ability to perform a range of work-
related activities rather than the ability to
perform a specific job.
Severe Disablement Allowance is a tax-
free benefit for people who have not been able
to work for at least 28 weeks because of illness
or disability but who cannot get Incapacity
Benefit because they have not paid enough NI
contributions. The benefit is £42.15 a week,
plus additions of up to £14.65 depending on
the person’s age when they became incapable
of work. Additions for adult dependants and
for children may also be paid. Claims may be
made by people aged between 16 and 65.
Once a person has qualified for the allowance,
there is no upper age limit for receipt. New
claimants must satisfy the same incapacity
test as that used in Incapacity Benefit.
People who become incapable of work after
their 20th birthday must also be medically
assessed as at least 80% disabled for a
minimum of 28 weeks. People already in
receipt of certain benefits, such as the higher
rate of the Disability Living Allow ance care
component (see below), will automatically be
accepted as 80% disabled.
In April 2001, Severe Disablement
Allowance was abolished for new claims.
People under 20, or 25 if they were in
education or training before reaching 20, may
now be able to receive Incapacity Benefit
without having to satisfy the contributions
conditions.
Other Benefits
Disability Living Allowance is a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit to help severely
disabled people aged under 65 with extra costs
incurred as a result of disability. Entitlement
is measured in terms of personal care and/or
mobility needs. There are two components: a
care component which has three weekly
rates—£55.30, £37.00 and £14.65; and a
mobility component which has tw o weekly
rates—£38.65 and £14.65. The higher rate is
payable from age three and above; the low er
rate is payable from age five and above.
Attendance Allowance is a non¬
contributory tax-free benefit to provide
financial help to severely disabled people aged
65 or older with extra costs incurred as a result
of disability. It is measured in terms of
personal care needs by day and/or night. 1 he
two rates are £55.30 and £37.00.
A non-contributory Invalid Care
Allowance (ICA) of £41.75 weekly may be
payable to people between 16 and 65 at the time
of claim who have given up the opportunity of a
full-time paid job because they are providing
regular and substantial care of at least 35 hours
a week, to a severely disabled person in receipt
of either Attendance Allow ance or the higher or
middle care component of Disability Living
Allowance. ICA is taken fully into account
when calculating entitlement to Income
Support, income-based JSA, Housing Benefit
and Council Tax Benefit, as it is an earnings
replacement benefit. Carers do, however,
receive the carer premium, which is intended to
180
12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
focus help on those who have lost the
opportunity to gain income from work because
of caring, and who do not gain from receipt of
ICA.
Disabled Person’s Tax Credit (DPTC)
provides support to people with disabilities
who work. DPTC structure is similar to that
of the WFTC (see p. 178). Some of the
individual tax credit amounts are set at
different levels and applicants do not have to
have dependent children to qualify.
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit
\ arious benefits are payable for disablement
caused by an accident at work or a prescribed
disease caused by a particular type of
employment. The main benefit is the tax-free
Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit:
UP t0 £112.90 a week is usually paid after a
qualifying period of 15 weeks if a person is at
least 14% or more physically or mentally
disabled as a result of an industrial accident or
a prescribed disease.
Basic Disablement Benefit can be paid in
addition to other NI benefits, such as
Incapacity Benefit. It can be paid whether or
not the person returns to work and does not
depend on earnings. The degree of
disablement is assessed by an independent
medical authority and the amount paid
depends on the extent of the disablement and
on how long it is expected to last. Except for
certain progressive respiratory diseases,
disablement of less than 14% does not attract
Disablement Benefit. In certain circumstances
additional allowances may be payable.
Housing and Council Tax Benefits
Housing Benefit is an income-related, tax-
free benefit which helps people on low
incomes meet the cost of rented
accommodation. The amount paid depends on
personal circumstances, income, savings, rent
and other people sharing the home. It also
normally depends on the general level of rents
for properties with the same number of rooms
in the locality.
Most single people under 25 years old who
are not lone parents and who are renting
privately have their Housing Benefit limited to
the average cost of a single non-self-contained
room (that is, with shared use of kitchen and
toilet facilities) in the locality.
Council Tax Benefit helps people to
meet their council tax payments (the tax set by
local councils to help pay for services—see
p. 70). The scheme offers help to those
claiming Income Support and income-based
Jobseeker’s Allowance and others with low
incomes. It is subject to rules broadlv similar
to those governing the provision of Housing
Benefit (see above). A person who is solely
liable for the council tax may also claim
benefit for a second adult who is not liable to
pay the council tax and who is living in the
home on a non-commercial basis. In Northern
Ireland, where council tax does not apply,
people on low incomes may get help to pay for
their domestic rates from a means-tested
housing benefits scheme.
War Pensions and Related Services
Pensions are payable for disablement as a result
of service in the armed forces or for certain
injuries received in the merchant navy or civil
defence during wartime, or to civilians injured
by enemy action. The amount paid depends on
the degree of disablement: the pension for
100% disablement for an officer is £6,251 a
year; for other ranks it is £119.80 a week.
There are a number of extra allowances.
The main ones are for unemployability,
restricted mobility, the need for care and
attendance, the provision of extra comforts,
and as maintenance for a lowered standard of
occupation. An age allowance of between
£8.00 and £24.70 is payable weekly to war
pensioners aged 65 or over whose disablement
is assessed at 40% or more.
Pensions are also paid to war widows and
other dependants. (The standard rate of
pension for a private soldier’s widow is £90.45
a week.) \\ ar W idow’s Pension is also payable
to a former war widow who has remarried and
then become widowed again, divorced or
legally separated.
The War Pensioners’ Welfare Service helps
and advises war pensioners, war widows and
other dependants. It works with ex-Service
organisations and other voluntary bodies
181
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
which give financial and personal support to
those disabled or bereaved as a result of war.
Concessions
Other benefits for which unemployed people
and those on low incomes may be eligible
include exemption from health service charges
(see p. 192), vouchers towards the cost of
spectacles (see p. 193), publicly funded legal
help (see p. 235) and free school meals for
their children. People on low incomes,
pensioners, widows and long-term sick people
on Incapacity Benefit, receive extra help to
meet the cost of VAT (value added tax) on
their fuel bills.
Reduced charges are often made to
unemployed people, for example, for adult
education and entry into exhibitions, and
pensioners are usually entitled to reduced
transport fares. Since November 2000,
pensioners aged 75 and over have no longer
been required to pay for their television licence.
Taxation
The general rule is that benefits which replace
lost earnings are subject to tax, while those
intended to meet a specific need are not (see
Table 12.6). Various income tax reliefs and
exemptions are allowed on account of age or a
need to support dependants.
Benefit Controls on People from
Abroad
Residence Test
All claimants must be habitually resident in
the Common Travel Area (that is, the UK, the
Irish Republic, the Channel Islands or the Isle
of Man) before a claim for Income Support,
income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Housing
Benefit or Council Tax Benefit can be paid.
This in line with most other European
countries, which also limit access to their
benefit systems to those who have lived in the
country for some time.
Asylum Seekers
Generally only people who claim refugee
status as soon as they arrive in the UK can
claim income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance,
Income Support, Housing Benefit and
Council Tax Benefit. Their eligibility to
receive these will stop if their asylum claim is
refused by the Home Office. The Immigration
and Asylum Act 1999 (see p. 112), among
other things, replaced cash benefits for asylum
seekers with a voucher system.

12: SOCIAL PROTECTION
ARRANGEMENTS AND
COMPARISONS WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES
As part of the European Union’s efforts to
promote the free movement of labour,
regulations provide for equality of treatment
and the protection of benefit rights for people
who move between member states. The
regulations also cover retirement pensioners
and other beneficiaries who have been
employed, or self-employed, as well as
dependants. Benefits covered include Child
Benefit and those for sickness and maternity,
unemployment, retirement, invalidity,
accidents at work and occupational diseases.
The UK has reciprocal social security
agreements w ith a number of other countries
which also provide cover for some NI benefits
and family benefits.
A comparison of the expenditure on social
protection benefits per head for the 15 EU
countries indicates that, in general, spending is
much higher in the more northerly countries
than in the south. Luxembourg spent the most
per head in 1998; at just over £6,500 this w as
over three times the amount spent by Portugal,
the country which spent the least. The UK
spent around £4,000 per head of population,
just below' the average for the EU.

Strategies for dealing with health problems and improving healthcare services
have been published for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They
contain many common elements, such as commitments to reduce avoidable ill-
health, with particular emphasis on cancer, heart disease and mental health,
improving clinical performance through a more integrated and inclusive
network of local health provision, and tackling the various health inequalities
which exist across the United Kingdom.
The State of Public Health
Overall mortality declined in the 20th century;
this is generally regarded as a result of a
number of major social and economic trends,
including an increase in real incomes,
improvements in nutrition and housing,
higher levels of education, improved health
services, and developments in medicines and
their wider availability to the population.
Life Expectancy
Life expectancy provides a useful summary
measure of mortality. Since the middle of the
19th century the expectation of life at birth for
both females and males has almost doubled.
Neither women nor men born in England and
Wales in 1841 had an average life expectancy
from birth much beyond 40, mainly because of
high infant and child mortality; by 1998 the
life expectancy at birth for females in Great
Britain had reached almost 80, and for males
nearly 75 years. However, life expectancy
takes no account of quality of life. Healthy life
expectancy, on the other hand, combines
mortality and morbidity data into a single
index. Healthy life expectancy at birth,
defined as life expectancy in good or fairly
good self-perceived general health, increased
from 64.4 years to 66.9 years between 1981
and 1997 for males, and for females from
66.7 to 68.7 years.
Cancer
About a third of the population develop cancer
at some time in their lives. Over the 20th
184
13: HEALTH
century cancer has become more prominent as
a cause of death when compared with other
major causes. While death rates from some
other major types of illness have fallen
considerably, those from cancer have not done
so to the same extent. By 1999 cancer was
responsible for around a quarter of deaths
among males in Great Britain and about a fifth
of female deaths, compared with a tenth and a
sixth respectively in 1911. However, despite
the greater prominence of cancer deaths in the
latter half of the 20th century, the death rates
have declined since the 1980s. The particular
cancers which people are diagnosed with have
changed over the last 20 years. The incidence
of breast and prostate cancer has risen
considerably since 1981, partly because
increased awareness and screening have led to
earlier diagnosis, while lung cancer among
males has fallen dramatically, mainly because
fewer men now smoke. In 1981 there were 112
new cases of lung cancer per 100,000 males,
but the rate had fallen to around 80 by the
mid-1990s.
Coronary Heart Disease
The Lnited Kingdom has one of the highest
premature death rates from circulatory disease
(which includes heart disease and strokes) in
Europe. Coronary heart disease (CHD) killed
around 132,000 people in the UK in 1999.
However, death rates from coronary heart
disease for both males and females under 65
fell steadily between 1979 and 1999, from 139
to 56 per 100,000 males and from 39 to 16 per
100,000 females. Among patients of all ages in
1998 in England and Wales, 37 per 1,000
males and 22 per 1,000 females were treated
for coronary heart disease. These figures
represent a rise over the past few years.
Mental Health
Mental ill-health is also a major cause of
disability and mortality. In 1999-2000, there
were 2.1 million attendances at National
Health Service (NHS) outpatient facilities for
psychiatric specialties in England, 282,000 of
which were new attendances.
Communicable Diseases
Although communicable (or infectious)
diseases were the cause of less than 1% of
deaths in England and Wales in 1999, they are
still a public health concern, especially as the
occurrence of some diseases is rising. In the 40
years up to 1987, the number of notifications
of tuberculosis (TB) in England and Wales fell
considerably. However, over the next 13 years
they increased by 34%, so that in 2000 there
were around 6,800 notifications. The rise has
been particularly noticeable in London and
among young men.
Another communicable disease which has
risen in prominence comparatively recently is
the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV).
The UK has a relatively low prevalence of
HIV as a result of public education and health
campaigns. The use of combination drug
therapy to delay disease progression has
helped HIV-related deaths fall during the
second half of the 1990s. However, the
number of people diagnosed with HIV each
year is rising: in 1999 there were more new
diagnoses of HI\ than in any year previously,
at around 2,900. There are now 20,800 people
living with HIV in England and Wales, and
this is expected to rise to 29,000 by the end of
2003.
Substance Misuse
Alcohol
I he consumption of alcohol in excessive
amounts can lead to ill health, and an
increased likelihood of problems such as high
blood pressure, cancer and cirrhosis of the
liver. The current Department of Health
(DH) advice on alcohol is that consumption of
between three and four units1 a day for men
and two to three units a day for women w ill
not lead to significant health risks, but
consistently drinking four or more units a day
for men, and three units or more for wromen,
is not advised because of the progressive
health risks. In 1998—99, around two-fifths of
1 A unit of alcohol is 8 grams by weight or 10 millilitres (ml) by
volume of pure alcohol. This is the amount contained in half a
pint of ordinary strength beer or lager, a single measure of pub
spirits ('/6 gill or 25 ml), one glass of ordinary wine and a small
pub measure of sherry or other fortified wine.

men aged 16 and over and a fifth of women
aged 16 and over in the United Kingdom had
exceeded the recommended amount of alcohol
on their heaviest drinking day in the week
prior to being interviewed (see Table 13.1).
However, the proportions for 16 to 24 year
olds were much higher, with half of young
men having consumed more than four units
and two-fifths of young women having
consumed more than three units.
Smoking
More cancer deaths in the United Kingdom
can be attributed to smoking tobacco than to
any other single risk factor. The then Health
Education Authority estimated that smoking
was the direct cause of 120,000 deaths in 1995.
The proportion of people who smoked fell
steadily through the 1970s and 1980s. The gap
between males and females has narrowed: in
1974, 51% of males aged 16 and over and 41%
of females of the same age smoked in Great
Britain, compared with 28% and 26%
respectively in 1998-99.
The prevalence of smoking also varies by
social class. For both men and women, the
proportion of smokers is higher among those
in the manual socio-economic groups than
among those in the non-manual groups. Just
over a quarter of people aged 16 and over in
the United Kingdom were smokers in
1998-99, but while only 13% of male
professionals and 14% of female professionals
smoked, almost half of unskilled males and a
third of unskilled females did so. Smoking
during pregnancy can have harmful effects on
the health of the child. Between 1985 and 1995
the proportion of women who smoked during
pregnancy in the United Kingdom fell from
30% to 24%.
Drugs
Findings from the 1998 British Crime Survey
indicate that about 500,000 of 16 to 24 year olds
in England and Wales had used Class A drugs2
in the previous 12 months, and about 200,000
in that age group had done so during the last
month. These figures represent 8% and 3% of
16 to 24 year olds respectively. Young people
are more likely than older people to misuse
drugs. The most commonly used illegal drug in
1998 among both young men and young
women was cannabis, which had been used by
more than a quarter of young people aged 16 to
24 in England and Wales in the previous year.
Along with age, lifestyles are a good indicator of
likely drug use. In particular, young people
who go out more than three times a week, those
who visit pubs and bars and those who go to
nightclubs are all much more likely to use
drugs than other young people. The use of
more harmful drugs, such as heroin and crack,
appears to be associated more with those living
in relatively deprived areas.
2 Heroin, cocaine (both cocaine powder and ‘crack’), ecstasy,
magic mushrooms, LSD and unprescribed use of methadone.

13: HEALTH
Health Inequalities
In July 2000, the Government gave a
commitment in the NHS Plan (see p. 188)
that, for the first time ever in England, local
targets for reducing health inequalities would
be reinforced by the creation of national health
inequalities targets:
^ starting with children under one year, by
2010 to reduce by at least 10% the gap in
mortality between manual groups and the
population as a whole; and
> by 2010 to reduce by at least 10% the gap
between the fifth of areas with the lowest
life expectancy at birth and the
population as a whole.
These two targets address health
inequalities for the more disadvantaged groups
in the community, since they die sooner and
suffer more illness in their lives. The national
health inequalities targets will be delivered by
a combination of specific health and broader
government policies. Action on the priority
areas, such as cancer, CHD and stroke and
mental health, will help to reduce inequalities,
as all of these have high prevalence in lower
socio-economic groups.
Smoking reduction will be a significant
factor in the achievement of both the national
inequalities targets. They are therefore
supported by the government target to reduce
smoking rates among manual groups from
32% in 1998 to 26% by 2010.
Reducing inequalities in health is a priority
for the National Assembly for Wales. It has
launched an Inequalities in Health Fund to
stimulate and support new action to address
health inequalities and the factors that cause
them, including inequities in access to health
services. Fifty-four projects lasting for up to
three years were announced in July 2000 and
will result in new local action in deprived
communities across Wales.
The Scottish Executive has appointed a
Health and Homelessness Coordinator,
responsible for working with Primary Care
Trusts (see p. 189) and NHS Boards (see
p. 190) to develop strategies to tackle the
health needs of Scotland’s homeless people.
The National Health
Service
The body responsible for public health in the
UK is the National Health Service (NHS).

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The NHS is founded on the principle of
providing a universal service to all its resident
population, based upon need rather than
ability to pay. The services are intended to
provide treatment and care where necessary
while making the best use of the resources
available. All taxpayers, employers and
employees contribute to the cost so that
members of the community who do not
require healthcare help to pay for those who
do. Most forms of treatment are provided free,
but others incur a charge, such as prescription
drugs and eye tests.
The Department of Health (DH) is
responsible for national strategic planning in
England and for developing and implementing
policies for the provision of health services.
The National Assembly for Wales, the
Scottish Executive Health Department and
the Department of Health, Social Services and
Public Safety in Northern Ireland have similar
responsibilities for health provision in their
respective countries.
ENGLAND
The Government’s strategy for healthcare in
England was set out in the NHS Plan,
published in July 2000. The plan sets out a
programme of reform and investment that is
intended to tackle the systemic problems that
have affected the NHS.
Key to the principles laid down in the NHS
Plan are modernisation and improvement. In
April 2001 the Modernisation Agency was
launched, with a brief to take a lead role in
modernising the NHS by helping local
clinicians and managers redesign services
around the needs of patients. The
Commission for Health Improvement (CHI)
now provides independent advice and
expertise to the NHS on developing and
improving the quality of NHS services. The
CHI also has an inspection role: every NHS
organisation is to be inspected every four
years. Those that perform well are given more
freedom to run their own affairs, and obtain
access to extra funds. Those which fail receive
intensive support from the Modernisation
Agency and NHS regional offices, and could
have their responsibilities removed.
The NHS Plan includes a number of targets
for the NHS to achieve by 2004. Among these
are:
> patients to be able to see a GP within 48
hours;
> hospital consultants, currently working
only in hospitals, to deliver
approximately 4 million outpatient
consultations a year in primary care and
community settings;
> GPs to be able to refer patients to around
1,000 GPs with a special interest, for
example in ophthalmology, orthopaedics,
dermatology and ear, nose and throat
surgery, instead of referring them to
hospital; and
> waiting time in accident and emergency
departments in hospitals to fall to 1 hour
15 minutes on average.
Targets to be met by the NHS by the end of
2005 include:
> the replacement of waiting lists for
appointments and admission by booking
systems (see p. 200);
> a reduction in the maximum waiting time
for a routine outpatient appointment
from six to three months; and
> a reduction in the maximum waiting time
for inpatient treatment from 18 to six
months.
The National Institute for Clinical
Excellence (NICE) was established in 1999 to
develop national standards for best practice in
clinical care within the NHS in England and
Wales. This includes drawing up new
guidelines based on clinical and cost
effectiveness and ensuring that they apply to
all parts of the NHS. The Institute’s
membership is drawn from the health
professions, the NHS, academics, health
economists and patients. It appraises new
drugs and technologies and produces clinical
guidelines. In 2000, its first full year of
operation, NICE issued 16 appraisals of new
technologies. (Details of some of these
appraisals can be found elsewhere in the
chapter.)
The Government sees the local management
of healthcare as important in reducing health
188
13: HEALTH
inequalities. There are 99 health authorities in
England responsible for identifying the
healthcare needs of the people living in their
areas. They secure hospital and community
health services and arrange for the provision
of services by family doctors, dentists,
pharmacists and opticians, as well as
administering their contracts. Health
authorities now have a duty to prepare health
improvement programmes, and to work with
Primary Care Groups (PCGs), Primary Care
Trusts (PCTs) and NHS Trusts to achieve
the targets set out in them.
In 2000 the first Primary Care Trusts were
established, and by April 2001 there were 164
in total. They bring together medical and
social care professionals with other
organisations and agencies, to shape local
health and social care services. PCTs have
taken over many functions formerly
performed by health authorities; they can also
provide some community health services
directly.
Primary Care Groups, which are smaller
than Primary Care Trusts, were established in
1999. They control about two-thirds of local
NHS budgets and are responsible for
commissioning services for their local
communities. PCGs are accountable to local
health authorities. They are the bodies which
enable control of the nature of services to be
held by GPs, community nurses, other health
professionals, managers, social services, health
authorities and NHS Trusts.
The actual provision of healthcare at a local
level is carried out by NHS Trusts. These
existed prior to the Primary Care Groups and
Trusts, but they now carry out healthcare
according to local long-term service
agreements with the Primary Care Groups
and Trusts. Each NHS Trust has autonomy
over recruitment, pay, research and training,
and publishes details of its performance,
including the cost of treatments and services.
Patient opinion and involvement have been
given greater emphasis by the Health and
Social Care Act 2001. Under the Act, NHS
bodies have a duty to make arrangements with
a view to ensuring that the public are
consulted and involved in planning and
decisions about local health services. The Act
also provides for local authority overview and
scrutiny committees (established under the
Local Government Act 2000) to examine the
health service in their area.
Responsibility for health education lies with
separate NHS authorities working alongside
the national health departments. In England
the former Health Education Authority was
succeeded in April 2000 by two new bodies:
the Health Development Agency (HDA) and
Health Promotion England.
The HDA is a special health authority,
working to improve the health of people and
communities in England, and in particular to
reduce health inequalities. In partnership with
others, it gathers evidence of what works,
advises on standards and develops the skills of
all those working to improve health.
Health Promotion England runs national
campaigns on a number of subjects, including
childhood immunisation, drugs, alcohol and
sexual health. In addition, almost all NHS
health authorities have their own health
education service, which works closely with
health professionals, health visitors, community
groups, local employers and others to
determine the most suitable local programmes.
WALES
In Wales, the operation of the NHS is the
responsibility of the National Assembly for
Wales (NAW). In January 2001 it published
Improving Health in Wales—A Plan for the
NHS with its Partners. The document
describes the Assembly’s programme over the
next ten years.
1 he Assembly has the power to make
changes to the structure of the NHS in Wales.
By April 2003, the Assembly will abolish the
five health authorities in Wales and put in place
a new structure, with changes at two levels:
^ at a local level, Local Health Groups will
be developed into Local Health Boards
and their role strengthened—they will
take on new responsibilities for
commissioning, securing and delivering
healthcare in their localities; and
a national level, the National Assembly
will hold both Local Health Boards and
NHS Trusts fully accountable for the
services they provide and commission.
189
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Effective partnership working is an
important theme of the Welsh Plan. At a
national level, a Health and Well-being
Partnership Council will be established,
chaired by the Health and Social Services
Minister. The Council will bring together key
personnel from the NHS, local government,
the voluntary and independent sectors, staff
and professional groups, and patients’
representatives to ensure the direction and
leadership of the new agenda for health and
well-being. The council will be supported by a
network of similar partnerships at a local level.
Since devolution, the NAW also has some
control over the finances of the NHS in Wales,
and in February 2001 it announced additional
investment, so that by 2003—04 health
expenditure will be £3.6 billion, an increase of
£1 billion on 1999-2000. Much of this new
investment is to be directed towards tackling
the priorities outlined in Improving Health in
Wales', coronary heart disease, cancer services,
mental health services, intensive care, primary
and community care, children’s services and
local priorities in Health Improvement
Programmes. Other areas targeted are
integrated working methods to address waiting
lists and waiting times, pressures on
admissions, human resource development for
the NHS workforce, and the establishment
of a new Inequalities in Health Fund.
SCOTLAND
The Scottish Executive Health Department is
an integrated body, responsible both for the
executive leadership of NHSScotland and for
the development and implementation of
health and community care policy. The
Health Department works with NHSScotland
bodies:
> to improve, protect and monitor the
health of the people of Scotland;
> to develop and deliver modern primary
care and community care services; and
> to provide modern, high-quality,
responsive hospital and specialist
services.
Prior to devolution in 1999, healthcare in
Scotland was already distinct from healthcare
in England and Wales in many ways, and in
December 2000 the Scottish Executive Health
Department published the Scottish Health
Plan—Our National Health: A plan for action,
a plan for change—which described its
priorities. These are to:
> improve Scotland’s health, and narrow
the health gap between rich and poor;
> set national standards of care to be
delivered locally across Scotland;
> improve patients’ practical access to
health services;
> give patients and communities a voice in
the way the NHS is run;
> provide better care for the young, and for
older people;
> tackle coronary heart disease, cancer and
poor mental health; and
> change the ways in which the NHS
works with its staff so as to improve care
and standards.
To underpin these aims, the Scottish
Executive’s core spending on health will rise
from £4.9 billion in 2001—02 to £6.7 billion in
2003-04—this represents approximately one-
third of the devolved Scottish budget. In
addition, a new way of sharing NHS funds
across Scotland—the ‘Arbuthnott formula’—
is now in place to address relative healthcare
needs, including those caused by deprivation.
In September 2001, the decision-making
powers of the 15 Health Boards and 28 NHS
Trusts are being brought together in 15 new
unified NHS Boards, each of which will be
responsible for all NHS services in its area.
The introduction of the new NHS Boards will
ensure that national clinical and service
standards are delivered in all parts of Scotland
by unified local systems of care.
The 15 NHS Boards and 32 local authorities
will be expected to work together to
strengthen the localised focus of health
provision, and every local authority will have a
seat on its principal NHS Board. Acute
services and primary care will continue to be
delivered through NHS Trusts, although the
Island Boards will remain as integrated
structures with no separate Trusts. Other
NHS bodies, such as the Scottish Ambulance
Service, the Health Education Board for
190
13: HEALTH
Scotland and the Clinical Standards Board for
Scotland, provide services on a national basis.
One of the priorities for the new NHS Boards
is involving people and communities. The
Scottish Executive is investing £14 million in
improving NHSScotland’s ability to
communicate with, listen to and work with
patients. One such initiative is the Patients’
Project, a systematic assessment of patient
information which intends to capture and
disseminate best practice and to act as a
national source of patient information and
advice. NHS Boards will be required to show
how they are involving the public, and how this
has affected the provision of services. Local
Health Councils also provide a voice for the
local public in each area.
The Scottish Health Plan includes the same
clinical priorities as the NHS Plan for
England: CHD, cancer and poor mental
health. In July 2001, the Scottish Executive
published Cancer in Scotland: Action for
Change, a comprehensive cancer plan for
Scotland. The Scottish CHD Task Force is
due to report in autumn 2001 and the
Framework for Mental Health, published in
1997, is in its implementation phase. Specific
targets have also been set, including:
by 2002, the maximum wait for
angiography (radiographic examination
of arteries and veins) will be 12 weeks
from the time of seeing a specialist;
** by 2002, the maximum wait for surgery
or angioplasty (a treatment for CHD)
will be 24 weeks from the time of
angiography;
> by October 2001, women who have
breast cancer and are referred for urgent
treatment will begin that treatment
within one month of diagnosis, where
clinically appropriate; and
by 2005, the maximum wait from urgent
referral to treatment for all cancers will
be two months.
The Health Technology Board for Scotland
was established in April 2000 and acts as a
single source of national advice on the most
clinically and cost-effective health
technologies, playing a similar role to NICE in
England and Wales (see p. 188).
A new' service, NHS24, is also planned.
Similar to NHS Direct in England (see
p. 196), it is due to be introduced in Scotland
from April 2002 onwards.
NORTHERN IRELAND
Northern Ireland also has a new' public health
strategy. Investing for Health was released for
consultation in November 2000 and was
finalised by the Northern Ireland Executive in
2001. It is focusing on avoidable chronic
sickness and disability, and inequalities in the
health of different groups in the population.
Northern Ireland’s equivalent bodies to
health authorities are the four health and
social services boards. They are responsible
for identifying the healthcare needs of the
people in their area, securing hospital and
community health services, providing primary
care services, and administering contracts.
The boards will play a major role in the
implementation of Investing for Health. They
are each responsible for establishing an
‘Investing for Health Partnership’ between
the main public, voluntary and community
interests which have a contribution to make in
their area, and producing ‘Health and Well¬
being Investment Plans’.
The Health Promotion Agency is
responsible for providing a statutory regional
focus for health promotion in Northern
Ireland, and it plays a key role in identifying
needs and in developing and implementing
programmes designed to promote health and
prevent ill-health. It coordinates regional
health promotion activities throughout
Northern Ireland, undertakes public education
campaigns, evaluates and disseminates research
findings, provides training and works w ith the
wider health and personal social services and
other bodies in helping to implement the
Government’s public health policies.
One of the w ider impacts of the Belfast
(Good Friday) Agreement in 1999 (see
p. 16) was the setting up of bodies for cross-
border cooperation between Northern Ireland
and the Irish Republic. Cooperation on health
matters was identified as an area suitable for
consideration by the North/South Ministerial
Council, and Joint Working Groups have been
191
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
set up in five areas: accident and emergency
services, emergency planning, high technology
equipment, cancer research and health
promotion. These groups are looking in detail
at where cooperation can yield the greatest
benefit for people in both Northern Ireland
and the Irish Republic. Joint ventures have
included the production of an all-Ireland
cancer incidence report, a folic acid
advertising campaign, promotion of physical
fitness, training and research initiatives, and
preliminary work to establish plans and
protocols for dealing with major incidents.
ADMINISTRATION
Finance
The NHS is financed mainly through general
taxation, along with an element of National
Insurance contributions (see chapter 12) paid
by employed people, their employers and self-
employed people. In 2000-01 an estimated
80.4% of the NHS was financed through
general taxation, with 12.1% from National
Insurance contributions and 7.4% from
charges and other receipts.
The Government’s Expenditure Plans,
published in May 2001, detailed the funding
strategy for the NHS in England. Planned
expenditure (net of receipts) by the DH has
been set at around £49.8 billion in 2001-02,
£54.7 billion in 2002-03, and £59.2 billion in
2003-04. Capital investment is also set to rise,
to £3.1 billion in 2001-02, £3.4 billion in
2002-03, and £3.6 billion in 2003-04. Core
spending on health by the Scottish Executive
will rise from £5.9 billion in 2001-02 to £6.7
billion in 2003-04. Capital spending on
NHSScotland buildings and equipment will
rise to £312 million by 2003-04, more than
double the amount spent in 1997.
Health authorities may raise funds from
other, non-government, sources. For example,
some hospitals increase revenue by taking
private patients, who pay the full cost of their
accommodation and treatment. They can also
use private finance for NHS capital projects,
under the Private Finance Initiative. This is a
scheme which aims to promote commercial
partnership between the public and private
sectors (see p. 403). In the context of the

NHS, it involves new facilities being designed,
built, maintained and owned by the private
sector, which then leases them back to the
NHS. The NHS retains control of key
planning and clinical decisions. In addition,
the National Lottery’s New Opportunities
Fund provides funding for health, education
and the environment.
Charges
Around 552 million prescription items, worth
around £5.6 billion, were dispensed in
England in 2000, an increase of 6.0% in real
terms since 1995. The proportion of items
provided free of charge was 85% in 2000, a
rise of 1% since 1995. The following groups
are exempt from prescription charges: people
aged 60 and over; children under 16 and
people aged under 19 who are in full-time
education; women who are pregnant or have
given birth in the previous 12 months; and
people with certain medical conditions. In
addition, people who receive (or whose
192
13: HEALTH
partners receive) certain social security
benefits (see chapter 12), or who otherwise
qualify on low income grounds, do not pay
prescription charges. In 2000, 54% of all
prescription items dispensed by community
pharmacies and appliance contractors in
England were for elderly people, compared
with 45% five years earlier. War pensioners (if
not otherwise entitled to free prescriptions)
get free prescriptions for treatment of their
pensionable disability, and they may receive
refunds of the costs of sight tests, glasses or
contact lenses and dental treatment.
Prescription charges and exemptions in Wales
are now different from those in England.
There are charges for most types of NHS
dental treatment, including examinations.
However, the following people are entitled to
free treatment: women who begin a course of
treatment while pregnant or within 12 months
of having a baby; children under 18; full-time
students under 19; and adults on low incomes
or receiving the same benefits or tax credits as
for free prescriptions.
Free NHS sight tests are available for
people aged 60 and over, children, full-time
students under the age of 19, adults on low
incomes or receiving the same benefits or tax
credits as for free prescriptions, and people
who have, or are at particular risk of, eye
disease. Over 10 million sight tests were paid
for by health authorities in England and Wales
in the year to 31 March 2001.
NHS Workforce
The NHS is one of the largest employers in
the world, with a workforce of nearly 1 million
people. In 1999 there were the equivalent of
943,000 whole-time direct care employees in
NHS hospital and community health services
in Great Britain.
For the most part, family practitioners
(GPs, dentists, optometrists and community
pharmacists) are either self-employed or (in
the case of pharmacists and optometrists) are
employed by independent businesses. They,
or their companies, agree to provide services
on the NHS’s behalf, and are paid by health
authorities for doing so.
By 2005, the Government intends the
number of places in medical schools in
England to have risen to 5,894, compared with
3,749 in October 1997. It has set NHS Plan
targets to increase the number of GPs by at
least 2,000, the number of consultants by
7,500 and the number of nurses by 20,000
between 1999 and 2004. In the first year of the
NHS Plan period (September 1999 to
September 2000) there were 6,300 more
nurses, 1,100 more consultants and 126 more
GPs. By 2003, the Scottish Executive intends
to have invested an additional £11.5 million to
recruit 375 extra junior doctors.
Doctors and Dentists
Only people on the medical or dentists’
registers may practise as doctors or dentists in
the NHS. University medical and dental
schools are responsible for undergraduate
teaching, and the NHS provides hospital and
community facilities for training.
Full registration as a doctor requires five or
six years’ training in a medical school, in a
hospital and in the community, with a further
year’s hospital experience. Most GPs are paid
by a system of fees and allowances designed to
reflect responsibilities, workload and practice
expenses. The regulating body for the medical
profession in the UK is the General Medical
In the 2001 Budget, new initiatives costing
£835 million over three vears were
announced, aimed at recruiting more NHS
staff in England, particularly GPs and
nurses. These included:
^ a £5,000 ‘golden hello’ to every new
GP who joins the NHS;
> a scheme to encourage GPs to return
to the NHS;
> a £10,000 payment to GPs who wait
until the age of 65 before retiring
from the NHS;
> extra payment to GPs who work in
deprived areas;
> a 10.4% rise in bursaries for student
nurses, midwives and therapists; and
> funding for 50 new NHS workplace
nurseries.

Council (GMC), and the main professional
association is the British Medical Association.
As a result of high-profile cases, such as that
of Harold Shipman,2 clinical governance has
become an increasing concern. From 2001 all
doctors are being appraised annually, and the
GMC plans to revalidate doctors regularly to
ensure that they keep their professional
practice up to date. A National Clinical
Assessment Authority was established in April
2001, to provide a rapid objective assessment
of a doctor’s performance where necessary.
For a dentist, five years’ training at a dental
school and satisfactory completion of one
year’s mandatory vocational training are
required before permission is granted to work
as a principal in the General Dental Services
of the NHS. All general dental practitioners
are paid by a combination of capitation fees for
children registered with the practice,
continuing care payments for adults
registered, and a prescribed scale of fees for
individual treatments. The regulating body for
the dental profession in the UK is the General
Dental Council, and the main professional
association is the British Dental Association.
Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors
The majority of nursing students undertake
the pre-registration Diploma in Higher
Education programme, which emphasises
health promotion as well as care of the sick
and enables students to work either in
hospitals or in the community. The
programme lasts three years and consists of
periods of university study combined with
practical experience in hospital and in the
community. In addition, there are now over 60
cadet schemes in England, encompassing over
800 people. They offer a non-academic route
into professional training by combining work
experience with theoretical learning, leading
to achievement of qualifications sufficient to
meet entry requirements to a pre-registration
programme, usually a National Vocational
Qualification (NVQ). The Government
intends to expand the scheme to cover at least
2,000 people over the next three years.
2 In January 2000, a Manchester GP, Harold Shipman, was
convicted of murdering 15 elderly patients.
Between 1997 and 1999, the number of
qualified nurses in the NHS increased by
more than 10,000.
Midwifery education programmes for
registered general/adult nurses take 18
months, but the direct entry programme lasts
three years. Health visitors are registered adult
nurses who have a further specialist
qualification in health visiting. District nurses
are registered adult nurses who have a further
specialist qualification in district nursing and
care for clients in the community. By 2005,
the Government aims to raise the number of
midwives by 2,000.
The United Kingdom Central Council for
Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting is
responsible for regulating and registering
these professions. Four National Boards—for
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland—are responsible for ensuring that
training courses meet Central Council
requirements as to their type, content and
standard. The Government intends to replace
all of these bodies with a single regulatory
body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council,
which will be more responsive to patients’
needs. This body was set up in shadow form
in May 2001, and is expected to be established
formally from April 2002.
Pharmacists
Only people on the register of pharmaceutical
chemists may practise as pharmacists.
Registration requires four years’ training in a
school of pharmacy, followed by one year’s
practical experience in a community or
hospital pharmacy approved for training by
regulatory bodies for the profession—the
Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain
or the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern
Ireland. Community pharmacists are paid
professional fees for dispensing NHS
prescriptions, as well as being reimbursed for
the cost of the drugs and appliances
concerned.
Optometrists (Ophthalmic Opticians)
The General Optical Council regulates the
professions of ophthalmic optician (or
ophthalmic medical practitioner) and

ophthalmic opticians may test sight. Their
training takes four years, including a year of
practical experience under supervision.
Dispensing opticians take a two-year full-time
course with a year’s practical experience, or
follow a part-time day-release course while
employed with an optician. Ophthalmic
medical practitioners and optometrists
providing general ophthalmic services for the
NHS receive approved fees for each sight test.
Other Health Professions
The Council for Professions Supplementary
to Medicine (CPSM) and its 12 professional
boards regulate the initial training and
subsequent practice of arts therapists,
chiropodists, clinical scientists, dieticians,
medical laboratory scientific officers
(commonly known as medical laboratory
technicians or biomedical scientists),
occupational therapists, orthoptists,
paramedics, physiotherapists, prosthetists and
orthotists, radiographers, and speech and
language therapists. The boards are
responsible for promoting high standards of
professional education and conduct among
members, approving training institutions,
qualifications and courses, and maintaining
registers of those who have qualified for state
registration, which is mandatory for
employment in most of these professions in
health authorities, trusts and local authority
social services. However, by April 2002, the
Government plans to replace the CPSM and
all of the boards with the Health Professions
Council (HPC), a single statutory regulatory
body which is intended to be more responsive
to patients’ needs, and which will have scope
to regulate new professions.
Standards and Openness in the NHS
The 1997 White Paper The New NHS and the
1998 consultation document A First Class
Service introduced a range of measures to raise
quality and decrease variations in service,
including National Service Frameworks
(NSFs). The NHS Plan re-emphasised the
role of NSFs in modernising the service.
NSFs set national standards and define service
models for a defined service or care group, put
in place strategies to support implementation,
and establish performance milestones against
which progress within an agreed timescale can
be measured.
The rolling programme of NSFs, launched
in April 1998, takes forward established
frameworks on cancer and paediatric intensive
care, and published NSFs include those for
mental health (1999), coronary heart disease
(2000) and older people (2001). Other NSFs
will be for diabetes, renal services, children’s
195
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
services, and long-term conditions focusing on
neurological conditions.
NHS Complaints System
Under the current NHS complaints system,
complaints should be resolved speedily at local
level, but if the complainant remains
dissatisfied with the local response he or she
can request an independent review. Where
such an investigation takes place, a report
setting out suggestions and recommendations
will be produced. Complainants who remain
dissatisfied, or whose request for a panel
investigation is turned down, can refer their
complaint to the Health Service Commissioner.
In 1999-2000, 86,536 written complaints
were made about hospital and community
health services in England, and 39,725
complaints (covering general medical and
dental services and health authority/family
health services administration) were made
about family health services. In Scotland in
1999-2000, there were 7,027 written
complaints about hospital and community
health services and 2,581 about family health
services.
Health Service Commissioners
England, Wales and Scotland each have
Health Service Commissioners. They are
responsible for investigating complaints
directly from members of the public about
health service bodies. The three posts are at
present held by one person (with a staff of
about 250), who is also Parliamentary
Commissioner for Administration (the
Ombudsman—see p. 57). As Health Service
Commissioner, he reports annually to
Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the
Scottish Parliament. In Northern Ireland
complaints about health and social services
bodies are investigated by the Commissioner
for Complaints.
The Health Service Commissioner can
investigate complaints that a person has
suffered hardship or injustice as a result of a
failure in a service provided by a health service
body; a failure to provide a service which the
patient was entitled to receive or
maladministration by an NHS authority; or
action by health professionals arising from the
exercise of clinical judgment.
NHS Charters
In 2001 a new NHS Charter for England—
Your Guide to the NHS—replaced the
Patient’s Charter. It provides information on
how patients can access appropriate services to
meet their healthcare needs, sets out a series of
standards for each stage in the patient’s care,
and includes improvements patients can
expect in the future. In Wales, a Health
and Social Care Charter was launched in
2001, backed up with local charters at local
health group level. A revised Charter for
NHSScotland is planned.
NEW INITIATIVES
NHS Direct
In 1998 NHS Direct, a nurse-led telephone
helpline, was launched in England. NHS
Direct aims to provide people at home with
fast and convenient access to health
information and advice. The service helps
people to be better able to care for themselves
and their families, when it is appropriate to do
so, and to direct them to the most appropriate
level of care when they need professional help.
During 2000-01 NHS Direct handled 3.42
million calls. At present, the service handles
between 100,000 and 110,000 calls each week.
NHS Direct Online, an Internet extension
of the telephone-based services, was launched
in December 1999, and receives around 5
million ‘hits’ a month, or around 150,000 site
visits. The website {wwrp.nhsdirect.nhs.uk)
features an electronic version of the NHS
Direct Healthcare Guide, and a conditions
and treatment database with information and
links to support groups for hundreds of
different conditions. Work is in progress to
develop an interactive e-mail enquiry service
for health information. A pilot scheme making
NHS Direct Online services available via
digital television is also in progress.
The NHS Plan set out a programme of
developments for NHS Direct. These focus
around the closer integration of NHS Direct
196
13. HEALTH
with other parts of the NHS and should
ensure the development of the service in the
next two to three years into one of the most
important ‘gateways’ into the NHS, with an
estimated call volume of 20 million calls a year
by 2004.
\\ ales has a similar service, NHS Direct
Wales, which offers advice in both English
and Welsh.
In Scotland, a new service—NHS24—is
due to be rolled out from April 2002 onwards.
Similar to NHS Direct in England, NHS24
will be available 24 hours a day throughout the
year. A single telephone call will allow
members of the public to obtain confidential
and reliable health advice from qualified
nurses, gain access to care services when
appropriate, and get information on healthcare
services in their area.
NHS Walk-in Centres
By the end of 2001 a total of 43 NHS Walk-in
Centres will exist across England. NHS Walk-
in Centres are a network of centres—where no
appointment is necessary—offering quick
access to a range of services, including
healthcare advice and information, and
treatment for minor ailments and injuries such
as coughs, colds, cuts and bruises, and sprains.
They are intended to complement GP
surgeries and help reduce pressure on GPs.
Health Action Zones
There are 26 Health Action Zones (HAZs) in
deprived areas of England, including inner
city, rural and ex-coalfield communities. The
zones are local partnerships between the
health service, local councils, voluntary groups
and local businesses, and receive government
funding. Their aim is to make measurable
improvements in the health of local people
and in the quality of treatment and care.
\\ orking closely with DH, the participants
cooperate to tackle inequalities and deliver
better services and healthcare. They focus on
areas such as programmes to stop smoking,
children s and young people’s health, mental
health, CHD and cancer, older people’s
health, and the health of ethnic minorities.
HAZs play an important role in the
development of Local Strategic Partnerships
and the NHS modernisation agenda.
Four Health Action Zones have been
established in Northern Ireland and an
initiative to encourage local healthcare
partnerships has been launched in Scotland.
The Scottish Executive is supporting Social
Inclusion Partnerships to tackle exclusion at a
local level. The 48 Partnerships deliver local
solutions in deprived areas and for particular
groups facing disadvantage, including health
inequalities. Thirty-four are area-based and
include the majority of the areas within the
10% most deprived postcode sectors in
Scotland. The others are thematic and target
groups of people with specific needs, such as
young people leaving care and ethnic minority
groups.
Electronic Initiatives
The NHS is making increasing use of new
technology in patient care. In March 2001 the
DH and the Scottish Executive both agreed to
pilot electronic prescription schemes, whereby
prescriptions could be sent electronically from
GPs to community pharmacies. Consortia are
concentrating on preparatory work in
readiness to begin piloting once amended
regulations have been approved. In addition,
by 2004 the Government has said that every
patient in England will be able to access his or
her own electronic health record—a summary
of key personal and health data about the
patient. There are other health information
websites: the Medicines Control Agency
(MCA) website, which was relaunched in
2001, contains information on medicines; and
the British Library’s telemedicine website,
which was launched in 2001 and aims to give
medical professionals, patients and carers
access to information on the latest projects and
developments. Scotland’s first pilot scheme
for the electronic transmission of prescriptions
from local surgeries to community pharmacies
was launched in March 2001. NHSnet is a
range of voice and data services used by the
NHS, covering radio, telephone and
computer-based communications. Health
authorities and most Trusts are connected to
NHSnet, as are a number of major NHS
suppliers and all GPs in Scotland. By 2002
197
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
every GP practice in England will be
connected to NHSnet and will be able to
receive hospital pathology test results.
NHSnet will also support the longer-term goal
of introducing electronic health records to
replace the paper-based records. This will
make possible secure access by doctors to
patients’ records in an emergency when they
are away from home. An equivalent scheme,
HPSSnet, has been set up in Northern Ireland
by Northern Ireland Health and Personal
Social Services (HPSS).
FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES
The Family Health Services are those
provided to patients by doctors (GPs),
dentists, opticians and pharmacists. According
to estimates based on the ONS’s General
Household Survey, there were 255.3 million
consultations with GPs in Great Britain in
1998-99.
GPs provide the first diagnosis in the case of
illness, give advice and may prescribe a
suitable course of treatment. They may refer a
patient to the more specialised services and
hospital consultants. Primary healthcare teams
also include health visitors, district nurses,
midwives, social workers and other
professional staff employed by the health
authorities. A long-term investment
programme to improve GP premises is under
way and since 1998 over 1,000 premises have
been improved.
Between 1981 and 1999, the number of GPs
in Great Britain rose by a third, from 27,000
to 36,000, and the number of general dental
practitioners increased by more than a third,
from 15,000 to 21,000 (see Table 13.4).
Initiatives in Primary Care
The NHS Plan envisages that by 2004 patients
in England will be able to see a primary care
professional routinely within 24 hours and a
GP within 48 hours. Additional funding has
been made available to PCTs over the four
years to 2003-04 to help GP practices achieve
this target. An interim target has been set, that
by March 2002 six in ten patients will be able
to see a GP within 48 hours. More services
will also be available in primary care centres,
and there are targets (see p. 188) of some
4 million consultant outpatient appointments
a year in primary care and community settings
and up to 1,000 GPs with a special interest
being able to take referrals from other GPs.
A major target of the NHS Plan is reducing
inequality in access to services. To improve
the fair distribution of GPs across the NHS,
from 2002-03 the formula for allocating
resources to the NHS will be improved to take
greater account of expenditure on GPs, and
responsibility for deciding if more GPs are
needed in particular areas will be transferred
to health authorities from the national
Medical Practices Committee, which is to be
abolished.
In September 2000 the DH published
Modernising NHS Dentistry: Implementing the
NHS Plan, its dental strategy for England. It
states that, by the end of 2001, everyone who
wants to will be able to be treated by an NHS
dentist. A Dental Care Development Fund
has been set up, aimed at making it easier for
up to 250,000 people to find an NHS dentist.
Pilot dental services are being set up to
encourage innovation to meet differences in
local dental needs, and Dental Access Centres
are being set up in a number of locations to
relieve the most acute access problems. The
first were launched in October 1998, and by
April 2002 there will be around 60 Dental
Access Centres, providing both routine and
emergency dental care. The Scottish
Executive published An Action Plan for Dental
Services in Scotland in August 2001 and is
currently implementing its plans, including
free toothbrushes and toothpaste for 100,000
children in Scotland.
Pharmacy in the Future—Implementing the
National Plan was published by the DH in
September 2000. By 2004 all Primary Care
Groups and Trusts should have schemes
which enable people to get more advice from
pharmacists in using their medicines. In
Scotland, work is under way to develop a
national strategy for pharmaceutical care.
Midwives, Health Visitors and District
Nurses
Nurses, midwives and health visitors working
in primary and community care provide care,
198
13: HEALTH
treatment, rehabilitation and preventive
services to individuals, families and
communities. They deliver this care in the
home, health centres, schools, and other
community settings.
District nurses give skilled nursing care to
people at home or elsewhere outside hospital;
they also play an important role in health
promotion and education. Practice nurses are
based in GP surgeries. They carry out
treatments and give advice on health
promotion, working closely with GPs and
with other community nurses. Midwives
provide care and support to women
throughout pregnancy (see p. 206), birth and
the postnatal period (up to 28 days after the
baby is born). They work in both hospital and
community settings. The Government has
emphasised the importance of both nurses and
midwives in their planned reforms of the
NHS {Making a Difference—Strengthening
nursing, midwifery and health visiting in
England, issued in July 1999, and Caring for
Scotland—the Strategy for Nursing and
Midwifery in Scotland, issued in March 2000).
It intends nurses and midwives to play a
stronger role in the health service, and has
committed itself to investment in developing
nurses’ and midwives’ skills and in expanding
their training. In both Scotland and England
there are plans to expand the prescribing
powers of some nurses, after appropriate
training, so that patients can obtain quicker
access to medicines. Following the publication
of the review of public health nursing in
Scotland, Nursing for Health, in March 2001,
the Scottish Executive is creating 84 new
’public health practitioner’ posts, who will be
drawn from the nursing profession and whose
job will be to help families and communities
make improvements in their own health.
HOSPITAL AND SPECIALIST
SERVICES
District general hospitals offer a broad
spectrum of clinical specialities, supported by
a range of other services, such as anaesthetics,
pathology and radiology. Almost all have
facilities for the admission of emergency
patients, either through accident and
emergency departments or as direct referrals
from GPs. Treatments are provided for
inpatients, day cases, outpatients and patients
who attend wards for treatment such as
dialysis. Some hospitals also provide specialist
services covering more than one region or
district, for example for heart and liver
transplants and rare eye and bone cancers.
There are also specialist hospitals such as the

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
world-famous Hospital for Sick Children at
Great Ormond Street, Moorfields Eye
Hospital, and the National Hospital for
Neurology and Neurosurgery, all in London.
These hospitals combine specialist treatment
facilities with the training of medical and other
students, and international research.
Less than a third of hospitals now pre-date
the formation of the NHS in 1948. While
much has been done to improve existing
hospital buildings, the largest building
programme in the history of the NHS is
currently in progress, including several major
Private Finance Initiative schemes. Altogether
over 100 new hospital schemes are planned
between 2000 and 2010.
The main contribution of NHS Trusts (see
p. 189) remains the provision of hospital and
community services to patients. The services
provided are subject to quality standards set
by NICE (see p. 188) and, in England, to the
new ‘earned autonomy’ system to be
established under the NHS Plan (see p. 188).
Waiting Lists
Half of all admissions to hospital are
immediate. The other half are placed on a
waiting list before the admission takes place.
Of patients admitted from waiting lists, half
are admitted within six weeks, and around
two-thirds within three months. Under the
NHS Plan, the maximum waiting time for
admission to hospital is intended to be
reduced from 18 months to 6 months by the
end of 2005. By the same date patients
needing a hospital outpatient appointment will
face a maximum wait of 3 months. At the end
of March 2001 just over 1 million patients
were waiting to be admitted to NHS hospitals
in England. The Government has developed a
new National Booked Admissions Programme,
under which, by the end of 2005, all patients
will be able to pre-book their hospital
appointments and operations for a convenient
date and time. This will be facilitated by the
introduction of electronic booking systems
throughout the NHS by the end of 2005. An
extra £40 million was made available by the
National Assembly for Wales to reduce
waiting lists by 15,000 during 2000-01.
Cancer Care
Cancer was one of the three clinical priorities
outlined by the UK Government in its NHS
Plan. Cancer services are organised at three
levels:
> primary care for initial care;
> cancer units in many local hospitals of
sufficient size to support a team with the
expertise and facilities to treat more
common cancers; and
> cancer centres situated in larger hospitals
to treat less common cancers and to
support smaller cancer units.
Cancer networks are also being developed as
an additional element in this structure. These
bring together NHS providers (cancer units
and centres), health authorities, Primary Care
Groups and the voluntary sector.
In September 2000, the NHS published its
Cancer Plan, A plan for investment. A plan for
reform. This sets out targets for investment,
waiting times, staffing levels, screening and
reducing the risk of cancer. For 1999—2000,
£280 million was made available for the
achievement of the Government’s cancer
targets, and by 2003-04 funding will rise to
£570 million a year.
In July 2001, the Scottish Executive
published a comprehensive cancer plan for
Scotland : Cancer in Scotland: Action for
Change, which builds on the work of the
Scottish Cancer Group, established in 1998.
The plan sets out objectives for improving the
prevention of cancer and its diagnosis and
treatment. The Scottish Health Plan pledged
new maximum waiting times for cancer
treatment.
Targets
The NHS Cancer Plan set out a range of
targets, including:
> reducing smoking rates among manual
groups of workers from 32% in 1998 to
26% by 2010;
> employing 1,000 more cancer specialists
by 2006;
> pre-planned and pre-booked care for
every patient diagnosed with cancer by
2004;
200
13: HEALTH
^ a maximum one-month wait from urgent
GP referral to treatment for children’s
and testicular cancer and acute leukaemia
by the end of 2001;
> a maximum one-month wait from
diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer
by 2001, and for all cancers by 2005; and
> a maximum two-month wait from urgent
GP referral to treatment for breast cancer
by 2002, and for all cancers by 2005.
The Cancer Services Collaborative
programme was launched in 1999 to find the
best ways of cutting delays in treatment. In
January 2001, the DH published national
standards for cancer care, allowing the quality
of care provided to be assessed across the
country on a consistent basis.
Research
Research is an important way to reduce the
number of deaths from cancer in the long
term. The National Cancer Research Institute
was formed in April 2001 to coordinate all
cancer research in the United Kingdom. At
the same time the National Cancer Research
Network was also established. It aims to
double the number of patients involved in
clinical trials as well as recruiting more
specialist nurses and other staff. By 2003-04,
the Government will be investing an
additional £20 million a year on this initiative.
The National Institute for Clinical
Excellence (NICE) has recommended
several cancer drugs since its formation
in 1999. These have included the ovarian
cancer drug Taxol, the breast cancer
drug Taxotere, the brain cancer drug
Temodal and the pancreatic cancer drug
Gemzar.
Screening
Cancer screening programmes are in operation
for breast cancer and cervical cancer. At
present, under the United Kingdom’s breast
cancer screening programme, every woman
aged between 50 and 64 is invited for
mammography (breast X-ray) every three
years by computerised call-up and recall
systems. This facility is to be extended to
women aged 65 to 70 by 2004 in England. In
Scotland, the extension of the routine age of
invitation to women aged 65-70 will begin in
2003-04 and be implemented over a three-
year round of screening. Also at present, all
women over the age of 64 can refer themselves
for screening. In England, 1.3 million women
of all ages were screened, and 8,215 cases of
cancer were diagnosed. In Scotland 106,816
women aged 50-64 years were routinely
screened in 1999-2000, and 712 cases of
cancer were diagnosed.
National policy for cervical screening is that
women should be screened every three to five
years (three-and-a-half to five-and-a-half
years in Scotland) so as to detect indications of
the long developmental stage which may
proceed to invasive cancer. The programme
invites women aged 20 to 64 (20 to 60 in
Scotland) for screening. However, since many
women are not invited immediately when they
reach their 20th birthday, the age group 25 to
64 is used to give a more accurate estimate of
coverage of the target population in England.
By the end of March 2000, more than four-
fifths of women in the target population had
been screened in England, Scotland and
Wales. This is a considerable increase on the
figures for 1989, when less than half of the
target population in England had undergone a
smear test in the previous five years.
The NHS Cancer Plan set out the
Government’s intention to introduce prostate
cancer screening if and when screening and
treatment techniques have developed
sufficiently. The evidence for this is kept
under review. In the meantime, a prostate
cancer risk management programme has been
launched. One element of this is the Informed
Choice Project for prostate specific antigen
(PSA) testing. Pilot studies are under way for
colorectal screening, and other possibilities for
future screening programmes are lung and
ovarian cancers.
Coronary Heart Disease
As well as being a major clinical health
concern, coronary heart disease is also linked
to the Government’s aim of reducing health
201
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
inequality. Death rates for CHD are three
times higher among manual workers than
among managers. By 2003-04, an extra £230
million should have been invested in heart
disease services, and capital funding from the
Capital Modernisation Fund (see p. 400) is
also being made available. To help streamline
the delivery of coronary heart care, in 2000 the
Coronary Heart Disease Partnership
Programme was set up, bringing together
doctors, nurses, paramedics and other staff
involved in heart care. The Government has
set the following targets and priorities for
CHD in England:
> an increase of 10% each year to 2003-04
in the number of consultant cardiologists,
and no Trust to have a ‘single-handed’
consultant cardiologist by 2004;
> all practices to have disease management
registers in place by 2003;
> rapid access chest pain clinics to be
established by 2003 (by April 2001, 139
had been opened);
> ‘clot-busting’ drugs to be administered
within 60 minutes of a call for
professional help;
> a reduction in waiting times for cardiac
surgery to three months by 2008; and
> 6,000 more heart operations by 2003.
Improving Health in Wales recognised that
clinical networks for cardiac care are essential
for the development and improvement of
clinical services, and the Welsh Assembly is to
spend an extra £208,000 on heart disease and
critical care managed clinical networks. It is
also spending £2 million on attempts to
reduce waiting lists for cardiac surgery.
The Scottish Health Plan, Our National
Health, includes a range of measures to tackle
heart disease and stroke in Scotland, focusing
on primary and secondary prevention,
improving access to diagnostic services, and
reducing waiting times for treatment. In
autumn 2001, the national CHD Task Force is
due to report on its comprehensive review of
CHD services in Scotland.
Mental Health
The Mental Health Services NSF sets out a
ten-year programme designed to raise
standards of mental healthcare. The NHS
Plan involves extra annual investment of over
£300 million by 2003-04 and includes
provision for:
> 1,000 new mental healthcare workers
helping GPs, and 500 additional
community mental health staff;
> 50 teams to be established over the next
three years to help reduce the period of
untreated psychosis in young people;
> over 300 ‘crisis resolution’ teams to help
deal quickly with people with acute
mental illness experiencing a crisis and
who would otherwise need to be admitted
to hospital;
> 230 teams to deal with the small number
of high users of services, many of whom
also have a problem with substance
misuse;
> women-only day centres in every health
authority by 2004; and
> more staff to increase respite care.
In addition, the NHS Plan established a
Mental Health Taskforce, which has a specific
remit to look at minority ethnic mental health
and the development of culturally appropriate
mental health services. In 2000 the DH carried
out a survey of attitudes to mental illness in
Great Britain, which revealed that three-
quarters of adults felt that ‘mental illness was
an illness like any other’. However, 80% of
young people believe that mental illness will
lead to discrimination, and in 2001 the DH
launched a campaign designed to reduce
discrimination against people with mental
health problems and users of mental health
services. In Scotland, the Framework for
Mental Health, published in 1997, is in its
implementation phase.
Communicable Disease Prevention and
Immunisation
Health authorities/health boards are
responsible for the prevention and control of
infectious disease, liaising closely with
colleagues in environmental health
departments of local authorities. They are
assisted by the Public Health Laboratory

CUMBRIA CiRAMICA
13: HEALTH
Service (PHLS), which aims to protect the
population from infection through the
detection, diagnosis, surveillance, prevention
and control of communicable diseases in
England and Wales. Similar facilities are
provided in Scotland by the Scottish Centre
for Infection and Environmental Health and,
in Northern Ireland, by the Communicable
Disease Surveillance Centre, the Department
of Health, Social Services and Public
Safety, and other hospital microbiology
laboratories.
Immunisation
Health authorities/health boards carry out
programmes of immunisation against
diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella,
poliomyelitis, tetanus, tuberculosis, whooping
cough (pertussis) and haemophilus influenzae
type B infection (‘Hib’). The UK was the first
country in the world to use a new vaccine to
protect against meningitis C. This vaccine was
introduced into the immunisation programme
in 1999, and by the end of 2000 all people aged
under 18 had been offered the vaccine. The
programme has led to dramatic reductions in
the incidence of meningitis C among 15 to 17
year olds and babies under the age of one.
Immunisation is not compulsory. Parents are
provided with information about the safety and
effectiveness of vaccines and are encouraged to
have their children immunised. Immunisations
are mainly given by GPs and their practice
nurses. Virtually every child under the age of
two is now immunised against diphtheria,
tetanus, whooping cough and polio. Since the
introduction of the Hib vaccine in 1992, Hib
meningitis has been almost completely
eliminated in young children.
Vaccination against influenza is
recommended for people with certain other
illnesses, and for everybody aged 65 and over.
In 1988, the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR)
vaccine was introduced and a higher coverage
of immunisation was achieved as it became
widely available. Adverse publicity about the
MMR combined vaccine led to a fall in the
number of children immunised against
MMR by their second birthday in England,
from 92% in 1995-96 to 88% in
1999-2000.
Tuberculosis
A schools immunisation programme against
tuberculosis (I B), which had been suspended
in 1999, was restarted in March 2001. The
Government intends routine immunisation for
pupils aged between 13 and 15 to be back in
place by 2002-03.
Much of the recent rise in TB in the UK
(see p. 185) is thought to be the result of the
disease being ‘imported’ from other countries.
The Government has a dual approach to
prevention and control of TB in new
immigrants to the UK: first to screen those at
highest risk at ports of entry, and then to offer
more detailed screening, including skin
testing, when they arrive at their destination.
HIV/AIDS
Government strategies to reduce HIV
transmission include:
^ HIV/AIDS health promotion aimed at
both the general population and groups
at risk;
> information on antenatal HIV testing to
help pregnant women to reach informed
decisions, for example about ways of
reducing the risk of transmission to
babies; and
^ the National AIDS Helpline, which
provides confidential information and
advice on all aspects of HIV and AIDS.
The Government has also introduced a
range of initiatives to encourage pregnant
women to have an HIV test as an integral part
of their antenatal care. Most HIV-infected
pregnant women accept measures to decrease
the risk of passing the infection to their babies.
Substance Misuse
Alcohol
Part of the funds allocated to Health
Promotion England (see p. 189) is for
promoting sensible drinking in England, and
equivalent bodies are similarly funded in other
parts of Britain. ‘Drinkline’ provides
confidential telephone advice about alcohol
problems and services in England and Wales.
Treatment and rehabilitation within the NHS
203
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
includes inpatient and outpatient services in
general and psychiatric hospitals and some
specialised alcohol treatment units. Primary
care teams and voluntary organisations also
play an important role in providing treatment
and rehabilitation in hostels and day centres.
There is also close cooperation between
statutory and voluntary organisations. In
England, Alcohol Concern plays a prominent
role in improving services for problem
drinkers and their families, increasing public
awareness of alcohol misuse, and improving
training for professional and voluntary
workers. The Scottish Council on Alcohol has
a similar function in Scotland.
The Scottish Executive will publish a Plan
for Action on Alcohol Misuse in autumn 2001,
following an extensive public consultation
exercise. In Northern Ireland, a Regional
Drug Strategy Coordinator was appointed in
February 2001 to take forward the Drug
Strategy and the Strategy for Reducing
Alcohol Related Harm.
Tobacco
The NHS Plan envisages an expansion in
specialist services for those smokers who need
extra help to give up. Smokers can now get
nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) on
prescription from GPs. NRT provides the
body with nicotine in decreasing doses until
the craving can be coped with. This
complements the newly available treatment,
buproprion. Reduction in the proportion of
people smoking since 1965 has almost halved
the number of lung cancer deaths that would
otherwise have been expected in the UK.
In September 1999, the licensed hospitality
industry, supported by the Government,
produced a voluntary Public Places Charter
which committed signatories to improve the
facilities for customers who do not smoke in
public houses, bars and restaurants.
In Northern Ireland a working group has
been established to oversee the implementation
of an action plan to tackle the use of tobacco.
Drugs
The misuse of drugs, such as heroin, cocaine
and amphetamines, is a serious social and
health problem (see p. 186). In response to
this, the Government launched its ten-year
anti-drugs strategy Tackling Drugs to Build a
Better Britain in April 1998. The strategy
acknowledged the link between drug misuse
and social conditions and problems; signalled a
change in spending priorities in order to stop
the problem happening, rather than reacting
to it when it does; and developed targets for
reducing drug misuse based on evidence and
experience.
Over the past four years, the Government’s
strategy has been:
> encouraging young people to resist taking
drugs in the first place;
> helping communities to protect
themselves from drug-related anti-social
and criminal behaviour;
> providing treatment to help people
overcome their drug addiction; and
> tackling the availability of drugs.
By 2008 the Government aims to:
> halve the number of young people using
the most dangerous illegal drugs, such as
heroin and cocaine;
> double the number of drug misusers in
treatment;
> halve the level of re-offending by drug
misusing offenders; and
> halve the availability of the most
dangerous drugs, such as heroin and
cocaine, on the streets.
The Welsh Assembly’s anti-drugs strategy
was published in May 2000 in Tackling
Substance Misuse in Wales: a Partnership
Approach. Scotland’s drugs strategy is set out
in Tackling Drugs in Scotland—Action in
Partnership, published in 1999, and in the
Scottish Executive’s Drug Action Plan,
published in May 2000. A £100 million
package of expenditure on drugs misuse
over three years was announced in
September 2000, covering NHS Boards,
local authorities and other agencies. This is
the biggest programme of anti-drugs
initiatives in Scotland and will fund a series of
interlinked activities, to ensure that every
204
13: HEALTH
school pupil, both primary and secondary,
has effective drugs education. The strategy
for Northern Ireland is set out in Drug
Strategy for Northern Ireland, published in
1999.
The National Drugs Helpline gives advice
and information to anyone in the UK
concerned about drugs. The telephone
number is 0800 77 66 00.
Solvents
Government policy aims to prevent solvent
misuse through educating young people,
parents and health professionals about the
dangers and signs of misuse, and, where
practicable, restricting the sales of solvent-
based liquefied gas and aerosol products to
young people.
In England, W ales and Northern Ireland it
is an offence to supply such substances to
children under 18 if the supplier knows or has
reason to believe they are to be used to induce
intoxication. In Scotland proceedings can be
taken under the common law. Since October
1999 it has been an offence in the UK to sell
butane lighter refills to people under 18—
these refills are implicated in more than half of
all deaths from solvent abuse.
The DH funds a hospital-based unit in
London to collect and publish annual
mortality statistics associated with volatile
substance abuse. There were 73 deaths in the
UK in 1999.
Organ Transplants
Lnited Kingdom Transplant (a special health
authority of the NHS) provides a 24-hour
support service to all transplant units in the
L K and the Irish Republic for the matching
and allocation of organs for transplant. In
many cases transplants are multi-organ.
During 2000, 1,695 kidney transplants were
performed, and at the end of 2000 there were
6,126 patients waiting for kidney transplants.
At the end of 2000 there were seven
designated thoracic transplant centres in
England, and one in Scotland. In 2000, 204
heart, 98 lung, and 33 heart/lung transplants
were performed. There are six designated liver
transplant units in England and one in
Scotland. In 2000, 671 liver transplants were
performed. A similar service exists for corneas
and, in 1999, 2,271 were transplanted in the
LK. The Government has set targets for
increasing the kidney transplant rate by almost
100% and the heart and lung and liver
transplant rates by 10% by 2005. A voluntary
organ donor card system enables people to
indicate their willingness to become organ
donors in the event of their death. The NHS
Organ Donor Register is a computer database
of those willing to be organ donors. At
December 2000 it contained around 8 million
names. The Government aims to double this
figure by 2010. Commercial dealing in organs
for transplant is illegal in the UK.
Blood Services
Blood services are run by the National Blood
Services in England and North Wales, the
\\ elsh Blood Service, the Scottish National
Blood Transfusion Service and the Northern
Ireland Blood Transfusion Agency. The UK
is self-sufficient in blood components.
In the UK over 3 million donations are
made each year by voluntary unpaid donors.
These are turned into many different life¬
saving products for patients. Red cells,
platelets and other components with a limited
‘life' are prepared at blood centres, while the
production of plasma products is undertaken
at the Bio Products Laboratory in Elstree
(Hertfordshire) and the Protein Fractionation
Centre in Edinburgh.
Each of the four national blood services
coordinates programmes for donor
recruitment, retention and education, and
donor sessions are organised regionallv, in
towns and workplaces. Donors are normally
aged between 17 and 70. Blood centres are
responsible for blood collection, screening,
processing and supplying hospital blood
banks. They also provide laboratory, clinical,
research, teaching and specialist advisory
services and facilities. These blood centres are
subject to nationally coordinated quality audit
programmes, through the MCA.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Ambulance and Patient Transport
Services
NHS emergency ambulances are available free
to the public through the 999 telephone
system for medical emergencies and accidents,
as well as for doctors’ urgent calls. Rapid
response services, in which paramedics use
cars and motorcycles to reach emergency
cases, have been introduced in a number of
areas, particularly major cities with areas of
high traffic density. Helicopter ambulances,
provided through local charities, serve many
parts of the country and an integrated NHS-
funded air ambulance service is available
throughout Scotland. In England between
1999-2000 and 2000-01 the number of
emergency calls to the NHS rose by 6% to
4.4 million and the number of emergency
patient journeys grew by 2% to 2.9 million.
Non-emergency patient transport services
are free to NHS patients considered by their
doctor, dentist or midwife to be medically
unfit to travel by other means. In many areas
the ambulance service organises volunteer
drivers to provide a hospital car service for
non-urgent patients. Patients on low incomes
may be eligible for reimbursement of costs of
travelling to hospital.
Rehabilitation
The NHS and social services undertake
rehabilitation work for large numbers of
people of all ages, to restore and maintain
their independence and social participation.
Rehabilitation plays an important role in
improving quality of life, enabling people to
return to, or remain in, employment or
education and preventing future admissions
to hospital or long-term care. Health and
social services are encouraged to develop a
range of rehabilitative options and to be
flexible in meeting people’s needs.
Hospices
Hospice (or palliative) care is a special type of
care for people whose illness may no longer be
curable; it enables them to achieve the best
possible quality of life during the final stages.
It was first developed in the UK in 1967 by
the voluntary hospices and continues to be
provided by them, but is also increasingly
provided within NHS palliative care units,
and in hospitals and community services. The
care may be provided in a variety of settings:
at home (with support from specially trained
staff), in a hospice or palliative care unit, in
hospital or at a hospice day centre.
Hospice care focuses on controlling pain
and other distressing symptoms and providing
psychological support to patients, their
families and friends, both during the patient’s
illness and into bereavement. Hospice care
services mostly help people with cancer,
although patients with other life-threatening
illnesses, such as AIDS, motor neurone
disease and heart failure are also cared for.
Currently 22 specialist hospice inpatient units
provide respite care for children from birth to
16 years of age.
The National Council for Hospices and
Specialist Palliative Care Services brings
together voluntary and health service
providers in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland, in order to provide a coordinated view
of the service. Its Scottish counterpart is the
Scottish Partnership Agency for Palliative and
Cancer Care.
Parents and Children
Special preventive services are provided under
the NHS to safeguard the health of pregnant
women and mothers with young children.
Services include free dental treatment; health
education; and vaccination and immunisation
of children against certain infectious diseases
(see p. 203). Under the NHS Plan, further
screening programmes are planned by 2004.
Nearly all births take place in hospital,
although there was a slight increase during the
1990s in the popularity of home births: these
accounted for around 2% of births in England
and Wales in 2000, compared with around 1%
during the 1980s. Home births in Scotland
remain relatively constant at under 1%. A
woman is entitled to care throughout her
pregnancy, the birth and the postnatal period.
Care may be provided by a midwife, a
community-based GP, a hospital-based
obstetrician, or a combination of these. The
206
13: HEALTH
birth may take place in a hospital maternity
unit, a midwife/GP-led unit, or at home.
After the birth, a midwife will visit until the
baby is at least ten days old and after that a
health visitor’s services are available.
Throughout her pregnancy and for the first
year of her baby’s life, a woman is entitled to
free prescriptions and dental care.
There is a welfare food scheme for mothers
on low income, providing formula feed and
vitamins free of charge. The NHS Plan
envisages that the scheme will be reformed by
2004 to improve access to a healthy diet for
children in poverty. As part of the drive to
tackle health inequalities, breastfeeding is
being encouraged by the Infant Feeding
Initiative in England and the Scottish
Breastfeeding Group and the National
Breastfeeding Adviser in Scotland.
A comprehensive programme of health
surveillance, provided for pre-school children
(under five years of age), is run by community
health trusts and GPs who receive an annual
payment for every child registered on the
programme. (In Scotland this is carried out by
the Community Paediatric Service which may
be based in the primary care or acute services
trust.) This enables doctors, dentists and
health visitors to oversee the health and
development of pre-school children so that
any health problems are picked up and
appropriate intervention arranged as early and
as quickly as possible. Health Promotion
England (see p. 189) produces The Pregnancy
Book, a complete guide to a healthy
pregnancy, labour and giving birth as well as
life with a new baby, and Birth to Five, a guide
to the early stages of development, nutrition,
weaning and common childhood ailments;
both are made available to all first-time
mothers free of charge. The Scottish
equivalent is Ready, Steady, Baby!, produced
by the Health Education Board for Scotland.
New mothers also receive a Personal Child
Health Record for their child. This helps
parents to keep a record of immunisation (see
p. 203), tests, birth details and health checks.
In February 2001 the Scottish Executive
published the national Framework for
Maternity Services in Scotland, designed to
ensure choices for women and their families
while recognising the need for clinical safety. It
sets out a basis against which each NHS Trust
and NHS Board should judge its own service
provision, and covers key aspects of maternity
care, the organisation of maternity services,
and women’s and parents’ information needs.
In England, the DH is developing a NSF for
maternity care, and is investing an extra £100
million to fund capital improvements to
modernise the facilities in maternity units, as
well as separate additional investment to
provide 2,000 extra midwives by 2005.
Children of school age attending a state
school have access to the school health service,
as well as usually being registered with a GP
and a dentist. In addition to providing health
advice to children and young people, the
school health service assists teachers with
pupils who have medical needs.
Child guidance and child psychiatric
services provide help and advice to families
and children with psychological or emotional
problems. In recent years efforts have been
made to improve cooperation between
community-based child health services and
local authority education and social services
for children. This is particularly important in
the prevention of child abuse and for the
health and welfare of children in care (see
p. 169).
Fertility and Sexual Health
The Government’s public health strategy aims
to ensure the provision of effective sexual
health services. Free contraceptive advice and
treatment are available from GPs, family
planning clinics and tailored services for
young people. Clinics are able to provide
condoms and other contraceptives free of
charge. The DH has developed a national
sexual health and HIV strategy to bring
together current initiatives in sexual health
and HIV, including work on chlamydia. The
Scottish Executive is also developing plans for
a sexual health strategy for Scotland. The
National Assembly for Wales’ Strategic
framework for promoting sexual health,
launched in October 2000, is now being
implemented. Local sexual health strategies
are in place, and a two-year HI\ prevention
campaign targeted at homosexual men has
been commissioned.
207
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Teenage Pregnancies
The Social Exclusion Unit’s report on teenage
pregnancy, launched in 1999, set out a
national strategy for England to halve the rate
of conception among women aged under 18
and to increase the participation of teenage
parents in education and work. The strategy
sets out an action plan to help prevent teenage
pregnancy and provide support for teenage
parents. Every top-tier local authority area has
agreed a ten-year local teenage pregnancy
strategy, beginning in 2001, outlining how
local authorities will work with health bodies
and other local agencies to take forward the
aims of the national strategy. The conception
rate for women aged under 18 declined by 4%
between 1998 and 1999.
Abortion
Under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, a
time limit of 24 weeks applies to the largest
category of abortion—risk to the physical or
mental health of the pregnant woman—and
also to abortion because of a similar risk to any
existing children of her family. There are
three categories in which no time limit applies:
to prevent grave permanent injury to the
physical or mental health of the woman; where
there is a substantial risk of serious foetal
handicap; or where continuing the pregnancy
would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant
woman greater than if the pregnancy were
terminated. The Act does not apply in
Northern Ireland.
Between 1999 and 2000 the rate of legal
abortions on women resident in England rose
by 1% to 175,542, and the overall age-
standardised rate rose slightly, from 16.8 to
16.9 abortions per 1,000 women aged between
15 and 49.
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
The world’s first ‘test-tube baby’ was born in
the UK in 1978, as a result of the technique of
in vitro fertilisation. This provided new
possibilities for dealing with the problems of
infertility and for the science of embryology.
The social, ethical and legal implications were
examined by a committee of inquiry and led
eventually to the passage of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. The
Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority (HFEA) licenses and controls
centres providing certain infertility
treatments, undertaking human embryo
research or storing gametes or embryos. The
HFEA maintains a code of practice giving
guidance to licensed centres and reports
annually to Parliament.
Eating Habits, Nutrition and Exercise
Since the early 1970s there have been marked
changes in the British diet. One feature has
been the long-term rise in consumption of
poultry, while that of red meat (such as beef
and veal) has fallen (see Figure 13.6).
Consumption of fresh fruit has increased since
1970, while consumption of fresh green
vegetables was lower in 2000 than in 1970. In
addition, the use of convenience food—both
frozen and ready meals—has increased.
Despite these changes, the British diet is still
noticeably different from that in other
countries such as those in the Mediterranean,
being relatively low in fruit, vegetables and
fish. Health considerations appear to have
been influencing some aspects of diet in recent
years, such as the fall in sales of red meat and
the rise in consumption of low-fat spread.
However, the proportion of adults who are
obese or overweight has increased—in 1999,
19% of women and 21% of men aged 16 and
over in England were classified as obese,
compared with 8% and 6% respectively in
1980 in Great Britain. The likelihood of being
obese increases up to the age of 65 and then
declines at older ages.
In 1997, three-quarters of children aged 4 to
18 had not eaten any citrus fruits (excluding
fruit juice) during the seven-day dietary
record, and three-fifths had not eaten any leafy
green vegetables. The Department of Health is
piloting ‘five a day’ projects testing the
feasibility and practicalities of new approaches
to improving access to and increasing
awareness of fruit and vegetables. Lessons
learned from these pilot projects will be used
to provide guidance on the national roll-out

beginning in 2002. Under the National School
h ruit Scheme, launched in 2000 and expanded
in spring 2001, over 80,000 children in 27 areas
and 548 schools are receiving free fruit each
school day. By 2004 every child in nursery and
children aged four to six in infant schools will
be entitled to a free piece of fruit on each
school day. The Scottish Diet Action Plan—
Eating for Health—provides the framework for
wide-ranging action to tackle Scotland’s poor
health, with a particular focus on children and
young people. The most recent initiatives in
this area include fruit for infants, breakfast
clubs, and school fruit and salad bars.
The Committee on the Medical Aspects of
Food and Nutrition Policy published its report
Nutritional Aspects of the Development of Cancer
in 1998. It noted that research suggests that diet
might contribute to about a third of all cancers.
Its main recommendations are consistent with
the Government’s healthy eating advice to the
effect that a healthy and balanced diet is one
which is varied and rich in fruit and vegetables
and dietary fibre. The report also underlined
the importance of maintaining a healthy body
weight throughout adult life.
The major supermarket groups and most
food manufacturers have introduced voluntary
labelling schemes indicating the energy, fat,
protein and carbohydrate content of food.
Nutrition labelling is compulsory on products
for which a nutritional claim is made.
Physical activity helps give protection against
coronary heart disease and stroke. It also has
beneficial effects on weight control, blood
pressure and diabetes, all of which are
cardiovascular disease risk factors in their own
right. Regular exercise also protects against
osteoporosis (brittle bones), maintains muscle
power and increases people’s general sense of
well being. Among males in England aged 16 to
24, almost a fifth said they took part in seven or
more hours of sport or exercise per week in
1998. However, almost two-fifths engaged in
less than an hour’s sport or exercise. Three-
fifths of women aged 16 to 24 took part in less
than an hour’s sport or exercise per week. Only
one in 20 young women took part in more than
seven hours per week.
ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH
According to the DH, the public’s health also
needs protection through control of the
physical environment. Atmospheric pollution,
noise, radiation, contaminated land and water,
waste management and housing are all
important aspects of environmental health. In
209
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the United Kingdom no single government
department is responsible for environmental
health as a whole, but the DH advises other
departments and health ministers on the
health implications of Government policies.
Local authorities provide environmental
health services and employ professionally
trained environmental health officers,
concerned with inspection, health promotion
and regulation. The Environment Agency also
regulates pollution from large-scale industry.
The Government sponsors or funds a
number of bodies to support its work in this
area. For example: the DH Toxicology Unit
and the Small Area Health Statistics Unit
(SAHSU), both at Imperial College London;
the Institute for Environment and Health,
established by the Medical Research Council;
the National Focus, which coordinates work
on responses to chemical incidents and
surveillance of health effects of chemicals; and
the National Poisons Information Service,
which provides a 24-hour advice service to
health professionals in the NHS on suspected
poisoning cases. The Government has also
established a number of independent expert
committees to provide scientific advice.
Accidents
In 2000 there were 234,000 road accidents
involving personal injury in Great Britain, and
there were over 3,400 deaths and nearly
317,000 injuries (see p. 364). The
Department of Trade and Industn records
home and leisure accidents needing hospital
treatment. Data for 1999 show that every 6
hours one elderly person dies from an
accidental fall in the home. Altogether 1.2
million people in the U K go to a hospital
casualtv department each year as a result of a
fall in the home. Over 35,000 people experience
falls from ladders each year, and bums from
barbecues are thought to affect around 600
people. Results from the DH's Health Survey
for England show that 19 in every 100 men and
15 in even 100 women had a major accident—
one which necessitated treatment bv a doctor or
in a hospital—in 1999. In 1999-2000 there
were 218 worker fatalities, compared with 253
the previous year.
Food Safety
Under the Food Safety Act 1990, it is illegal to
sell or supply food that is unfit for human
consumption or falsely or misleadingly
labelled. The Act covers a broad range of
commercial activities related to food
production, the sources from which it is
derived, such as crops and animals, and
articles which come into contact with food.
There are also more detailed regulations,
which apply to all types of food and drink and
their ingredients. Local authorities are
responsible for enforcing food law in two main
areas: trading standards officers deal with the
labelling of food, its composition and most
cases of chemical contamination; and
environmental health officers deal with
hygiene, cases of microbiological
contamination of foods, and food which is
found to be unfit for human consumption.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA), which
began operating in April 2000, is responsible
for all aspects of food safety and standards in
the UK. The Agency has set a target to
reduce foodborne disease by 20% by 2006,
and will be seeking new ways to help
disadvantaged consumers improve their diets.
It also sets and audits standards for the
enforcement of food law by local authorities.
In 1999, 47% of the food premises inspected
by local environmental health officers were
found to be infringing food safety rules in
some way, compared with 44% in the
previous year.
CJD and Public Health
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy in
humans. Since the discovery in 1996 of
variant CJD, or vCJD, which is linked to
exposure to BSE (see p. 460), there have been
102 cases of definite and probable vCJD in
the UK (up to the end of June 2001). To
safeguard public health the Government is
providing additional funding for research into
CJD and BSE, including the work carried out
at the National CJD Surveillance Unit, which
monitors the incidence of the disease. In
2001, the Government announced interim
210
13: HEALTH
payments of £25,000 to each of the families of
people who had been diagnosed with vCJD. A
compensation scheme is currently being
developed. The Government also announced
that arrangements would be made for the
funding of health and social care for patients
with CJD.
An independent public inquiry set up to
establish and review the history of the
emergence and identification of BSE and
vCJD in the UK reported in October
2000 (see p. 460).
Safety of Medicines
Only medicines that have been granted a
marketing authorisation issued bv the
European Agency for the Evaluation of
Medicinal Products or the MCA may be
supplied to the public. Marketing
authorisations are issued following scientific
assessment on the basis of safety, quality and
effectiveness.
HEALTH ARRANGEMENTS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES
The member states of the European Economic
Area (EEA—see p. 83) have special health
arrangements under which EEA nationals
resident in a member state are entitled to
receive emergency treatment, either free or at
a reduced cost, during visits to other EEA
countries. Treatment is provided, in most
cases, on production of a valid Form El 11
which, in the L nited Kingdom, people
normally obtain from a post office before
travelling. There are also arrangements for
people who go to another EEA country
specifically for medical care, or who require
continuing treatment for a pre-existing
condition. Unless falling into an exempted
category (for instance foreign students),
3isitors to the United Kingdom are generally
expected to pay for routine, non-emergencv
treatment, or if the purpose of their visit is to
seek specific medical treatment. The United
Kingdom also has a number of separate
bilateral agreements with some other
countries, such as Australia and New Zealand.
HEALTH PROVISION OUTSIDE
THE NHS
Private Healthcare and Regulation
As an alternative to the XHS, people are
entitled to pay for their own health and social
care, by joining a private healthcare
organisation. In addition, there is the option of
private medical insurance, which, depending
on the premium paid, will cover people’s
healthcare in times of need. In 2000, 11.5%
of the population of the United Kingdom
were covered by private medical
insurance.
The Government does, however, still play
some role in this type of care, through
regulation. At present, local councils and
health authorities are responsible for
monitoring care provision by the private and
voluntary sectors. However, during 2001-02
the National Care Standards Commission
(XCSC) is to be set up. It will cover public,
private and voluntary care services in
institutions such as care homes, children’s
homes, private hospitals and private clinics.
It will carry out regular inspections of
sen ices and will have the power to ensure
that standards meet national minima.
In \\ ales, these functions will be
performed by the Care Standards
Inspectorate for Wales, a new division
within the W elsh Assembly.
Partnerships
The Government is beginning to work
tormally in partnership with the private
sector. In October 2000, the DH signed an
agreement with the independent healthcare
sector (the private and voluntary sectors),
under which health authorities will be able to
bring private sector providers into the
planning of local healthcare on a systematic
and long-term basis. The agreement covers
care, workforce planning and service planning,
and will involve the XHS using the private
sector’s spare capacity, transfer of patients
between the two sectors, exchange of
information, and joint working on preventive
and rehabilitation services.
211
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Complementary and Alternative
Medicine
There is a growing interest in complementary
and alternative medicine (CAM). In
November 2000 the House of Lords Select
Committee reported its findings on CAM,
and in March 2001 the Government
published its response. The Government
agreed that acupuncture and herbal medicine
were early candidates for regulation on a
statutory basis, and that others, such as
chiropractic, homeopathy and osteopathy,
might also be regulated in due course. The
Government also said that, for voluntary
regulation to be effective, each type of
therapy should have its own single regulatory
body, and that funding for research into
CAM was a possibility, if it supported the
Government’s clinical priorities—cancer,
heart disease and mental health. Information
on CAM is now available through NHS
Direct Online.

The United Kingdom does not have a single legal system. Instead, England and
YVales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own, with considerable
differences in law, judicial procedure and court structure. There is, however,
substantial similarity on many points and a large volume of modern legislation
including EC legislation, applies throughout the UK. In all three systems there is
a common distinction between criminal law and civil law.
Introduction
Criminal and Civil Law
Criminal law deals with wrongs affecting the
community for which a prosecution may be
brought in the criminal courts. Civil law is
about deciding disputes between two or more
parties—individuals, companies or other
organisations—and for providing a means of
legal scrutiny of the actions of public bodies.
The purpose of civil proceedings is not to
punish, but to obtain compensation or some
other appropriate remedy, although in
England and Wales the payment of damages
may sometimes have a punitive element.
The distinction between civil and criminal
matters is not precise. All courts in England
and Wales, and Northern Ireland have both a
civil and a criminal jurisdiction (apart from
county courts, whose jurisdiction is
exclusively civil). However, the court of trial
and the rules of procedure and evidence will
usually differ in civil and criminal cases.
Sources of Law
Statutes passed by Parliament are the ultimate
source of law. There are no legal limits on
w hat may be done by Act of Parliament,
although a legal duty exists to comply with
European Community (EC) law. In addition,
statutes passed by the Scottish Parliament are
a source of law in Scotland. A statute may also
confer power on a minister, local authority or
other executive body to make delegated
legislation (see p. 54).
Modern statutes are usually brought into
effect by an Order made by a minister of the
Crown. The Order allows provisions to
become effective when practical. Pilot schemes
can be set up to test the operation of statutory
provisions. Changing policies or
circumstances may sometimes mean that
provisions are not brought into effect, and
may be repealed.
Common law in England and Wales covers
many key areas which have, over the
centuries, developed through the decisions of
213
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
the courts. The concept of binding precedent
means that decisions of higher courts bind
those courts lower down in the court
hierarchy, ensuring consistency of judicial
approach. Judges give reasons for their
decisions, and principles of law are stated,
developed and modified. When government
action is being tested, the court is considering
the legality of that action and will try to ensure
that government is not overstepping its proper
role; the court does not seek to substitute its
discretion for that of the public authority
being challenged. Sources of law in Scotland
include decisions of the courts as well as Acts
of the previous Scottish parliament which
ended in 1707.
European Sources
EC law, which applies in the UK as a member
of the European Union (see p. 72), is derived
from the EC treaties, from the Community
legislation adopted under them, and from the
decisions of the European Court of Justice.
That court has the highest authority, under
the Treaty of Rome, to decide points of EC
law. Where a point arises before a British
court, it may refer the point of law to the
Court of Justice for it to decide. Sometimes a
court is obliged to make a reference to the
European Court.
The decisions of the Court of Justice do not
directly bind British courts, but the UK is
under treaty obligation to uphold EC law.
Consequently, British courts are obliged to
apply EC law, even at the expense of not
applying the provision of an Act of
Parliament. If a rule of statute or common law
is incompatible with Community law, it is
Community law that will be applied by a
British court. Under the Scotland Act 1998,
the Parliament and the Executive are bound,
as a matter of domestic law, to act in
accordance with EC obligations.
European Convention on Human Rights
The European Convention on Human Rights
is an international treaty covering, among
other rights, an individual’s right to life,
prohibition of torture, right to a fair trial, right
to respect for family and private life, freedom
of expression and freedom of assembly. Most
Convention rights can be limited by public
authorities under certain circumstances.
Individual rights sometimes have to be
balanced against one another or the wider
public interest.
The Convention was incorporated into UK
law under the Human Rights Act 1998 on
2 October 2000. It requires all public
authorities, including the courts, to act
compatibly with the Convention rights (unless
an Act of Parliament leaves no choice). It
enables individuals to rely on those rights in
any legal proceedings and to bring a claim
against a public authority which has acted
incompatibly with those rights. The Act
requires a court to give effect to legislation, as
far as possible, in a way that is compatible with
Convention rights. A court cannot declare
invalid an Act of Parliament which is
incompatible with the Convention, but the
higher courts may make a declaration of
incompatibility. It will be up to Parliament to
decide what action to take, if any, following
such a declaration. In this way the Human
Rights Act lays down a set of basic human
rights against which laws and administration
can be tested. In Scotland, as with EC law, the
Scottish Executive and Scottish Parliament
have to act in a way which is compatible with
the Convention.
Personnel of the Law
The law is enforced by judicial officers, both
professional judges and lay justices who,
together with juries in certain cases, are
responsible for deciding disputed cases. The
law also depends on officers of the court who
have general or specialised functions of an
administrative, and sometimes of a judicial,
nature in the courts to which they are
attached.
Judges are legally qualified, being
appointed from the ranks of practising
barristers and advocates or solicitors. They
have independence of office, and can be
removed only in rare and limited
circumstances involving misconduct or
incapacity. They are not subject to ministerial
control or direction. Full-time judges are
generally expected to have previously sat in a
214
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
part-time capacity (for about 15 days a year) in
the same or a similar jurisdiction. There are
approximately 3,500 full and part-time judges,
including District Judges (Magistrates’
Courts), sitting in the civil and criminal courts
in England and Wales plus approximately
10,000 full and part-time judiciary and
members sitting in tribunals handling a range
of disputes and appeals.
Magistrates in England and Wales, and
justices of the peace in Scotland, are trained in
order to give them sufficient knowledge of the
law, including the rules of evidence, and of the
nature and purpose of sentencing. There are
nearly 30,000 lay magistrates working on a
part-time, voluntary basis in England and
Wales and around 260 full and part-time
professional District Judges and Deputy
District Judges (Magistrates’ Courts).fhere
are 4,000 justices of the peace in Scotland. In
Northern Ireland there are 19 resident
magistrates, who are drawn from practising
solicitors or barristers, with powers similar to
those of District Judges (Magistrates’ Courts)
and 18 deputy (part-time) magistrates.
Although people are free to conduct their
own cases if they so wish, barristers (in
Scotland, advocates) and solicitors, or other
authorised litigators, generally represent the
interests of parties to a dispute. There are over
10,000 practising barristers in England and
Wales and around 85,000 practising solicitors.
Scotland has over 400 practising advocates and
some 8,600 solicitors; in Northern Ireland there
are about 450 barristers. Barristers practise as
indiv iduals, but join a group of other barristers,
in Chambers. Advocates in Scotland practise as
individuals; they do not operate from
Chambers and work independently of each
other. Solicitors usually operate in partnership
with other solicitors, unless they are self-
employed. Large firms of solicitors employ not
onl) qualified staff, but also legal executives
and support staff. Certain legal functions may
be performed by non-lawyers—licensed
conveyancers (qualified conveyancers in
Scotland) can act in conveyancing matters (the
transfer of interests in land).
Only barristers and advocates, who are
regarded as specialist court pleaders, have
traditionally had rights of audience in the
higher courts—the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, House of Lords, Court of
Appeal, High Court and Crown Court, High
Court of Justiciary (Scotland) and Court of
Session (Scotland). Legislation in 1990
opened the door for other professional bodies
to apply to become authorised to grant their
members rights of audience in the higher
courts, making it possible for solicitors in
private practice to obtain the same rights of
audience as barristers and advocates. In 1999
the Institute of Legal Executives and the
Chartered Institute of Patent Agents were
authorised to grant rights of audience to their
members. The Access to Justice Act 1999 (not
applicable in Scotland) established the
principle that all barristers and solicitors
should acquire full rights of audience on call
to the Bar or admission to the Roll. It also
allowed suitably qualified emploved barristers
and solicitors to acquire rights of audience in
the higher courts, from which they had
previously been excluded. (See civil justice
reforms, p. 229.)
The Bar Council is the professional body
representing barristers (in Scotland, the
Faculty of Advocates); and the Law Society of
England and Wales, Law Society of Scotland
and Law Society of Northern Ireland represent
solicitors. The profession is self-regulating,
with the professional bodies exercising
disciplinary control over their members.
The Legal Services Ombudsman for
England and Wales oversees the way in which
relevant professional bodies handle complaints
about barristers, solicitors, legal executives,
licensed conveyancers and patent agents. The
Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman performs
a similar task.
Crime in the UK
Crime Statistics
There are two main measures of the scale of
crime in the UK: the recording of crimes by
the police; and surveys which ask
representative samples of the population about
their experiences of crime.
Recorded Crime
Notifiable crimes recorded by the police
broadly cover the more serious offences.

they reported the incident to the police. The
survey therefore provides a measure of those
crimes not reported to, or recorded by, the
police. The latest BCS, published in October
2000, estimated that there were 14.7 million
crimes in 1999, 10% fewer than in 1997.
Burglary was down 21% from 1997 (to its
lowest level since 1991) and theft of vehicles
decreased by 11% from its 1997 level. The
number of violent crimes fell by 4%. The
proportion of people who were victims of
some type of crime once or more during 1999
fell from 34% to 30%.
The 2000 Scottish Crime Survey estimated
that around 845,0000 crimes were committed
against individuals and private households in
Scotland during 1999. This was 13% fewer
than the number estimated in the 1996 survey.
Official estimates put the total impact of
crime in 1999-2000 at around £60 billion;
roughly 30% of this cost represents an
estimate of the value to the victim of the
pain and trauma suffered, while the
remainder reflects actual transactions such
as insurance claims and making good
damage to property. Violent crime
represented almost 40% of the total cost of
crime, compared with 3% of the volume of
crimes committed.
Crime Reduction
In Scotland there were 423,000 crimes
recorded by the police in 2000, a decrease of
3% compared with 1999. The overall crime
clear-up rate was 44%.
Recorded crime in Northern Ireland in
2000-01 totalled 120,000 offences. The overall
clear-up rate was 27%.
Principal Crime Surveys
The British Crime Survey (BCS) is a large
household survey first conducted in 1982,
which has a sample representative of people
aged 16 and over in private households in
England and Wales. The BCS asks
respondents whether they have experienced
certain personal and household crimes in the
preceding year, regardless of whether or not
An aim of the Home Office is to reduce crime
and the fear of crime. It has developed a
Crime Reduction Strategy to tackle crime and
the causes of crime. Crime and Disorder
Reduction Partnerships, set up under the
Crime and Disorder Act 1998, bring together
the police, local authorities and other relevant
agencies to develop strategies in local districts.
A Crime Reduction Programme (CRP)
started in England and Wales in 1999 to run
for three years. This is taking an evidence-
based approach to reducing crime. The CRP
is funding a range of programmes to deliver
crime reduction and to obtain evidence on
what works in tackling crime and its causes. A
website (www.crimereduction.gov.uk) has been
developed with the aim of helping
practitioners around the country and abroad to
216
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
Crime reduction ‘toolkits’ provide web-
based information and advice to Crime and
Disorder Reduction Partnerships. They
cover the main areas of crime and
criminality, and are designed to provide
the Partnerships and their constituent
agencies—including police, local
authorities, probation, health, and the
private and voluntary sectors—with a
practical approach to identifying and
understanding local problems, and
implementing effective strategies to reduce
crime and disorder in their area. The

and local solutions and provide

and funding opportunities.
reduce crime. A number of toolkits (see box)
can be found on the website.
Key elements of the Crime Reduction
Programme include:
around £170 million of investment in
closed-circuit television (CCTV)
surveillance systems in public areas such
as housing estates, shopping centres,
railway stations and car parks;
> crime reduction action teams, set up to
examine problems which affect particular
types of crime (vehicles, retailers and
property crime in general) in their area;
> youth inclusion projects to provide
assistance and support for young people
at risk of offending;
work to help schools develop effective
behaviour management techniques to
deal with disruptive pupils;
^ burglary and targeted policing projects;
and
** initiatives to prevent and identify best
practice in preventing domestic violence
and sexual assault.
Other recent crime reduction initiatives,
building on previous work, include:
** a commitment to reduce domestic
burglary by 25% by 2005;
a commitment to reduce robbery by 14%
in principal cities by 2005; and
^ the setting up of new neighbourhood
wardens schemes to act as a channel of
communication between the community
and the police.
Since April 2000 every police authority and
Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership
has been asked to set five-year targets for the
reduction of two key offences—vehicle crime
and domestic burglary—and five metropolitan
forces have been set the additional target of
reducing street robberies.
Within the Scottish Executive Justice
Department, the Crime Prevention Unit has
responsibility for developing crime prevention,
community safety and domestic abuse policy
on behalf of Scottish Executive ministers. All
32 local councils in Scotland have formed
community safety partnerships. The Scottish
Executive has formed a Scottish Forum on
Community Safety. In Northern Ireland, there
is a Crime Prevention Panel.
Drug and Alcohol Misuse
The UK-wide drugs strategy, launched in
1998 to coordinate the fight against illegal
drugs, has four main elements:
> helping young people resist drug misuse
in order to achieve their full potential in
society;
> protecting communities from drug-
related anti-social and criminal
behaviour;
> enabling people to overcome drug
problems through treatment; and
^ stifling the availability of illegal drugs on
the streets.
Scotland has its own drugs strategy within this
framework and has also introduced national
standards for drugs services.
The Crime and Disorder Act 1998
introduced drug treatment and testing orders,
targeted at persistent offenders (aged 16 and ’
over) with drug problems w ho show a
w illingness to cooperate with treatment. The
orders were introduced in England and Wales
in October 2000 and are currently being
piloted in Scotland. A pilot ‘drug court’ has
been set up in Glasgow to deal specifically
with drugs-related offending (see p. 27).
217
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
The Drugs Prevention Advisory Service
(DPAS) was launched in England and Wales
in April 1999 to promote community-based
drugs prevention at local, regional and
national level in line with the objectives of the
Government’s national strategy. In particular,
the DPAS provides information, advice and
support to local Drug Action 1 earns to
encourage good drugs prevention practice and
promotes prevention policy across
Government. DPAS teams have been
established in each of the nine Government
Regions in England. In an effort to reduce the
availability of drugs in Scotland and to target
organised drug crime, the Scottish Drug
Enforcement Agency was launched in June
2000.
Under provisions in the Criminal Justice
and Court Services Act 2000, the drug-testing
of offenders will be extended across the
criminal justice process. Drug testing will be
introduced at the police station after charge;
under probation supervision through a new
drug abstinence order and as a condition of
other forms of community sentence (see
p. 226); and for offenders released from prison
on licence. Drug test results will also
be used to inform decisions on bail.
In 2001, the Government announced a new
programme to tackle drugs and drug-related
crime in communities—‘Communities Against
Drugs’—and channelled over £200 million to
Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships
with the aim of tackling local drugs markets,
and cutting drug-related crime.
Other recent initiatives have focused on
curbing alcohol misuse, recognised to be a
contributory factor in 40% of all incidents of
violent crime committed in England and
Wales. The programme in England and Wales
has three main objectives:
> reducing the problems arising from
under-age drinking;
> reducing public drunkenness; and
> prevention of alcohol-related violence.
In order to achieve these objectives, there
are tougher regulations on licensing laws
relating to off-licences and pubs giving them,
among other things, more discretionary
powers and responsibilities to restrict the sale
of alcohol to young persons or persons already
intoxicated. Additionally, regulations and
proposals to curb the use of glass bottles as
weapons in incidents of street violence are also
being considered. A plan for action on alcohol
misuse in Scotland will be produced by the
Scottish Executive by the end of 2001.
Countering Terrorism
In order for the UK to be better able to deal with
the threats which terrorism imposes, legislation
was introduced in Parliament in December
1999. The Terrorism Act 2000 came into force
in February 2001. The Act provides for:
> permanent UK-wide anti-terrorist
legislation (to replace the existing
separate pieces of temporary legislation
for Northern Ireland and Great Britain);
> the adoption of a new definition of
terrorism (including ideological and
religious motivation for terrorist acts)
which would extend to domestic and
international terrorism (see below);
> a new offence of inciting terrorist acts
abroad from within the UK;
> new powers to seize suspected terrorist
cash at borders;
> a new judicial authority to consider
applications for extensions of detention
of terrorist suspects; and
> specific offences relating to training for
terrorist activities.
The Terrorism Act 2000 (Proscribed
Organisations) (Amendment) Order 2001
added international organisations to Schedule
2 of the Act (which lists proscribed Terrorist
Organisations) and came into force on
29 March 2001 following approval by both
Houses of Parliament. A total of 21
organisations have been added to Schedule 2,
which also includes 14 organisations
connected to terrorism in Northern
Ireland.
In the light of the terrorist attacks in the
United States in September 2001 (see
p. 93), the Government has announced its
intention to strengthen current counter¬
terrorist legislation.
218
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
Police Service
Government ministers, together with police
authorities and chief constables, are
responsible for providing an effective and
efficient police service in the UK.
Organisation
There are 52 police forces organised on a local
basis—43 in England and Wales, eight in
Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. The
Metropolitan Police Service and the City of
London force are responsible for policing
London. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act
2000 created a new framework for the police
service in Northern Ireland (see p. 19). Each
force in Great Britain has volunteer special
constables who perform police duties in their
spare time, without pay, acting in support of
regular officers. They number about 20,000 in
all (around 12,700 in England and Wales).
Civilian staff in England and Wales number
about 54,600.
Police strength in England and Wales is
about 125,500 (of which the Metropolitan
Police numbers around 25,000). There are just
over 15,100 officers in Scotland and 8,500
(plus 5,000 reserves) in the Northern Ireland
Police Service (formerly called the Royal
Ulster Constabulary—RUC).
Police forces are maintained in England and
Wales by local police authorities. In the 41 police
areas outside London, they normally have 17
members—nine locally elected councillors, three
magistrates and five independent members. In
July 2000 the Home Secretary’s duties as the
police authority for the Metropolitan Police
District were assumed by a new Metropolitan
Police Authority (MPA), the majority of whose
23 members are elected representatives from the
Greater London Assembly (see p. 9). For the
City of London Police Area, the authority is the
Common Council of the Corporation of
London. Police authorities, in consultation with
the chief constables and local community, set
local policing objectives, while the Government
sets ministerial priorities for the police as a
whole. The police authorities in Scotland are
composed of elected councillors. In Northern
Ireland the Secretary of State appoints the newly
formed Police Board.
Police forces are headed by chief constables
(in London the Commissioner of the City of
London Police, and the Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police), appointed by their
police authorities with government approval.
They are responsible for the direction and
control of their forces and for the
appointment, promotion and discipline of
all ranks below assistant chief constable.
On matters of efficiency they are generally
answerable to their police authorities.
Independent inspectors of constabulary
report on the efficiency and effectiveness of
police forces.
National Crime Bodies
The National Criminal Intelligence Service
(NCIS), which was put on an independent
statutory footing in 1998, has the leading role
in collecting and analysing criminal
intelligence for use by police forces and other
law enforcement agencies in the UK. It has a
headquarters and South East regional office in
London, five other regional offices in England
and offices in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
NCIS coordinates the activities of the Security
Services in support of the law enforcement
agencies against organised crime, and liaises
with the International Criminal Police
Organisation (INTERPOL), which promotes
international cooperation between police
forces. It also provides the channel for
communication between the UK and
EUROPOL (see p. 93).
In 1998 a National Crime Squad, with 1,400
officers, replaced six regional crime squads in
England and W ales. Its role is to prevent and
detect organised and serious crime across police
force and national boundaries and to support
provincial forces in their investigation of
serious crime. The Scottish Crime Squad
performs the same function in Scotland. The
two organisations are each headed by a Director
General, who is accountable to a body known as
the Service Authorities.
Forensic Science Service (FSS)
The FSS, a Home Office executive agency,
provides scientific support in the investigation
of crime to police forces in England and Wales
219
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
through six regional laboratories. It also
operates the national DNA database, which
provides intelligence information to police
forces by matching DNA profdes taken from
suspects to profiles from samples left at the
scenes of crime. In Scotland forensic science
services are provided by four regional
laboratories. The largest of these is based in
Dundee. Northern Ireland has its own
laboratory.
Powers and Procedures
England and Wales
Police powers and procedures are defined by
legislation and accompanying codes of
practice. Evidence obtained in breach of the
codes may be ruled inadmissible in court. I he
codes must be available in all police stations.
> Stop and search—Police officers can stop
and search people and vehicles if they
reasonably suspect that they will find
stolen goods, offensive weapons or
implements that could be used for
burglary and other offences. An officer
must record the grounds for the search,
and anything found, and the person
stopped is entitled to a copy of the
officer’s report. Some 857,200 stop and
searches were carried out by the police in
England and Wales in 1999—2000.
> Arrest—The police may arrest a suspect
on a warrant issued by a court, but can
arrest without a warrant for arrestable
offences (for which the sentence is fixed
by law or for which the term of
imprisonment is five years or more).
> Detention and questioning—Suspects must
be cautioned before the police can ask
any questions about an offence. For
arrestable offences, a suspect can be
detained in police custody without charge
for up to 24 hours. Someone suspected of
a serious arrestable offence can be held for
up to 96 hours, but not beyond 36 hours
unless a warrant is obtained from a
magistrates’ court. If someone thinks that
his or her detention is unlawful, he or she
may apply to the High Court for a writ of
habeas corpus against the person
responsible, requiring them to appear
before the court to justify the detention.
Habeas corpus proceedings take
precedence over others.
> Charging—Once there is sufficient
evidence, the police have to decide
whether a detained person should be
charged with an offence. If the police
institute criminal proceedings against a
suspect, the Crown Prosecution Service
(see p. 223) then takes control of the case.
Scotland and Northern Ireland
The police in Scotland can arrest someone
without a warrant, under wide common law
powers, if suspects are seen or reported as
committing a crime or are a danger to
themselves or others. They also have specific
statutory powers of arrest for some offences.
In other cases they may apply to a justice of
the peace for a warrant. As in England and
Wales, Scottish police have powers to enter a
building without a warrant if they are
pursuing someone who has committed, or
attempted to commit, a serious crime. A court
can grant the police a warrant to search
premises for stated items in connection with a
crime, again as in England and Wales. The
police may search anyone suspected of
carrying an offensive weapon. Someone
suspected of an imprisonable offence may be
held for police questioning without being
arrested, but for no more than six hours
without being charged. If arrested, suspects
must be charged and cautioned. The case is
then referred to the procurator fiscal (see
p. 230).
The law in Northern Ireland relating to
police powers in the investigation of crime and
to evidence in criminal proceedings is similar
to that in force in England and Wales.
Firearms
The policy in Great Britain is that the police
should not generally be armed but that there
should be specialist firearms officers, deployed
on the authority of a senior officer where an
operational need arises. In 1999-2000 there
were over 11,000 operations in Great Britain
220
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
where firearms were issued to the police. Most
forces operate armed response vehicles to
contain firearms incidents. In Northern
Ireland police officers are issued with firearms
for their personal protection.
Police Discipline
An officer may be prosecuted if suspected of a
criminal offence. Officers are also subject to a
code of conduct. If found guilty of breaching
the code, an officer can be dismissed. There is
a civil standard of proof at police disciplinary
hearings; a fast-track procedure to deal with
officers caught committing serious criminal
offences; and separate formal procedures for
dealing w ith unsatisfactory performance.
Complaints
Members of the public can make complaints
against the police if they feel that they have
been treated unfairly or improperly. In
England and Wales the investigation of the
more serious cases is supervised by the Police
Complaints Authority. In 1999-2000, over 800
of the 30,000 complaints received by police
forces were supervised by the Authority. Less
than 3% of all complaints wrere substantiated.
The Government intends to introduce
legislation in the current session which will
establish a new' complaints system and a newr
Independent Police Complaints Commission
(IPCC) by April 2003. Unlike the Police
Complaints Authority, the IPCC w ill have its
own investigating teams, independent from
the police. In Scotland complaints of
misconduct against police officers are overseen
by chief constables. Police authorities have
statutory responsibility for dealing w ith
complaints against chief officers. Allegations
of criminal misconduct are referred to the
procurator fiscal for investigation. HM
Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland also
considers representations from complainants
dissatisfied with the way the police have
handled their complaints. A consultation
paper with proposals for strengthening the
independence of the police complaints system
in Scotland w as published in July 2001. In
Northern Ireland the Independent
Commission for Police Complaints has been
superseded by a Police Ombudsman.
Community Relations
\\ ithin every police authority there are
police/community liaison consultative
arrangements, involving representatives from
the police, local government and community
groups. Home Office and police service
initiatives have sought to ensure that racist
crime is treated as a police priority.
The Government is committed to a policy
of ensuring that the police service is
representative of society. In 1999, the
Government set employment targets for the
recruitment, retention and progression of
minority ethnic officers in England and Wales.
The targets are intended to ensure that by
2009 forces w ill reflect their local minority
ethnic population. On 31 March 2001 there
were 2,955 officers from minority ethnic
backgrounds (representing 2.4% of the police
service in England and Wales). The
corresponding figure for Scotland is about
/0 (less than 1% of police numbers).
Measures introduced to promote better
relations betw een the police and the
communities they serve include:
> an extension of the race relations
legislation—through the Race Relations
(Amendment) Act 2000. This makes
direct and indirect discrimination in all
public authorities unlawful, and places a
duty on public authorities to promote
race equality;
> citizenship classes in schools, to be
introduced into the National Curriculum
(see p. 132) in England and Wales in
2002, to ensure that pupils are taught
about the cultural diversity of
Britain;
> enforcing specific criminal offences of
racially aggravated violence, harassment
and criminal damage; and
> a programme to reform the use by the
police of their pow ers to stop and search
people (w ith the aim of ensuring these
powers are used fairly).

system can be found on the Home Office

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Legal System in England
and Wales
Various government departments, agencies
and individuals share the responsibility of
administering the system which dispenses
justice in England and Wales. Most Acts of
Parliament and the common law apply equally
in both countries, although since devolution
some legislation has applied differently in
Wales.
The Lord Chancellor heads the judiciary and
sits as a member of the judicial committee of
the House of Lords. He also presides over the
upper House in its law-making role, and, as a
senior Cabinet minister, is in charge of the
Lord Chancellor’s Department. This
Department has overall responsibility (through
the Court Service) for the court system in
England and Wales, which includes the
Supreme Court—comprising the Court of
Appeal, High Court and Crown Court—the
county courts and some tribunals. The Lord
Chancellor advises the Crown on the
appointment of all senior judges in England
and Wales, and appoints most other judges and
magistrates, consulting national executives and
Senior Judiciary in Scotland and Wales where
appropriate for tribunal appointments. In
addition, he has policy responsibility for locally
managed magistrates’ courts and responsibility
for the civil justice process; promoting general
reforms of the civil law; and arrangements for
publicly financed legal services. He is also
responsible for open government, including
freedom of information and data protection;
royal, Church and hereditary issues and Lords
Lieutenants; Crown Dependencies and human
rights issues.
The Home Secretary has overall
responsibility for criminal law, the police
service, the prison system, the probation
service, and for advising the Crown on the
exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy.
The Attorney-General and the Solicitor-
General are the Government’s main legal
advisers, providing advice on a range of legal
matters, including proposed legislation. They
may also represent the Crown in difficult or
publicly important domestic and international
cases. In addition to his various civil law
functions, the Attorney-General has final
responsibility for enforcing the criminal law.
The Solicitor-General is the Attorney-
General’s deputy.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS—see
p. 223) is headed by the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP), who reports to the
Attorney-General. Other prosecuting
authorities include the Serious Fraud Office
(see p. 224), which also answers to the
Attorney-General, and bodies such as the
Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise
Commissioners, local authorities and trading
standards departments which prosecute cases
in their own discrete areas of work. Individual
citizens may bring private prosecutions for
most crimes, but some need the consent of the
Attorney-General and these may be taken over
by the DPP.
The four Heads of Division and other
senior members of the judiciary may perform
specific administrative functions. The Lord
Chief Justice of England and Wales,1 for
example, has some responsibilities for the
organisation and work of the criminal courts,
including issuing practice directions to the
courts and members of the legal professions
on criminal law and court procedures.
Individual judges may be asked to carry out
specific duties such as chairing a national
inquiry, while other functions are performed
by statutory committees comprising legal
professionals and lay representatives. The
Civil Procedure Rule Committee is
responsible for making rules that govern the
civil justice process.
Executive bodies or agencies such as the
Prison Service and the Forensic Science
Service manage their own functions. Since
1998 the Youth Justice Board for England and
Wales has monitored the youth justice system,
promoted good practice and advised the Home
Secretary on its operation and the setting of
national standards.
In addition, a wide range of other statutory
and non-statutory advisory bodies gives
advice to the Government. These include
1 The Lord Chief Justice presides over the Criminal Division of
the Court of Appeal and the Queen’s Bench Division of the
High Court, and ranks second only to the Lord Chancellor in
the judicial hierarchy.

Figure 14.2:
The Prosecution Process
1 Although the majority of prosecutions are handled by the Crown Prosecution Service, other organisations can also bring prosecutions.
A case will be under continued review, and may be discontinued at any stage before the hearing at the magistrates’ court or the
prosecution may offer no evidence. In addition, the charge may be altered up to the final decision of the court.
Magistrates may commit to the Crown Court for sentence.
Derived from Figure 1.2 in A Guide to the Criminal Justice System in England and Wales, Home Office, 2000
the police inspectorates, the magistrates’
courts service, the probation service, the
Audit Commission, the Criminal Justice
Consultative Committee, law reform bodies
such as the Law Commission and ad hoc
Royal Commissions and departmental
committees.
PROSECUTION AND THE
CRIMINAL COURTS
Prosecution Arrangements
Crown Prosecution Service
The CPS is responsible for prosecuting people
in England and Wales who have been charged
223
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
by the police with a criminal offence.
Although it works closely with the police, it is
a governmental body independent of them.
With headquarters in London and York, the
service comprises 42 geographical Areas.
These correspond to the 43 police forces in
England and Wales, with the CPS London
Area covering the operational boundaries of
both City of London and Metropolitan Police
Forces. Each Area is headed by a Chief Crown
Prosecutor (CCP) supported by an Area
Business Manager. The role of the CPS is to:
> advise the police on possible
prosecutions;
> review prosecutions started by the police
to ensure that the right defendants are
prosecuted on the correct charges before
the appropriate court;
> prepare cases for court;
> prosecute cases at magistrates’ courts;
and
> instruct counsel to prosecute cases in the
Crown Court and higher courts.2
When deciding on whether to go ahead with a
case, Crown Prosecutors must first be satisfied
that there is enough evidence to provide a
realistic prospect of conviction against each
defendant on each charge. If there is enough
evidence, prosecutors must then decide
whether it is in the public interest to proceed.
A prosecution will usually take place unless
there are public interest factors against it
clearly outweighing those in favour.
Serious Fraud Office
The Serious Fraud Office prosecutes cases of
serious or complex fraud, with teams of
lawyers, accountants, police officers and other
specialists conducting investigations. The
Office has wide powers that go beyond those
normally available to the police and
prosecuting authorities.
Initial Stages
For minor offences, the police may decide to
caution an offender rather than prosecute.
2 Under a change in legal rules, a number of CPS lawyers are
now qualified to appear in some cases in the Crown Court and
other higher courts.
A caution is not the same as a conviction,
and will not be given unless the person
admits the offence. Under the Crime and
Disorder Act 1998, cautioning for young
offenders has been replaced with the final
warning scheme.
If the police decide to charge someone, that
person may be released on bail to attend a
magistrates’ court. If not granted police bail,
the defendant must be brought before a
magistrates’ court (or, if under 18, a youth
court) as soon as possible. There is a general
right to bail, but magistrates may withhold it if
there are grounds for believing that an accused
person would run away, commit an offence,
interfere with a witness or otherwise get in the
way of justice. If bail is refused, an accused
person has the right to apply again, subject to
some limitations, to the Crown Court or to a
High Court judge. In certain circumstances,
the prosecution may appeal to a Crown Court
judge against the granting of bail by
magistrates.
Once a person has been charged, it is for
the CPS to decide whether the case should
proceed.
Criminal Courts
There are two types of criminal offences.
Summary offences are the least serious and may
be tried only in a magistrates’ court. Indictable
offences are subdivided into 'indictable-only'
(such as murder, manslaughter or robbery)
which must be tried on indictment3 at the
Crown Court by judge and jury, and ‘either-
way’, which may be tried either summarily or
on indictment. Under a new procedure
introduced in January 2001, indictable-only
cases are sent straight to the Crown Court
from an initial appearance before the
magistrates. The defence may, if it wishes,
challenge the prosecution case as soon as it has
been served by making an application to the
judge for the case to be dismissed.
Either-way offences, such as theft and
burglary, can vary greatly in seriousness and a
magistrates’ court must decide whether the
3 An indictment is a written accusation against a person, charging
him or her with serious crime triable by jury.
224
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
case is serious enough to be sent to the Crown
Court. If the magistrates decide in favour of
summary trial, however, the accused person
has the right to a trial by jury in the Crown
Court if he or she chooses.
Where an either-way case is to be tried on
indictment, the magistrates’ court commits it
to the Crown Court for trial if it is satisfied
that there is a case to answer. In most cases
this is accepted by the defence and the
magistrates do not need to consider the
evidence, but if the defence challenges the
case, the magistrates consider the
documentary evidence—without witnesses
being called. In 1999, 1.9 million defendants
were dealt with by magistrates’ courts, while
77,000 were dealt with in the Crown Court.
A magistrates’ court usually comprises three
representatives of the local community who do
not have professional legal qualifications,
known as lay magistrates or justices of the peace
(JPs). They sit with a court clerk who advises
them on law and procedure. In some areas a
paid professional District Judge (Magistrates’
Courts) sits alone instead of the JPs. District
Judges (Magistrates’ Courts) are becoming
more common, although most cases are still
dealt with by lay magistrates.
Magistrates’ courts committees (MCCs),
made up of magistrates selected by their
colleagues, are responsible for running the
magistrates’ courts service locally. During
2000-01 the MCCs were reorganised and their
number reduced, improving efficiency and
bringing their boundaries into closer
alignment with those of other criminal justice
agencies, such as the police and the CPS.
Youth courts are specialist magistrates’
courts, which sit separately from those dealing
with adults. They handle all but the most
serious charges against people aged at least ten
(the age of criminal responsibility) and under
18. Young offenders may also be tried in an
adult magistrates’ court or in a Crown Court,
depending on the type of offence they have
committed. Only JPs who have been specially
trained for the job sit in youth courts.
Proceedings are held in private.
The Crown Court sits at about 90 venues,
in six regional areas called circuits, and is
presided over by High Court judges, circuit
judges and part-time recorders. The type of
judge dealing with a case and instructing the
jury of 12 members of the general public will
depend on which Crown Court the case is
being heard in. Not all Crown Courts handle
cases of the same level of seriousness.
An independent review of the practices and
procedures of, and the rules of evidence
applied by, the criminal courts in England and
Wales was announced by the Lord Chancellor
in December 1999. A report on its findings is
expected to be published in autumn 2001.
Trial
The prosecution and the defence form the two
opposing sides in criminal trials. The law
presumes an accused person is innocent until
proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt by the
prosecution. Accused people have a right at all
stages to stay silent; however, when
questioned, failure to mention facts which
they later rely upon in their defence may not
be helpful to their case. There are rules
governing the pre-trial disclosure of material
by both the prosecution and the defence. A
judge may, in a case to be tried on indictment,
hold a preliminary hearing, where pleas of
guilty or not guilty are taken. If the defendant
pleads guilty, the judge will simply decide
upon the appropriate sentence. If a not guilty
plea is entered, the prosecution and defence
are expected to help the judge identify the key
issues and provide any additional information
required for the proper and efficient trial of
the case.
Criminal trials normally take place in open
court (that is, members of the public and press
are allowed to hear the proceedings, unless
there are specific reasons why this would not
be appropriate) and it is the prosecution’s job
to prove their case. Strict rules of evidence
govern how this may be done. Certain types of
evidence may be excluded because they could
be prejudicial or unreliable. Written
statements by witnesses are allowed with the
consent of the other party or in limited
circumstances at the discretion of the court.
Otherwise evidence is taken from witnesses
testifying orally on oath. Child witnesses may
testify without taking the oath and their
evidence must be received by the court unless
the child is incapable of giving intelligible
225
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
testimony. A child in some circumstances can
testify via a live TV link or the court may
consider a video-recorded interview, subject
to the defence having the right to question the
child in cross-examination.
Helping Victims and Witnesses
In England and Wales a government-funded
organisation, Victim Support, provides
practical help and emotional support to
victims of crime with the help of around
16,000 volunteers. It also runs the Witness
Service, which advises victims and other
witnesses attending Crown Court centres (and
is developing similar services in magistrates’
courts). Victim Support Scotland provides a
volunteer-based service similar to that
provided by Victim Support in England and
Wales. A separate scheme operates in
Northern Ireland.
In 1998 the Government published a
report—Speaking up for Justice—on
improving the treatment of witnesses
(including children) who become involved in
the criminal justice system in England and
Wales. Twenty-six of the report’s
recommendations required statutory force
and were included in the \outh Justice and
Criminal Evidence Act 1999. The
implementation plan includes the provision of
pagers for intimidated witnesses, new rules on
cross-examination and evidence, and practical
help and protection for vulnerable witnesses
(including children).
Blameless victims of violent crime in
England, Wales and Scotland may be eligible
for compensation from public funds under the
Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. In
Northern Ireland there are separate statutory
arrangements for compensation for criminal
injuries, and for malicious damage to property.
The Jury
In jury trials the judge decides questions of
law, sums up the case to the jury, and
discharges or sentences the accused. The jury
is responsible for deciding questions of fact.
The jury’s verdict may be ‘guilty’ or ‘not
guilty’ and the latter would result in an
acquittal. Juries may, subject to certain
conditions, reach a verdict by a majority of at
least 10—2.
If an accused person is acquitted, there is
no right of appeal from the prosecution, and
the accused cannot be tried again for that same
offence. However, an acquittal may be set
aside and a retrial ordered if there is proof that
a juror has been interfered with or
intimidated.
A jury is independent of the judiciary and
any attempt to interfere with its members is a
criminal offence. People aged between 18 and
70 whose names appear on the electoral
register are liable to be chosen at random for
jury service. Various occupations, such as
police officers, lawyers and doctors, are
exempted from serving.
Sentencing
The court will sentence the offender after
considering all the relevant information it has
on the case, which may include a pre-sentence
or any other specialist report, and a mitigating
plea by the defence. Magistrates may impose a
fine of up to £5,000 and/or a maximum
sentence of six months’ imprisonment, but
can send the offender to the Crown Court if
they feel their sentencing powers are not
sufficient.
Taking away someone’s freedom is only
done where the offence is so serious that this
action alone is justified. In 1999, 8% of males
and 3% of females found guilty of all offences
were given a custodial sentence. A term of up
to two years’ imprisonment may be
suspended. Courts are required to impose
minimum three-year sentences on offenders
convicted of a third offence of domestic
burglary. A second serious violent or sexual
offence requires a court to order a life sentence
unless there are exceptional circumstances.
Life imprisonment is the mandatory sentence
for murder, and is also available for certain
other serious offences. The death penalty is no
longer available for any offence; it has not
been used in the United Kingdom since 1965.
Community sentences may include
community rehabilitation orders (involving
supervision in the community—see p. 235);
community punishment orders (unpaid work
within the community); community
226
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
punishment and rehabilitation orders
(elements of both probation supervision and
community service work); curfew orders
(requiring the offender to remain at a specified
place for specified periods, usually monitored
by electronic tagging); and drug treatment and
testing orders (see p. 217). The Criminal
Justice and Court Services Act 2000 contained
two new measures: drug abstinence orders,
which require an offender to abstain from
misusing Class A drugs and to undertake
drugs tests on instruction; and exclusion
orders (likely to be monitored by electronic
tagging) requiring offenders to stay away from
a certain place for specified periods. Both
types of order are to be piloted during 2001
before being introduced nationally.
A fine is the most common punishment,
and most offenders are fined for summary
offences. A court may also make compensation
orders, which require the offender to pay
compensation for personal injury, loss or
damage resulting from an offence; or impose a
conditional discharge, where the offender, if
he or she offends again, may be sentenced for
both the original offence and for the new one.
In May 2000 the Government announced a
review of the legal framework for sentencing
and its impact on reducing re-offending. The
review—the Halliday Report—was published
in May 2001. It made wide-ranging proposals,
including increased severity of sentencing of
persistent offenders, and restructuring of
sentences under 12 months.
Sentencing Young Offenders
The main custodial sentence for 12 to 17 year
olds is the detention and training order which
was introduced in April 2000 and replaced
detention in a young offender institution and
the secure training order. It is a two-part
sentence which combines a period of custody
with a period under supervision in the
community. It may last for a minimum of four
months to a maximum of two years and there
is provision for the custodial element to be
shortened or lengthened depending on the
young offender’s progress.
Offenders under 18 convicted of certain
serious offences may be detained for a period
not exceeding the maximum term of
imprisonment which would be available for
that offence in the case of an adult. Those
convicted of murder are detained ‘during Her
Majesty’s pleasure’—the equivalent of a life
sentence in the case of an adult.
Non-custodial penalties include: conditional
discharge-, fines and compensation orders (with
the offender’s parents having to pay);
supervision orders (where the offender must
comply with specific requirements, such as
staying in local authority accommodation);
and attendance centre orders. Those aged 16 or
17 may also be given the same community
rehabilitation, community punishment,
community punishment and rehabilitation,
drug treatment and testing, curfew and
exclusion orders as older offenders. From
February 2001 the courts have been able to
sentence offenders aged 10-15 to a curfew
order with electronic tagging. This was
previously only available for offenders aged 16
or over.
Other new orders are also available,
including a reparation order, which requires
young offenders to compensate the victim(s)
of their offence or the community which they
have harmed in some non-financial way; and
an action plan order, making them comply with
an individually tailored programme intended
to alter their offending behaviour.
Complementing these are parenting orders,
which require a parent or guardian to attend
counselling and guidance sessions, and may
direct them to comply with other
requirements; and child safety orders, which
place a child under ten who is at risk of
becoming involved in crime or is behaving in
an anti-social manner under the supervision of
a specified, responsible officer.
Prohibitive anti-social behaviour orders
(ASBOs) may be applied to individuals or
groups whose threatening and disruptive
conduct harasses the local community.
Anyone in breach of such an order is guilty of
a criminal offence. ASBOs and sex offender
orders are applicable throughout the UK. By
the end of March 2001, around 215 ASBOs
had been issued.
A young offender convicted in court for the
first time and pleading guilty may be
sentenced to a referral order where an absolute
discharge or custodial sentence is not
227
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
appropriate. These orders are being piloted in
seven areas in England and Wales. The
offender is referred to a panel of two
community volunteers and a member of the
Youth Offending Team who agree a
programme of activity aimed primarily at
preventing re-offending. The target date for
national implementation of referral orders is
April 2002.
Appeals
A person convicted by a magistrates’ court may
appeal to the High Court, on points of law, and
to the Crown Court, for their trial to be re¬
heard. Appeals from the Crown Court go to
the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). A
further appeal can be made to the House of
Lords on points of law of public importance, if
permission is given. A prosecutor cannot
appeal against an acquittal, but there is a
system for reviewing rulings of law and
sentences which are too lenient. The Criminal
Cases Review Commission, which is
independent of both government and the
courts, reviews alleged miscarriages of justice
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Referral of a case to this body depends on some
new argument or evidence coming to light, not
previously raised at the trial or on appeal.
Coroners’ Courts
The coroner (usually a senior lawyer or
doctor) must hold an inquest if a person died a
violent or unnatural death, or died suddenly
while in prison or in other specified
circumstances. He or she may also need to
hold an inquest if the cause of death remains
unknown following a post-mortem
examination. The coroner’s court establishes
how, when and where the death occurred. A
coroner may sit alone or, in certain
circumstances, with a jury.
CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM
Jurisdiction in civil matters is split between
the High Court and the county courts and, to
a limited extent, magistrates’ courts. Some
90% of all cases are dealt with by the county
courts, but most civil disputes do not go to
court at all, and most of those which do, do
not reach a trial. Many are dealt with through
statutory or voluntary complaints mechanisms,
or through mediation and negotiation.
Arbitration is common in commercial and
building disputes. Ombudsmen have the power
to determine complaints in the public sector,
and, on a voluntary basis, in some private sector
activities (for example, banking, insurance and
pensions).
A large number of tribunals exist to
determine disputes. Most deal with cases that
involve the rights of private citizens against
decisions of the State in areas such as social
security, income tax and mental health. Some
tribunals deal with other disputes, such as
employment. In all, there are some 70
tribunals which together deal with over
1 million cases a year.
Courts
The High Court is divided into three
Divisions:
> The Queen’s Bench Division deals with
disputes relating to contracts, general
commercial matters (in a specialist
Commercial Court), and breaches of
duty—known as ‘liability in tort’—
(covering general civil wrongs, such as
accidents caused by negligence, or
defamation of character). The
Administrative Court has special
responsibility for dealing with
applications for judicial review of the
actions of public bodies, and has the
power to declare the action of a public
individual, department or body unlawful.
> The Chancery Division deals with
disputes relating to land, wills,
companies and insolvency.
> The Family Division deals with
matrimonial matters, including divorce,
and the welfare of children.
About 220 county courts handle claims in
contract and in tort (of these, 179 deal with
family issues including divorce and the welfare
of children) and a wide range of statutory
matters. The majority of claims dealt with
concern the recovery and collection of debt.
The next most common types of claims relate
228
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
to recovery of land and personal injury.
Magistrates’ courts have limited civil
jurisdiction: in family matters (when they sit
as a Family Proceedings Court) and in
miscellaneous civil orders.
Appeals in most civil cases were reformed
by the Access to Justice Act 1999 (see below).
Appeals from magistrates’ courts in civil
matters go to the High Court, on matters of
law, or to the Crown Court, if the case is to be
re-heard. A further appeal on points of law of
public importance goes to the House of
Lords.
Reform of the Civil Justice System
Changes to the civil justice system were
implemented in 1999, introducing:
> a unified code of procedural rules,
replacing separate sets for the High
Court and county court and enabling
both to deal with cases more
appropriately. Courts now take a more
active case management role than before,
handling them in a way which is
proportionate to their value, complexity
and importance;
> pre-action protocols (for clinical
negligence, personal injury, construction
and other professional negligence
disputes), which set standards and
timetables for the conduct of cases before
court proceedings are started; and
> a system of three tracks to which
disputed claims are assigned bv a judge
according to the value and complexity of
the case. These are the:
small claims track, for cases worth less
than ^5,000, at an informal hearing by a
district judge;
fast track, for cases from £5,000 to
£15,000, setting a fixed timetable from
allocation to trial; and
—multi-track, for cases worth over
£15,000 or of unusual complexity, which
are supervised by a judge and given
timetables tailored to each case.
Judges have a key role in reducing cost,
delay and complexity, by managing cases to
ensure that people going to law and their
representatives keep to the timetable, and
undertake only necessary work.
The Access to Justice Act 1999 reformed
the workings of the appeals system according
to the principles of proportionality and
efficiency, by:
> diverting from the Court of Appeal those
cases which, by their nature, do not
require the attention of the most senior
judges in the country; and
> making various changes to the working
methods and constitution of the Court,
which will enable it to allocate its
resources more effectively.
The Civil Justice Council oversees the
working of the civil justice system, and makes
proposals for its improvement.
Legal System in Scotland
Scots law has legal principles, rules and
concepts modelled on a combination of
medieval church laws and those borrowed
from other European systems. The main
sources are judge-made law, certain legal
treatises having ‘institutional’ authority,
legislation, and EC law. The first two sources
are sometimes referred to as the common law
of Scotland. Legislation, as in the rest of the
UK, consists of statutes (Acts of Parliament)
or subordinate legislation authorised by
Parliament.
PROSECUTION AND THE
CRIMINAL COURTS
Awaiting Trial
Y\ hen arrested, an accused person may be
released by the police to await summons, on
an undertaking to appear in court at a
specified time, or be held in custody to
appear in court on the next working day.
Following that appearance, the accused may¬
be remanded in custody until trial or
released by the court on bail. If released on
bail, he or she must agree to appear at trial
when required, not to commit an offence
229
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
while on bail, and not to interfere with
witnesses or obstruct justice. There is a right
of appeal to the High Court against the refusal
of bail, or by the prosecutor against the
granting of bail, or against the conditions
imposed.
Prosecution Arrangements
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal
Service provides Scotland’s independent
public prosecution and deaths investigation
service. The Department is headed by the
Lord Advocate, assisted by the Solicitor-
General for Scotland (who are the Scottish
Law Officers and members of the Scottish
Executive). The Crown Agent, a senior civil
servant, is responsible for the running of the
Department.
Procurators fiscal and Crown Office
officials prepare prosecutions in the High
Court which are conducted by the Lord
Advocate and the Solicitor-General for
Scotland; they in turn delegate the bulk of
their work to advocates depute, collectively
known as Crown Counsel, of whom there are
13. In all other criminal courts the decision to
prosecute is made, and prosecution carried
out, by procurators fiscal, who are the Lord
Advocate’s local representatives (one for each
sheriff court). They are lawyers and full-time
civil servants subject to the direction of the
Department.
The police report gives details of alleged
crimes to the local procurator fiscal who has
discretion whether or not to prosecute. He or
she may receive instructions from the Crown
Counsel on behalf of the Lord Advocate.
The office of coroner does not exist in
Scotland. Instead the local procurator fiscal
inquires into sudden or suspicious deaths.
When appropriate, a fatal accident inquiry
may be held before the sheriff; this is
mandatory in cases of death resulting from
industrial accidents and deaths in custody.
Criminal Courts
There are three criminal courts in Scotland:
the High Court of Justiciary, the sheriff court
and the district court. Cases are heard under
one of two types of criminal procedure:
> In solemn procedure in both the High
Court of Justiciary and the sheriff court,
an accused person’s trial takes place
before a judge sitting with a jury of 15
people selected at random from the
general public. As in England and Wales,
the alleged offence is set out in a
document called an indictment. The
judge decides questions of law and the
jury decides questions of fact and may
reach a decision by a simple majority.
They may decide to find the accused
‘guilty’, ‘not guilty’ or ‘not proven’; the
last two are acquittals and have the effect
that the accused cannot be tried again for
the same offence.
> In summary procedure in sheriff and
district courts, the judge sits without a
jury and decides questions of both fact
and law. The offence charged is set out in
a document called a summary complaint.
Pre-trial hearings (called ‘diets’) in summary
and solemn cases are intended to establish the
state of readiness of both the defence and the
prosecution.
The High Court of Justiciary is the supreme
criminal court in Scotland, sitting in
Edinburgh, Glasgow and on circuit in other
towns. It tries the most serious crimes and has
exclusive jurisdiction in cases involving
murder, treason and rape.
The 49 sheriff courts deal mainly with less
serious offences committed within their area
of jurisdiction. These courts are organised in
six sheriffdoms; at the head of each is a sheriff
principal. There are over 100 permanent
sheriffs, most of whom are appointed to
particular courts. The sheriff has jurisdiction
in both summary and solemn criminal cases.
Under summary procedure, the sheriff may
impose prison sentences of up to three months
(although more in some cases) or a fine of
.£5,000. Under solemn procedure, the sheriff
may impose imprisonment for up to three
years and unlimited financial penalties, and
has an additional power of remit to the High
Court of Justiciary if he or she thinks a heavier
sentence should be imposed. The sheriff also
has available a range of non-custodial
sentences, principally community service and
probation.
230
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
District courts, which deal with minor
offences, are the administrative responsibility
of the local authority. The longest prison
sentence which can be imposed is generally
60 days and the maximum fine is £2,500. The
bench of a district court will usually be made
up of one or more Justices of the Peace. A
local authority may also appoint a stipendiary
magistrate, who must be a professional lawyer
of at least five years’ standing, and who has the
same summary criminal jurisdiction and
powers as a sheriff. At present, only Glasgow
has stipendiary magistrates sitting in the
district court. A government review of the
operation of the district courts was announced
in May 2000.
Sentencing
In Scotland a court must obtain a social
enquiry report before imposing a custodial
sentence if the accused is aged under 21 or has
not previously served a custodial sentence. A
report is also required before making a
probation or community service order, or in
cases involving people already subject to
supervision.
Non-custodial sentences available to the
courts include fines, probation orders,
community service orders, restriction of
liberty orders (monitored by electronic
tagging) and supervised attendance orders
(which provide an alternative to imprisonment
for non-payment of fines, and incorporate
aspects of work and training).
Children
Criminal proceedings may be brought against
any child aged eight or over, but the
instructions of the Lord Advocate are
necessary before anyone under 16 years of age
is prosecuted. Most children under 16 who
have committed an offence or are considered
to be in need of care and protection may be
brought before a Children’s Hearing. The
hearing, consisting of three people who are not
lawyers, determines whether compulsory
measures of care are required and, if so, the
form they should take.
Young people aged between 16 and 21
serve custodial sentences in young offender
institutions. Remission of part of the sentence
for good behaviour, release on parole and
supervision on release are available.
Appeals
The High Court of Justiciary sits as the
Scottish Court of Criminal Appeal. In both
solemn and summary procedure, a convicted
person may appeal against conviction, or
sentence, or both. The Court may authorise a
retrial if it sets aside a conviction. There is no
appeal from this court in criminal cases. The
Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission
is responsible for considering alleged
miscarriages of justice and referring cases
meeting the relevant criteria to the Court of
Appeal for review.
CIVIL COURTS
The main civil courts are the Court of Session
(the supreme court, subject to appeal only to
the House of Lords in London) and sheriff
court (the principal local court).
The Court of Session sits in Edinburgh, and
may hear cases from the outset or on transfer
from sheriff courts and tribunals on appeal.
A leading principle of the court is that cases
starting there are both prepared for decision,
and decided, by judges sitting alone whose
decisions are subject to review by several
judges. The total number of judges is 32, of
whom 24, called Lords Ordinary, mainly
decide cases in the first instance. This branch
of the court is called the Outer House. The
other eight judges are divided into two
divisions of four judges each, forming the
Inner House. The First Division is presided
over by the Lord President of the Court of
Session and the Second Division by the Lord
Justice-Clerk. The main business of each
division is to review, on appeal, the decisions
of the Lords Ordinary or inferior courts.
In addition to its criminal jurisdiction, the
sheriff court deals with most civil law cases in
Scotland. There is, with very few exceptions,
no upper limit to the financial level with
which the court can deal, and a broad range of
remedies can be granted. Cases may include
debts, contracts, reparation, rent restrictions,
231
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
actions affecting the use of property, leases
and tenancies, child protection issues and
family actions. There is a right of appeal in
some cases from the sheriff to the sheriff
principal and then, in some cases, to the Court
of Session.
The House of Lords hears relatively few
appeals in civil matters from Scotland but,
since devolution, the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council (JCPC) has had jurisdiction
to consider disputes involving devolution
issues. When dealing with Scottish cases, the
JCPC usually includes at least two Scottish
judges and can sit in London or elsewhere as
appropriate.
Civil Proceedings
The formal proceedings in the Court of
Session are started by serving the defender
with a summons or, in sheriff court cases in
ordinary actions, an initial writ. A defender
who intends to contest the action must inform
the court; if he or she fails to do so, the court
normally grants a decree in absence in favour
of the pursuer. Where a case is contested, both
parties must prepare written pleadings, after
which a hearing will normally be arranged.
In summary cause actions involving sums
between £750 and £1,500 in the sheriff court,
a summons incorporates a statement of claim.
The procedure is designed to let most actions
be settled without the parties having to appear
in court. Normally, they, or their
representatives, need appear only when an
action is defended.
In cases below £750 a special small claim
procedure allows those who do not have legal
advice to raise claims themselves. The
procedures are similar to, but less formal than,
the summary cause procedure. In addition to
the courts, there is a wide range of tribunals
which administer justice in special types of
case. Many of these are the same as in the rest
of Great Britain; others, such as the Land
Court, the Lands Tribunal and the Children’s
Hearings, only apply to Scotland.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE
SCOTTISH LEGAL SYSTEM
The Scottish Executive Justice Department,
under the Minister for Justice, is responsible
for civil law and criminal justice, including
criminal justice social work services, police,
prisons, courts administration, legal aid, and
liaison with the legal profession in Scotland.
The Scottish Court Service, an executive
agency of the Scottish Executive Justice
Department, deals with the work of the
Supreme Courts and the sheriff courts.
The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-
General for Scotland provide the Scottish
Executive with advice on legal matters and
represent its interests in the courts. Since
devolution, the Advocate-General for
Scotland has provided advice on Scots law to
the UK Government.
The role of the Scottish Parliament is to
make laws on matters devolved to it (see
chapter 4). In these areas, it is able to amend
or repeal existing Acts of the UK Parliament
and to pass new legislation for Scotland of its
own. It can also consider and pass private
legislation, promoted by individuals or bodies
(for example, local authorities).
The Court of Session and the High Court
of Justiciary enact the rules regulating their
own procedure and the procedures of the
sheriff courts and the lay summary courts.
The Court of Session and Criminal Courts
Rules Councils, and the Sheriff Court Rules
Council, consisting of judges and legal
practitioners, advise the courts about
amending the rules.
Legal System in Northern
Ireland
Northern Ireland’s legal system is similar to
that of England and Wales. Jury trials have the
same place in the system, except in the case of
offences involving acts of terrorism (see
p. 218). In addition, cases go through the same
stages in the courts and the legal profession
has the same two branches.
Superior Courts
The Supreme Court of Judicature comprises
the Court of Appeal, the High Court and the
Crown Court. All matters relating to these
courts are under the jurisdiction of the UK
Parliament. Judges are appointed by the
Crown.
232
14: CRIMINAL AND CIVIL JUSTICE
The Court of Appeal consists of the Lord
Chief Justice (as President) and two Lords
Justices of Appeal. The High Court is made
up of the Lord Chief Justice and five other
judges. The practice and procedure of the
Court of Appeal and the High Court are
virtually the same as in the corresponding
courts in England and Wales. Both courts sit
in the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast.
The Court of Appeal has power to review
the civil law decisions of the High Court and
the criminal law decisions of the Crown
Court, and may in certain cases review the
decisions of county courts and magistrates’
courts. Subject to certain restrictions, an
appeal from a judgment of the Court of
Appeal can go to the House of Lords.
The High Court is divided into a Queen’s
Bench Division, dealing with most civil law
matters; a Chancery Division, dealing with,
for instance, trusts and estates, title to land,
mortgages and charges, wills and company
matters; and a Family Division, dealing
principally with such matters as matrimonial
cases, adoption, children in care and
undisputed wills.
The Crorm Court deals with all serious
criminal cases.
Inferior Courts
The inferior courts are the county courts and
the magistrates’ courts, both of which differ in
a number of ways from their counterparts in
England and Wales.
County courts are primarily civil law courts.
They are presided over by one of 14 county
court judges, two of whom—in Belfast and
Londonderry—have the title of recorder.
Appeals go from the county courts to the High
Court. The county courts also handle appeals
from the magistrates’ courts in both criminal
and civil matters. In civil matters, the county
courts decide most actions in which the
amount or the value of specific articles claimed
is below a certain level. The courts also deal
with actions involving title to, or the recovery
of, land; equity matters such as trusts and
estates; mortgages; and the sale of land and
partnerships.
The day-to-day work of dealing summarily
w ith minor local criminal cases is carried out
in magistrates’ courts presided over by a full¬
time, legally qualified resident magistrate
(RM). The magistrates’ courts also exercise
jurisdiction in certain family law cases and
have a very limited jurisdiction in other civil
cases.
Terrorist Offences
People accused of offences specified under
emergency legislation (see p. 218) are tried in
the Crown Court without a jury. The
prosecution must prove guilt beyond
reasonable doubt and the defendant has the
right to be represented by a lawyer of his or
her choice. The judge has to set out in a
WTitten statement the reasons for conviction
and there is an automatic right of appeal to the
Court of Appeal against conviction and/or
sentence on points of fact as well as of law.
Administration of the Law
The Lord Chancellor is responsible for court
administration, while the Northern Ireland
Office, under the Secretary of State, deals
wdth policy and legislation concerning
criminal lawr, the police and the penal system.
The Lord Chancellor has general
responsibility for legal aid, advice and
assistance.
The Director of Public Prosecutions for
Northern Ireland, w ho is responsible to the
Attorney-General, prosecutes all offences
tried on indictment, and may do so in other
(summary) cases. Most summary offences are
prosecuted by the police.
Prison Service
The Prison Service in England and Wales, the
Scottish Prison Service and the Northern
Ireland Prison Service are all executive
agencies. There are currently 138 prison
establishments in England and Wales (nine
of which are run by private contractors),
17 Scottish establishments and three
establishments in Northern Ireland.
Prison accommodation ranges from open
prisons to high-security establishments.
Sentenced prisoners are classified into
233
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
different risk-level groups for security
purposes. Women prisoners are held in
separate prisons or in separate accommodation
in mixed prisons. There are no open prisons
in Northern Ireland.
Many of the prisons currently used were
built in Victorian times. Few new prisons
were built at the start of the 20th century.
In the late 1980s a number of new prisons
were built, including those at Doncaster,
Lancaster Farms and Milton Keynes. New
prisons continued to open in the 1990s
including Altcourse (Liverpool) and Parc
(Bridgend) which were designed,
constructed, managed and financed by the
private sector under the PFI (Private
Finance Initiative).
Independent Oversight of the Prison
System
Every prison establishment in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland has a board of visitors,
comprising volunteers drawn from the local
community appointed by the Home Secretary
or Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
Boards, which are independent, monitor
complaints by prisoners and concerns of staff,
and report as necessary to ministers. In
Scotland, visiting committees to prisons are
appointed by local authorities.
Independent Prisons Inspectorates report
on the treatment of prisoners and prison
conditions, and submit annual reports to
Parliament. Each prison establishment is
visited about once every three years.
In England and Wales prisoners who fail to
get satisfaction from the Prison Service’s
internal request and complaints system may
complain to the independent Prisons
Ombudsman. In Scotland, prisoners who
exhaust the internal grievance procedure may
apply to the independent Scottish Prisons
Complaints Commissioner.
Privileges and Discipline
Prisoners in the UK may write and receive
letters, be visited by relatives and friends, and
make telephone calls. Privileges include a
personal radio; books, magazines and
newspapers; and watching television. Earnable
privileges, dependent on good behaviour,
include extra and improved visits, higher rates
of pay, community visits, and longer periods
out of cell.
Offences against prison discipline are dealt
with by prison governors, who act as
adjudicators. In England, Wales and Scotland
measures to counter drug misuse in prisons
include mandatory drug testing. Voluntary
testing has been piloted in Northern Ireland,
but there is no mandatory programme. People
awaiting trial in custody have certain rights
and privileges not granted to convicted
prisoners.
Early Release of Prisoners
There are statutory arrangements governing
the early release of prisoners. Offenders
serving shorter terms (less than four years)
may be automatically released at specific
points in their sentences, while those detained
for longer require Parole Board approval or
the consent of a government minister.
Probation
The Probation Service in England and Wales
supervises offenders in the community under
direct court orders and after release from
custody. It also advises offenders in custody.
All young offenders and all prisoners in

England and Wales sentenced to 12 months’
imprisonment and over are supervised on
release by the Probation Service, or, in the
case of certain young offenders, by local
authority social services departments or youth
justice teams.
A court probation order requires offenders
to maintain regular contact with their
probation officer, who is expected to
supervise them. The purpose of supervision
under a probation order is to secure the
rehabilitation of the offender, to protect the
public and to prevent the offender from
committing further offences. A probation
order can last from six months to three years;
an offender who fails to comply without good
reason with any of the requirements can be
brought before the court again. The
Probation Service also supervises those
subject to community service orders,
combination orders (see p. 226) and those
released from prison on parole. The
Probation Service in England and Wales dealt
with around 130,000 new offenders in 2000.
Just under half this total were starting
probation orders; a similar number were
beginning community service orders.
HM Inspectorate of Probation has both an
inspection and an advisory role, and also
monitors any work that the Probation Service
carries out in conjunction with the voluntary
and private sectors.
In Scotland local authority social work
departments supervise offenders on probation,
community service and other community
disposals, and ex-prisoners subject to statutory
supervision on release from custody. With
effect from September 2002, arrangements for
delivery of community disposals—equivalent
to community sentences—will pass to 11
mainland groupings of local authorities.
In Northern Ireland the probation service is
administered by the government-funded
Probation Board, whose membership is
representative of the community.
Publicly Funded Legal Help
Someone who needs legal assistance or
representation may be able to get help with
costs from publicly funded schemes. Those
who qualify may have all their legal costs paid
for, or they may be asked to make a
contribution, depending on their personal
financial circumstances and, in civil cases, the
outcome of the case.
England and Wales
Provisions in the Access to Justice Act 1999
set up the Legal Services Commission (LSC)
which administers two separate schemes for
funding services:
> the Community Legal Service (CLS)
operates the CLS F'und, through which
funding in civil cases is targeted on
quality-assured services in priority areas
of need; and
> the Criminal Defence Service, which
aims to achieve quality assurance and
improve value for money in publicly
funded criminal defence services.
The CLS Fund provides legal help and
representation if applicants qualify for it,
which depends on their personal financial
circumstances and the nature of their case. It
supports eligible people in cases of divorce,
mediation and other family issues, welfare
benefits, credit and debt problems, housing
and property disputes, immigration and
nationality issues, clinical negligence cases,
challenges to decisions by government
departments and other public bodies, and
actions against the police and others. The
CLS Fund is not available for most personal
injury cases (except clinical negligence cases),
as the Government believes that these are best
conducted by way of conditional fee (kno win,
no fee’) arrangements between solicitors and
clients.
In criminal proceedings the LSC, through
the Criminal Defence Service, makes
arrangements for solicitors to assist
unrepresented defendants in the magistrates’
courts and advocacy assistance is also available
in some other specified circumstances.
Solicitors are also available, on a 24-hour
basis, to give advice and assistance to people
being questioned by the police and others.
These services are not means-tested and are
free.
235
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Publicly funded representation in criminal
cases may be granted by the court if it appears
to be in the interests of justice. A contribution
towards the costs may be payable in cases
which reach the Crown Court or the higher
criminal courts on appeal. During 2000 over
3 million acts of assistance, including offering
advice and payment of legal bills, were granted
at a total cost of around £1.7 billion.
Scotland
The Scottish Legal Aid Board manages legal
aid in Scotland. Its main tasks are to grant or
refuse applications for legal aid; to pay
solicitors or advocates for the legal work that
they do; and to advise Scottish ministers on
legal aid matters. Where legal aid is granted to
the accused in criminal proceedings, he or she
is not required to pay any contribution
towards expenses.
Northern Ireland
Civil legal aid is administered by the Law
Society for Northern Ireland. \\ here legal aid
is granted for criminal cases it is free.
Other Legal Advice
The CLS brings together organisations
offering legal and advice services into local
networks throughout England and Wales.
These include solicitors’ firms, Citizens
Advice Bureaux, law centres, local authority
services and other independent advice centres.

The Lnited Kingdom in the 21st century is a multifaith society. Everyone has
the right to religious freedom. Religious organisations and groups may conduct
their rites and ceremonies, promote their beliefs within the limits of the law,
own property and run schools and a range of other charitable activities The'
2001 Census included, for the first time in the UK since 1851, a question on
religion.1 When the answers to this question have been analysed, they will
provide extensive official information on patterns of religious identity in the
United Kingdom.
CHURCH AND STATE
Christianity has been the most influential
religion in the U K, and it remains the
declared faith of the majority of the
population. Two churches have a special
status with regard to the State. In England,
following the rejection by Henry Mil of the
supremacy of the Pope in 1534, the Anglican
Church of England has been legally recognised
as the official, or established, Church. The
Monarch is the ‘Supreme Governor’ of the
Church of England and must always be a
member of the Church, and promise to
uphold it. A similar situation applied in
Scotland until the earlv 20th century
regarding the Presbyterian Church of Scotland.
Since then the Church has continued to be
recognised as the national Church. The
Monarch holds no constitutional role in the

government of the Church of Scotland but is
represented at the General Assembly (see
p. 241) in the office of the Lord High
Commissioner. There are no ‘established’
churches in \\ ales or Northern Ireland. In
\\ ales, the Anglican Church is known as the
Church in Wales.
BACKGROUND AND MEMBERSHIP
A distinction is often drawn between
‘community size’ figures and ‘active
membership' figures, with the former
representing identification with a religion, or a
religious ethic, in the broadest sense, and the
latter a much closer association. Current
community size estimates suggest 40 million
people in the UK identify themselves as
Christians. On the same basis it is estimated
that there are over 1.5 million Muslims;

4 Synagogue-affiliated households. In some parts of the country membership is through a household which may contain more than
one adult. Figures relate to 1996.
Note: Many religious gatherings are small and of an informal nature. Consequently, reliable data on the level of religious
observance and activity in the UK can sometimes be difficult to obtain.

In addition to the 7.9 million active faith
members of religions (see Table 15.1), many
other people involve themselves in formal
religious ceremonies at times of crisis or for
significant events such as birth, marriage and
death.
Organisations such as the British Humanist
Association and the National Secular Society
offer the opportunity for members to debate
and explore moral and philosophical issues in
a non-religious setting.
The Christian Community
The Church of England is part of a worldwide
Communion of Anglican churches, 38 in all,
with a UK membership of 1.7 million. The
Presbyterian Church of Scotland has an adult
communicant membership in the UK of over
600,000.
The Catholic Church has the largest active
adult membership of any single Christian
denomination in the UK, with average weekly
Mass attendance of over 1 million in England
and Wales and 225,000 in Scotland.
The rise of the Puritan movement in the
16th and 17th centuries led to a proliferation
of nonconformist churches. The term ‘Free
Churches’ is often used to describe those
Protestant churches in the UK which, unlike
the Church of England and the Church of
Scotland, are not ‘established’ churches. The
major Free Churches include Methodist,
Baptist, United Reformed, Salvation Army
and Pentecostal churches.
The British Methodist Church, the largest
of the Free Churches, originated in the 18th
century following the evangelical revival
under John Wesley (1703-91). It has 332,000
adult full members. The present Church is
based on the 1932 union of most of the
separate Methodist Churches.
The Baptists first achieved an organised
form in the UK in the 17th century. Today
they are mainly organised in groups of
churches, most of which belong to the Baptist
238
15: RELIGION
Union of Great Britain (re-formed in 1812)
with about 145,000 members. There are also
separate Baptist Unions for Scotland, Wales
and Ireland, and other independent Baptist
Churches.
The third largest of the Free Churches is
the United Reformed Church, with some
93,000 members. It was formed in 1972 from
the union of the Congregational Church in
England and Wales with the Presbyterian
Church in England. In 1982 and 2000 there
were further unions with the Reformed
Churches of Christ and the Congregational
Union of Scotland.
Among the other Free Churches are: the
Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the largest
Protestant church in Northern Ireland, where it
has around 300,000 members; the Presbyterian
(or Calvinistic Methodist) Church of Wales,
with 49,750 members and the largest of the
Free Churches in Wales; the Union of Welsh
Independents, with 40,750 members; and a
number of independent Scottish Presbyterian
churches which are particularly active in the
Highlands and Islands.
The Salvation Army was founded in the
East End of London in 1865 by William Booth
(1829—1912). It runs over 800 local church and
community centres, and has a strong musical
tradition.
The Religious Society of Friends
(Quakers), with about 17,000 adult members,
was founded in the middle of the 17th century-
under the leadership of George Fox
(1624-91). Other Protestant churches include
the Christian Brethren, a Protestant body
organised by J. N. Darby (1800-82). There
are two branches: the Open Brethren and the
Closed or Exclusive Brethren. Unitarians and
Free Christians, whose origins go back to the
Reformation, belong to a similar tradition.
The rich tradition of people of different
cultures coming to settle in the United
Kingdom since the Middle Ages has also
contributed to the diversity of Christian
denominations found here. Christian
communities founded by migrants include those
of the Orthodox, Lutheran and Reformed
Churches of various European countries, the
Coptic Orthodox Church and the Armenian
Church. These tend to be concentrated in the
larger cities, particularly London, and operate in
a variety of languages. The largest is probably
the Greek Orthodox Church, many of whose
members are of Cypriot origin.
More recent developments within the
Christian tradition have included the rise of
Pentecostalism and the charismatic
movement. A number of Pentecostal bodies
were formed in the UK at the turn of the 20th
century. The two main Pentecostal
organisations in the UK today are the
Assemblies of God, with approximately 54,000
members, and the Elim Pentecostal Church,
with around 62,000 members. Since the
Second World War immigration from the
Caribbean has led to a significant number of
Black Majority Pentecostal churches, and
these are a growing presence in British (and
especially English) church life.
The Christian ‘house church’ movement
(or ‘new churches’) began in the 1970s when
some of the charismatics began to establish
their own congregations. The movement,
whose growth within the UK has been most
marked in England, is characterised byf lay
leadership and is organised into a number of
loose fellowships.
Inter-church Cooperation
Churches Together in Britain and Ireland is
the main coordinating body for the Christian
churches in the UK. It coordinates the work
of its 33 member churches and associations of
churches, in the areas of social responsibility,
international affairs, church life, world
mission, racial justice, care of international
students and inter-faith relations. Its
international aid agencies—Christian Aid,
CAFOD and SCIAF2—are major charities.
Member churches are also grouped in separate
ecumenical bodies, according to country:
Churches Together in England, Action of
Churches Together in Scotland, Churches
Together in Wales (Cytun), and the Irish
Council of Churches.
The Free Churches Group, with 18
member denominations, was in 2001
incorporated into Churches Together in
England. It promotes cooperation among the
2 Catholic Agency for Overseas Development and Scottish
Catholic International Aid Fund.
239
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Free Churches, especially in hospital
chaplaincy and in education matters. The
Evangelical Alliance, with a membership of
individuals, churches or societies drawn from
20 denominations, represents over 1 million
evangelical Christians.
Inter-church discussions about the search
for Christian unity take place internationally,
as well as within the UK, and the main
participants are the Anglican, Baptist,
Lutheran, Methodist, Orthodox, Reformed
and Catholic Churches. In 1999 the Church of
England and the Methodist Church began
formal discussions on a move towards unity.
An initial report is expected to be published in
December 2001. The Baptist Union, the
Moravian Church, the Catholic Church and
the United Reformed Church had
participating observers at the discussions.
Informal talks were held between the Church
of England, the Methodist Church and the
United Reformed Church from 1999 to 2001.
A report from these conversations will be
published alongside the report of the formal
discussions betw een the Church of England
and the Methodist Church. In Scotland,
several churches, including the Church of
Scotland, have been pursuing unity through
the Scottish Churches’ Initiative for Union.
Among them wras the United Reformed
Church, itself the outcome of a 1999 union
between the United Reformed Church in the
UK and the Scottish Congregational Church.
In Wales there are moves tow ards a United
Free Church, and towards establishing in one
small area an ecumenical bishop.
Other Faith Communities
In addition to Christianity, the United
Kingdom is also home to adherents of many
other w orld religions.
The Buddhist community in the UK has
around 50,000 follow ers, both of British or
Western origin, and of South Asian and Asian
background.
The Hindu community in the UK originates
largely from India, although others have come
from countries to which earlier generations had
previously migrated, such as Kenya, Tanzania,
Uganda, Zambia and Malawi. The number of
members is around 400,000 to 550,000,
although some community representatives
suggest a considerably higher figure (of close to
1 million). They are predominantly Gujaratis
(between 65% and 70%) and Punjabis
(between 15% and 20%). Most of the
remainder have their ancestral roots in other
parts of India, such as Uttar Pradesh, West
Bengal, and the Southern states, as w'ell as
other countries such as Sri Lanka.
Jews first settled in England at the time of
the Norman Conquest. They were banished by
royal decree in 1290, but readmitted following
the English Civil War (1642-51). Sephardic
Jews, who originally came from Spain and
Portugal, have been present in the UK since
the mid-17th century. The majority of the
300,000 Jew's in the UK today, w hile British
born, are Ashkenazi Jews, of Central and East
European origin, w ho fled persecution in the
Russian Empire between 1881 and 1914, and
Nazi persecution in Germany and other
European countries from 1933 onw ards.
A significant Muslim community has
existed in the UK since Muslim seamen and
traders settled around the major ports in the
early 19th century. Most came from the
Middle East and the areas that are now
Pakistan and Bangladesh. There was further
settlement after the First World War, and
again in the 1950s and 1960s as people arrived
to meet the shortage of labour following the
Second World War. The 1970s saw the arrival
of significant numbers of Muslims of Asian
origin from Kenya and Uganda. There are
also well-established Turkish Cypriot and
Iranian Muslim communities, while more
recently Muslims from Somalia, Iraq, Bosnia
and Kosovo have sought refuge in the UK.
There are smaller numbers of English and
West Indian Muslims. In total, there are
around 1.5 million people who identify
themselves as Muslims in the UK, the
majority of whom are now British-born. Sunni
and Shi’a are the two principal traditions
within Islam and both are represented among
the Muslim community in the UK. Sufism,
the mystical aspect of Islam, can be found in
both traditions, and members of some of the
major Sufi traditions have also developed
branches in British cities.
Most of the Sikh community in the UK are
of Punjabi ethnic origin. A minority came
240
IS: RELIGION
from East Africa and other former British
colonies to which members of their family had
migrated, but the majority have come to the
UK directly from the Punjab. There are
between 400,000 and 500,000 members,
making it the largest Sikh community outside
the Indian subcontinent.
Jainism is an ancient religion brought to the
UK by immigrants mainly from the Gujarat
and Rajasthan areas of India. It is estimated
that there are between 25,000 and 30,000
members in the UK. The Zoroastrian religion
is mainly represented in the UK by the Parsi
community. Pounders of the UK community
originally settled in the 19th century and it is
estimated that there are between 5,000 and
10,000 members. 4 he Baha’i movement
originated in Persia in the 19th century. The
UK community has around 6,000 members.
Rastafarianism, with its roots in the return-
to-Africa movement, emerged in the West
Indies early in the 20th century. It arrived in
the UK with immigration from Jamaica in the
1950s.
Other religious groups in the UK were
originally founded in the United States in the
19th century. These include the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (the
Mormon Church, with about 180,000
members in Britain), the Jehovah’s Witnesses
(146,000 members), the Christadelphians, the
Christian Scientists, and the Seventh-day
Adventists. The Spiritualists have about
35,000 members.
A number of newer religious movements,
established since the Second World War and
often with overseas origins, are now active in
the UK. Examples include the Church of
Scientology, the Transcendental Meditation
movement, the Unification Church and
various New Age groups. INFORM
(Information Network Focus on Religious
Movements) carries out research and seeks to
provide information about new religious
movements.
ORGANISATION
The Church of England is divided into two
geographical provinces, each headed by an
archbishop: Canterbury, comprising 30
dioceses, including the Diocese in Europe; and
4ork, with 14 dioceses. The dioceses are
divided into archdeaconries and deaneries,
which are in turn divided into about 13,000
parishes, although in practice many of these
are grouped together.
Church of England archbishops, bishops
and the deans of some cathedrals are
appointed by the Monarch on the advice of
the Prime Minister. The Crown
Appointments Commission, which includes
lay and clergy representatives, plays a key role
in the selection of archbishops and diocesan
bishops. The Archbishops’ Council is the
centre of an administrative system dealing
with inter-church relations, inter-faith
relations, social questions, recruitment and
training for the ministry, and missionary
work.
The Church Commissioners are
responsible for the management of a large part
of the Church of England’s invested assets.
The Crown appoints a Member of Parliament
from the backbenches of the governing party
to the unpaid post of Second Church Estates
Commissioner, to represent the
Commissioners in Parliament. The Church
Commissioners provide a fifth of the Church
of England’s total annual income, with most of
the remainder provided by local voluntary
donations.
The Church oj Scotland became the national
church following the Scottish Reformation in
the late 16th century and legislation enacted
by the Scottish Parliament. It has a
Presbyterian form of government—that is,
government by church courts or councils,
composed of ministers, elders, and deacons.
The 1,600 congregations are governed locally
by courts known as Kirk Sessions. The courts
above these are the ‘Presbyteries’, responsible
for a geographical area made up of a number
of parishes. The General Assembly, or
Supreme Court, meets annually under the
chairmanship of an elected moderator, who
serves for one year.
There are eight provinces of the Catholic
Church in Great Britain and Northern
Ireland—four in England, two in Scotland,
one in Wales and one which includes
Northern Ireland. There is a Bishops’
Conference of England and Wales, and a
Bishops’ Conference of Scotland. The Irish
241
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Episcopal Conference includes the whole of
Ireland. The Bishops’ Conference is a
permanent institution of the Catholic Church
whereby the bishops of a country exercise
together pastoral, legislative and teaching
offices as defined by the law of the Catholic
Church.
In Great Britain there are 30 territorial
Catholic dioceses: 22 in England and Wales
and eight in Scotland. Each diocesan bishop is
appointed by the Pope and governs a diocese
according to Canon Law and through
reference to a Council of Priests, College of
Consultors and a Pastoral Council.
There are 2,843 Catholic parishes in
England and Wales and 483 in Scotland.
Northern Ireland is covered by seven dioceses,
some of which have territory in the Irish
Republic. There are 1,329 parishes in the
whole of Ireland.
The Network of Buddhist Organisations
links many of the various Buddhist
educational, cultural, charitable and teaching
organisations. The Buddhist Society of Great
Britain and Ireland, formed in 1907,
eventually evolved into a new and
independent organisation—the Buddhist
Society—in 1943. The Society promotes the
principles, but does not adhere to any
particular school, of Buddhism.
The main administrative body for Hindus
is the National Council of Hindu temples.
Other national bodies serving the Hindu
community include the Hindu Council (UK)
and Vishwa Hindu Parishad.
Jewish congregations in the UK number
about 365. The Board of Deputies of British
Jews is the officially recognised representative
body for these groups. Founded in 1760, it is
elected mainly by synagogues, but a growing
number of community organisations are also
represented. The Board serves as the voice of
the community to both government and the
wider non-Jewish community. Of the total
number of synagogue-affiliated households,
most Ashkenazi Jews (60%) acknowledge the
authority of the Chief Rabbi. The Reform
Synagogues of Great Britain (founded in
1840) cover almost 20% of synagogue-
affiliated community membership. The Union
of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues
(founded in 1901) and the recently established
Assembly of Masorti synagogues together
account for most of the remaining synagogue-
affiliated community membership. The more
strictly observant have their own spiritual
leaders, as do the Sephardim.
The Muslim Council of Britain, founded in
1997, represents established national and
regional Muslim bodies as well as local
mosques, professional associations and other
organisations. The Council aims to promote
cooperation, consensus and unity on Muslim
affairs in the UK. A number of other
representative bodies, such as the Union of
Muslim Organisations, have been set up to
coordinate the social, cultural and economic
aspects of Muslim life in the UK.
The Network of Sikh Organisations (NSO)
was formed in 1995 to facilitate cooperation
between British Sikhs. It provides a forum for
organising the celebration of major events in
the Sikh calendar, and works with government
departments and a number of national
organisations to represent Sikh interests at a
national level.
GUIDANCE AND LEADERSHIP
Most religions depend, to a greater or lesser
degree, on ministers of religion to interpret
doctrine, advise on moral issues and lead their
respective communities.3 Church of England
ministers, Catholic priests, and other ordained
ministers often receive a guaranteed annual
stipend and rely to a lesser extent on gifts and
donations from members of their
communities. Some ministers (particularly lay
ministers) combine their religious ministries
with other paid employment.
The two archbishops of the Church of
England (of Canterbury and York), together
with its bishops of London, Durham and
Winchester and 21 other senior bishops, sit in
the House of Lords as Lords Spiritual. There
are currently proposals to appoint a third
archbishop. Prior to the House of Commons
(Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Act
2001, all clergy who had been ordained by a
bishop, and Ministers of the Church of
Scotland, were disqualified from sitting as
3 Although not all—the Quakers, for example, have no ordained
ministers and no formal liturgy or sacraments.
242
15: RELIGION
MPs in the House of Commons. The new Act
removed these restrictions, except for those
bishops who sit as Lords Spiritual in the
House of Lords.
The Church of England, which has about
13,000 ordained ministers and 10,300 licensed
Readers, reported an increase in the
ordination of new clergy between 1999 and
2000 (from 481 to 569). There are at present
just over 1,400 people in training. The first
women priests were ordained in 1994 and by
2000 they numbered 2,100. Women priests
cannot yet be appointed bishop or archbishop.
The Church of Scotland has around 1,200
ministers in parishes. The Methodists have
3,727 ministers (including student ministers),
the Baptists 1,780 and the United Reformed
Church 1,090. All these admit women to the
ministry.
The Catholic Church in Great Britain has
approximately 3,800 active diocesan priests
and 1,800 priests who are members of
religious congregations. In the Catholic
tradition, men are ordained to the priesthood
and diaconate.
Rabbis provide leadership for the Jewish
community. Sadhus provide leadership and
guidance for the Hindu community. There is
no priesthood in Islam. However, the British
Muslim community has a number of
associations of religious scholars—ulema—
and shariah councils that provide religious
legal rulings on matters such as matrimonial
disputes.
PLACES OF WORSHIP
The State does not contribute to the general
expenses of church maintenance, although
some state aid does help repair historic
churches. In 1999-2000 English Heritage and
the Heritage Lottery Fund jointly offered
grants to churches totalling j£26 million.
Assistance is also given to meet some of the
costs of repairing cathedrals, and £3 million
was available from English Heritage in
2000-01.
The Churches Conservation Trust
(formerly the Redundant Churches Fund),
funded jointly by the Government and the
Church of England, preserves Anglican
churches of particular cultural and historical
importance that are no longer used as regular
places of worship. At present over 300
churches are maintained in this way.
The Historic Chapels Trust was
established to take into ownership redundant
chapels and other places of worship in
England of outstanding architectural and
historic interest (other than those which are
eligible for vesting in the Churches
Conservation Trust). Buildings of all
denominations and faiths can be and have
been taken into care, including nonconformist
chapels, Catholic churches, private Anglican
chapels and synagogues. In April 2001 the
Government announced a new grant for
repairs to listed buildings used as places of
worship. While not a tax rebate, it will have
the same effect as if the level of VAT (value
added tax) for repairs had been reduced from
17.5% to 5%.
Although religious buildings are not as
central to Buddhist life as to that of some
other religious traditions, there are some 50
Buddhist monasteries and temples in the UK.
The first Hindu temple, or mandir, was
opened in London in the 1950s and there are
now over 140 mandirs in the UK; many are
affiliated to the National Council of Hindu
4 emples (UK). The Swaminarayan Hindu
Temple, in north London, is the first
purpose-built Hindu temple in Europe,
having a large cultural complex with provision
for conferences, exhibitions, marriages, sports
and health clinics.
Jewish synagogues in the UK number
slightly fewer than 300, a lower figure than the
number of congregations.
There are over 1,000 mosques and
numerous community Muslim centres
throughout the UK. Mosques are not only
places of worship; they also offer instruction
in the Muslim way of life and facilities for
education and welfare. Mosques range from
converted buildings in many towns to the
Central Mosque in Regent’s Park, London,
and its associated Islamic Cultural Centre.
The main conurbations in the Midlands,
North West and North East of England,'and
in Scotland also have their own central
mosques with a range of communitv facilities.
The largest gurdwara, or Sikh temple, in
the UK is situated in Southall, Middlesex.
243
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Gurdwaras cater for the religious, educational,
welfare and cultural needs of their community.
A granthi is usually employed to take care of
the building and to conduct prayers. There are
over 200 gurdwaras in the UK, the vast
majority being in England and Wales.
A new use has been found for Anglican
church steeples. Mobile telephone
companies have, by agreement with
individual parishes, recently placed
telephone aerials on a number of church
steeples, generating income in the form of
annual rent for the churches concerned.
The Archbishop’s Council is considering
proposals for a national scheme which
would increase the number of aerials on
churches, while ensuring that installations
are made to the highest aesthetic and
environmental standards.
CEREMONIES MARKING LIFE
EVENTS
Historically, one of the major roles of religion
has been to commemorate as a community the
birth, marriage and death of members of that
community. The state and organisations such
as the British Humanist Society have long
offered a secular alternative for marriage.
Some local authorities offer a secular
alternative for celebrating births. Secular
funerals and memorial meetings can also be
held.
In 1999, 179,000 people were baptised in
the Church of England’s two provinces,
excluding the Diocese in Europe; of these,
126,000 were under one year old. In the same
year there were 37,000 confirmations. In 1999
there were over 67,000 baptisms in the
Catholic Church in Great Britain and almost
6,000 adults became Catholics. Over 67,000
marriages were solemnised in 1999 in the
Church of England and Church in Wales.
There were over 12,000 Catholic weddings
and 14,000 nonconformist weddings in
England and Wales during the same year.
Religious ceremonies in 1999 in England and
Wales accounted for fewer than two-fifths of
marriages, compared with just over half in
1991.
Traditionally, deaths have been followed
by a burial ceremony. However, as UK
cemeteries have grown increasingly
overcrowded, cremation ceremonies,
whether religious or secular, have become
more common. In 2000 an estimated 72%
of all deaths resulted in cremation.
Concerns about future land-use have also
led to an increasing number of burials in
‘green’ cemeteries, with minimal
disruption to the countryside and a greater
use of biodegradable coffins.
Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims likewise
commemorate the birth, marriage and death of
their community members, together with
other rites of passage. The Jewish bar mitzvah
for boys and bat mitzvah for girls are coming
of age ceremonies for children approaching
adulthood.
RELIGION AND SOCIETY
The influence of Christianity and other
religions in the UK has always extended far
beyond the comparatively narrow spheres of
organised and private worship. Churches and
cathedrals make a significant contribution to
the architectural landscape of the nation.
Religious organisations are actively involved in
voluntary work and the provision of social
services—many schools and hospitals, for
example, were founded by men and women who
were strongly influenced by Christian motives.
Easter and Christmas, the two most important
events in the Christian calendar, are the year’s
major public holidays. Festivals and other
events observed by other religions—such as
Diwali (Hindu), Ramadan (Muslim),
Vaisakhi (Sikh) and Passover (Jewish)—are
adding to the visible diversity of life in the
UK today
The moral codes of behaviour associated
with many religions have helped to determine
how young people are educated. The way
individuals dress, eat, express themselves
artistically and view themselves as belonging
to an immediate community can often be
derived from, and inspired by, a particular
religious tradition.
244
I
15: RELIGION
Art
All major world religions have been a rich
source of inspiration for art and artists, and
public interest in religious art shows no sign of
diminishing. ‘Seeing Salvation’, a major
exhibition held in the National Gallery in
London, was the most visited show in 2000 of
all the major galleries and museums of Great
Britain, and the fourth most visited in the
world. There was an exhibition ‘Arts of the
Sikh Kingdoms’ at the Victoria and Albert
Museum in 1999 and one on Jainism in 1998.
Regular annual events such as the Islam
Awareness Week help to promote the social,
cultural and artistic contribution of British
Muslims.
Religious Education
In England and \\ ales all state schools must
provide religious education, each local
education authority being responsible for
producing a locally agreed syllabus. Syllabuses
must reflect Christianity, while taking account
of the teaching and practices of the other
principal religions represented in the UK.
State schools must provide a daily act of
collective worship. Parents may withdraw
their children from religious education.
The vast majority of the maintained schools
that have a religious character are either
Anglican (nearly 4,700 schools) or Catholic
(around 2,100 schools). In addition, there is a
well-established tradition of Methodist and
Jewish schools, with about 30 schools
provided by each. Recently the Government
has helped set up, and given support to, a
number of schools reflecting other religious
traditions—Greek Orthodox, Muslim,
Seventh-day Adventist and Sikh. All the
churches and faith groups involved with the
provision of these schools have organisations
at national or regional level to provide support
and help when opportunities arise to promote
new schools.
In Scotland, education authorities must
ensure that schools provide religious
education and regular opportunities for
religious observance. The law does not specify
the form of religious education, but it is
recommended that pupils should be provided
with a broad-based curriculum, through
which they can develop a knowledge and
understanding of Christianity and other world
religions, and develop their own beliefs,
attitudes and moral values and practices.
In Northern Ireland a core syllabus for
religious education has been approved by the
main churches and this must be taught in all
state schools. Integrated education is
encouraged and all schools must be open to
pupils of all religions, although in practice
most Catholic pupils attend Catholic
maintained or Catholic voluntary grammar
schools, and most Protestant children are
enrolled at controlled schools or non-
denominational voluntary grammar schools.
Howev er, the number of inter-denominational
schools is increasing. In 2000-01, over 13,800
primary and secondary school pupils received
their education at ‘integrated’ schools not
attached to any particular religion.
Welfare
Charitable concern is a feature of many
religions. There are currently over 3,000
charities (see p. 122) with religious
connections helping to translate charitable
concern into charitable action, usually
involving some sort of practical or financial
help given by the charity to those in need.
Around two-thirds of such charities have a
Christian connection, such as Oxfam or
CAFOD, but there are also many Jewish and
Islamic charities operating within this sector.
Muslim Aid and Islamic Relief are two British
Muslim charities that organise appeals and
deliver relief aid globally.
Within the UK the Salvation Army is the
largest, most diverse provider of social services
after the Government. It is one of the biggest
providers of hostel accommodation, offering
over 3,000 beds every night. Other services
include work with alcoholics, prison
chaplaincy and a family-tracing service which
receives 5,000 enquiries each year. The
Quakers have a long tradition of social concern
and peacemaking.
The Church of England’s Church Urban
Fund is an independent charity which raises
money to enable those living in the most
disadvantaged urban areas to set up local
245
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
projects to help alleviate the effects of poverty.
These projects help support a wide range of
community-based programmes concerned
with issues such as education, employment,
young people and poverty. Although rooted in
the Christian faith, the Fund does not restrict
its grants on the basis of religious belief. By
2001 it had made grants totalling £37 million
to nearly 2,900 different projects.
The General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland debates annual reports from its
Committee on Church and Nation, on social,
economic and political matters; and, through
its Board of Social Responsibility, it is the
largest voluntary social work agency in
Scotland. The Board currently runs more than
80 projects offering care and support to over
4,000 people every day. Churches in Wales
and Northern Ireland, and other faith
communities also have a concern for social
issues.
In England, the Inner Cities Religious
Council, based in the Department for
Transport, Local Government and the
Regions, provides a forum in which the
Government and the faith communities work
together on issues relating to urban policy.
Chaired by a government minister, the
December 2000 saw the end of the Jubilee
2000 coalition in the UK, a group of over
100 national and regional organisations,
including many churches and other
religious groups. It campaigned for 100%
cancellation of the debts of the world’s
poorest countries and was influential in
persuading the G7 countries (see p. 76)
to promise to do so. Jubilee 2000 was
succeeded by the Jubilee Debt Campaign,
a similar coalition that aims to build upon
the work of its predecessor.
Council comprises senior leaders of the
Christian, Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh
faiths. The Churches Regional Network
coordinates church involvement in Regional
Development Agencies and Regional
Assemblies. Churches in Scotland have
created a Scottish Churches Parliamentary
Office for formal representation of their
interests in the new Scottish Parliament. In
Wales, the churches have worked together to
appoint a Churches National Assembly
Liaison Officer to relate to the National
Assembly for Wales.
COOPERATION BETWEEN
RELIGIONS
The Inter Faith Network for the United
Kingdom links a wide range of organisations
with an interest in inter-faith relations,
including the representative bodies of the
Baha’i , Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jain,
Jewish, Muslim, Sikh and Zoroastrian
communities. The Network promotes good
relations between faiths in the UK, and runs a
public advice and information service on
inter-faith issues. The Council of Christians
and Jews works for better understanding
among members of these two religions and
deals with educational and social issues. The
Three Faiths Forum and the Calamus
Foundation have as their focus relationships
between the Christian, Jewish and Muslim
traditions. There are many other organisations
in the UK dealing wholly, or in part, with
inter-faith issues.
Churches Together in Britain and Ireland
(see pp. 239-40) has a Commission on Inter
Faith Relations. The Interfaith Unit of the
Islamic Foundation was set up with the
specific aim of developing better relations
between the Muslim and Christian traditions.

Culture makes an important contribution to the wider economy in the United
Kingdom. Arts and culture are a major influence on business location and
tourism. The arts are seen by the Government as having a role in helping to lift
personal and community self-esteem, and in developing skills and confidence
that open up wider economic and social opportunities.
INTRODUCTION
The United Kingdom has a diverse cultural
heritage. It is the birthplace of Shakespeare,
Jane Austen, Burns, Elgar, Constable and
numerous other men and women who have
contributed over the centuries to the growth
of a rich, complex and eclectic cultural
tradition. Culture in the UK is forward-
looking too, with many artists and performers
currently working in the sector seeking out
innovative ways of expressing themselves.
As a nation, the appetite for culture remains
undimmed, with more people spending more
on cultural leisure and entertainment services
than ever before. Many people come from
abroad to visit the UK for cultural reasons.
Collections in the UK’s museums and
galleries are among the best in the world.
British popular music has enjoyed
considerable success at home and overseas.
Increasingly, however, ‘culture’ extends far
beyond the traditional participation of an
individual at a formal cultural event. The
communication and enjoyment of personal
and imaginative experiences can take place at
school, at home, in a street or community
festival, or even in the workplace.
The Indian Mahila Cultural Committee in
Glasgow and the Scottish African and
Caribbean Resource Centre celebrate the
richness and diversity of contemporary culture
in the United Kingdom. CADMAD1 runs a
cultural diversity training programme for
artists and arts organisations. Measures to
foster cultural diversity in Northern Ireland
include funding for arts in both the Irish
language and Ulster Scots language. A feature
of the richness of cultural life in the United
Kingdom has been the growth of Caribbean
carnival, of which the most famous is the
annual Netting Hill Carnival, the largest street
festival in Europe. The Regional Black
I heatre Initiative, Kuumba, an arts centre in
Bristol, takes part in youth projects with the
Bristol Old Vic.
The personal and imaginative experiences
of other voices in society are also encouraged.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
National Disability Arts Forum and other
similar national agencies are funded by the
Arts Council of England (ACE), as are
creative organisations, such as Candoco Dance
Company, composed of disabled and non¬
disabled dancers, and Graeae, a theatre
company promoting performers with
disabilities. Dance Division is another group
looking to push back the boundaries of what is
commonly understood as performing art,
offering trainee footballers new approaches to
movement and fitness.
Innovations
The Government’s 24-hour Museum website
(mvip.24hourmuseum.org.uk), which provides a
gazetteer of all UK museums and galleries, a
magazine, search facilities and educational
resources, receives about 300,000 ‘hits’ a month.
SCRAN (wwrv.scran.ac.uk), the Scottish
Cultural Resources Access Network, is a history
and culture site providing access to images,
movies, sounds and virtual reality records from
museums, galleries, archives and media.
Cultureonline (www.cultureonline.gov.uk),
another government Internet initiative, which
was launched in September 2000, will
eventually act as one of the main sources of
information about cultural events across the
United Kingdom, as well as being an
educational tool. After a consultation period, a
full business case for Cultureonline will be
produced, which will form the basis of a bid to
the Capital Modernisation Fund (see p. 400).
It is proposed that the new service will be set
up and run by a new autonomous body, to be
established as a company limited by guarantee.
Its position will be regularised as a statutory
body at the first legislative opportunity.
A growing number of operas, concerts,
ballets and plays can now be viewed via the
Online Classics webpage (www.onIineclassics.net).
The British Library has put on its Internet
catalogue details of more than 10 million
documents from the past 500 years, including
books, journals and reports. The National
Library of Wales has established a substantial
digitisation programme in order to make
available online copies of large numbers of
items from its collections. The expansion of
cultural experiences communicated via the
Internet remains a potentially enormous
growth area, although there are copyright
difficulties associated with posting such
information on the Internet which have yet to
be fully addressed.
ADMINISTRATION
The expression of creativity is first and
foremost a personal or group activity, but
there is an official and commercial side to
culture too. Many artists and performers
engaged in cultural activity rely on subsidies
and funding from government and other
patrons of the arts. The Government has a
role in protecting the rights of authors
through copyright legislation (see p. 251);
providing a regulatory framework for cultural
activities in areas such as film classification
(see p. 251); and encouraging greater public
participation in the arts. Public sector
involvement in the arts is expressed in a
number of different ways: through the work of
the four Administrations directly responsible
for culture in England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland; through local government
support for local initiatives (see p. 250); or
through intermediate groups such as the Arts
Councils (see pp. 249-50), which act
independently from the Government but are
nonetheless publicly funded and take on the
role of patrons of the arts.
UK and England
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport (DCMS) has policy responsibilities
within government for the arts, broadcasting,
the built heritage, creative industries, film,
museums, galleries and libraries, the National
Lottery (see p. 123), press freedom and
regulation, sport and tourism, along with new
areas of responsibility that include film and
video classification.
The DCMS’s stated aim is to improve the
quality of life for all through cultural activities
and to strengthen the creative industries. The
Department, in partnership with others,
works to:
> create an efficient and competitive
market by removing obstacles to growth
248
16: CULTURE
and unnecessary regulation so as to
promote Britain’s success in the fields of
culture, media, sport and tourism, both
in the UK and abroad;
> broaden access to cultural events and to
the built environment;
> raise the standards of cultural education
and training;
> ensure that everyone has the opportunity
to achieve excellence in areas of culture
and to develop talent, innovation and
good design; and
> maintain public support for the National
Lottery and ensure that the objective of
the Lottery Fund supports DCMS and
other national priorities.
Future plans under consideration by the
DCMS include:
> the creation of new regional centres of
excellence, involving greater partnership
between national and regional museums
and galleries; and
> the piloting of plans for local authorities
to draw up cultural strategies appropriate
for their area.
As part of its commitment to encourage
greater participation in the arts, the
Government will enable museums to
recover VAT (value added tax) on their
purchases under a scheme which makes it
possible (subject to the agreement of the
trustees of the museums and galleries
concerned) for a scrapping of all entry
charges on the major collections (see p. 259)
to take effect from December 2001. In
Scotland admission to the National Galleries
of Scotland is free of charge, and the
Scottish Executive made provision for the
National Museums of Scotland to abolish
admission charges from 1 April 2001.
Other national organisations acting in an
advisory capacity are:
the Creative Industries Task Force,
which was set up in 1998 to identify
issues vital to the economic health of the
creative industries. It has organised a
work programme covering skills
development, access to capital,
intellectual property, export promotion,
regional activity, and the UK’s image
overseas;
> the Quality, Efficiency and Standards
Team (QUEST), which monitors
financial management across DCMS
sectors; and
> the Music Industry Forum, a DCMS
initiative which works closely with
interested parties and trade associations
to identify what can be done to improve
the economic performance of the music
industry.
Wales
The National Assembly for Wales has
responsibility for the arts in Wales, including
museums, galleries and libraries.
Responsibility for funding and developing the
arts in Wales falls to the Arts Council of Wales
(ACW). ACW launched its Cultural Diversity
Strategy in the summer of 2001. The
Council’s work includes support for events
such as the Hay Festival of Literature and
organisations such as Welsh National Opera.
1 he promotion of the Welsh language and
support for the National Eisteddfod is the
responsibility of the W elsh Language Board.
Scotland
The Scottish Executive published a National
Cultural Strategy in August 2000, providing
additional funding for the arts in Scotland,
promoting Scotland’s languages and cultural
heritage, and developing further the work
started by the three-year Scotland Onstage
initiative towards the goal of a fully fledged
national theatre. Other plans to promote
culture in Scotland include the building of a
creative media campus’ on Tayside, a hub for
Scotland’s flourishing computer games
industry, which will provide employment for
designers and other creative talent.
Northern Ireland
‘To the Millennium: A Strategy for the Arts
in Northern Ireland’, a five-year plan for the
arts, produced jointly by the Northern Ireland
249
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Arts Council and its parent organisation at the
time, the Department of Education, has
provided the basis for planning in the arts,
outlining goals for achieving wider community
participation and encouraging greater access in
all aspects of cultural activity. Since
devolution, responsibility for the arts has been
taken over by the Department of Culture, Arts
and Leisure. An independent report ‘Opening
up the Arts’ was published in May 2000,
providing the basis for directions in arts policy
up to 2006. Practical plans for boosting culture
in Northern Ireland include the construction
of major theatres and arts centres in
Cookstown, Ballymena and Omagh.
Local Authorities
Although policy is worked out by the four UK
administrations, many new initiatives are
carried out at a local level. Local authorities
maintain about 1,000 museums and art
galleries, and a network of public libraries.
They also provide grant aid for professional
and amateur orchestras, theatres, and opera
and dance companies. Fourteen authorities are
piloting Local Cultural Strategies, a DCMS
scheme to bring cultural issues into the heart
of local government planning. The Greater
London Authority (see p. 9) will prepare
a cultural strategy and proposes to introduce
a Capital Culture Card, allowing students,
pensioners and the unemployed to attend
theatres, cinemas and concerts at reduced rates.
The Arts Councils
The independent Arts Councils of England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are the
main channels for the distribution of
government grants and Lottery funding to the
visual, performing and community arts and to
literature. They act as national ‘champions’ of
the arts and give financial assistance and advice
not only to the major performing arts
organisations, but also to small touring theatre
companies, experimental performance groups
and literary organisations. They provide funds
for training arts administrators and help to
develop sponsorship and local authority support.
In addition to promoting education and public
access to, and participation in, performing and
visual arts and literature, the Arts Councils
commission research into the impact of the arts
on society and develop forward strategies.
ACE funds the major national arts-
producing organisations in England—
including the Royal Opera, the Royal Ballet,
the Birmingham Royal Ballet, English
National Opera (ENO), the Royal Shakespeare
Company (RSC), the Royal National Theatre
(RNT) and the South Bank Centre—and the
main touring companies, such as Opera North
and English National Ballet.
The year 2000 was designated Year of the
Artist by ACE, with 1,000 artists given
residencies in 1,000 places across England.
Residencies ranged from sound artist Kate
Tierney working on the Radio 4 programme
Today, to the Cornelius Cardew ensemble
creating a pub opera at the Miller’s Arms in
Canterbury (Kent). The Scottish Arts Council
operated a similar scheme with 100 artists in
residence, including Barnaby Brown recording
Gaelic choirs from Skye in a series of sea-caves.
Resource: the Council of Museums,
Archives and Libraries
Resource is the strategic agency working with,
and on behalf of, museums, archives and
libraries across the UK; it replaced the
Museums and Galleries Commission in April
2000. It also provides funds to the seven
English Area Museum Councils, which supply
services and their own small grants to
individual museums, the Museum
Documentation Association and to the
Cultural Heritage National Training
Organisation. Resource advises ministers on
the Acceptance in Lieu (AIL) scheme,
whereby pre-eminent works of art may be
accepted by the Government in settlement of
tax and allocated to public galleries. A review
of the scheme in 2001 found there was scope
for promoting greater public awareness of
AIL, and recommended the establishment of a
new fast-track claims procedure to reduce
processing delays.
Film Council and bfi
The Film Council, which came into being in
April 2000, channels the majority of public
250
16: CULTURE
funding for film production in the UK. It has
a wide remit, with both cultural and industry
objectives: to develop film culture in the UK,
and to create a coherent structure for the UK
film industry. The Council also helps to fund
the British Film Office in Los Angeles, which
acts as an information service to promote both
British exports and the advantages of British
studios to US film-makers. Recently, the
responsibilities of the British Film Office were
broadened to include television programmes
and commercials.
The moving image as an art form is
promoted by the British Film Institute {bji),
Scottish Screen, the Northern Ireland Film
Commission and Sgrin, the Media Agency for
Wales. The bfi has an extensive library and runs
a number of film festivals, including the
London Him Festival. It also supports a new
UK cinema exhibition strategy to bring non¬
mainstream films into high street multiplexes,
and gives financial assistance to a network of
independent cinemas across the UK. Its
educational activities include courses,
conferences and other events, and helping to
formulate national film education policy.
Cinema Licensing and Film Classification
Public cinemas must be licensed by local
authorities, which have a legal duty to prohibit
the admission of children to unsuitable films,
and may prevent the showing of any picture.
In assessing films the authorities normally rely
on the judgment of an independent non-
statutory body, the British Board of Film
Classification (BBFC), to which all items must
be submitted. Films passed by the BBFC are
put into one of the following categories:
> U (universal), suitable for all;
^ PG (parental guidance), in which some
scenes may be unsuitable for young
children;
^ 12, 15 and 18, for people of not less than
those ages; and
^ Restricted 18, for restricted showing only
at premises to which no one under 18 is
admitted, for example, licensed cinema
clubs.
The BBFC is also legally responsible for
classifying videos under a system similar to
that for films. It is an offence to supply
commercially a video which has not been
classified or to supply it in contravention of its
designation.
Authors’ Copyright and Performers’
Protection
Original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic
works (including computer programs and
databases), films, sound recordings, cable
programmes, broadcasts and the typographical
arrangement of published editions are
automatically protected by copyright in the
UK if they meet the legal requirements for
protection. The copyright owner has rights
against unauthorised reproduction,
distribution, public performance, rental,
broadcasting and adaptation of his or her work
(including putting material on the Internet
without permission). In most cases the author
is the first owner of the copyright, and the
term of copyright in literary, dramatic,
musical and artistic works is generally the life
of the author and a period of 70 years. There
are similar rules governing copyright on films.
Sound recordings and broadcasts are
protected for a period of 50 years.
British Council
The British Council (see p. 97) is the UK’s
international organisation for educational and
cultural relations. It works in 243 cities in
111 countries to promote international
understanding of British creativity in the arts,
literature and design, as well as education,
good governance and science. It aims to
present a modern and culturally diverse
picture of the UK. In 2000 it supported some
3,000 cultural events overseas. The Visiting
Arts Office of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland is a joint venture of the British Council
with the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and
the Arts Councils. It encourages the inward
flow to the UK of arts from other countries.
FINANCE
In England planned central government
expenditure through the DCMS in 2001-02
251
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
amounts to £246 million for museums and
galleries; £253 million distributed through the
Arts Council for England for the visual and
performing arts; and £115 million for libraries
and archives.
Planned 2001-02 expenditure by the Arts
Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland is respectively £34.8 million, £16.6
million and £7.4 million. The Scottish
Executive is also providing £41 million for
Scotland’s National Galleries and Museums,
and National Library, while the National
Assembly for Wales is giving £23.2 million for
Wales’s National Museum, National Library
and other arts. Total planned spending by the
Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in
Northern Ireland on the National Museums
(see p. 261), arts and libraries amounts to just
over £43.3 million in 2001-02.
National Lottery
By December 2000, Lottery awards of over
£1.47 billion had been announced by the Arts
Council of England for arts projects. Between
June 1995 and April 2000, grants for the
acquisition of works of art from the Heritage
Lottery Fund (HLF—see p. 322) to
museums, galleries and other organisations
amounted to £1-57 billion.
By August 2001 UK museums and galleries
were estimated to have benefited from £656
million of Heritage Lottery Fund money, as
well as £117 million from the Millennium
Commission. Recent Arts Lottery grants have
included nearly £16 million to the New Art
Gallery, Walsall, and £20 million to the new
Milton Keynes Theatre and Art Gallery.
Heritage Lottery grants included £15 million
to the development of Manchester’s City Art
Gallery and £11.9 million to the new wing of
the National Portrait Gallery. Scottish Arts
Council lottery grants included £7 million for
the Centre for Contemporary Arts in
Glasgow.
Nesta
The National Endowment for Science,
Technology and the Arts has initial finance of
£200 million from the National Lottery. It
aims to help talented individuals or groups to

develop their full potential; to turn creativity
into exploitable or commercial products and
services with protected rights, and to
contribute to public knowledge and
appreciation of science, technology and the
arts. It grants fellowships worth up to £75,000
spread over a fellowship of three to five years,
with around 40 awards made each year.
Business and Other Sponsorship
Total UK business investment in the arts in
1999—2000 was over £150 million. London
attracted most of the investment—£80
million—followed by Scotland and the West
Midlands. Museums and galleries received
£12 million each, drama and theatre received
£7 million, music £8 million, festivals
£6.6 million and opera £2.4 million. As one
example, HSBC, one of the UK’s largest
banks, is giving £1.5 million over three years
to the National Youth Theatre, the National
Youth Orchestra, the National Youth Ballet
and the National Opera Studio.
Arts & Business promotes and encourages
partnerships between business and the arts. It
has over 350 business members and manages
the Arts & Business New Partners Programme
on behalf of ACE and the DCMS. Under the
programme, investments can be made in
252
16: CULTURE
arts/business partnerships, which bring
benefits to both parties. Arts & Business New
Partners was launched in April 2000, replacing
the former Pairing Scheme, which raised £10
million from business and contributed over
£160 million (including £52 million from the
Government) to the arts over 16 years. Arts &
Business also runs the Arthur Andersen Skills
Bank and the NatWest Board Bank, which
enable 3,000 volunteers from companies to
loan their skills, in computing, accountancy,
marketing or personnel, to local arts groups on
a part-time basis.
The Corporation of London, the local
authority for the City of London, is one of the
largest sponsors of the arts in the UK, with a
budget of £56 million in 2001-02. The
Corporation owns, funds and manages the
Barbican Centre (Europe’s largest multi-arts
and conference centre), which has the London
Symphony Orchestra as resident and
presents an international theatre programme;
owns, funds and manages the Guildhall
School of Music and Drama; jointly funds and
manages the Museum of London with the
DCMS; and funds various other cultural
activities.
Among sponsorship from charitable trusts,
the Jerwood Foundation gave over £5.5
million a year in capital and revenue grants in
2000, with emphasis on encouraging young
performers. In January 2000 the Foundation
pledged £500,000 over five years to the Young
Singers Programme at English National
Opera. In addition to its £3 million towards
the renewal of the Royal Court Theatre in
London, it plans to continue with revenue
funding for the theatre of up to £100,000
a year, providing it produces new plays by
young writers. The Arvon Foundation,
a charitable trust which also attracts
sponsorship from the private sector, runs
residential courses for new writers, attracting
over 1,000 students a year.
Approximately £3 million from the
Foundation for Sport and the Arts, run by the
Pools Promoters Association, was used to help
the arts in 2000 in the form of awards. Many
arts organisations also benefit from the fund¬
raising activities of friends, groups and from
private individuals’ financial support. For
example, theatre companies have traditionally
relied on the support of‘angels’, individual
sponsors putting up often quite small amounts
of money to meet the costs of putting on a
show, and subsequently recouping their
investment from box office proceeds.
Sector Finance
Museums and galleries maintained by local
authorities, universities and independent or
privately funded bodies may receive help in
building up their collections through grants
through Area Museum Councils—throughout
the UK—which are funded by Resource: the
Council of Museums, Archives and Libraries.
Support to national and regional public and
independent museums and galleries is also
given by the Arts Councils and by trusts,
voluntary bodies, the Heritage Lottery Fund
and the National Art Collections Fund.
Government help for the film industry
allows a 100% tax write-off on the production
and acquisition costs for British movies with
budgets of up to £15 million.
The Film Council will be responsible for
distributing £150 million of Lottery and
government grant to the UK film industry
during 2000-03.The Council’s New Cinema
bund will make £1.5 million available to
radical and innovative film-makers looking to
use the latest digital technology. Its £10
million Premiere Production Fund is geared
towards the making of popular mainstream
films and the £5 million Film Development
F und will be targeted at the pre-production
stage of film-making. The Film Council has
absorbed the British Film Commission, whose
aim has been to attract foreign film-making
and production investment into the UK, and
British Screen Finance, a private sector
company which previously provided funding
to British productions and co-productions.
The Council has earmarked 20% of its
production funds for encouraging European
co-productions. It also funds the British Film
Institute {bfi\ see p. 251) to deliver its cultural
and educational objectives and has fully
absorbed bfi Production.
In 2000—01 ACE spent more than £50
million on support for drama, including
regional theatre—21% of ACE’s total grant.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
London Underground is becoming an
increasingly popular location for film¬
makers, a popularity that has been boosted
by the commercial success of recent films
such as Sliding Doors. In 1999 London
Underground received over 200 filming
requests, and provided some scenes for the
hit film Billy Elliott. Canary Wharf station
was the most popular for film-makers
because of its futuristic appeal. A record
28 feature films produced by foreign
production teams were made in Britain in
2000 with budgets totalling £366 million.
an extra £25 million available for theatre
companies, spread over two financial years.
Nearly 200 individual venues are to benefit
from substantial increases in their grants,
and 85 touring companies will share over
£4 million. The Arts Council of Wales has
established Clwyd Theatr Cymru as a Wales
National Performing Arts Company,
supported major building work at the Grand
Theatre in Swansea, and funded new
equipment at the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff.
CULTURAL EVENTS
Since the end of the 19th century the means of
cultural expression have rapidly expanded
from their traditional roots, as practitioners of
the arts have exploited the opportunities
presented by new media—cinema, radio,
television, electronics and the Internet.
Continuing technological development and
innovative work from artists have helped blur
distinctions between traditional art forms and
created richer and more diverse outlets for the
communication of cultural experiences. The
most recent Turner Prize winner, a
competition traditionally reserved for artists,
was a photographer; even theatre, one of the
most traditional of art forms, can now be
directly experienced online.
Arts Centres
Over 200 arts centres in the UK give people
the chance of seeing a range of art forms and
taking part in activities, especially educational
projects. Nearly all the centres are
professionally managed, while using the
services of volunteers. They are assisted
mainly by the Arts Councils, and local
authorities, while ACE currently funds two
centres in London—the South Bank Centre
and the Institute of Contemporary Arts—the
latter being popular for its art films and avant-
garde exhibitions. The Pier Arts Centre at
Stromness (Orkney) and Dundee
Contemporary Arts (which has two galleries,
two cinemas, a print studio and activity
rooms) are two of the centres supported by the
Scottish Arts Council. Among other centres,
the Arts Council of Wales funds Chapter Arts
Centre in Cardiff and the Aberystwyth Arts
Centre, which helps to promote international
artists and collaborations.
Festivals
Some 500 professional arts festivals take place
in the UK each year. Their appeal has
broadened; for example, whereas classical
music once dominated music festivals, there
are now those that offer jazz, folk, pop, rock,
world and early music as well. Sixty or so
festivals concentrate on poetry, and other
festivals are devoted to the visual arts, such as
the Liverpool Biennial.
The 2001 Edinburgh International Festival
featured some 180 performances of music,
theatre, opera and dance, as well as lectures
and discussions. Performances included Sir
Charles Mackerras conducting the Scottish
Chamber Orchestra and Chorus with the BT
Scottish Ensemble in a programme of Handel
concerti and Wagner’s Die Walkure,
performed by Scottish Opera. The Edinburgh
Festival Fringe, with programmes (including
street events) to suit all tastes, takes place
alongside the main events. In recent years it
has proved a fertile training ground for
comedians and actors who have progressed to
successful careers elsewhere. In 2001 the
Fringe hosted over 1,462 performances by 666
different companies. Other annual Edinburgh
events include the International Film Festival,
the International Book Festival and the
international Jazz and Blues Festival.
The 53rd Aldeburgh Festival in 2001
included Janacek piano recitals by Thomas
254
16: CULTURE
Ades, and performances of Beethoven and
Shostakovich by the Borodin String Quartet.
The Hay festival, held in Hay-on-Wye,
originally focusing on literature—the town is
renowned for its second-hand bookshops—has
broadened its range in recent years and its
programme in 2001 included appearances by
best-selling author Louis de Bernieres, rock
band Pulp and former US President Bill
Clinton. Film festivals include the annual
London Film Festival, the 45th in 2001, and
newer festivals such as the Leeds Children’s
Film Festival and the Brief Encounters short
film festival in Bristol.
LIVE PERFORMANCE
Drama
Some of the UK’s 300 professional theatres
are privately owned, but most belong to local
authorities or to not-for-profit organisations.
In England, the Royal National Theatre
(RNT) on the South Bank in London relies in
part on public subsidy for support, allowing it
to take greater artistic risks and offer cheaper
tickets than unsubsidised theatres in London’s
West End. Under the directorship of Trevor
Nunn, recent plays produced at the RNT have
included the revival of musicals such as
Oklahoma! and the staging of work such as
Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen.
Elsewhere in London, revivals of classic
musicals such as The King and I and My Fair
Lady (with Martine McCutcheon in the
starring role) have proved a success. Other,
more literary, lower-budget plays such as the
comedy Stones in their Pockets, by Marie Jones,
have proved popular with audiences too. The
Almeida Theatre, one of London’s leading
independent venues, closed briefly for
refurbishment in 2001, and reopened in
temporary accommodation with a staging of
Wedekind’s masterpiece Lulu at a refashioned
disused coach depot in King’s Cross.
Productions from the Donmar Warehouse,
another leading West End theatre, included a
revival of Christopher Hampton’s Tales from

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Hollywood and Boston Marriage, by David
Mamet. The 2001 season of the Globe
Theatre—a reconstruction of Shakespeare’s
playhouse—featured King Lear, Cymbehne
and Umabatha, the Zulu Macbeth. The Royal
Shakespeare Company, based at Stratford-
upon-Avon, presents spring and autumn
seasons of Shakespeare’s plays in a repertory
programme.
Northern Ireland has six major theatre
spaces, including the Opera House and the
recently opened Waterfront Hall; and several
young theatre companies—among them
Tinderbox Theatre, specialising in small-scale
productions of new work. In Scotland, the
Royal Lyceum Theatre and King’s and
Festival Theatres in Edinburgh, and the
Citizen’s Theatre Glasgow, all have full
programmes covering a wide range of
productions—the spring season at Citizen’s
featured a Borderline Theatre Company
production of Marie Jones’ comedy Women on
the Verge of HRT. The Traverse Theatre in
Edinburgh is Scotland’s leading centre for
new writing. The Sherman Theatre in Wales
has a specific mission of attracting younger
audiences, and recently staged Everything
Must Go by Patrick Jones, featuring musical
contributions from the successful Welsh pop
group Manic Street Preachers.
Music
Orchestral and Choral Music
London leads the world in its wide range of
music available throughout the year. In
classical music alone, there are four symphony
orchestras with public subsidy, two more at
the BBC, one at English National Opera and
one at Co vent Garden. The largest of these,
the London Symphony Orchestra, performs at
the Barbican. Recent concerts by English
orchestras at the Royal Festival Hall were
given by the Philharmonia, the London
Philharmonic (under its new principal director
Kurt Masur), the BBC Symphony (under
Andrew Davis), and the City of Birmingham
Symphony. The smaller Queen Elizabeth Hall
featured the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment and chamber groups: the
London Mozart Players, the Academy of St
Martin-in-the-Fields and the English
Chamber Orchestra. The Bournemouth
Symphony, Manchester’s Halle Orchestra and
the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic are other
well-known and highly rated English
orchestras.
The Royal Scottish National Orchestra and
the Scottish Chamber Orchestra each give
over 100 performances a year. The Ulster
Orchestra, Northern Ireland’s only fully
professional orchestra, has established a
world-class reputation under the artistic
direction of conductors such as Vernon
Handley and Dmitri Sitkovetsky. In Wales the
BBC National Orchestra of Wales offers a
year-round programme of orchestral and
choral music featuring the BBC National
Chorus of Wales.
English and Welsh choral societies have
done much to foster the oratorio tradition at
the leading music festivals. English
ecclesiastical choral singing is a speciality of
the choirs of cathedrals and Oxford and
Cambridge colleges.
Two celebrated events in the musical
calendar are the Leeds International Piano
Competition for young pianists and the
biennial Cardiff Singer of the World
Competition, which attracts outstanding
young singers, and distinguished adjudicators,
from all countries. The 18-year-old cellist
Guy Johnston won the biennial BBC Young
Musicians contest in 2000.
Attendance at the 2000 Promenade
Concerts (the ‘Proms’), the world’s largest
music festival, was 89% of capacity, with
attendance figures reaching 259,700. ‘Pastoral’
and ‘Exile’ were two themes linking
performances in the 2001 season, which
included new work commissioned from Sally
Beamish, Alexander Goehr and Sir Harrison
Birtwistle, and premieres of material by
Bernstein, Boulez and Tavener.
A number of classical musicians have in
recent years achieved ‘celebrity’ status. The
violinist Vanessa Mae has been making solo
recordings and appearing at top international
venues for the past decade. The tenor Russell
Watson was, until recently, a relatively
unknown singer. However, after an intensive
television promotion campaign for his debut
256
16: CULTURE
album ‘The Voice’, he became the top-selling
classical performer of 2000. Charlotte Church,
still only 15, has in recent years given many
international concerts and achieved great
popularity as a soprano, making her one of
Britain’s highest-paid entertainers. The
repertoire, marketing, and celebrity
appearances of classical artists have helped
break down traditional barriers between
hitherto distinct genres of classical and pop
music.
Pop and Rock Music
The pop and rock music industry continues to
thrive in the United Kingdom and has seen
the continuing chart success of bands such as
SClub7 and Steps—whose work is often
characterised by the emphasis placed on dance
routines in their live and video performances.
One of the latest groups to emerge is the all¬
girl group Atomic Kitten, which has had two
chart-topping singles in 2001. Craig David has
won critical acclaim and achieved commercial
success through his development of ‘garage’
music, an innovative soul sound.
Hear’say, the winners of a musical talent
competition on television, is one of the
most notable new groups to emerge in
2001. In the course of the year, Hear’say
became the first British band to top both
album and single charts simultaneously
with their debut releases. The band
achieved instant success largely because it
was selected in a series of ratings-topping,
‘fly on the wall’ television documentaries
broadcast in autumn 2000.
In 2000-01 Welsh artists and bands made
significant contributions to British pop, with
the Stereophonies, Manic Street Preachers and
Super Furry Animals achieving commercial
success. Another success for the industry was
the release of the greatest hits compilation
album ‘7’ of perennial favourites the Beatles,
which sold over 20 million copies and reached
the number one slot in the pop charts in over
30 countries.
Folk
Folk music has always been strong in all parts
of the UK. In Northern Ireland, for example,
bands perform in pubs and clubs, playing
fiddles and other traditional Celtic
instruments. Scottish and Welsh festivals
honour Gaelic and Celtic music and song. The
Scottish Arts Council highlights the diversity
of Scottish traditional music: a CD, Seriously
Scottish, places traditional music alongside
contemporary forms. English morris dancing,
in which traditional musical instruments and
centuries-old dance forms are practised by
groups or ‘sides’, remains popular since its
revival in the 1970s and 1980s. Currently
there are about 800 morris dancing sides in the
United Kingdom.
Jazz and Blues
The Brecon, Cheltenham and London Jazz
festivals, Edinburgh International Jazz and
Blues Festival, and venues such as Ronnie
Scott s in London s Soho have helped win
new audiences for jazz in the UK and have
shown how it can evolve when exposed to
other musical influences, such as pop and
Latin American, and how its rhythms can
change. The 2001 Bishopstock Blues Festival,
held in Devon in June, attracted artists from
all over the world, including Booker T and the
MGs, Johnny Winter and Nina Simone.
Opera
London’s Royal Opera House (ROH) at
Covent Garden reopened in December 1999
after a £214 million restoration and
redevelopment. Recent performances include
Boulevard Solitude, staged as a 75th birthday
tribute to the German composer Hans Werner
Henze. The English National Opera, Welsh
National Opera and Scottish Opera companies
all have international reputations.
Glyndebourne Opera (East Sussex), which
relies on private patrons for its summer
season, is another prestigious venue. One of its
main season offerings in 2001 included
traditional favourites in the operatic
repertoire, Fideho and yf A/lidsummer Night's
Dream. Other country house opera ventures
include Garsington (Oxfordshire), where the
257
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
stage is a garden terrace, Longborough
(Gloucestershire) and Castleward Opera in
County Down (Northern Ireland).
Dance
The Royal Ballet is to have an enhanced status
and more performances at the ROH. In 2001
English National Ballet was at the Coliseum.
Other important ballet companies include
Birmingham Royal Ballet and Northern Ballet
Theatre. Alongside traditional repertoires of
classic ballet favourites such as Tchaikovsky,
contemporary dance has grown in stature in
recent years. Scottish Ballet has embarked on
a new era of classical and contemporary dance,
and Dance Base, Scotland’s new national
centre for dance, opened in Edinburgh in
2001. The Rambert Dance Company,
Britain’s oldest ballet troupe, has become
known for its forward-looking creativity.
It remains the UK’s only large-scale
contemporary dance repertory company,
touring nationally and internationally. In 2001
it presented a programme of work in the
intimate setting of Linbury Studio, London,
featuring work from new choreographers—
‘Beach Birds’ by Merce Cunningham and
‘Hurricane’ by Christopher Bruce. It also
focuses on education and community work.
Other dance companies with growing
reputations are Spring Loaded and the
Richard Alston Dance Company.
BROADCAST PERFORMANCE
AND FILM
Television
Now that 99% of households own a television
set, and the average person watches well over
20 hours of programmes a week (see p. 123),
television has become an enormously popular
medium for the communication of cultural
experiences. Plays, fdms, ‘soaps’ (long
running serials often focusing on family
relationships) and specialist arts and music
programmes—which might together be
referred to as ‘cultural’ programmes in the
traditional sense—form a significant part of
the broadcasting output of many terrestrial,
cable and satellite channels. However, the
format of television programmes is constantly
changing and in this medium the concept of
culture has expanded beyond, or fused,
traditional art forms. Many quiz shows and
‘fly on the wall’ documentaries, for example,
have a strong cultural element, and the
broadcast media are adept at combining
popular and supposedly highbrow culture in
a seamless and acceptable form for huge and
varied audiences. For information on
individual programmes broadcast on
television, see p. 274.
Arts programmes broadcast by BBC radio
and television and the independent companies
have won many international awards, for
example at the Prix Italia and Montreux
International Television Festivals.
Independent television companies give grants
for arts promotion in their regions. The BBC
plans to introduce a new digital television
channel, BBC FOUR (see p. 272), with the
specific aim of giving more primetime space to
cultural debate.
Radio
The BBC broadcasts each week about 150
hours of classical and other music (both live
and recorded) on Radio 3 (see p. 272). BBC
Radio 1 broadcasts rock and pop music, and
much of the output of BBC Radio 2 is popular
and light music. Classic FM offers mainly
classical and Virgin Radio plays rock. Much of
the output of the UK’s local radio stations is
popular and light music, news and
information. Radio 4’s output is mainly talk-
based and includes a wealth of drama,
documentary discussions and full-length
plays. Latest estimates indicate that radio
programmes reach 92% of the adult
population aged 15 and over, with BBC local
and national stations taking just over half of
the audience share. The Archers, Radio 4’s
serial chronicling the lives of a fictional rural
community in the village of Ambridge,
recently celebrated its 50th anniversary.
Film
At the end of 2000 there were 754 cinema sites
in Great Britain and 3,017 screens. The
258
16: CULTURE
average number of screens per site increased
from just over three in 1993 to just over four
in 2000, reflecting the growth in ‘multiplex’
(multi-screen cinema sites sometimes built in
out-of town locations) which currently
account for over half of all screens and over
two-thirds of all admissions. More than £539
million was invested in the British production
sector for films such as Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer’s Stone, The Mummy Returns, Proof of
Life, and Pearl Harbor. Shepperton and
Pinewood, two leading British film studios,
merged at the start of 2001 in a move designed
to strengthen the UK’s production base, and
attract more US investment.
Billy Elliott, a feature film about a working-
class boy in the North East of England
wishing to train as a professional ballet
dancer, was one of the notable success
stories of 2000 and the seventh most
popular film in the United Kingdom,
bringing in revenue of over £16 million
at the box office. The top three films in
2000 in terms of box office revenue w ere
Toy Story 2 (US), Gladiator (US) and
Chicken Run (a jointly funded, UK-US
production).
VISUAL ARTS
Museums and Galleries
Over 80 million visits a year are made to the
UK s 2,500 or so museums and galleries open
to the public (in contrast to the 800 museums
in 1980), which include the major national
collections (permanent displays of art and
artefacts), about 1,000 independent museums,
and 800 receiving support from local
authorities. The £15 million Designated
Challenge Fund made its second round of
awards in 2000. Nearly £7 million has so far
been awarded to 62 institutions in England, to
encourage them to raise their standards of ’
collection care and access. Exhibitions in the
form of smaller shows (often housed in the
same building as the national collections) or
less permanent displays of works of art also
attract thousands of visitors.
Current exhibitions include Paper Assets, a
wide-ranging collection of prints and drawings
(including cigarette cards) at the British
Museum; Zero to Infinity, Arte Povera
1962—1972 at Tate Modern; new installations
by Daphne Wright and retrospectives of
established names such as Barbara Hepworth
at the New Art Centre Sculpture Park and
Gallery, Salisbury; Rembrandt’s Women and
Lee Miller: the Photographer at the National
Galleries of Scotland; and an exhibition of
Japanese woodblock prints at the National
Museums and Galleries of Wales.
The English national museums and galleries are:
> British Museum, housing one of the most
comprehensive collections of European
and world culture. It also houses many
documents relating to Britain’s rich
literary heritage.
> Natural History Museum.
> Victoria and Albert Museum
(concentrating on fine and decorative
arts).
> National Museum of Science & Industry,
including the Science Museums in
London and Wroughton, the National
Railway Museum (York) and the
National Museum of Photography, Film
and Television (Bradford). Their exhibits
commemorate the role played by the UK
in the industrial and technological
revolutions of the 19th and 20th
centuries.
> National Gallery (Western painting from
about 1260 to 1900)—a collection of
worldwide importance, including the
Leonardo da V inci Cartoons and The
Haywain by Constable.
> Tate Britain, devoted to British art since
the 15th century, with additional
collections in Liverpool and St Ives,
Cornwall (St Ives School and modern
art).
> Tate Modern (20th-century international
art). Visitors at the recently opened
former power station in London reached
over 4 million in 2000, reflecting renewed
public interest in modern art.

The Royal Academy of Arts in London
holds an annual Summer Exhibition (the
233rd in 2001) which is the world’s largest
open display of present-day art, and other
important shows during the year. Anyone
claiming the status of an artist of
‘distinguished merit’ and seeking ‘reputation
and encouragement' may submit works to the
Summer Exhibition. In 2000, 1,516 were
chosen, representing 628 artists, from an entry
of over 13,000. The Royal Academy also puts
on children's shows, including the National
Exhibition of Children's Art.
Other important displays housed in
galleries and museums include: the New Art
Gallery, Walsall, containing a collection of
European art bequeathed by Kathleen
Garman (widow of the sculptor Jacob Epstein)
and Sally Ryan. The Lowry at Salford Quays,
Manchester, costing £96 million (£64 million
of which came from ACE Lottery funds),
houses galleries dedicated to the works of
L. S. Lowry. The Hermitage Rooms, a new
permanent display in Somerset House,
London, which opened in November 2000,
contains exhibitions originating from the
collection of the Hermitage Museum in St
Petersburg (see colour section between
pp. 202 and 203). Other important
collections in London include the Museum of
London; the Courtauld Institute Galleries
(containing masterpieces of 14th-20th-century
European painting); and the London
Transport Museum. Museums outside
London include those associated with
universities.
Scotland
In Scotland the national collections are held
by the National Museums of Scotland and the
National Galleries of Scotland. The former
include the Royal Museum, the Museum of
Scotland, the Scottish National War Museum
and the Scottish Agricultural Museum, in
Edinburgh; the Museum of Flight, near North
Berwick; and the Museum of Costume at
Shambellie House near Dumfries. The new
Museum of Scotland, built at a cost of £52
million and devoted to the history of Scotland,
has imaginative displays and distinctive
architecture.

The National Galleries of Scotland
comprise the National Gallery of Scotland, the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the
Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, and
the Dean Gallery, housing the Paolozzi gift of
sculpture and graphic art, and renowned Dada
and Surrealist collections. The National
Galleries also have deposits at Paxton House
near Berwick upon Tweed and Duff House in
Banff. In 2000 the National Museums of
Scotland attracted nearly 1.1 million visitors,
while in 2000—01 the National Galleries of
Scotland attracted over 1.1 million.
Wales
The National Museum of Wales in Cardiff has
a number of branches, including the Museum
of Welsh Life at St Fagans, the Slate Museum
at Llanberis and the National Waterfront
Museum Swansea, which is currently under
development and will be housed in Swansea’s
Maritime Quarter.
Contemporary museums are distancing
themselves from their traditional image of
dusty exhibits in glass cases. Many have
interactive displays and programmes of
lectures and demonstrations catering
specifically for school trips. One of the
most popular single exhibits in 2001, in the
Natural History Museum, was a three-
quarters size replica of a dinosaur, w hich
moved and reproduced swamp smells from
the Jurassic era. The dinosaur attracted
over 180,000 visitors in its opening week.
Northern Ireland
The Museums and Galleries of Northern
Ireland comprise the Ulster Museum in
Belfast, the Ulster Folk and Transport
Museum in County Down, and the Ulster-
American Folk Park in County Tyrone.
‘Living Museums’
Open-air museums depicting the life of an
area or preserving early industrial remains,
such as the W eald and Downland Museum in
Y\ est Sussex, the Ironbridge Gorge Museum
in Shropshire and the North of England Open
Air Museum at Beamish in County Durham,
are becoming increasingly popular tourist
attractions. Skills of the past are revived
interactively in a number of‘living’ museums
such as the Gladstone Pottery Museum near
Stoke-on-Trent and the Quarry Bank Mill at
Styal in Cheshire. Here, actors play the parts
of people living in a particular ‘bygone age’,
allow ing visitors to ask questions about their
working life and conditions.
Art Sales
The LK art market is second only to that of
the Lnited States. The UK’s art and antiques
trade handles about 70% of European art
sales, employs about 40,000 people, had
exports valued at £629 million in 1999 and in
the same year had a turnover of .£3.5 billion.
Auctions of works of art take place in the main
auction houses (two of the longest established
being Sotheby s and Christie’s), and through
private dealers. Art 200£ the UK’s leading
contemporary art fair, was held in London in
January, and has been influential in promoting
the careers of innovative artists such as
Tomoko Takahashi.
Crafts
Crafts’ in the L nited Kingdom is an umbrella
term covering a huge range of activities, from
the making of pots to rugs to handmade toys
and other personal and household products.
The crafts industry gives people another
opportunity to express their creativity, adds
richness and diversity to cultural life, and
provides significant employment.
The crafts in the UK have an annual
turnover estimated at £400 million.
Go\emment aid amounted to £2.5 million in
1999—2000. Policy and funding for the crafts in
England are the responsibility of ACE, which is
required to allocate at least £3.4 million, £3.6
million and £3.8 million to crafts for the years
1999—2000, 2000-01 and 2001—02 respectively,
w ith a further £750,000 for development.
The Crafts Council is the official
organisation for crafts in England. Its
objectnes include raising the profile of crafts
261
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
in England and abroad and strengthening and
developing, through its publications and
exhibition work, the crafts economy in
support of craftspeople. Activities and
responsibilities of the Crafts Council include
organising the annual Chelsea Crafts Fair and
other programmes from its London venue;
and coordinating British groups at
international fairs. Craft Forum Wales has a
membership of 640 craft business groups in
Wales; they had a turnover of £27.5 million in
1999. Craftworks, an independent company, is
the craft development agency for Northern
Ireland. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland
funds crafts promotion. In Scotland, the
Scottish Arts Council has a Crafts
Department, which promotes crafts and helps
craftworkers.

Among the leading trade organisations are
the Publishers Association (PA), which has
200 members; and the Booksellers Association,
with about 3,300 members. The PA, through
its international division, promotes the export
of British books. The Welsh Books Council
promotes the book trade in Wales in both
Welsh and English and the Gaelic Books
Council supports the publication of books in
Gaelic. The Book Trust encourages reading
and the promotion of books through an
information service and a children’s library.
THE WRITTEN WORD
Books have been central to the preservation
and dissemination of UK culture for
centuries. Despite the growth of television and
the Internet, demand for books remains as
strong as ever. In 2000 British publishers
issued over 116,000 separate titles (including
new editions). The UK book industry
exported books worth £1,172 million in 2000.
J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books have
continued their success, both in the domestic
and overseas markets. Sales of the four Harry
Potter books totalled 3.2 million in 2000, and
they occupied the top four places in the
bestsellers list. The latest in the series, Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire, was the best¬
selling book of 2000, with sales of just over
1 million. Fictional works of literature are just
part of the range of books on offer. Non¬
fiction, in particular gardening, lifestyle, and
travel books, as well as books tied to particular
television series, are consistently among the
lists of best-selling titles. Excluding the Harry
Potter series, the top ten best-selling titles of
2000 in Great Britain were as follows:
1. Angela's Ashes Frank McCourt
2. The Return of the Naked CA^/Jamie Oliver
3. Hannibal Thomas Harris
4. The Testament ]o\\n Grisham
5. Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason
Helen Fielding
Literary and Philological Societies
Societies to promote literature include the
English Association, the Royal Society of
Literature and the Welsh Academy (Yr
Academi Gymreig). The leading society for
studies in the humanities is the British
Academy for the Promotion of Historical,
Philosophical and Philological Studies (the
British Academy).
Other specialist societies are the Early
English Text Society, the Bibliographical
Society and several devoted to particular
authors, such as Jane Austen and Charles
Dickens. The Poetry Society sponsors poetry
readings and recitals, as does the Scottish
Poetry Library. London’s South Bank Centre
and the British Library run programmes of
literary events.
The National Poetry Competition,
sponsored by the Poetry Society, has
established itself as a major cultural event.
Ian Duhig won the 2000 competition,
beating around 8,000 other entries (the
winners were announced in April 2001).
LIBRARIES AND ARCHIVES
Local authorities in Great Britain and
education and library boards in Northern
262
16: CULTURE
Ireland have a duty to provide a free lending
and reference library service. There are almost
5,000 public libraries in the UK. In Great
Britain more than 34 million people (58% of
the population) are members of their local
library and about half of these borrow at least
once a month. About 430 million books and
37 million audio-visual items were borrowed
from UK public libraries in 1999-2000. Adult
fiction accounted for 43%, adult non-fiction
for 29% and children’s books for 28%. The
Government is advised on library and archives
policy by Resource (see p. 250).
Many libraries have collections of CDs,
records, audio- and video-cassettes, DVDs and
musical scores for loan to the public, while a
number also lend from collections of works of
art, which may be originals or reproductions.
Most libraries hold documents on local history,
and all provide services for children, while
reference and information sections, and art,
music, commercial and technical departments
meet a growing demand.
The information role is important for all
libraries: nearly all have personal computers for
public use and, in early 2000, 62% had Internet
connections. A government initiative under the
New Opportunities Fund is providing £20
million for information and communications
technology training of library staff and £50
million for enabling library material to be
stored and accessed in digitised form. The
Government is committed to networking all
public libraries and connecting them to the
National Grid for Learning by 2002. The
DCMS/Wolfson Public Libraries Challenge
Fund has mounted a £3 million campaign to
persuade people, especially the young, of the
joys of reading as a leisure pursuit.
Films are also archived. The bfi maintains
the J. Paul Getty Conservation Centre, which
contains over 275,000 films and 200,000
television programmes, together with
extensive collections of stills, posters and
designs. The bfi National Library forms the
world’s largest collection of film-related
books, periodicals, scripts and other written
materials.
The Library Association is the principal
professional organisation for those engaged in
library and information management,
founded in 1877, the Association has some
24,000 members. It maintains a Register of
Chartered Members and is the designated
authority for the recognition of qualifications
gained in other EU Member States.
Public Lending Right Scheme
The Public Lending Right Scheme gives
registered authors royalties from a central fund
(totalling just over £5 million in 1999-2000)
for the loans made of their books from public
libraries in the UK. Payment is made
according to the number of times an author’s
books are lent out. The maximum yearly
payment an author can receive is £6,000.
The top 12 most borrowed authors in 2000
Irom public libraries in the UK were:
Catherine Cookson, R. L. Stine, Danielle
Steel, Josephine Cox, Dick Francis, Janet
and Allan Ahlberg, Jack Higgins, Ruth
Rendell, Agatha Christie, Roald Dahl,
Lucy Daniels and Enid Blyton.
The British Library and National
Libraries
The British Library (BL), the national library
of the UK, is custodian of the most important
research collection in the world (150 million
items spanning 3,000 years). It is housed in
the largest wholly publicly funded building
constructed in the UK in the 20th century.
The total floor space is approximately
100,000 square metres. The basements, the
deepest in London, have 340 km of shelving
for 15 million books. There are 11 reading
areas, three exhibition galleries and a
conference centre with a 255-seat auditorium.
British publishers are legally obliged to
deposit a copy of their publications at the BL.
The National Libraries of Scotland and of
Wales, the Bodleian at Oxford and the
Cambridge University Library (and the
Library of Trinity College, Dublin) can also
claim copies of all new British publications
under legal deposit.
Some 456,000 reader visits are made to the
BL each year. The reading rooms are open to
those who need to see material (for example,
manuscripts, newspapers, journals, stamps,
263
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
maps and CD-ROMs as well as books) not
readily available elsewhere or whose work or
studies require the facilities of the national
library.
The BL’s Document Supply Centre at
Boston Spa (West Yorkshire) is the national
centre for inter-library lending within the UK
and between the UK and other countries. It
dispatches over 3.5 million documents a year.
University Libraries
As well as public and national libraries there are
nearly 700 in higher and further education
institutions, about 5,600 in schools and 2,220
specialised libraries within other public and
private sector organisations (such as
government bodies and commercial companies).
The university book collections of Oxford
and Cambridge number over 7 million and
more than 6 million items respectively. The
combined stores of the colleges and
institutions of the University of London total
9 million volumes. The John Rylands
University Library of Manchester contains
3.5 million volumes, Edinburgh 2.5 million,
Leeds 2.3 million, and Durham, Glasgow,
Liverpool and Aberdeen each have over
1 million volumes. Many universities have
vital research collections in special subjects,
the Barnes Medical Library at Birmingham
and the British Library of Political and
Economic Science at the London School of
Economics, for example.
Manuscripts and Other Records
The Historical Manuscripts Commission
locates, reports on, and gives information
and advice about historical papers outside
the public records. It also advises private
owners, grant-awarding bodies, record
offices, local authorities and the Government
on the acquisition and maintenance of
manuscripts. The Commission maintains the
National Register of Archives (the central
collecting point for information about British
historical manuscripts) and the Manorial
Documents Register, which are available to
researchers.
The Public Record Office (PRO) in Kew
(Surrey) houses the records of the superior
courts of law of England and Wales and of
most government departments, as well as
millions of historical documents, such as
Domesday Book (1086) and autograph letters
and documents of the sovereigns of England.
Public records, with a few exceptions, are
available for inspection by everyone 30 years
after the end of the year in which they were
created. The National Archives of Scotland
(formerly the Scottish Record Office) in
Edinburgh and the PRO of Northern Ireland
in Belfast serve the same purpose.
EDUCATION AND TRAINING
The National Curriculum specifies that all
children at school should receive training in
the arts, music and literature. For many,
involvement in art classes, the school play, or
orchestra is the first time their interest in
culture is awakened. The Government is keen
to encourage artistic talent at school. In
England, Artsmark, a new initiative from the
Department for Education and Skills (DfES)
and the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport in conjunction with ACE, gives formal
recognition to schools which achieve a certain
standard in the cultural education they offer.
Additional initiatives to encourage cultural
excellence in schools include:
> the Music Standards Fund, receiving
£270 million from the DfES over five
years. Some £60 million a year from the
DfES Standards Fund will be used over
the next three years to protect and
expand a range of music services, such as
buying musical instruments for schools,
providing instrumental tuition and
providing extra training for teachers;
> the National Foundation for Youth
Music, funded by a £30 million Lottery
grant and donations from other sources,
including the British Phonographic
Industry; and
> the Space for Sport and Arts initiative,
creating around 300 multi-purpose
facilities for primary schools in the most
deprived areas.
In Scotland, education is the responsibility
of the Scottish Executive Education
Department (SEED). Expressive arts are a key
264
16: CULTURE
component of the pre-school and 5-14
curricular guidelines, and are available as
examination subjects at Standard Grade,
Higher and Advanced Higher levels.
For those wishing to pursue the route of a
career in the arts, training available at post-16
tends to concentrate on particular specialisms
within the arts. The DCMS and DIES
disburse £19 million a year in grants for drama
and dance students for tuition and
maintenance. Over 800 students a year cover
their tuition fees in this way, on the same basis
as other higher and further education pupils.
All training must be at accredited institutions
and towards recognised qualifications, with
annual evaluation by the DCMS and DIES to
ensure that standards are maintained. Among
drama schools which train actors, directors,
technicians and stage managers are the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), the
Central School of Speech and Drama, the
London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art
(LAMDA), and the Drama Centre (all in
London); the Bristol Old Vic School; the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama
(Glasgow); Queen Margaret University College
(Edinburgh); and the Welsh College of Music
and Drama (Cardiff). Competition to enter all
the Schools of Performing Arts is keen.
The Royal National Theatre’s Education
Programme encourages access to drama on a
national level through youth theatre projects,
touring productions, workshops, rehearsed
readings, work in schools and a nationwide
membership scheme. The National Youth
Theatre in London, the touring National
Youth Theatre of Wales, the Scottish Youth
Theatre in Glasgow and the Ulster Youth
Drama Theatre offer early acting
opportunities to the young. ACE supports
several national touring companies that
produce plays for children, including Pop-Up,
Quicksilver and Theatre Centre. The Scottish’
Arts Council supports many youth theatre
initiatives and several theatre companies
touring Scotland with work for children,
including TAG, Visible Fictions, Wee Stories
and Catherine Wheels.
Professional training in music is given at
universities and conservatoires. The leading
London conservatoires are the Royal Academy
of Music, the Royal College of Music, the
Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and
Trinity College of Music. Outside London
are the Royal Scottish Academy of Music
and Drama (RSAMD), including the
Alexander Gibson School in Glasgow, the
Royal Northern College of Music in
Manchester, the Welsh College of Music and
Drama in Cardiff, and the Birmingham
Conservatoire.
Nearly a third of the players in the European
Community Youth Orchestra come from the
UK. There is also a National Youth Jazz
Orchestra, a Scottish Youth Jazz Orchestra and
a network of other youth jazz orchestras and
wind bands.
Professional training for dancers and
choreographers is provided mainly by specialist
schools, which include the Royal Ballet School,
the Central School of Ballet, the Northern
School of Contemporary Dance (Leeds) and
the London Contemporary Dance School.
All government-funded dance companies
provide dance workshops and education
activities. Phoenix Dance Company and
English National Ballet, for example, have
won awards for their projects, and Scottish
Ballet has a long history of education work.
Ludus Dance Company, in Lancaster, works
mainly with young people. The National
\ outh Dance Company gives a chance for
young people to work with professionals, as
does Scottish Youth Dance.
The National Film and Television School
is financed jointly by the Government and the
film, video and television industries (£5.5
million in 1999—2000). It offers postgraduate
and short course training for directors, editors,
camera operators, animators and other
specialists. The School enrols 50-60 full-time
students a year and about 850 on short course
programmes. The London International Film
School, the Royal College of Art and some
universities and other institutions of higher
education also offer courses in production.
The Skills Investment Fund, worth £1.5
million and run by Skillset, the National
Training Organisation for the industry, aims
to boost UK film production training. The
Film Council makes £5 million available for
the film Training Fund, for screenwriters to
gain expertise in producing commercially
attractive screenplays; and a further
265
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
million to First Movies, to enable children
to make a first film using low-cost digital
technology.
Most practical education in art and design
is provided in the art colleges and fine and
applied art departments of universities (these
include the Slade School of Art and
Goldsmiths College of Art, London), which
have absorbed the former independent art
schools, and in further education colleges and
private art schools. Some of these institutions
award degrees at postgraduate level. The
Royal College of Art in London is the only
postgraduate school of art and design in the
world. Art is also taught to degree level at the
four Scottish art schools.
University courses concentrate largely on
academic disciplines, such as the history of art.
The Courtauld and Warburg Institutes of the
University of London and the Department of
Classical Art and Archaeology at University
College London are leading institutions. Art is
a foundation subject in the National
Curriculum in England (see p. 132). The
Society for Education through Art, among
other activities, encourages schools to buy
original works by organising an annual
‘Pictures for Schools’ exhibition.
AWARDS
The granting of awards remains a popular
means of recognising and rewarding
outstanding cultural achievement. Awards
ceremonies generate large amounts of
publicity for the industry concerned; and the
careers of individual performers are often
boosted enormously by the awards they
receive. The number of awards ceremonies
grows by the year; a selection of some of the
most important awards—given in 2001 unless
otherwise stated—is given in Table 16.2.
British actors and filmmakers have enjoyed
success at Hollywood’s Oscars in recent years.
A Lifetime Achievement award was given in
2001 to cinematographer Jack Cardiff.
AUDIENCES AND EXPENDITURE
Recent official estimates included in a creative
industries mapping report produced by the
DCMS creative industries initiative suggest
that, taken as a whole, these industries generate
around £112.5 billion a year in revenue,
contribute some £10.2 billion in export
earnings, employ 1.3 million people and account
for over 5% of Gross Domestic Product.
By sector, the music industry as a whole in
2000 was worth over £4 billion (with exports
worth £1.3 billion). It employed about
120,000 people. Over 200 million pop albums
and 66 million pop singles were sold in the
UK domestic market, generating a turnover of
£1,170 million, a 3.3% increase on the
previous year. Year-on-year sales of classical
albums increased by 13% in 2000 to £66.5
million.
In 2000, cinemas took £507 million at the
box office, from 349 films on release,
compared with £583 million in 1999, from 360
films. An estimated 45,000 people were
employed in the film and video industry in
2000. Exports in 1999 were worth around
£653 million.
In 2000 the London West End theatres
were credited with bringing around £1 billion
into the UK economy, when additional
expenditure on travel, accommodation and
meals has been added to the cost of a ticket.
Figures from the ONS Family
Expenditure Survey provide further evidence
that the culture and leisure industries are
strong growth areas for the economy: in
1999-2000 the average household spent more
on leisure goods and services (including
holidays) than food (see chapter 22).
Increasing amounts are also being spent on
satellite subscriptions to channels and cable
TV subscriptions and connections.
Investment in new museums and galleries
(particularly those in Salford, Walsall and
Bankside, London) has also helped to
regenerate local communities.
Attendance figures at cultural events are
also either steady or increasing (see Table
16.3). In the UK more people attend live
music performances than football matches.
Admissions to cinemas rose from 139 million
in 1999 to 143 million in 2000, reaching their
highest level since 1974. Museum and gallery
attendance in England rose from 25 million in
1999-2000 to over 27 million in 2000-01 (see
Table 16.4).

Ironbridge Gorge, Shropshire
The Ironbridge Gorge is celebrated for its role in the
Industrial Revolution. The mass production of iron began
here in the 18th century, helping to create the British
engineering industry and laying the foundations for the
railway age in the next century. The revolution changed the
landscape of the United Kingdom forever.
In 1986 a two-mile stretch of the Ironbridge Gorge was
added to the World Heritage List by UNESCO.

A Government White Paper proposing a new framework for communications
regulation in the UK was published jointly by the Department of Trade and
Industry and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in December 2000
It set out the Government’s response to the new communications environment
encompassing digital media, multi-channel television, telecommunications and
nternet services. The aim is to promote the global competitiveness of the UK’s
media and communications industries as well as to protect the interests of
the consumer.
Television and Radio
The Department for Culture, Media and
Sport is responsible for government policy on
broadcasting. 1 hree public authorities oversee
television and radio services. They are
accountable to Parliament, but are otherwise
independent in their day-to-day operations.
The authorities are:
^ the BBC (British Broadcasting
Corporation), which broadcasts television
and radio programmes and online
services;
the I PC (Independent Television
Commission), which licenses and
regulates commercial television services,
including cable, satellite and independent
teletext services; and
^ the Radio Authority, which licenses and
regulates commercial radio services,
including cable and satellite.
There are five terrestrial analogue television
channels, offering a mixture of drama, light
entertainment, films, sport, educational,
children’s and religious programmes, news
and current affairs, and documentaries. These
comprise two national BBC networks,
financed almost wholly by a licence fee, and
the commercial ITV (Channel 3), Channel 4
and Channel 5 services, which are funded by
advertising and sponsorship. In Wales, S4C—
Sianel Pedwar Cymru—broadcasts
programmes on the fourth channel.
Satellite television and cable services are
funded mainly by subscription income. The
largest satellite programmer is BSkyB (British

Sky Broadcasting), which dominates
subscription-based television in the United
Kingdom.
The UK’s first digital satellite and
terrestrial television services (see pp. 274 and
277) started in 1998, providing the existing
analogue programmes in a digital format,
together with free-to-air and subscription and
pay-per-view1 services. Digital cable services
began in 1999.
The BBC has five national radio networks
(see p. 272), which together transmit all types
of music, news, current affairs, drama,
education, sport and a range of features
programmes. There are also 39 BBC local
radio services covering England and the
Channel Islands, and national radio services in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,
including Welsh and Gaelic language stations.
BBC radio takes a 52% share of the total UK
radio audience.
There are three national commercial radio
stations (see p. 275). About 240 independent
local radio (ILR) services also supply local
news and information, sport, music and other
entertainment, education and consumer
advice. The first commercial digital radio
services started in 1999.
DIGITAL BROADCASTING
The transition from analogue to digital
transmission technology has the potential to
expand broadcasting capacity enormously.
Digital broadcasting, which uses computer
technology instead of standard signals, allows
much more information than before to be
transmitted, and can offer many more
channels, extra services, interactivity, and
higher quality picture and sound to viewers
and listeners with new receiving equipment.
Digital television services can be received
through an existing television aerial, a cable
connection or a satellite dish. Viewers need
either a special set-top box decoder, enabling
reception of digital broadcasts through an
analogue television set, or an integrated digital
television set. Radio listeners need to invest in
new sets to hear digital radio.
Legislation was passed in 1996 setting out a
regulatory framework for the introduction of
digital terrestrial broadcasting (and paving the
way for more broadly based competitive media
groups—see p. 283). The Broadcasting Act
1996 provided for:
> the licensing of six digital terrestrial
television (DTT) ‘multiplexes’,2 and of
the providers of the programmes or other
services on them; and
> the licensing of digital radio services on
two national multiplexes, with
multiplexes for local services in most
parts of the UK.
The existing public service broadcasters
have guaranteed capacity on the multiplexes.
Licences to operate commercial DTT
multiplexes were awarded by the ITC in 1997,
and all DTT multiplexes started broadcasting
in 1998. The Radio Authority awarded the
national commercial radio multiplex licence in
1998, and is inviting applications for local
commercial multiplex licences in most of the
main population centres across the UK.
Many of the new services on digital
television are available on a subscription or
2 Through the process known as multiplexing, the signals of
several broadcasters are combined into a single stream on
a single-frequency channel. There is therefore no longer
a direct one-to-one relationship between a television service
and a frequency.
1 A free-to-air service can be received without charge to the
viewer. Pay-per-view allows subscribers to pay for a specific
programme, such as a film, sporting event or concert.
270
17: MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS
pay-per-view basis. Any broadcaster wishing
to offer pay-television needs to use a
‘conditional access’ system (covering
encryption, scrambling and subscription
management services) to ensure that only
those who have paid for a particular service
receive it.
Existing analogue transmissions will
continue for some time, but the Government
wants to announce a switch-off date for
analogue services as soon as is practicable. It
has said that the switch-over to digital
broadcasting could start to happen as early as
2006 and be completed by 2010, provided that
all viewers who can receive the current free-
to-air analogue services can receive them
digitally. By the end of 2000 about 30% of
households in the UK had access to digital
television (the great majority via satellite). In
April 2001, to encourage the digital switch¬
over, the Government announced a scheme to
provide a series of targeted neighbourhoods
with free conversion to digital TV (including
access to interactive Internet services and e-
mail). This programme is intended to provide
practical experience to plan the switch-over
from analogue services.
THE BBC
The BBC is the UK’s main public service
broadcaster. ’ A Royal Charter and Agreement
govern its constitution, finances and
obligations. Its Board of Governors appoints
the Director-General, who heads the bodies in
charge of the daily running of the
Corporation. It has a regional structure
throughout the UK.
The domestic services of the BBC are
financed almost wholly by a licence fee. All
households or premises with a television set
must buy an annual licence. This costs £109
for colour and £36.50 for black and white in
2001-02, although people aged 75 and over
have been entitled to free licences since
1 November 2000. Licence income is
supplemented by profits from the commercial

entertainment for all.
activities of BBC Worldwide (see p. 273).
BBC World Service’s radio broadcasting
operations (see p. 272) are financed by a grant
from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office.
In 2000 the Government announced new
funding plans for the BBC over the period to
2006—07, aimed at ensuring that the
Corporation can continue to meet its public
service obligations and operate effectively in a
competitive market.
BBC Television
The BBC broadcasts 17,000 hours of
television each year on its two analogue
domestic channels to national and regional
audiences. BBC ONE is the channel of broad
appeal (including documentaries and current
affairs, features, drama and light
entertainment, sport, religion and children’s
programmes), while BBC TWO aims for more
innovation and originality in its programming.
Network programmes are made at, or
acquired through, Television Centre in
London and six bases throughout the UK
(Glasgow in Scotland, Cardiff in W ales,
Belfast in Northern Ireland, and Birmingham,
Bristol and Manchester in England); or they
are commissioned from independent
producers—the BBC must ensure that at least
25% of its original programming comes from
the independent sector.
The Corporation provides a range of digital
channels available free-to-air, including:
> an extended BBC ONE and BBC TWO
in widescreen;
> BBC News 24 (a 24-hour news channel);
> BBC Choice, a supplementary service to
complement and enhance the network
schedules;
BBC Parliament (coverage of proceedings
in the House of Commons, House of
Lords, the Parliament in Scotland and
the assemblies in Wales and Northern
Ireland—see p. 278); and
> BBC Knowledge (the UK’s first fully
integrated public service multimedia
learning service).
It also offers BBC Text, a new digital
teletext service for its digital viewers.
271
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
In February 2001 the BBC announced
plans to introduce four new digital services.
Subject to government approval, its existing
BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge channels
would be replaced by BBC THREE (an
entertainment channel for young adults) and
BBC FOUR (devoted to culture). There
would also be two daytime children’s
channels. In September 2001 the Government
approved conditionally three of the proposed
services, but not BBC THREE. However, the
BBC was offered the opportunity to put
forward fresh proposals for a replacement for
BBC Choice.
The BBC’s Online channel on the Internet
provides constantly updated news, sport,
finance, travel and other information,
attracting 4.9 million users in 2000-01.
Education is a central component of the
Corporation’s public service commitment
across all platforms. A range of educational
programmes is broadcast for primary and
secondary schools (over 90% of which use
BBC schools television), further education
colleges and the Open University (see
p. 141), while programmes for adults cover
numeracy, literacy, language learning, health,
work and vocational training. Books,
pamphlets, computer software, and audio and
video cassettes supplement the programmes.
BBC Network Radio
BBC Network Radio, broadcasting to the
whole of the UK, transmits almost 43,000
hours of programmes each year on its five
networks (broadcasting 24 hours a day):
> Radio 1 is a contemporary music station,
serving a young target audience (with
nearly 10% of the overall radio audience
share during January-Mareh 2001);
> Radio 2 offers a broad range of music,
light entertainment, documentaries,
public service broadcasting and popular
culture (over 14% of audience share);
> Radio 3 covers classical and jazz music,
drama, documentaries and discussion
(over 1% share);
> Radio 4 offers news and current affairs
coverage, complemented by drama,
science, the arts, religion, natural history,
medicine, finance and gardening features;
it also carries parliamentary coverage and
cricket in season on Long Wave, and
BBC World Service overnight (over
11% share);
> Radio 5 Live broadcasts news, current
affairs and extensive sports coverage
(over 4% share).
BBC plans to provide five new digital radio
services (for launch in 2001 and 2002) were
approved by the Government in September
2001. They will be available via digital satellite
and cable, the Internet and digital radio sets.
Three services will focus on: black music,
news and speech aimed at a young audience;
popular music from the 1970s to the 1990s
(drawing on the BBC’s archive of musical
performances, concerts and interviews); and a
speech-based service, offering comedy, drama,
stories and features (mixing original and
archive programming). Two other services—
5 Live Sports Plus and a national BBC Asian
Network—will be enhancements of existing
services. The BBC World Service (see below)
will also be available as part of BBC Radio’s
digital portfolio.
BBC World Service
BBC World Service broadcasts by radio in 43
languages (including English) worldwide. It
has an estimated global weekly audience of 153
million listeners. This excludes any estimate
for listeners in countries where it is difficult
to survey audiences. The core programming
of news, current affairs, business and sports
reports is complemented by cultural
programmes, including drama, literature
and music.
While maintaining short wave broadcasts
for mass audiences, BBC World Service is
making programmes more widely available on
FM frequencies and delivering services in
major languages through digital broadcasting
and on the Internet.
BBC World Service programmes in
English and many other languages are made
available by satellite for rebroadcasting by
agreement with local or national radio stations,
networks and cable operators.
272
17: MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS
BBC Monitoring, the international media
monitoring arm of BBC World Service,
provides transcripts of radio and television
broadcasts from 150 countries. As well as
providing a vital source of information to the
BBC, this service is used by other media
organisations, government departments, the
commercial sector and academic institutions.
BBC Worldwide
BBC \\ orldwide Limited is the main
commercial arm, and a wholly owned
subsidiary, of the BBC. It was formed in 1994
to coordinate the Corporation’s commercial
activities (television, publishing, product
licensing, the Internet and interactive
services), which are not funded by the licence
fee. Its role is to generate money that can be
rein\ ested in public service programming for
the benefit of UK licence payers.
BBC Worldwide is Europe’s largest exporter
of television programmes, the world’s biggest
television channel operator based outside the
Lnited States, and the UK’s third largest
publisher of consumer magazines. These
activities accounted for turnover of £587
million in 2000—01, which in turn delivered
£96 million back to the BBC for reinvestment
in programming and other services.
It operates 12 commercial channels in the
UK and overseas. These include the wholly
owned BBC World (news and information),
BBC Prime (entertainment) and BBC America
channels, and nine other channels in joint
ventures with other companies (Discovery
Communications, Flextech, and FOXTEL
and Pearson). Together, they reach about 365
million households across the world.
BBC \\ orldwide is the market leader in
audio publishing. It also operates online
services (beeb.com and beeb.net).
INDEPENDENT BROADCASTING
Independent Television Commission
The ITC is responsible for licensing and
regulating commercial television services
(including BBC commercial services)
operating in, or from, the UK. It does not
make, broadcast or transmit programmes.
The ITC must ensure that a wide range of
commercial television services is available
throughout the UK and that they are of a high
quality and appeal to a variety of tastes and
interests. It must also ensure fair competition
in the provision of these services, and
compliance with the rules on media
ownership.
The Commission regulates the various
television services through licence conditions,
codes and guidelines. The codes cover
programme content, advertising, sponsorship
and technical standards. If a licensee does not
comply with the conditions of its licence or
the codes, the ITC can impose penalties.
These range from a formal warning or a
requirement to broadcast an apology or
correction, to a fine. In extreme
circumstances, a company’s licence may be
shortened or revoked.
ITV (Channel 3)
IT\ is made up of 15 regionally based
television companies, which are licensed to
supply programmes in the 14 independent
television geographical regions. There are two
licences for London, one for weekdays and the
other for the weekend. An additional ITC
licensee provides a national breakfast-time
service, transmitted on the ITV network.
The ITV licences for Channel 3 are
awarded for a ten-year period by competitive
tender to the highest bidder (who has to have
passed a quality threshold). Licensees must
provide a diverse programme service designed
to appeal to a wide range of tastes and
interests. Each company plans the content of
the programmes to be broadcast in its area.
These are produced by the company itself, by
other programme companies, or are bought
from elsewhere. As with the BBC, at least
250/o of original programming must come
from the independent sector. About one-third
of the output is made up of informative
programmes—news, documentaries, and
coverage of current affairs, education and
religion—while the remainder covers drama,
entertainment, sport, the arts and children’s’
programmes. Programmes are broadcast 24
hours a day throughout the country. A
common national and international news
273
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
service is provided by Independent Television
News (ITN).
ITV (Channel 3) companies are obliged to
operate a national programme network. The
ITV Network Centre, which is owned by the
companies, independently commissions and
schedules programmes.
Operating on a commercial basis, licensees
derive most of their income from selling
advertising time. Their financial resources and
programme production vary considerably,
depending largely on the population of the
areas in which they operate. Newspaper
groups can acquire a controlling interest in
ITV companies, although measures are in
force to deter any undue concentrations of
media ownership (see p. 284).
Granada and Carlton, the two dominant
regional ITV (Channel 3) television
companies, jointly own ITV Digital (known as
ONdigital until July 2001), which occupies
three of the six multiplexes licensed for digital
terrestrial television. It offers over 30
channels, including subscription and non¬
subscription TV channels and some
interactive services. ITV Digital services were
launched in 1998 and had attracted 1 million
subscribers by the end of 2000.
Channel 4 and S4C
Channel 4 provides a national 24-hour
television service, although Wales has its own
corresponding service—S4C (Sianel Pedwar
Cymru). Channel 4 is a statutory corporation,
licensed and regulated by the ITC, and
funded by selling its own advertising time. Its
remit is to provide programmes with a
distinctive character and to appeal to tastes
and interests not generally catered for by ITV
(Channel 3). It must present a suitable
proportion of educational programmes, and
encourage innovation and experiment.
Channel 4 commissions programmes from the
ITV companies and independent producers,
and buys programmes from overseas. In
February 2001 Channel 4 announced a
restructure, and launched a new incorporated
company, 4Ventures, to manage all its film
and other new business activities.
The fourth analogue channel in Wales is
allocated to S4C, which is regulated by the
Welsh Fourth Channel Authority. Members
of the Welsh Authority are appointed by the
Government. S4C must ensure that a
significant proportion of programming—and
the majority between 18.30 and 22.00 hours—
is in the Welsh language. At other times it
transmits Channel 4 programmes. In 1998
S4C launched a digital service incorporating
current analogue Welsh programmes and
additional material. Roughly 5% of S4C’s
income comes from advertising, programme
sales, merchandising and publicity; the rest
comes from a government grant, which is
fixed by statute.
Channel 5
The UK’s most recent national terrestrial
channel went on air in 1997, its ten-year
licence having been awarded by competitive
tender to Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited.
Channel 5 serves about 70% of the population
and is supported by advertising revenue.
Like ITV (Channel 3), the new service is
subject to positive programming
requirements. It must show programmes of
Popular Television Programmes
The most consistently popular television
programmes in the UK are soap operas
(everyday-life drama serials), notably
ITV’s Coronation Street and the BBC’s
EastEnders (which are broadcast several
times a week and attract average audiences
of 16-17 million viewers for each episode).
Other current peak-time favourites are
quiz shows, such as Who Wants To Be a
Millionaire? (ITV) and The Weakest Link
(BBC), and leisure and lifestyle
programmes. Channel 4 has meanwhile
pioneered competitive ‘people-watching’
shows in the UK, particularly the
successful Big Brother series.
British programmes also sell well
abroad. In addition to historical drama and
quiz shows, particular recent successes
have included the computer graphic BBC
documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, and
the children’s programmes Tweenies and
Bob the Builder.

quality and diversity, with a range of original
productions and commissions from
independent producers.
Gaelic Broadcasting
The Gaelic Broadcasting Committee is an
independent statutory body committed to
ensuring that a good selection of quality
television and radio programmes is broadcast
in Gaelic for reception in Scotland. Its
members are appointed by the ITC, in
consultation with the Radio Authority. The
Committee is responsible for the distribution
of government money to programme makers
through the Gaelic Broadcasting Fund.
The Radio Authority
The Radio iVuthority’s licensing and
regulatory remit covers all independent radio
services, including national, local, cable and
satellite services. Its three main tasks are to
plan frequencies, appoint licensees with a view
to broadening listener choice, and regulate
programming and advertising.
The Radio Authority has to make sure that
licensed services are of a high quality, and
offer programmes which will appeal to many
different tastes and interests. It has
published codes covering engineering,
programmes, news and current affairs, and
advertising and sponsorship, to which
licensees must adhere.
Independent National Radio
There are currently three independent
national radio services, whose licences were
awarded by the Radio Authority through
competitive tender, and w hich broadcast 24
hours a day:
Classic FM, which broadcasts mainly
classical music, together with news and
information;
> Virgin 1215, which plays broad-based
rock music (and is supplemented by a
separate Virgin station w hich operates
under a local London licence); and
^ Talk Sport, a speech-based service.
Independent Local Radio
Independent local radio (ILR) stations broadcast
a w ide range of programmes and new s of local
interest, as well as music and entertainment,
traffic reports and advertising. There are also
stations serving ethnic minority communities.
The Radio Authority aw ards independent local
licences, although not by competitive tender; the
success of licence applications is in part
determined by the extent to w hich applicants
widen choice and meet the needs and interests of
the people living in the area, and in part by
w hether they have the necessary financial
resources for the eight-year licence period. Local
radio stations do not have guaranteed slots on
digital local radio multiplexes.
The Radio Authority also issues restricted
service licences (RSLs). Short-term RSLs,
generally for periods of up to 28 days, are for
special events or trial services, and long-term
RSLs, primarily for student and hospital
stations, broadcast to specific establishments.
TELETEXT, CABLE AND SATELLITE
SERVICES
Teletext Services
Teletext is w ritten copy broadcast on
television sets. There are several teletext
ser\ ices, operated by the BBC (including a
new' digital service—see p. 271) and by
independent television. They offer constantly
updated information on a variety of subjects,
including new's, sport, travel, weather and
entertainment. The teletext system allows the
television signal to carry additional
information w hich can be selected and
displayed as ‘pages’ of text and graphics on
receivers equipped with the necessary
decoders. Around 16 million homes have sets
with teletext decoders. The BBC and
Channels 3, 4 and 5 provide subtitling for
people w ith hearing difficulties. The ITC
awards teletext licences for Channels 3, 4 and
5 by competitive tender for a period often
years.
Cable Services
Cable services are delivered to consumers
through underground cables and are paid for

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Communications White Paper
Following a review of the future regulation
of broadcasting and telecommunications,
taking account of the implications of the
increasing convergence of the two sectors,
the Government published a White Paper,
A New Future for Communications, in
December 2000. The main proposals in the
White Paper are:
> the establishment of a new unified,
independent regulator—the Office of
Communications (OFCOM)—
combining the functions of the
Broadcasting Standards Commission,
Independent Television Commission,
Office of Telecommunications
(OFTEL; see p. 285), Radio Authority
and the Radiocommunications
Agency;
> while the BBC would be subject to
OFCOM’s regulation with regard to
standards, its Board of Governors
would retain the role of overseeing the
Corporation’s public service remit and
upholding its political and editorial
independence;
> the BBC’s and S4C’s present roles
would remain, but Channel 4’s remit
would be reviewed, as would Channel
5’s public service obligations;
> ITV companies would continue as the
main commercial providers of public
service broadcasting, but with less
prescriptive regulation; and
> OFCOM would have powers to
promote effective competition in the
communications services sector for the
benefit of consumers.
The White Paper also invited comments
for reform of cross-media ownership rules,
including television ownership rules (see
p. 283), where the present disqualification on
holding two or more independent television
licences where the licensee has 15% or more
of the total television audience share would
be reviewed and a simplification of the
present regulations governing radio
ownership considered.
In July 2001 the Government published
legislative proposals providing for the formal
establishment of OFCOM. A broader draft
communications bill should follow later in
the parliamentary session.
by subscription. The franchising of cable
systems and the regulation of cable television
services are carried out by the ITC, while
the Radio Authority issues cable radio
licences. ITC licences are required for
systems capable of serving more than 1,000
homes. Systems extending beyond a single
building and up to 1,000 homes require only
an individual licence regulated by OFTEL
(see p. 285).
‘Broadband cable’ systems can carry
between 30 and 65 television channels using
analogue technology (including terrestrial
broadcasts, satellite television and channels
delivered to cable operators by landline or
videotape), as well as a full range of
telecommunications services. Digital
technology is being introduced which will
support up to 500 television channels. The
two major cable companies (NTL and
Telewest) started converting their networks to
digital transmission during 1999.
There are no specific quality controls on
cable services. However, if cable operators also
provide their own programme content as
opposed to just conveying services, they
require a programme services licence from the
ITC, which includes consumer protection
requirements.
There are currently around 140 operating
cable franchises in the UK. By the end of 2000
over 12.6 million homes were able to receive
broadband cable services; of these 3.6 million
subscribed to television services.
Cable also has the capacity for computer-
based interactive services, such as video-on-
demand,4 home shopping, home banking,
security and alarm services, e-mail and high¬
speed Internet access. It can additionally
supply television services tailored for, and

a cable or telephone network, and call up a programme or film of
their choice, which is then transmitted to that household alone.

directed at, local communities. Local
television services operate under location-
specific restricted service licences (making use
of spare frequencies as and when they are
available). These services began in 1998.
Satellite Services
Direct broadcasting by satellite, by which
television is transmitted directly by satellite
into people’s homes, has been available
throughout the UK since 1989. The signals
from satellite broadcasting are received
through specially designed aerials or ‘dishes’.
Most services are paid for by subscription. All
satellite television services provided by
broadcasters established in the UK are
licensed and regulated by the ITC.
Some services offer general entertainment,
while others concentrate on specific areas of
interest, such as sport, music, religion, health,
children’s programmes and feature films.
They also include foreign language services,
some of them designed for ethnic minorities
within the LK and others aimed primarily at
audiences in other countries. Viewers in the
LK can likewise receive a variety of television
sen ices from other European countries.
Satellite services must comply with the ITC’s
programmes, advertising and sponsorship
codes, but they are not subject to any positive
programming obligations.
BSkyB is the LK’s largest satellite
programmer, with 5.1 million ‘direct to home’
subscribers. BSkyB’s digital satellite service,
SkyDigital, w hich offers over 200 channels
including T\ and radio services (subscription
and non-subscription), was launched in 1998.
New interactive services started in 1999.
Satellite radio services must be licensed by
the Radio Authority if they are transmitted
from the UK for general reception within the
country, or if they are transmitted from
outside the L K but are managed editorially
from w ithin it.
OTHER ASPECTS
Advertising and Sponsorship
The BBC may not raise revenue from
broadcasting advertisements or from
commercial sponsorship of programmes on its
public service channels. It must not give
publicity to any firm or organised interest
except when this is necessary in providing
effective and informative programmes. It does,
however, cover sponsored sporting and artistic
events. Advertising and sponsorship are
allow ed on all commercial television and radio
services, subject to controls. The ITC and the
Radio Authority operate codes governing
advertising standards and programme
sponsorship, and can impose penalties on
broadcasters who do not comply.
Advertisements on independent television
and radio are broadcast in breaks during
programmes as w ell as between programmes,
and must be distinct and separate from them.
Advertisers are not allowed to influence
programme content. Advertising is prohibited
in broadcasts of religious services and in
broadcasts to schools. Political adv ertising and
advertisements for betting (other than the
National Lottery, the football pools and bingo)
are prohibited. All tobacco advertising is
banned on television and cigarette
advertisements are banned on radio. Religious
advertisements may be broadcast on
commercial radio and television, provided
thev comply w ith the guidelines issued by the
ITC and the Radio Authority.
Sponsorship in Independent Broodcosting
In return for their financial contribution,
sponsors receive a credit associating them with
a particular programme. The ITC’s Code of
Programme Sponsorship and the Radio
Authority’s Advertising and Sponsorship
Code aim to ensure that sponsors do not exert
influence on the editorial content of
programmes and that sponsorships are made
clear to viewers and listeners. News and
current affairs programmes on telev ision may
not be sponsored. References to sponsors or
their products must be confined to the
beginning and end of a programme and
around commercial breaks; on television they
must not appear in the programme itself. All
commercial radio programmes other than
news bulletins may be sponsored.
The ITC permits masthead programming
(programmes with the same title as a magazine
277
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
and made or funded by its publishers) on all
UK commercial television services.
Broadcasting Standards
The independence of the broadcasting
authorities carries certain obligations
concerning programme content. Broadcasters
must try to achieve a wide and balanced range
of subject matter, impartiality in controversial
issues and accuracy in news coverage, and
must not offend against good taste.
Broadcasters must also obey the law relating to
obscenity and incitement to racial hatred.
The BBC, the ITC and the Radio
Authority apply rules on impartiality, the
portrayal of violence, and standards of taste
and decency in programmes, particularly
during hours when children are likely to be
viewing or listening. Television programmes
broadcast before 21.00 hours (or 20.00 hours
on certain cable and satellite services) must be
suitable for a general audience, including
children.
Broadcasting Standards Commission (BSC)
The BSC, a statutory body, monitors
standards and fairness on television and radio
(both terrestrial and satellite). It considers
complaints received from the public, and
adjudicates on claims of unfair treatment in
broadcasts and of unwarranted infringement
of privacy in programmes or in their
preparation. In 2000-01 the Commission
received 360 fairness complaints, of which 111
were within its remit; of these, 80 complaints
were considered further, and 21% were
upheld in part or in full. The BSC also
received 4,920 complaints about standards, of
which 3,944 were within its remit; 3,123
complaints were pursued, of which 25% were
upheld in part or in full.
Parliamentary Broadcasting
The proceedings of both Houses of Parliament
may be broadcast on television and radio,
either live or, more usually, in recorded and
edited form on news and current affairs
programmes. The BBC has a specific
obligation to transmit on radio an impartial
account day by day of the proceedings in both
Houses of Parliament. The BBC Parliament
digital channel (see p. 271) transmits
continuous coverage of daily proceedings. The
proceedings of the Scottish Parliament and the
Assemblies for Wales and Northern Ireland
are also broadcast live on occasions and in
recorded and edited form on a regular basis by
the BBC.
Party Political Broadcasts
In the absence of paid political advertising in
the UK, broadcasters make time available for
party political and election broadcasts on
television and radio. Changes have been
introduced by broadcasters to reflect the
increased number of elections in the UK
following devolution and to refocus broadcasts
between elections at key times in the political
calendar (for example, the Budget, the
Queen’s Speech and party conferences). The
content of these broadcasts is the
responsibility of the parties, although they
have to comply with broadcasters’ rules. The
Government may make ministerial broadcasts
on radio and television, with opposition
parties also being allotted broadcast time.
Audience Research
The BBC and the commercial sector are
required to monitor the state of public opinion
about the programmes and advertising that they
broadcast. This is done through the continuous
measurement of the size and composition of
audiences and their opinions of programmes.
For television, this work is undertaken through
BARB (the Broadcasters’ Audience Research
Board). Joint research is undertaken for BBC
radio and for commercial radio by RAJAR
(Radio Joint Audience Research).
The BBC, the commercial sector and the
BSC conduct regular surveys of audience
opinion on television and radio services.
European Agreements
The UK has implemented two European
agreements on cross-border broadcasting—the
European Community Broadcasting Directive
278
17: MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS
and the Council of Europe Convention on
Transfrontier Television. These oversee the
free flow of television programmes and
services throughout participating countries,
setting minimum standards on advertising,
sponsorship, taste and decency, and the
portrayal of sex and violence. If a broadcast
meets these standards, no participating
country may prevent reception in its territory.
The Press
On an average weekday it is estimated that
54% of people aged 15 and over in the UK
read a national morning newspaper (59% of
men and 50% of women in 2000-01). About
84% of adults read a regional or local
newspaper every week. National papers have
an average (but declining) total circulation
of some 13 million on weekdavs and about
14 million on Sundays. There are more than
1,300 regional and local newspaper titles.
\\ hile newspapers are almost always
financially independent of any political party,
the\ often express obvious political leanings in
their editorial coverage, which may derive
from proprietorial and other non-party
influences. Ownership of the national press
lies in the hands of a number of large
corporations (see Table 17.2), most of w hich
are in\ol\ed in the whole field of publishing
and communications. There are around 100
regional press publishers—ranging from those
ow ning just one title (about half of them) to a
few controlling more than 100 each.
In addition to sales revenue, newspapers and
periodicals earn considerable amounts from
advertising. Indeed, the press is the largest
advertising medium in the UK. The British
press i eceives no subsidies from the state.
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL TITLES
The National Press
The national press consists of ten morning
daily papers and nine Sunday papers (see
Table 17.2). At one time London’s Fleet
Street area was the centre of the industry, but
nowr all the national papers have moved their
editorial and printing facilities to other parts
of London or away from the capital altogether.
Editions of several papers, such as the
Financial Times, Guardian and Daily Mirror,
are also printed in other countries.
National newspapers are often described as
quality , mid-market or ’popular1 papers on
the basis of differences in style and content.
Five dailies and four Sundays are usually
described as ‘quality’ newspapers, which are
directed at readers w ho w ant full information
on a w ide range of public matters. Popular
newspapers tend to appeal to those who want
to read shorter, entertaining stories with more
human interest. ‘Mid-market’ publications
cater for the intermediate readership. Quality
papers are normally in the larger broadsheet
format, w hile mid-market and popular papers
are smaller-size ‘tabloid’ format.
Many newspapers are printed in colour and
most produce extensive supplements as part of
the Saturday or Sunday edition, w ith articles
on personal finance, travel, gardening, home
improvement, food and w ine, fashion and
other leisure topics.
Increasing competition from other media in
the delivery of news, information and
entertainment has had an effect on the
national press, with a gradual decline in
circulation discernible for many titles. Most
national newspaper groups have set up
Internet w ebsites in recent years, initially
experimenting w ith the newr medium and
offering editorial, directory and advertising
ser\ices, and later developing networks of
additional special interest sites to cater for a
growing alternative readership.
Regional Newspapers
Most towns and cities throughout the UK
have their own regional or local new spaper.
These range from morning and evening dailies
to Sunday papers and others w hich are
published just once a week. They mainly
include stories of regional or local attraction,
but the dailies also cover national and
international news, often looked at from a local
view point. In addition, they provide a valuable
medium for local advertising. Circulation
figures for the period July-December 2000
indicate that the regional press sells 42 million
paid-for new spapers and distributes 30 million

issues of free titles each week, reflecting an
expanding market. About 90% of local and
regional titles are now available online.
London has one paid-for evening paper,
the Evening Standard. Its publisher
(Associated Newspapers) also produces a free
daily newspaper, London Metro, launched in
1999. There are also local weekly papers for
every district in Greater London; these are
often different local editions of one centrally
published paper.
Of the Scottish papers, the Daily Record
has the highest circulation. The press in Wales
includes Welsh-language and bilingual papers
(Welsh community newspapers receive an
annual grant as part of the Government’s
wider financial support for the Welsh
language). Newspapers from the Irish
Republic, as well as the British national press,
are widely read in Northern Ireland.
Around 640 free distribution newspapers,
mostly weekly and financed by advertising, are
published in the UK. Top free weekly titles
include the Manchester Metro News and The
Glaswegian.

Ethnic Minority Publications
Many newspapers and magazines in the UK
are produced by ethnic minority communities.
Most are published weekly, fortnightly or
monthly. A Chinese newspaper, Sing Tao, the
Urdu Daily Jang and the Arabic Al-Arab,
however, are dailies. Afro-Caribbean
newspapers include The Gleaner, The Voice
and Caribbean Times, which are all weeklies.
The Asian Times is an English language
weekly for people of Asian descent.
Publications also appear in other languages,
particularly Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi and
Punjabi. The fortnightly Asian Trader is a
successful business publication, while
Cineblitz International targets those interested
in the Asian film industry.
THE PERIODICAL PRESS
There are around 9,000 separate periodical
publications that carry advertising. They are
generally defined as either ‘consumer’ titles,
offering readers leisure-time information and
entertainment, or ‘business and professional’
titles, which provide people with material of
relevance to their working lives. Within the
former category, there are general consumer
titles, which have a wide appeal, and consumer
specialist titles, aimed specifically at groups of
people with particular interests, such as
motoring, sport or music. A range of literary
and political journals, appearing monthly or
quarterly, caters for a more academic
readership. I here are also many in-house and
customer magazines produced by businesses
or public services for their employees and/or
clients.
The two top-selling weekly consumer titles,
What’s on TV (published by IPC Magazines)
and Radio Times (BBC-owned), carry full
details of the forthcoming week’s television
and radio programmes and have sales of
around 1.7 million and 1.3 million
respectively. Reader’s Digest, which covers a
broad range of topics, has the highest sales
(over 1 million) among monthly magazines.
Women’s magazines traditionally enjoy
large circulations, while several men’s general
interest titles similarly reached high levels of
circulation (see Table 17.4) during the 1990s.
Children have an array of comics and
papers, while magazines like Sugar, Smash
Hits and It’s Bliss, with their coverage of pop
music and features of interest to young people,
are very popular with teenagers.
Leading journals of opinion include the
Economist, an independent commentator on
national and international affairs, finance and
business, and science and technology; New
Statesman, which reviews social issues,
politics, literature and the arts from a

which covers similar subjects from a
conservative point of view. A rather more
irreverent approach to public affairs is taken
by Private Eye, a satirical fortnightly. New

Weekly listings magazines such as Time Out
provide details of cultural and other events in
London and other large cities.
NS, PPA and the Publishers Association, was
formed in January 2001.
The Society of Editors is the officially
recognised professional body for newspaper
editors and their equivalents in radio and
television. It exists to defend press freedom
and to promote high editorial standards.
There is also a British Society of Magazine
Editors. Organisations representing journalists
are the National Union of Journalists,
Chartered Institute of Journalists and British
Association of Journalists. The main printing
union is the Graphical, Paper and Media
Union. The Foreign Press Association helps
the correspondents of overseas newspapers in
their professional work.
The Press Association is the national news
agency of the UK and Irish Republic,
delivering comprehensive news and sports
coverage, photographs, weather reports and
listings to the national and regional print,
broadcast and electronic media. A number of
other British and foreign agencies and news
services have offices in London, and there are
smaller agencies based in other British cities.
Most regional agencies are members of the
National Association of Press Agencies.
PRESS CONDUCT AND LAW
PRESS INSTITUTIONS
Trade associations include the Newspaper
Publishers Association (NPA), whose
members publish national newspapers, and
the Newspaper Society (NS), which
represents British regional and local
newspapers (and is believed to be the oldest
publishers’ association in the world). The
Scottish Daily Newspaper Society represents
the interests of daily and Sunday newspapers
in Scotland; the Scottish Newspaper
Publishers Association acts on behalf of the
owners of weekly newspapers in Scotland; and
Associated Northern Ireland Newspapers is
made up of proprietors of weekly newspapers
in Northern Ireland. The membership of the
Periodical Publishers Association (PPA)
includes most publishers of business,
professional and consumer magazines. UK
Publishing Media, an alliance of the NPA,
Press Complaints Commission
In a free society, there is a delicate and
sometimes difficult balance in the relationship
between the responsibilities of the press and
the rights of the public. A policy of press
self-regulation, rather than statutory control
or a law of privacy, operates in the UK. The
Press Complaints Commission, a non-
statutory body whose 16 members are drawn
from both the public and the industry, deals
with complaints about the content and
conduct of newspapers and magazines, and
operates a Code of Practice agreed by editors
covering inaccuracy, invasion of privacy,
harassment and misrepresentation by the
press. The Commission’s jurisdiction also
extends to online versions of newspaper and
magazine titles by publishers who already
subscribe to the Code. In 2000 it received
2,225 complaints, 44% of which related to
national newspapers, 34% to regional papers,
282
17: MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS
10% to newspapers specific to Scotland, 7%
to magazines and 5% to other publications.
Most complaints breaching the Code are
resolved by editors following the intervention
of the Commission. It had to adjudicate on
just 57 complaints—upholding 24 and
rejecting 33.
The Press and the Law
There is no state control or censorship of the
newspaper and periodical press, and
newspaper proprietors, editors and journalists
are subject to the law in the same way as any
other citizen. However, certain statutes
include sections which apply to the press.
There are laws governing the extent of
newspaper ownership in television and radio
companies (see p. 284), the transfer of
newspaper assets, and the right of press
representatives to be supplied with agendas
and reports of meetings of local authorities.
There is a legal requirement to reproduce
the printer’s imprint (the printer’s name and
address) on all publications, including
newspapers. Publishers are legally obliged to
deposit copies of newspapers and other
publications at the British Librarv (see
p. 263).
Publication of advertisements is governed
by wide-ranging legislation, including public
health, copyright, financial services and fraud
legislation. Legal restrictions are imposed on
certain types of prize competition.
Laws on contempt of court, official secrets
and defamation are also relevant to the press.
A newspaper may not publish comments on
the conduct of judicial proceedings which are
likely to prejudice the reputation of the courts
for fairness before or during the actual
proceedings; nor may it publish before or
during a trial anything which might influence
the result. The unauthorised acquisition and
publication of official information in such
areas as defence and international relations,
where such unauthorised disclosure would be
harmful, are offences under the Official
Secrets Acts. These are restrictions on
publication generally, not just through the
printed press.
Most legal proceedings against the press are
libel actions brought by private individuals.
Advertising Practice
Advertising in all non-broadcast media, such
as newspapers, magazines, posters, sales
promotions, cinema, direct mail, and
electronic media (such as CD-ROM and the
Internet) is regulated by the Advertising
Standards Authority (ASA). The ASA is an
independent body whose role is to ensure that
advertisers conform to the British Codes of
Advertising and Sales Promotion. These
require that advertisements and promotions
are legal, decent, honest and truthful; are
prepared with a sense of responsibility to the
consumer and society; and respect the
principles of fair competition generally
accepted in business.
The ASA monitors compliance with the
Codes and investigates complaints received.
Pre-publication advice is available to
publishers, agencies and advertisers from the
Committee of Advertising Practice. If an
advertisement is found to be misleading or
offensive, the ASA can ask the advertiser to
change or remove it. Failure to do so can result
in damaging adverse publicity in the ASA’s
monthly report of its judgments, the refusal of
advertising space by publishers, and the loss of
trading privileges. Advertisers found guilty of
placing irresponsible or offensive posters can
face a two-year period of mandatory pre¬
vetting. The ASA can also refer misleading
advertisements to the Director General of Fair
Trading (see p. 394), who has the power to seek
an injunction to prevent their publication.
Media Ownership
Legislation in 1990 laid down rules enabling
the ITC and Radio Authority to keep
ownership of the broadcasting media widely
spread and to prevent undue concentrations of
single and cross-media ownership, in the
broader public interest. The Broadcasting Act
1996 relaxed those rules, both within and across
different media sectors, to reflect the needs and
aspirations of the industry against the
background of accelerating technological change:
> allowing for greater cross-ownership
between newspaper groups, television
companies and radio stations, at both
national and regional levels; and
283
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
> introducing ‘public interest’ criteria by
which the regulatory authorities can
assess and approve (or disallow) mergers
or acquisitions between newspapers and
television and radio companies.
The 1996 Act overturned the rule that no
one company could own more than two of the
ITV (Channel 3) licences; instead, a new limit
was set whereby no company could control
franchises covering more than 15% of the total
television audience. Local newspapers with
more than a 50% share of their market may
own a local radio station, providing at least
one other independent local radio station is
operating in that area. An additional
regulation is the Office of Fair Trading’s limit
of 25% on any company’s share of television
advertising revenue. Newspaper transfers and
mergers are subject to the consent of the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry,
usually after reference to the Competition
Commission (where the total paid-for daily
circulation of newspapers owned by the
proprietors involved is 500,000 or more).
Government plans to revise or reconsider
ownership regulations were proposed in
December 2000 in the White Paper, A New
Future for Communications (see p. 276).
Communications
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Turnover of the UK telecommunications
services sector grew by 9% in 2000 to £38.4
billion. Growth has been particularly strong in
new services, notably mobile telephones and
services provided over the Internet. In the UK
over 300 licences have been issued to service
providers and more than 100 to
telecommunications operators to build and
run their own networks. According to a report
on telecommunications regulation issued by
the European Commission in December 2000,
the UK has one of the most competitive
telecommunications markets in Europe.
Telephone Services
Telephone traffic is growing quickly. Calls
from fixed links were 21% higher in 2000, at
241.9 billion call minutes, than in 1999 (see
Table 17.5). There are 35 million fixed lines.
A telephone is one of the most popular
consumer durable goods in the home.
According to the 1998 ONS General
Household Survey, an estimated 96% of
households had a telephone. A survey for
OFTEL, conducted in May 2001, found that a
significant and growing number of people
preferred to use a mobile telephone rather
than a fixed-line telephone as they favoured
the former’s flexibility and the ability to be
contactable at all times. Around 6% of homes
now have a mobile telephone instead of a fixed
line. By the beginning of March 2001 there
were some 43.5 million mobile telephone
users, 60% more than a year earlier.
BT, which became a private sector
company in 1984, remains the biggest fixed-
line UK operator, although competitors have
increased their share of the market, especially
the business market. BT runs one of the
world’s largest public telecommunications
networks, including about 20 million
residential lines and 8.8 million business lines.
Turnover in 2000-01 totalled £20.4 billion.
In May 2001 BT announced a major
restructuring, including a proposed demerger
(creating a separate company) for its BT
Wireless operations (including the mobile
telephone operator BT Cellnet—see p. 285),
which would become one of the UK’s biggest
companies on its establishment, scheduled for
later in 2001. BT currently operates five main
businesses: BT Retail and BT Wholesale,
concentrating on customers and the network
in the UK; and BTopenworld, BT Ignite and
BT Wireless, which operate internationally,
although concentrating on Western Europe.
The two main cable operators are NTL and
Telewest. By the end of March 2001 cable
operators had installed around 5.2 million
telephone lines in the UK.
In November 2000 the Government held
an auction for licences to run broadband fixed
wireless services, which would allow

and multimedia services over the airwaves
in the 28 gigahertz band. Six companies
were awarded licences. Some licences were
left unsold, and in February 2001 the
Government announced proposals for

allocating these licences. In addition, licences
will be offered in three other bands later
in 2001.
Mobile Communications
The number of mobile telephone subscribers,
and the volume of calls, are continuing to rise
rapidly. There has been particularly strong
growth in the volume of text messages handled
by cellular network operators, which increased
by over 240% between 1999-2000 and 2000-01.
About 90% of new subscribers in 2000-01
bought pre-paid packages—pre-paid
subscribers tend to have lower usage than
subscribers on annual contracts with a supplier.
Vodafone, one of the UK’s biggest
companies by market capitalisation (see
p. 384), is the world’s largest mobile telephone
operator in terms of the number of
subscribers. It has over 93 million customers
worldwide through its operations in 29
countries, including 12.5 million in the UK in
May 2001. There are three other network
suppliers in the UK:
^ B7 Cellnet (with 11.4 million subscribers
in May 2001);
> Orange (11.3 million), part of France
Telecom; and
> One 2 One (9.2 million), a subsidiary of
Deutsche Telekom.
In addition, there are around 50
independent service providers.
In 2000 the Government held an auction
for licences to run systems to provide the next
generation of mobile telephone services,
known as ‘third generation’. These will
provide users with high-speed access to the
Internet, e-mail facilities, video conferencing
and access to a large number of information
services. Bids for the five licences available
totalled £22.5 billion. Licences were
won by Vodafone, BT Cellnet, Orange and
One 2 One, with the licence reserved for
a new entrant going to a subsidiary of TIW
of Canada (now Hutchison 3G).
Regulation
OFT EL (the Office of Telecommunications),
a non-ministerial government department
headed by the Director General of
Telecommunications, is the independent
regulatory body for the telecommunications
285
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
industry. Among its current initiatives are
promoting greater broadband and narrowband
Internet access (see below), and market
reviews to ensure the appropriate level of
regulation. It is involved in regulating local
loop unbundling’, a process giving BT’s
competitors access to its telephone exchanges
in order to deliver their own high-speed
services via BT’s local telephone wires/lines;
the first unbundled loops became available in
early 2001. OFTEL has begun public
consultation on the creation of a Telecoms
Ombudsman with powers to resolve disputes
between consumers and telecommunications
companies; the new post is expected to begin
operating in April 2002. OFTEL is one of the
nine regulatory bodies whose functions would
be absorbed within those of the proposed new
Office of Communications (see p. 276).
A new legal framework for liberalising
telecommunications markets in the European
Union (EU) took effect in 1998. The UK
Government is in the process of negotiating a
regulatory framework for electronic
communications networks and services with
its EU partners. The European Commission
has proposed new legislation for the
converging electronic communications sector
that would remove existing barriers to the
single market and promote competition.
INTERNET SERVICES
The Internet plays an increasingly important
role in the provision and distribution of
information and entertainment. Broadly, it is a
loose collection of computer networks around
the world—it links thousands of academic,
government and public computer systems,
giving hundreds of millions of people access to
a wealth of stored information and other
resources. The World Wide Web (WWW or
the web) has given the Internet its user appeal
and accessibility-—it consists of many
thousands of‘sites’ on the Internet. No one
owns the Internet and there is no centralised
controlling or regulating body.
The use of the Internet in the UK is
growing rapidly (see Figure 17.6). According
to the ONS Family Expenditure Survey, in
the first quarter of 2001 an average of 9.2
million households (37% of households) in the
Figure 17.6:
Households with Home Access1
to the Internet, UK
Per cent
Since April-June 2000 the data cover the percentage of
households with home access using all forms of access, while
prior to April-June 2000 the data cover the percentage of
households with access from home computers.
Source: Office for National Statistics
UK could access the Internet from home,
almost three times the number in the same
period in 1999. Nearly all access the Internet
through a home computer, although a small
proportion access the Internet in another way,
such as through digital television or a mobile
telephone. Many people use the Internet at
work, in education establishments and in
libraries; over 99% of secondary schools and
96% of primary schools in England are
connected to the Internet, according to the
Department for Education and Skills. For
information on e-commerce (electronic
commerce) see the essay on p. 536.
Research conducted by OFTEL in May
2001 found that over one-third of homes used
some form of unmetered access to the Internet,
while in November 2000, 25% of households
with Internet access were considering installing
high-speed ADSL (asymmetric digital
subscriber line) broadband access, which is now
becoming available.
According to the National Statistics
Omnibus Survey, conducted in July 2001,
51% of adults in Great Britain have accessed
the Internet, equivalent to 23 million adults.
Activities undertaken included:

There are over 400 Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). Freeserve is the biggest ISP
and has some 2 million registered users; it was
acquired by Wanadoo of France in 2001.
POSTAL SERVICES
The Post Office, founded in 1635, pioneered
postal services and was the first to issue
adhesive postage stamps as proof of advance
payment for mail. In March 2001 it
experienced one of the most significant changes
in its history. Under the Postal Services Act
2000, which implemented the Government’s
programme of postal services reforms, the Post
Office ceased to be a statutory authority and its
business was transferred to a successor
company, Consignia Holdings pic, whollv
owned by the Government. Consignia serves its
UK customers through three main operations:
Royal Mail, Parcelforce W orldwide and the
Post Office retail network.
Regulation
The Government’s reforms are intended to
modernise the Post Office and give it greater
commercial freedom so that it can compete
more effectively in the changing global
communications market. The Act requires any
postal operator conveying letters costing less
than £1 per item and weighing less than 350
grams to be licensed. Licensing is the
responsibility of a new independent regulator,
the Postal Services Commission (known as
‘Postcomm’). By mid-2001 it had licensed
Consignia and was considering licence
applications from other potential operators.
The Act also enables the UK to meet objectives
under the EC Postal Services Directive, of
which the most important concerns the
provision of a universal service. Consignia is
required to provide a universal postal service
throughout the UK, involving the daily
delivery and collection of mail at a uniform,
affordable price. Its Royal Mail service cannot
raise prices for most of its products without the
prior approval of Postcomm. The Act also
established a consumer protection body, the
Consumer Council for Postal Services (known
as ‘Postwatch’), which is monitoring service
standards and acting as a focus for consumer
issues and complaints.
Consignia’s Operations
Consignia's Royal Mail service delivers to 27
million addresses in the UK, handling around
80 million items each working day. In 2000-01
it processed more than 19.1 billion inland
letters and 792 million outgoing international
letters. Mail is collected from about 113,000
posting boxes, and from post offices and large
postal users. Its International Services uses
1,400 flights a week to send mail direct to 280
postal ‘gateways’ worldwide. Consignia
employs some 200,000 people.
High-speed mail-handling machinery—the
Integrated Mail Processor—has cut the
sorting time for processing letters. Automatic
sorting utilises the information contained in
the postcode; the UK postcode system allows
mechanised sorting down to part of a street on
a delivery round and, in some cases, to an
individual address.
Parcelforce W orldwide provides a door-to-
door overnight delivery service throughout the
LK and an international service to 239
countries and territories. It handles 150
million packages a year. Parcelforce
W orldwide is modernising its facilities for
handling parcels. Two new sorting centres in
Coventry—one for international parcels and
the other for domestic traffic—have been
opened, forming one of the largest and most
modern distribution centres in Europe,
handling some 50,000 items an hour.
Consignia owns nearly 20 international
companies, based on the continent of Europe
and in North America. It is also involved in a
287
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
cross-border business mail joint venture with
TNT Post Group of the Netherlands and
Singapore Post.
Post Offices
The nationwide network of Post Office
branches handles a wide range of transactions,
with a total value of £ 140 billion in 2000-01.
It acts as an agent for Royal Mail and
Parcelforce Worldwide, government
departments, local authorities, and Alliance &
Leicester Giro and other banks’ banking
services. There are some 18,000 Post Office
branches in the UK, and nearly all branches
have recently been automated under a £1
billion programme, ‘Horizon’, which was
completed by summer 2001. As part of the
‘Modernising Government’ programme (see
p. 63), the concept of Post Offices as
‘government general practitioners’, helping
their customers to access public information
electronically and ‘face to face’, is being
investigated; a pilot scheme in Leicestershire
and Rutland will run for six months from
September 2001. In May 2001 the
Government reached agreement with the main
UK banks on the introduction of new
Universal Banking services (see p. 514), which
would be available through Post Offices and
aimed particularly at people who do not
currently have a bank account.
Private Courier and Express Services
Private sector couriers and express operators
can operate, subject to charging a minimum
fee, currently £1. Postcomm is considering
the scope for changing that part of the postal
market requiring a licence.

Sport is one of the UK’s most popular leisure activities, with two-thirds of all
adults taking part in one or more sporting activities. According to UK Sport (see
p. 293), the UK can claim to be among the top five most successful nations in
world sport. UK sportsmen and sportswomen hold over 50 world titles in a
variety of sports, such as professional boxing, modern pentathlon, rowing,
snooker, squash and motorcycle sports. In the 2000 Olympics in Sydney the Great
Britain team won 28 medals (including 11 gold medals) and in the subsequent
Paralympics the team was second in the medals table, winning 131 medals.
In 1996-97 (the latest period for which
information is available), 71% of men and
57% of women took part in at least one
sporting activity in the four-week period
before they were interviewed for the General
Household Survey in Great Britain and the
Continuous Household Survey in Northern
Ireland. Walking (including rambling and
hiking) was by far the most popular form of
active recreation in the UK (see Table 18.1).
Many important sporting events are held
each year in the UK, including the
Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships, the
FA Cup Final, the Open Golf Championship
and the Grand National steeplechase. In 1999
the UK hosted both the cricket and rugby
union world cups, while in 2000 most of the
matches in the Rugby League World Cup
were staged in the UK, and the World Track
Cycling Championships were held in

SPORTS POLICY
A ‘Sports Cabinet’, headed by the Secretary of
State for Culture, Media and Sport and
including the ministers responsible for sport
in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, is involved in identifying strategic
priorities for sport, which is a devolved
function.2 In April 2000 the Government
published A Sporting Future for All, its
strategy designed to increase participation in
sport in England and encourage greater
success for the top sportsmen and
sportswomen. It also seeks to ensure that
sporting opportunities are widely available to
the entire community, irrespective of age,
gender, social background, location or ability.
In March 2001 the Government published
its Plan for Sport, containing a series of
measures to support sport at every level: in
schools, in the community and in elite
competition.
Community Participation
The Government’s strategy also includes
measures to raise participation more widely in
the community, with investment of between
£1.5 billion and £2 billion from the Lottery
envisaged in community sports facilities in
England in the next ten years. Local
authorities are being encouraged to conduct
audits of sports facilities in England to
determine where the need for new or
improved facilities is greatest, and wdth a view
to the establishment of a comprehensive
national database of sports facilities, which
will form the basis of strategic planning for
sports development.
The Government’s view is that sport is an
important component of regeneration, and can
have a beneficial effect in helping the
development of run-down areas. Sport
England has established 12 Sport Action
2 Most of the strategies and funding programmes in this section
relate to England. The devolved administrations have separate,
but similar, strategies, policies and funding programmes.
For young people the Government’s plan
includes measures to ensure that all
children have more opportunities to take
part in physical education (PE) and sport
in schools, including:
> the allocation of over £750 million
for improving sports facilities in
schools from the next round of
funding from the National Lottery’s
New Opportunities Fund, with
priority for schools in areas of urban
and rural deprivation;
> investment of £130 million under a
new fund, Space for Sport and Arts,
in primary schools in the 65 most
deprived areas of England;
> the creation by 2004 of 200
Specialist Sports Colleges, of which
101 had been designated by
September 2001—they are
providing high-quality facilities and
training to support the most talented
and promising pupils;
> a commitment to offer a new
entitlement for children of two
hours a week of good-quality school
sport and PE; and
> investment of £120 million to
provide school sports coordinators.
Zones in areas of high economic and social
deprivation where basic sports provision falls
below an acceptable standard. Eventually up
to 30 zones will be established. Sport England
will target these areas for improving sporting
provision.
Sport England, the Youth Justice Board for
England and Wales and the UK Anti-Drugs
Co-ordination Unit have established ‘Positive
Futures’, an initiative set up in 24 locations in
England to reduce anti-social behaviour, crime
and drug use among young people aged 10 to
16 within local neighbourhoods. The
programme is to be expanded during 2001.
In Scotland about £87 million will be
available through the New Opportunities
Fund over the four-year period to 2004 to
stimulate schemes that will encourage the
improvement of school facilities and their
291
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
wider use in the community, and for schemes
in which sport can be part of a wider strategy
in action being taken against youth crime.
Sporting Excellence
As well as the Specialist Sports Colleges, two
main schemes are designed to promote
sporting excellence:
> The World Class Performance Programme
provides support to the UK’s most
talented athletes to enable them to
improve their performance and win
medals in major international
competitions.
> The World Class Events Programme aims
to ensure that major international events
can be attracted to, and staged
successfully in, the UK. About ^1.6
million a year is available to support
funding of up to 35% of the cost of
bidding for and staging events.
Following the UK successes in the
Olympics and the Paralympics (see pp. 294-5),
the Sports Cabinet has agreed to maintain
funding for the UK’s world-class performers.
Sport on Television and Radio
Major sporting events (such as the Olympic
Games) receive extensive television and radio
coverage in the UK and are watched or
listened to by millions of people. Football
matches attract very high ratings, especially
when the UK’s national teams are involved in
the final stages of international tournaments.
A number of other sports, including rugby,
horse racing, cricket and athletics, also achieve
high ratings figures. Several of the UK’s
leading sports events, such as the Grand
National and FA Premier League football
matches (see pp. 305 and 304 respectively), are
now watched on television by viewers in many
other countries.
There are a number of satellite and cable
channels concentrating on sport, and they
have won the rights for live coverage of several
major events and competitions. In the
Government’s view, however, there are some
leading sporting occasions to which everyone
should have access. These events are included
on a protected list (‘Group A’) and cannot be
shown on subscription channels unless they
have first been offered to the UK’s universally
available free-to-air broadcasters (the BBC,
the ITV network and Channel 4). Live
coverage of events on the ‘Group B’ list may
be shown by satellite and cable channels on
the condition that an acceptable level of
secondary coverage—a combination of
delayed coverage and edited highlights—is
made available to the universally available
free-to-air channels. The current list is:

Ryder Cup
Open Golf Championship
Crowd Safety and Control
The Football Licensing Authority (FLA) has
a wide-ranging role in advising football and
other sports on outdoor ground safety. In
England and Wales, licences issued by the
Authority require all clubs in the Premier
League and those in the First Division of the
292
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
Football League to have all-seater grounds.
Clubs in the second and third divisions of the
Football League have to ensure that any
terracing with standing complies with the
highest safety standards, as outlined in
guidance from the FLA.
The Government works closely with the
police, football authorities and the
governments of other European countries to
implement crowd control measures. The
Football (Disorder) Act 2000 has introduced
new measures to deal with English football
hooliganism overseas. Domestic and
international banning orders, which ban
individuals from attending football matches,
have been merged and can be imposed for
between two and ten years. Courts have
greater powers for imposing banning orders.
For example, they can now impose a banning
order on people who have not been convicted
of a football-related offence if they believe that
such an order would help prevent violence or
disorder at football matches. The police can
also request the courts to impose bans on
particular individuals. Anyone subject to a
domestic or international ban has to surrender
his or her passport when major international
‘away’ games involving England are imminent.
ORGANISATION AND
ADMINISTRATION
Sports Councils
Government responsibilities and funding for
sport and recreation are largely channelled
through five Sports Councils:
> the United Kingdom Sports Council,
operating as UK Sport;
> the English Sports Council, operating as
Sport England;
> the Sports Council for Wales;
^ the Scottish Sports Council, operating as
sportscotland; and
^ the Sports Council for Northern Ireland.
UK Sport takes the lead on those aspects of
sport and physical recreation that require
strategic planning, administration,
coordination or representation for the UK as a
whole. Its main functions include:
> coordinating support to sports in which
the UK competes internationally (as
opposed to the four home countries
separately);
> tackling drug misuse in sport;
> coordinating policy for bringing major
international sports events to the UK;
and
> representing British sporting interests
overseas at international level.
All the Sports Councils distribute
Exchequer and Lottery funds. UK Sport
focuses on elite sportsmen and sportswomen,
while the home country Sports Councils are
more concerned with the development of
sport at the community level by promoting
participation, giving support and guidance to
facility providers, and supporting the
development of talented sportsmen and
women, including people with disabilities.
They also manage the National Sports Centres
(see pp. 295-7).
Sports Governing Bodies
Individual sports are run by over 400
independent governing bodies. Some have a
UK or Great Britain structure, while others
are constituted on an individual home country
basis. Their functions include drawing up
rules, holding events, regulating membership,
selecting and training national teams, and
producing plans for their sports. There are
also organisations representing people who
take part in more informal physical recreation,
such as walking. Most sports clubs in the UK
belong to, or are affiliated to, an appropriate
governing body.
Governing bodies that receive funding
from the Sports Councils are required to
produce development plans, from the grass
roots to the highest competitive levels. In
order to have access to Lottery funds for their
top athletes, they need to prepare ‘world-class
performance’ plans with specific performance
targets. The Government is encouraging
governing bodies to develop strategic plans for
widening participation and developing
293
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
sporting talent and to include high-quality
youth sport programmes and coaching
education systems, a talent development
framework and targets for the development
of their sport. A number of governing bodies
that adopt such strategic plans will be given
greater control of the distribution of funding
from the Sports Councils and the National
Lottery. Under the new arrangements, all major
sports bodies receiving significant revenues
from broadcasting will be required to set aside
at least 5% of these revenues for investment in
grass-roots facilities in their sports.
There are 12 international federations that
have their headquarters in the UK: the
Commonwealth Games Federation and
federations for badminton, billiards and
snooker, bowls, cricket, curling, golf, netball,
sailing, squash, tennis and wheelchair sports.
Other Sports Organisations
The main sports associations in the UK
include:
> The Central Council of Physical
Recreation (CCPR), the largest sport and
recreation federation in the world,
comprises 202 UK bodies and 66 English
associations, most of which are governing
bodies of sport. The British Sports Trust
is the charity arm of the CCPR that runs
a volunteer sports leadership programme,
in which some 50,000 people participated
in 2000. The Scottish Sports Association,
the Welsh Sports Association and the
Northern Ireland Sports Forum are
equivalent associations to the CCPR.
Their primary aim is to represent the
interests of their members to the
appropriate national and local authorities,
including the Sports Councils, from
which they may receive some funding.
> The British Olympic Association (BOA),
comprising representatives of the 35
national governing bodies of Olympic
sports, which organises the participation
of British teams in the Olympic Games,
sets standards for selection and raises
funds. Its team of over 300 competitors
in the 2000 Olympics won more medals
than in recent Olympics (see Table 18.2),
gaining 11 gold, 10 silver and 7 bronze
medals. The number of gold medals was
the best performance by the team since
the Olympics of 1920. The BOA is
supported by sponsorship and by
donations from the private sector and the
general public, and works closely with
UK Sport. It makes important
contributions to the preparation of
competitors in the period between
Games, such as arranging training camps,
and for the Sydney Olympics had a camp
on the Gold Coast in Queensland for all
team members. The BOA also has
programmes to support national
governing bodies and their athletes in
areas such as acclimatisation, psychology
and physiology. Its British Olympic
Medical Centre at Northwick Park
Hospital in Harrow provides medical
services for competitors before and
during the Olympics. The BOA’s
educational arm aims to educate
youngsters on the Olympic Games and
the Olympic movement.
> The Women’s Sports Foundation, which
promotes the interests of women and
girls in sport and active recreation. It
encourages the establishment of women’s
sports groups throughout the UK and
organises events and activities. It runs
both the Sportswomen of the Year
Awards and an annual nationwide awards
scheme for girls and young women
between the ages of 11 and 19.
Sport for Disabled People
Sport for people with disabilities is organised
by a wide range of agencies in the UK. Single¬
disability, multi-sport organisations
coordinate disability-specific recreation and
development opportunities and events. These
agencies are the British Amputee and Les
Autres Sports Association, British Blind
Sport, British Wheelchair Sports Foundation,
Cerebral Palsy Sport and the United Kingdom
Sports Association for People with Learning
Disability. The British Deaf Sports Council
organises sporting opportunities for hearing-
impaired people and coordinates British
interests at the World Deaf Games.

18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
At the Paralympics in Sydney in October
2000 the Great Britain team was second to
Australia in the medals table, winning a
total of 131 medals: 41 gold, 43 silver and
47 bronze. Gold medals were won in
archery, athletics, boccia,’ equestrian
sports, powerlifting, shooting and
swimming, while silver or bronze medals
were also won in cycling, judo and table
tennis.
Winners of more than one gold medal
were:
^ in athletics, Tanni Grey-Thompson
(who won four gold medals, in the 100
metre, 200 metre, 400 metre and 800
metre T53 wheelchair events),
Caroline Innes and Lloyd Upsdell;
> in swimming, James Crisp, Jody
Cundy, Sascha Kindred, Giles Long
and David Roberts; and
> in equestrian dressage, where three of
the winners of the team dressage also
won individual gold medals—Kay
Gebbie, Lee Pearson and Nicola
Tustain.
Multi-disability, multi-sport organisations
are responsible for the coordination and
development of sport on a pan-disability basis
within each home country and, where
possible, endorse integration into mainstream
sport activities. These agencies are the English
Federation of Disability Sport, Disabilitv
Sport Cymru, Scottish Disability Sport and
Disability Sport Northern Ireland.
The remit of the British Paralympic
Association (BPA) is to ratify selection, and
fund and manage the Great Britain
Paralympic Team in the winter and summer
Paralympic Games. The BPA is the British
member of the International Paralympic
Committee.
UK Sport is reviewing disability sport,
with a key objective being the organisational
inclusion/integration of able-bodied and
disabled sport across a range of sports,
particularly at the high-performance level.
3 One of two disability-specific sports in the Paralympics, boccia
is played by those with cerebral palsy and is similar to bowls.
Nine sports already have a degree of
integration: athletics, swimming, cycling,
sailing, judo, equestrianism, powerlifting/
weightlifting, wheelchair tennis/tennis and
archery. The Commonwealth Games in
iVlanchester in 2002 will be the first to include
an integrated programme of events for people
with disabilities. All distributing bodies of
Lottery funding are required to ensure that
applicants incorporate access and availability
for people with disabilities.
SPORTS FACILITIES
The UK has a range of world-class sporting
facilities including 13 National Sports
Centres, operated by the home country Sports
Councils. A number of major facilities have
been improved in recent years, including
many football grounds and the Wimbledon
tennis complex. The Millennium Stadium in
Cardiff was completed in 1999, with a capacitv
of 72,500; it hosted the final of the Rugby
World Cup in 1999, and in May 2001 for the
first time staged the FA Cup Final. In
Manchester modern facilities are being
provided for the Commonwealth Games in
2002, including a new 50,000-seat sports
stadium costing £90 million, and an Olympic¬
sized swimming complex costing £32 million.
The Games are expected to attract over 5,000
athletes from the Commonwealth nations.
United Kingdom Sports Institute
The United Kingdom Sports Institute
(UKSI) is being set up under the strategic
direction of LK Sport and in partnership with
the home country Sports Councils, and will be
fully operational by summer 2002. It will
provide facilities and integrated support
services to potential and elite athletes and
teams. Its Athlete Career and Education
(ACE L K) programme is designed to enhance
athletes’ personal development and sporting
performance, and more than 700 athletes have
already undergone an initial assessment and
over 230 have attended personal development
courses. All sports have access to the UKSFs
services, although it concentrates on Olympic
sports and those minority sports that lack a
commercial element. The UKSI central
295
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
services team is part of UK Sport and based in
London. It coordinates a network of regional
centres in England and national institutes in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
UKSFs funds come mainly from the National
Lottery, although the costs of the central
services team are being provided from
government funds.
UKSI Regional and National Network
England
In England the UKSI network is managed by
the English Institute of Sport (part of Sport
England). It is based around a number of key
centres, of which four are based around
National Sports Centres: Crystal Palace
(London), Bisham Abbey (Berkshire),
Lilleshall (Shropshire) and the National Water
Sports Centre at Holme Pierrepont in
Nottinghamshire. The other network centres
are based around the Don Valley Stadium in
Sheffield, Gateshead International Stadium,
Manchester Sports City, the University of
Bath and Norwich Sports Park.
Investment in new facilities planned by the
English Institute includes:
> £21 million to fund a regional high-
performance centre at Crystal Palace,
with improved facilities for athletics,
boxing, swimming and tennis;
> £21 million at Loughborough
University, including facilities for
athletics, badminton, gymnastics, hockey,
netball and swimming;
> £20 million in sports science, sports
medicine and conditioning facilities (such
as gym facilities, including loose weights
and fitness machines);
> £10 million in water sports facilities for
sailing, canoeing and rowing;
> £6 million in water-based hockey
pitches; and
> £3 million in judo facilities.
Wales
The centre of the UKSI network in Wales is
the Welsh Institute of Sport in Cardiff, which
is the premier venue in Wales for top-level
training and for competition in many sports.
The Institute, which is run by the Sports
Council for Wales, has close links with other
specialist facilities, including the National
Watersports Centre at Plas Menai in north
Wales, a centre of excellence for sailing and
canoeing; the national indoor athletics centre
at the University of Wales Institute, Cardiff;
and the cricketing school of excellence at
Sophia Gardens, Cardiff.
Plas y Brenin National Mountain Centre,
in Snowdonia National Park in north Wales, is
run by Sport England. It offers courses in rock
climbing, mountaineering, canoeing,
orienteering, skiing and most other mountain-
based activities, and is the UK’s leading
training institution for mountain instructors.
Scotland
Sportscotland has set aside funding of £20
million over five years to develop the network
comprising the Scottish Institute of Sport and
six area institutes. The institutes have focused
initially on supporting the development of top
talent in seven sports: athletics, badminton,
curling, football, hockey, rugby and
swimming. Golf and judo were added to these
‘core’ sports in 2001. The network also
includes three National Sports Centres, run
by sportscotland, which provide training and
coaching facilities for a range of sports:
> Glenmore Lodge near Aviemore, which
caters for outdoor sports, including
canoeing, mountaineering, mountain
biking, orienteering and skiing;
> Inverclyde in Largs, which caters for 23
sports and has many indoor and outdoor
facilities, including a gymnastics hall, golf
training, and sports medicine and sports
science facilities of an international
standard; and
> the Scottish National Water Sports
Centre—Cumbrae—on the island of
Great Cumbrae in the Firth of Clyde.
Northern Ireland
The Sports Council for Northern Ireland has
announced a partnership with the University
296
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
of Ulster for the development of a Northern
Ireland network centre of the UKSI. This will
involve creating high-quality training facilities
and support services, primarily at the
University’s Jordanstown campus, with the
establishment of links with nearby facilities.
The Tollymore Mountain Centre in
County Down, run by the Sports Council for
Northern Ireland, offers courses in
mountaineering, rock climbing, canoeing and
outdoor adventure. Leadership and instructor
courses leading to nationally recognised
qualifications are also available.
The Council’s Youth Sport programme has
pioneered innovative ways of involving young
people in sport.
Local Facilities
Local authorities are the main providers of
basic sport and recreation facilities for the local
community, including indoor sports centres,
parks, lakes, playing fields, playgrounds, tennis
courts, natural and artificial pitches, golf
courses and swimming/leisure pools. The
English sports strategy (see p. 291) provides for
a major investment in the improvement of
school sports facilities which will also be
available for community use. The Lottery
Sports Fund is also providing investment of
£1.56 billion over ten years in community
sports facilities in England.
Over 150,000 voluntary sports clubs are
affiliated to the national governing bodies of
sport in the UK. Some local clubs cater for
indoor recreation, but more common are those
which provide sports grounds, particularlv for
bowls, cricket, football, rugby, hockey, tennis
and golf. In the March 2001 Budget the
Government announced its intention to
consult on the best way for tax relief to help
community amateur sports clubs that make a
positive contribution to their local
communities. Many clubs linked to businesses
and other employers cater for sporting
activities. Commercial facilities include health
and fitness centres (which are increasinglv
popular, as indicated by a growing number of
clubs and rising membership), tenpin bowling
centres, ice and roller-skating rinks, squash
courts, golf courses and driving ranges, riding
stables and marinas.
SUPPORT SERVICES
Coaching
Sports coach UK (formerly the National
Coaching Foundation) works closely with
sports governing bodies, local authorities, and
higher and further education institutions.
Supported by the Sports Councils, it provides
a comprehensive range of services for coaches
in all sports. In 2000, over 50,000 coaches and
schoolteachers participated in its programmes.
The Government wishes to see
improvements in coaching, and in March
2001 announced a review of coaching in
England with the intention of establishing a
tramework for developing more world-class
coaches.
Volunteering
In 1996 there were an estimated 1.5 million
volunteers involved in the running of sport in
the UK, according to a survey commissioned
by Sport England and conducted by Sheffield
University. The Government’s Plan for Sport
recognises the contribution of volunteers and
calls on Sport England and the national
governing bodies of sport to develop a cross¬
sport strategy for volunteering. In addition,
some £1 million is being allocated to the
training and support of up to 60,000
volunteers who will become mentors, coaches,
officials and administrators.
Sports Medicine
The National Sports Medicine Institute of the
United Kingdom (NSMI) was established in
1992 to serve as the national focus for all those
concerned with sport and exercise medicine. It
aims to provide optimum levels of safety and
care in order to enhance the ability of those
engaged in exercise and sport from grass-roots
to international levels throughout the UK.
The NSMI is funded through contracts with
the Sports Councils and it also generates
income from its services, many of which are
developed or delivered through collaboration
with other organisations.
297
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Sports Science
The development of sports science support
services for the national governing bodies of
sport is being promoted by the Sports
Councils, in collaboration with the BOA and
sports coach UK, in an effort to raise the
standards of performance of national squads.
The type of support provided may be
biomechanical (human movement),
physiological or psychological.
DRUG MISUSE
UK Sport aims to prevent doping and achieve a
commitment to drug-free sport and ethical
sporting practices. Its Anti-Doping Directorate
coordinates an independent drugs-testing
programme and conducts an information
programme aimed at changing attitudes to drug
misuse. Samples are analysed at a laboratory
accredited by the International Olympic
Committee, at King’s College, University of
London; UK Sport is responsible for reporting
the results to the appropriate governing body.
The drugs-testing programme involves 50
national governing bodies and 20 international
sporting federations from 44 sports. UK Sport
provides a Drug Information Line to allow
athletes to check whether a licensed medication
is permitted or banned under their governing
body’s regulations, and issues a comprehensive
guide on drugs and sport for competitors and
officials; information is also available on its
website uksport.gov.uk). The UK is
working closely with international colleagues in
the World Anti-Doping Agency.
FUNDING
Sport is a major industry in the UK: a joint
Department of Trade and Industry/Sports
Industries Federation competitiveness
analysis, published in 1999, found that it is
worth almost £5 billion a year.
Sport is one of the main recipients of funds
raised by the National Lottery, and 62 sports
have received Lottery funding. By mid-2001
awards totalling £1.58 billion had been made
to over 15,500 sport projects in the UK from
Lottery funds.
Sponsorship may take the form of financing
specific events or championships, such as
horse races or cricket leagues, or support for
sports organisations or individual performers.
Motor sport and football receive the largest
amounts of private sponsorship. Two recent
examples of major sport sponsorship are in
cricket—Vodafone has recently extended its
sponsorship of the England cricket team until
the end of 2005, and in January 2001 Npower
agreed to sponsor Test matches in England for
the next three years.
Sponsorship is encouraged by a number of
bodies, including the Institute of Sports
Sponsorship (ISS), which comprises some 100
UK companies involved in sponsoring sport.
Sportsmatch
Sportsmatch aims to increase the amount of
business sponsorship going into grass-roots
sport and physical recreation. It offers
matching funding for new sponsorships and
for the extension of existing ones. Priority is
given to projects involving disabled people,
the young and ethnic minorities and to
projects in deprived areas.
In England the ISS runs the scheme on
behalf of Sport England, while in Wales the
scheme is managed by the Sports Council for
Wales and in Scotland by sportscotland. In
England since 1992 Sportsmatch has approved
3,120 awards, totalling £25 million and
covering 70 different sports, while in Scotland
over £6.2 million has been invested, in
partnership with business, through 1,050
awards.
SportsAid
SportsAid raises funds to help encourage and
support young and disabled people with
sporting talent. Financial grants are provided
on an individual basis, with each application
being conducted on the criteria of talent and
need. Those receiving funds must normally be
aged between 12 and 18, but there is no age
limit for disabled people. SportsAid relies on
commercial sponsorship and donations from
the public, and the corporate and public
sectors. The Scottish Sports Aid Foundation,
SportsAid Cymru/Wales and the Ulster

Sports and Recreation Trust have similar
functions.
Foundation for Sport and the Arts
The Foundation for Sport and the Arts, set up
by the football pools promoters in 1991, funds
small-scale projects in sport and the arts. This
initiative followed the 1991 Budget, in which
pools betting duty was reduced by 2.5%,
provided that the money forgone by the
Government was paid into the new
Foundation. Funding will continue until at
least 2002. The Foundation has made awards
to schemes benefiting over 100 sports.
Betting and Gaming
A survey, published in June 2000, found that
72% of adults in Great Britain gamble at least
once a year. The survey was carried out by the
National Centre for Social Research for a
consortium representing the gambling
industry, the Home Office and other
regulatory authorities, and GamCare (the
national centre addressing the social impact of
gambling). It found that the National Lottery
was by far the most popular gambling activity
in the UK. Some 65% of the adult population
The Government has announced that
general betting duty of 6.75% on total
stakes will be replaced in October 2001
with a 15% tax on bookmakers’ gross
profits. Off-course punters will no longer
be liable for tax on their stakes. The
change is designed to help bookmakers
develop their domestic and international
business from an onshore base, while
protecting the future revenue received by
the Government from betting. Several UK
bookmaking firms had set up separate
offshore operations to cater for the
growing global market for telephone and
Internet betting and in order to avoid what
they considered to be onerous UK taxes,
but under the new arrangements almost all
have said they would raJocate their offshore
operations to the United Kingdom.
had bought Lottery tickets in the year leading
up to the survey, and the results indicate that
up to half the adult population take part each
week. According to the survey, other forms of
gambling in which people had participated
over the previous year included scratchcards
(22% of adults), fruit machines (14%), horse
racing (13%), private bets with friends or
workmates (11%), football pools (9%) and
bingo (7%). The survey found that less than
1% of adults would be classed as problem
gamblers.
Gross expenditure on all forms of
gambling, including the National Lottery, is
estimated at approximately £42 billion a year.
In July 2001 the Government published an
independent review of the controls on
gambling, with recommendations designed to
simplify regulation and extend choice for adult
gamblers. The review proposes that all
gambling activities, including betting other
than spread betting, should be regulated by a
single regulator, a new Gambling
Commission. Casinos would be permitted to
provide a wider range of gambling activities,
including betting and bingo. The proposals
are designed to ensure that permitted forms
of gambling remain crime-free and that there
is protection for children and vulnerable
groups. The Government has asked for
comments on the report by 31 October 2001,
and intends to publish early in 2002 its plans
on how the reform of gambling will be taken
forward.
POPULAR SPORTS4
Some of the major sports in the UK, many of
which were invented by the British, are
described below. During 2001 several sports,
such as horse racing and field sports, have
been affected by the outbreak of foot-and-
mouth disease (see p. 460). The Government’s
key priority has been to try to eradicate the
foot-and-mouth virus. As a result, some
sporting fixtures and events were postponed
or cancelled.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Angling
Angling is one of the most popular sports,
with an estimated 3 million anglers in the UK.
In England and Wales the most widely
practised form of angling is for coarse fish
(freshwater fish other than salmon or trout).
The rivers and lochs of Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland are the main areas for
salmon and trout fishing. Separate
organisations represent game, coarse and sea
fishing clubs in England, Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland, and there are separate
competitions in each of the three disciplines.
The UK has several world champion coarse
anglers. Alan Scotthorne is the only person to
have won three consecutive world titles, and
in 1999 Bob Nudd became the first angler to
be world champion for the fourth time.
England won the team gold in the 2000
European freshwater fishing championships
held in Nottingham and the team silver in the
championships in Hungary in 2001. Paul
Starbuck is the current junior world
champion.
Athletics
In the UK athletics incorporates many
activities, including track and field events,
cross-country and road running, race walking,
and fell and hill running. Alass participation
events, notably marathons and half marathons,
are popular. Many runners are sponsored,
raising considerable amounts for charities and
other good causes.
The largest UK marathon is the London
Marathon each April, with over 30,000
runners competing in the 2001 event. The
Great North Run, a half marathon, takes place
between Newcastle upon Tyne and South
Shields each September/October.
The governing body for the sport is UK
Athletics (wivw.ukathletics.org). It has made
successful bids to host major championships,
including the World Half Marathon in Bristol
in 2001; the World Indoor Championships,
which will be held at Birmingham in 2003; and
the European Cross Country Championships,
to be held in Edinburgh in 2003.
At the Sydney Oly mpics in September 2000
Jonathan Edwards and Denise Lewis won gold
medals in the triple jump and the heptathlon
respectively. Four other athletes won medals:
two silver, for Steve Backley in the javelin and
Darren Campbell in the 200 metres, and two
bronze, for Kelly Holmes in the 800 metres and
Katharine Merry in the 400 metres. At the
world championships in Edmonton (Canada) in
August 2001 Jonathan Edwards won the triple
jump and Dean Macey won the bronze medal
in the decathlon. Paula Radcliffe followed her
gold medal in the world half marathon
championships in Veracruz (Mexico) in
November 2000 by winning the 8 km world
cross-country championships and finishing
second in the 4 km event in Ostend (Belgium)
in March 2001. British athletes held world
records in two events in mid-2001: Jonathan
Edwards in the triple jump and Colin Jackson
in the 110 metre hurdles.
Badminton
Badminton takes its name from the Duke of
Beaufort’s country home, Badminton House,
where the sport was first played in the 19th
century. The game is organised by the
Badminton Association of England and the
Scottish, Welsh and Irish (Ulster branch)
Badminton Unions. Around 2 million people
play badminton regularly. The Badminton
Association of England (www.baofe.co.uk) has
a coach education system to develop coaches
for players of all levels and a development
department with a netw ork of part-time
county development officers.
The All England Badminton
Championships, staged at the National Indoor
Arena in Birmingham, is one of the w orld’s
leading tournaments. At the Olympic Games
in 2000, Simon Archer and Joanne Goode won
the bronze medal in the mixed doubles.
Basketball
Over 3 million people participate in basketball
in the UK. The English Basketball
Association is the governing body in England,
w ith similar associations in Wales, Scotland
and Ireland (Ulster EJjanch). All the
associations are represented in the British and
Irish Basketball Federation, which acts as the
300
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
coordinating body for the UK and the Irish
Republic.
The leading clubs play in the British
Basketball League and the National Basketball
League, which cover four divisions for men
and two for women, while there are also
leagues for younger players in the RAF
Junior/Cadet League and the Passerelle
competition. Mini-basketball has been
developed for players under the age of 12.
Wheelchair basketball is played under the
same rules, with a few basic adaptations, and
on the same court as the running game.
The English Basketball Association
(www.basketballengland.org.uk) runs various
development schemes for young people which
aim to increase participation and improve the
quality of basketball. With support from
National Lottery funds, some 10,000 outdoor
basketball goals have been installed in parks
and play areas in England.
Bowls
The two main forms of bowls are lawn flat
green (outdoor and indoor) and crown green.
About 6,000 flat green outdoor lawn bowling
clubs are affiliated to the English, Scottish,
Welsh and Irish Bowling Associations, which,
together with the Women’s Bowling
Associations for the four countries, play to the
laws of the \\ orld Bowls Board. Crown green,
indoor, English bowls federation and short
mat bowls have their own separate
associations. The World Bowls Tour now
organises bowls at the professional level. A
new single world governing body, World
Bowls Ltd, has been set up, with headquarters
in Edinburgh.
L K bowlers have achieved considerable
success in international championships. At the
world outdoor championships in April 2000 in
Johannesburg, gold medals were won by
Scotland (represented by Alex Marshall and
George Sneddon) in the pairs event and by the
four representing Wales: Mark Williams,
Stephen Rees, Robert Weale and Will
Thomas. At the women’s outdoor
championships held in Australia in March
2000, the Scottish pairing of Margaret Letham
and Joyce Lindores won the women’s world
pairs title and England won the overall team
title. At the 2001 world indoor championships,
held in Hopton-on-Sea (Norfolk), Paul Foster
won the singles event, while Les Gillett and
Mark McMahon won the pairs title.
Boxing
Boxing in its modern form is based on the
rules established by the Marquess of
Queensberry in 1865. In the UK boxing is
both amateur and professional, and in both
strict medical regulations are applied.
All amateur boxing in England is controlled
by the Amateur Boxing Association of
England. There are separate associations in
Scotland and Wales, and boxing in Northern
Ireland is controlled by the Irish Amateur
Boxing Association. The associations organise
amateur boxing championships as well as
training courses for referees and coaches.
Headguards must be used in all UK amateur
competitions.
Professional boxing in the UK is controlled
by the British Boxing Board of Control
(www.bbbofc.com). The Board appoints
referees, timekeepers, inspectors, medical
officers and representatives to ensure that
regulations are observed, and that contests
take place under carefully regulated
conditions. Medical controls and safety
measures must be in place at all licensed
tournaments, to minimise the risk to boxers.
The Board nominates challengers for British
championships and represents the interests of
British licensed boxers in the international
championship bodies of which it is a member.
In mid-2001 the UK had two world
champions (as recognised by organisations of
which the British Boxing Board of Control is a
member): Joe Calzaghe, who holds the World
Boxing Organisation (WBO) super-
middleweight title; and Johnny Nelson (WBO
cruiserweight).
Audley Harrison, who won the gold medal
in the super-heavyweight division at the
Sydney Olympics, has recently turned
professional and won his first professional
contest in May 2001. At the world amateur
boxing championships in Belfast in June 2001
UK boxers won two medals: David Have, a
silver in the heavyweight division; and Carl
Froch, a bronze in the middleweight.

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Chess
There are local chess clubs and leagues
throughout the UK, and chess is also played
widely in schools and other educational
establishments. Domestic competitions
include the British Championships, the
National Club Championships and the County
Championships. The Hastings Chess
Congress, which started in 1895, is the world’s
longest running annual international chess
tournament. A number of UK chess players
feature among the world’s best, including
Michael Adams and Nigel Short.
The governing bodies are the British Chess
Federation (mww.bcfndirect.co.uk) (responsible
for chess in England and for coordinating
activity among the home nations), the Scottish
Chess Association and the Welsh and Ulster
Chess Unions.
Cricket
The rules of cricket became the responsibility,
in the 18th century, of the Marylebone
Cricket Club (MCC), based at Lord’s cricket
ground in north London, and it still frames
the laws today. The England and Wales
Cricket Board (ECB) (www.ecb.co.uk)
administers men’s and women’s cricket in
England and Wales. The Scottish Cricket
Union administers cricket in Scotland.
Cricket is played in schools, colleges and
universities, and amateur teams play weekly
games in cities, towns and villages. There is a
network of First Class cricket, minor county
cricket and club games with a variety of
leagues. Recent changes to two of the main
professional cricket competitions have
involved the creation of a two-division
structure for the Cricinfo Championship,
which is played by 18 county teams in four-
day matches, and for the one-day Norwich
Union League. Two other main one-day
competitions are held: the Cheltenham &
Gloucester Trophy and the Benson & Hedges
Cup.
Each summer two visiting teams play Test
cricket against England in a number of five-
day Test Matches; a ten-match one-day
triangular competition, the NatWest Series, is
also contested. In 2001 the visiting teams were
Pakistan and Australia. The other Test¬
playing countries are Bangladesh, India, New
Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, the West
Indies and Zimbabwe. A team representing
England usually tours one or more of these
countries in the UK winter. The International
Cricket Council (ICC) is introducing a
ranking system for Test nations, the ICC Test
Championship, in which the Test-playing
nations will play each other on a regular basis
over a rolling five-year period.
Cycling
Cycling includes road and track racing, time-
trialling, mountain biking (downhill, cross¬
country and dual slalom), cyclo-cross (cross¬
country racing), touring and BMX (bicycle
moto-cross). Mountain bikes are increasingly
popular and make up the majority of the sales
of bicycles.
The British Cycling Federation (BCF)
(www.bcf.uk.com) has 14,000 members and
1,200 affiliated clubs. It is the internationally
recognised governing body for British cycle
sport. The Road Time Trials Council controls
road time trials and has around 1,030 member
clubs. In 2000 some 85,100 rides were
completed in open time trials in England and
Wales. CTC (Cyclists’ Touring Club)
(www.ctc.org.uk), with 71,000 members and
affiliates, is the governing body for
recreational (including off-road) and urban
cycling, and hosts the CTC rally each year in
York. CTC Scotland and the Scottish
Cyclists’ Union represent cyclists in Scotland.
CTC Cymru represents CTC in Wales. Wales
and Northern Ireland have separate
federations affiliated to the BCF.
The British cycling team achieved success
in 2000 at both the Sydney Olympics and the
World Track Championships held at the
Manchester Velodrome. At the Olympic
Games Jason Queally won a gold medal in the
1 km time trial and, together with Craig
MacLean and Chris Hoy, won a silver medal
in the men’s sprint. Bronze medals were won
by Yvonne McGregor in the 3,000 m pursuit
and by the men’s pursuit team. At the World
Track Championships the team won five
medals—Yvonne McGregor won her first
world 3,000 m pursuit title, while there were
302
18. SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
silver medals for the men’s sprint and the
men’s pursuit teams, and bronze medals for
Jason Queally in the 1 km time trial and Rob
Hayles in the men’s individual pursuit.
Equestrianism
Leading equestrian events are held at a
number of locations throughout the year. The
Badminton Horse Trials, sponsored by
Mitsubishi Motors, is normally one of the
UK’s largest sporting events, attracting
around 250,000 spectators. However, in 2001
it did not take place as a result of foot-and-
mouth disease. The major show jumping
events include the Horse of the Year Show at
Wembley in London and the Hickstead Derby
in West Sussex.
The British Equestrian Federation (BEF)
(www.bef.co.uk) acts as the international
secretariat on behalf of its members. They
include the British Showjumping Association,
British Eventing, British Dressage, British
Horse Driving Trials Association, British
Endurance Riding Association and British
Equestrian \ aulting. These associations act as
the governing bodies of the different sporting
disciplines in the UK and oversee the
organisation of the major national and
international events. The British Horse
Society, which includes Riding Clubs, is
responsible for promoting training, road safety,
rights of way and the welfare of horses, while
the Pony Club provides training for children.
At the 2000 Olympic Games, the British
team of Jeanette Brakewell, Pippa Funnell,
Leslie Law and Ian Stark won the silver medal
in the three-day event.
Exercise and Fitness
Exercise and fitness is a term covering a
variety of activities—such as exercise to
music, aqua exercise, weight training and
circuit training—which aim to improve health
and fitness. The Keep Fit Association (KFA)
(www.keepfit.org.uk), which has 900 teachers
and a membership of 8,500, promotes fitness
through movement, exercise and dance for
people of all ages and abilities. Its national
certificated training scheme for KF'A teachers
is recognised by local education authorities
throughout the UK. Autonomous associations
serve Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Field Sports
Field sports in the UK include hunting,
shooting, stalking, ferreting, falconry and hare
coursing. There are over 300 recognised packs
of quarry hounds in the UK, of which more
than 180 are foxhound packs recognised by the
Masters of Fox Hounds Association. Most
hunts organise ’point-to-point’ race meetings
(see p. 305). The Countryside Alliance
promotes, among several other issues, the
interests of field sports.
In June 2000, following the report of the
Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs
in England and Wales, the Government
announced its intention to introduce a Bill
containing a series of legislative options. In a
free vote on the Hunting Bill in January 2001,
Members of Parliament voted by 387 to 174 to
ban hunting and hare coursing with dogs in
England and W ales, although subsequently
the House of Lords supported self-regulation
of hunting by a vote of 249 to 108. However,
the Bill did not complete its passage through
Parliament. Following the General Election,
the Government has indicated that the House
of Commons will be given an early opportunity
to make its views known in the new
parliamentary session and that it will enable
Parliament to reach a conclusion on the issue.
Football
Association football is controlled bv separate
football associations in England, Whales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England

42,000 clubs to regional or district
associations. The FA, founded in 1863, and
the Football League (www.football-
league.co.uk), founded in 1888, were both the
first of their kind in the world. In Scotland
there are 78 full and associate clubs and nearly
6,000 registered clubs under the jurisdiction of
the Scottish Football Association
(www. scottishfa. co. uk).

some 42.2 million spectators attended the
main English and Scottish League matches in
1999-2000. Turnover of the FA Premier
League’s clubs reached £112 million in
1999-2000. The FA is investing substantially
in developing grass-roots football facilities. In
2001 it announced plans for a new National
Football Centre in Burton-on-Trent, to be
opened in 2003. Meanwhile, sportscotland
has invested over £18 million of Lottery funds
in developing Scottish football, at both grass¬
roots and elite level, and in March 2001
announced two football academies, at
Kilmarnock and Rangers football clubs, to
help develop talented young footballers into
top-class international players.
In 2001 Liverpool won the UEFA Cup,
defeating Alaves of Spain in the final in
Dortmund (Germany), the team’s third Cup

Hockey
The modern game of hockey was founded in
England in 1886. A single association—
English Hockey {www.hockeyonline.co.uk) 
now governs men’s and women’s hockey in
England, with similar single associations in
Scotland and Wales. Cup competitions and
leagues exist at national, divisional or district,
club and school levels, both indoors (six-a-
side) and outdoors, and there are regular
international matches and tournaments. The
National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes is
the venue for all major hockey matches played
in England.
Horse Racing
Horse racing takes two main forms—flat
racing and National Hunt (steeplechasing and
hurdle) racing. The turf flat race season lasts
from late March to early November, but all-
weather flat racing and National Hunt racing
take place throughout the year. Great Britain
has 59 racecourses and about 14,000 horses
currently in training. Point-to-point racing,
restricted to amateur riders on horses which
are qualified by having gone hunting, takes
place between January and June.
The Derby, run at Epsom, is the
outstanding event in the flat racing calendar.
Other classic races are: the 2,000 Guineas and
the 1,000 Guineas, both held at Newmarket;
the Oaks (Epsom); and the St Leger
(Doncaster). The meeting at Royal Ascot in
June is another significant flat racing event.
The most important National Hunt meeting is
the National Hunt Festival held at
Cheltenham in March, which features the
Gold Cup and the Champion Hurdle. The
Grand National, run at Aintree, near
Liverpool, since the 1830s, is the world’s most
famous steeplechase. The race is televised
around the world, with an estimated total
audience of approximately 500 million in 150
countries in 2001.

marketing. The Jockey Club, as the regulatory
authority, is responsible for licensing,
disciplinary matters and security.
The Government has announced that the
Horserace Totahsator Board (the Tote), which
provides pool betting facilities on racecourses
and a range of other betting facilities, will be
305
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
sold to the racing industry. It also intends to
abolish the Horserace Betting Levy Board and
the annual levy under which a proportion of
horserace betting turnover of bookmakers and
the Tote is returned to the racing industry.
Discussions are in progress between the racing
and betting industries on a successor
commercial arrangement.

time, having previously been staged at
Co\ entry. In 2001 Dougie Lampkin won his
fifth successive outdoor title in the world
motorcycle trials championship.
Mountaineering
The representative body is the British
Mountaineering Council (BMC)
{www.thebmc.co.uk), which works closely with
the Mountaineering Councils of Scotland and
Ireland. Their main areas of work include
access and conservation, training and the
pro\ ision of information. The BMC estimates
that the number of active climbers is around
150,000, while there are also a large number of
hill walkers. There are over 300
mountaineering and climbing clubs in the
UK, and three National Centres for
mountaineering activities run by the Sports
Councils (see pp. 296-7). UK mountaineers

SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
Amateur Rowing Association (ARA)
(www.ara-rowing.org) in England, with similar
bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. The ARA is also the governing body
for representative international teams for
Great Britain, in World and Olympic
competition.
The Head of the River Race is the largest
assembly of racing craft in the world, with
more than 420 eights racing in procession on
the Thames. Similar events are run
throughout the winter months for fours, pairs
and singles. Racing over the same course, the
University Boat Race, between two eights
from Oxford and Cambridge, has been rowed
almost every spring since 1836. Cambridge
won the event in March 2001, to take its total
number of victories to 77; Oxford has won 69
races and there has been one dead heat. The
National Championships are held at the

metres. At the Henley Regatta in Oxfordshire
crews from all over the world compete each
July in various kinds of race over a straight
course of 1 mile 550 yards (about 2.1 km).
In the 2000 Sydney Olympics the British
rowing team won two gold medals and a silver
medal, its best result since 1948. Sir Steve
Redgrave (who has since retired) became the
first competitor in Olympic history to win five
gold medals in an endurance sport in
consecutive Olympics when he won the
coxless four, together with Matthew Pinsent
(with whom he had won the coxless pairs in
the 1992 and 1996 Olympics), James Cracknell
and Tim Foster. The men’s eight also won
gold, while the women’s quadruple scull won
a silver medal, Britain’s first women’s
Olympic medal in rowing.
Rugby League
Rugby league (a 13-a-side game) originated in
1895 following the breakaway from rugby union
(see below) of 22 clubs in the north of England,
where the sport is still concentrated. In the UK
there are 30 professional clubs, with about 2,000
professional players, and some 400 amateur
clubs with a total of around 40,000 players.
The governing body of the professional
game is the Rugby Football League
(www.rfl.uk.com), while the amateur game is
governed by the British Amateur Rugby
League Association. The major domestic club
match of the season is the Challenge Cup Final.
Matches in the two main leagues are played
in the summer. The Tetley’s Super League
consists of 12 clubs—11 from the north of
England and one from London—while 19
clubs play in the Northern Ford Premiership.
Sixteen nations contested the Lincoln
Financial Group World Cup in 2000. In the
final at Old Trafford (Manchester) Australia
defeated New Zealand. Wales and England
were the other two teams to reach the
semi-finals.
Rugby Union
Rugby union football (a 15-a-side game)
originated at Rugby School in the first half of
the 19th century. The sport is played under
the auspices of the Rugby Football Union
(RFU) (www.rfu.com) in England (the
International Rugby Board internationally)
and parallel bodies in Wales, Scotland and
Ireland. In July 2001 an agreement was
reached under which the RFU and the
Premiership Clubs in England formed a joint
venture, England Rugby Ltd, to manage their
international and professional game together.
Each of the four home unions has separate
national league and knock-out competitions
for its domestic clubs; however, the two
premier sides in Scotland play in a league with
Welsh clubs. Leicester became the new
European champions in May 2001 when
winning the Heineken Cup, beating Stade
Fran^ais in the final in Paris.
The Lloyds TSB Six Nations
Championship is contested by England,
Scotland, Wales, Ireland (a team from the
Irish Republic and Northern Ireland), France
and Italy. Overseas tours are undertaken by
the national sides and by the British and Irish
Lions, a team representing Great Britain and
Ireland. Tours to the UK are made by teams
representing the major rugby-playing nations.
Sailing
Sailing is a broad term used to cover yacht and
dinghy racing and cruising, powerboat racing,
308
18: SPORT AND ACTIVE RECREATION
In finishing second in the yacht Kingfisher
in the \ endee Globe race in February
2001, Ellen MacArthur (see picture
opposite p. 299) became the fastest
woman to circumnavigate the world in a
single-handed race. At the age of 24, she
was also the youngest person to achieve
this feat.
motor cruising, jet skiing and windsurfing on
inland and offshore waters. The Royal
\ achting Association (RYA) (wrprv.rya.org.uk)
is the national governing body for boating in
the UK and aims to make boating in all its
forms as accessible as possible. The
Association also includes RYA Sailability, the
charit) for disabled sailors. It also administers
the 1 achtmaster yachting qualification.
According to the British Marine Industries
Federation, about 7.8 million people
participate in the sport. Among well-known
yachting events in the UK are Cowes Week
and the Fastnet Race.
In the 2000 Olympic Games the British
team was the most successful nation in sailing,
w inning five medals. Gold medals were won
by Ben Ainslie (in the Laser class), Iain Percy
(Finn class) and Shirley Robertson (Europe
class), while silver medals were won by Ian
Barker and Simon Hiscocks in the 49er event
and by Ian Walker and Mark Covell in the
Star class.
Skiing and Other Winter Sports
Skiing takes place in Scotland from December
to May and also at several English locations
when there is sufficient snow. The five
established winter sports areas in Scotland are
Cairngorm, Glencoe, Glenshee, the Uecht and
Nevis Range. All have a full range of ski-lifts,
prepared ski-runs and professional instructors.
There are over 115 artificial or dry ski-
slopes throughout the UK. The British Ski
and Snowboard Federation is the
representative body for international
competitive skiing and snowboarding. The
four home country ski councils are responsible
for the development of the sport at grass-roots
level.
Snooker and Billiards
Snooker was invented by the British in India
in 1875 and is played by approximately
7 million people in the UK. British players
have dominated the major professional
championships. The main tournament is the
annual Embassy World Professional
Championship, held at the Crucible Theatre
in Sheffield. In May 2001 Ronnie O’Sullivan
won the title, defeating John Higgins in the
final by 18 frames to 14.
World Snooker (www.worldsnooker.com)
organises professional events and holds the
copyright for the rules. The representative
body for women is the World Ladies’ Billiards
and Snooker Association.
Squash
Squash derives from the game of rackets,
which was invented at Harrow School in the
1850s. The governing body for squash in
England is the Squash Rackets Association
(www.squash.co.uk)', there are separate
governing bodies in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. The British Open
Championships is one of the major world
events in the sport.
The number of players in the UK is
estimated at over 1.5 million, of whom more
than 500,000 compete regularly in inter-club
league competitions. There are nearly 9,000
squash courts in England, provided mainly by
squash clubs, commercial organisations and
local authorities.
Peter Nicol is the current men’s world
squash champion. The England team of Tania
Bailey, Stephanie Brind and Linda Charman
won the women’s team title in Sheffield in
November 2000, defeating Australia in the
final.
Swimming
Swimming is a popular sport and form of
exercise for people from all age-groups (see
Table 18.1). Competitive swimming is
governed by the Amateur Swimming
Association (ASA) (www.britishswimming.org)
in England and by similar associations in
Scotland and W ales. Together these three
309
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL AFFAIRS
associations form the Amateur Swimming
Federation of Great Britain Ltd, which
coordinates the selection of Great Britain
teams and organises international
competitions. Instruction and coaching are
provided by qualified teachers and coaches
who hold certificates awarded mainly by the
ASA. Northern Ireland forms part of Swim
Ireland. The British team won seven medals in
the World Championships in Fukuoka (Japan)
in July 2001, including a gold medal for the
4 x 200 m women’s freestyle relay team of
Nicola Jackson, Janine Belton, Karen Legg
and Karen Pickering.
Table Tennis
Table tennis originated in England in the
1880s. Today it is played by all age-groups,
and in a variety of venues, ranging from small
halls to specialist, multi-table centres. It is also
a major recreational and competitive activity
for people with disabilities. The governing
body in England is the English Table Tennis
Association (vprprv.etta.co.uk) and there is also
an English Schools Association. Separate
associations exist in Scotland, Wales and
Ireland (where the association covers both
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic).
Tennis
The modern game of tennis originated in
England in 1873 and the first championships
were played at Wimbledon in 1877. The
governing body for tennis in Great Britain is
the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA)
(TPWW.lta.org.uk), to which Tennis Wales and
the Scottish LTA are affiliated. Tennis in
Northern Ireland is governed by Tennis
Ireland (Ulster Branch).
The Wimbledon Championships, held
within the grounds of the All England Club,
are one of the four tennis ‘Grand Slam’
tournaments. They attracted a record 490,000
spectators in 2001. Prize money totalled
£8.5 million. In 2000 the Championships
generated a surplus of £31.1 million, which
was invested in British tennis. The UK’s two
leading players, Tim Henman (a Wimbledon
semi-finalist in 1998, 1999 and 2001) and
Greg Rusedski, have both won titles on the
main tennis tour in 2001. Lee Childs and
James Nelson won the boys’ doubles at the US
Open in September 2000, and at the end of
2000 they became the first British players to
be declared world junior champions by the
International Tennis Federation.
About 5 million people play tennis in the
UK. There are national and county
championships, while national competitions are
organised for schools. The LTA has a five-year
plan for developing tennis in Great Britain,
with the aim of expanding participation,
encouraging regular competition and producing
more world-class tennis players. Tennis
facilities are being improved, with more indoor
tennis centres, clay courts and floodlit courts.

Design
Design—sometimes unnoticed, often highly
creative—is a pervasive influence in UK
society today. It covers a huge range of
activities: the packaging of a tin of beans, the
latest fashion styles, the layout and appearance
of websites and the special effects produced in
a film are all the responsibility of designers.
Design boosts the economy and exports,
introduces new and updated products into
e\ er) day life, and helps to change the way we
communicate and think about ourselves.
British business spends an estimated
£21 billion on design either as an in-house
resource or as a bought-in service, and around
1 million people are employed in design in the
UK in either full- or part-time positions.1 2
A relatively small number of these (around
7,000) work for the top 100 specialist firms,
selling design services to other companies.
British design consultancies earn around
£1 billion a year in export revenue. In
1998-99 some 18,000 students were studying
design courses at colleges of further and
higher education, including graphic design,
theatre and interior design, photography, craft
and animation courses.- The UK’s expertise in
areas such as airport and transport design is
acknowledged worldwide, with British
designers having a strong presence in all the
international large automotive design studios.
Designer fashion is another growth area.
Individual designers such as Alexander
McQueen, Julien Macdonald and Stella
McCartney have gained international
reputations, and London Fashion Week is
now firmly established as a leading event in
the fashion house circuit. The UK designer
fashion industry is currently ranked fourth
largest in the world, behind those of the
United States, France and Italy.
1 Design Council research, 2001.
2 As a comparison, there were about 8,000 creative arts
graduates from Great Britain institutions in 1991-92.
311
Better design is supported and encouraged in
the UK by the Design Council, an
independent organisation w orking with
partners in business, education and
government to inspire and enable the effective
use of design. Its w ork includes w eb-based
knowledge sharing, events, publications and
educational materials highlighting design best
practice, as well as the development of tools to
enable the integration of design into
management. The Design Council also runs
two annual awareness-raising initiatives:
Design in Business Week and Design in
Education Week.
Changing patterns in the UK economy have
resulted in the increasing dominance of service
sector and technology-intensive businesses.
The expansion of e-commerce, the shorthand
name given to many of these changes,3 has
opened up fresh opportunities for design. In
2000, seven of the top ten UK design
consultancies specialised in digital media.4
As more and more business is conducted over
the Internet, the design of websites will
become increasingly important in attracting
new customers.
The ability to generate new ideas or develop
innovative products or processes is a much
prized but often elusive skill. The traditional
workplace is not always the best environment
for such creativity. In a recent survey of
company directors, 39% of those questioned
said that their best ideas came to them w hile
travelling; thinking in bed w orked best for
18% of directors; and 12% favoured
bathtime as a source of creative ideas. Only
11% replied that their best ideas came to them
w hile they were at work.5

Recent initiatives to support the countryside and environmental protection
include the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 for England and Wales and
the rural White Papers in England and Scotland.
Government funding for countryside and wildlife programmes in 2002-03
will be £207 million in England and Wales, £52.6 million in Scotland and
£1.6 million in Northern Ireland.
Conservation
Administration
The Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is responsible for
countryside policy and environmental
protection in England. It was formed from the
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(MAFF) and parts of the Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
(DETR) in June 2001 to ensure that objectives
for the countryside are integrated with
agricultural policies. The Environment Group
of the Scottish Executive Environment and
Rural Affairs Department, the National
Assembly for Wales (NAW) and the Northern
Ireland Executive have broadly equivalent
responsibilities for other parts of the UK. The
four bodies are responsible for implementing
the Biodiversity Action Plan, the overarching
framework for conservation work in the UK
(see p. 320 ). Many of the conservation
functions are delegated to agencies, which are
described below. In addition, local authorities
and many voluntary organisations are actively
involved in environmental conservation and
protection.
Countryside and Wildlife
Countryside and Wildlife Agencies, and Voluntary
Organisations
The Wildlife and Countryside Directorate
within DEFRA is responsible for policy on
wildlife and countryside in England. It
sponsors three non-departmental public
bodies: the Countryside Agency, English
Nature and the National Forest Company.
DEFRA also sponsors the Joint Nature
Conservation Committee (JNCC), a
312
19: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
committee of three statutory nature
conservation agencies (see p. 314).
The Countryside Agency (wwm. country side.
gov.uk) is the statutory body in England whose
aims are to conserve and enhance the
countryside; promote social equality and
economic opportunity for the people who live
there; and help everyone, wherever they live,
to enjoy this natural asset. It has a budget of
around £73 million for 2001-02 which"
includes £10 million set aside for initiatives
announced in the rural White Paper; £2.2
million for its Rural Transport Partnerships
Scheme; and £3.5 million for Areas of
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs—see
p. 315) and for the preparations for the
introduction of greater access to open country
(see below).
In 2001 the Agency set out its strategy to
address the key issues facing the countryside.
The strategy comprises eight major work
programmes to:
> increase awareness of the impact of
policies on rural people and places;
> develop markets for local products and
influence subsidy reform;
> establish more areas where visitors can
enjoy the countryside;
> revitalise rural service centres;
> create attractive, accessible green spaces
around towns;
^ secure the quality of the best landscapes;
> equip rural communities to shape their
future; and
> help people to care for their landscapes,
landmarks and traditions.
The Agency has already started a number
of these programmes. In January 2001 it
commissioned work on mapping the areas that
are open country and common land. The
Countryside Character database will bring
together map-based and trend information on
a Geographical Information System (GIS)
map of England in order to develop a
landscape typography that provides a deeper
insight into the components of the English
countryside. Once the typography is finalised
in 2002, it will be used to assess the impact on
the landscape of changes in agricultural
practices, new housing, industrial
development and transport infrastructure, and
mineral extraction.
In April 2001 the Countryside Agency
published its third annual comprehensive
analysis: 7 he State of the Countryside 2001. For
the first time the report presents information
about 20 thematic indicators illustrating rural
economic, social and environmental
conditions. The indicators can track changes
and the cumulative impact of organisational
and individual decisions and policies. The
2001 report details how:
> tourism contributes more than £ 12
billion a year to the rural economy;
> the rapid decline in farmland birds
slowed between 1986 and 1999;
> hedgerow decline appears to have halted;
> one-third of all England’s businesses are
in rural areas; and
> the growth of rural populations continues
to outstrip that of urban populations, as
more people move into the countryside.
The Agency has established more than 250
new Millennium Greens in and on the edge of
cities, towns, villages and hamlets across
England, with the aid of a £10 million Lottery
grant from the Millennium Commission.
English Nature (www. english-nature.org.uk)
promotes the conservation of England’s
wildlife and natural features and provides
advice to the Government on nature
conservation. Its budget for 2001-02 is £62.6
million. Phis includes £8 million to enable it
to implement the new provisions on Sites of
Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) (see
p. 319) in the Countryside and Rights of Way
Act 2000 (see p. 314). In Scotland, the
Countryside and Natural Heritage Unit of the
Environment Group sponsors Scottish Natural
Heritage (SNH) {xvvpw.snh.org.uk), a body with
both the nature conservation duties and
powers of English Nature, and the countrvside
and landscape powers of the Countrvside
Agency. The Countryside Council for Wales
(CCW) {www.ccw.gov.uk) has responsibilities
in Wales for landscape and nature
conservation and countryside recreation. The
budgets for these two organisations for
2001-02 are £48.5 million and £40.2 million
respectively. In Northern Ireland, the
313
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Environment and Heritage Service (EHS)
(wjmv.elisni.gov.uk), an agency within the
Department of the Environment (DOE),
protects and manages the natural and built
environment and also has an environmental
protection role. Its budget for 2001-02 is
£35 million.
English Nature, CCW and SNH are also
responsible for providing advice and
information to the Government and the public
on nature conservation, for notifying land as
being of special interest due to its wildlife,
geological and natural features, and for
establishing National Nature Reserves
(NNRs).
The JNCC (www.jncc.gov.uk) is the statutory
committee through which English Nature,
CCW and SNH exercise their joint functions.
These include: providing advice on amendments
to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and on
the development and implementation of policies
that affect nature conservation in Great Britain
and internationally; and establishing common
standards for monitoring of, and research into,
nature conservation and the analysis of resultant
information. At the international level, the
JNCC is working on implementing the
Convention on Biological Diversity (see
p. 320).
Voluntary organisations are well represented
in conservation work. Although they are funded
largely by subscription, private donations and
entrance fees, many receive government
support and grants, sometimes in recognition of
statutory responsibilities that they perform.
The National Trust, a charity with nearly
2.7 million members, owns and protects places
of historic interest and natural beauty for the
benefit of the nation. It looks after around
270,000 hectares (667,000 acres) of land in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland,
including: 200 historic houses; 160 gardens;
40,000 ancient monuments and archaeological
remains; forests, woods, fens, farmland,
downs, moorland and islands; nature reserves;
coastline; and 46 villages. Some 2.6 million
people visit National Trust lpay for entry’
properties each year and an estimated 50
million visits are made annually to its coasts
and countryside properties.
The separate National Trust for Scotland
owns 125 properties and 75,000 hectares
(185,000 acres) of countryside. Established in
1931, it is supported by a membership of
240,000 and over 2 million people visit its
properties each year.
Countryside and Wildlife Legislation
The primary conservation legislation in Great
Britain is the Wildlife and Countryside Act
1981, which provides for a range of measures
to protect plants and animals from damage
and destruction. The Countryside and Rights
of Way Act 2000 strengthened this legislation.
The Act—the first major piece of countryside
legislation to be introduced in England and
Wales for nearly 20 years—creates a new
statutory right of access, giving people greater
freedom to explore the open countryside,
while also providing safeguards for
landowners. Other provisions within the Act,
which came into force in February 2001,
include:
> greater protection for SSSIs (see p. 319)
and AONBs (see p. 315);
> establishing statutory local access forums
to advise local authorities on the
improvement of access and rights of way
in their area;
> new provisions to tackle wildlife crime
(see p. 318);
> enabling courts to order the removal of
obstructions from highways;
> requiring vegetation overhanging
bridleways to be cut back to a height
suitable for horseriders;
> power to regulate traffic for conservation
purposes;
> promoting the conservation of important
habitats and species; and
> revising and clarifying the definition of
town and village greens.
National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural
Beauty and National Scenic Areas

importance of the area concerned, in terms of
landscape, biodiversity and as a recreational
resource. However, the name National Park

does not signify national ownership and most
of the land in National Parks is owned by
farmers and other private landowners. In
England and \\ ales, each Park is administered
by an independent National Park Authority.
There are eight National Parks in England
(including the Broads) and three in Wales.
The oldest is the Peak District National Park,
established in 1951. Although there are
currently no National Parks in Northern
Ireland or Scotland, the Scottish Parliament
passed the National Parks (Scotland) Act in
July 2000, paving the way to establish
Scotland’s first National Park—Loch Lomond
and the Trossachs—by summer 2002.
The primary objective of AONBs is the
conservation and enhancement of the natural
beauty of the landscape, although many of
them also fulfil a greater recreational purpose.
There are 37 in England and five in Wales.
Designation started in 1956 with the Gower
Peninsula in Wales, and the most recent
addition was the Tamar Valley in Cornwall in
1995. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000 gives authorities and communities
greater powers to improve the conservation of
AONBs.
The Countryside Agency and the CCW
designate National Parks and AONBs, subject
to confirmation by the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs or
NAW respectively. The Agency is currently
considering National Park
designations for the New
Forest and the South
Downs.
In Northern Ireland
the Council for Nature
Conservation and the
Countryside (CNCC)
advises the Government
on natural landscapes and
the designation of
AONBs. Nine such areas
have been designated and
two more areas—Erne
Lakeland and Fermanagh
Caveland—have been
proposed for designation.
While Scotland does not
have any AONBs it does
have four regional parks
and 40 National Scenic Areas (NSAs),
together covering around 11,000 sq km (4,250
sq miles). In NSAs certain developments are
subject to consultation with SNH and, in the
event of a disagreement, with the Scottish
Executive.
Forest and Country Parks
There are 17 forest parks in Great Britain,
covering nearly 3,000 sq km (1,150 sq miles),
which are administered by the Forestry
Commission (see pp. 465—7). The Countryside
Agency recognises over 200 country parks and
more than 250 picnic sites in England. A
further 36 country parks in Wales are
recognised by the CCW, and there are 36
country parks in Scotland. Northern Ireland
has eight forest parks, three forest drives and
over 40 minor forest sites. All are administered
by the Forest Service, an agency of the
Department of Agriculture and Rural
Development for Northern Ireland (DARD).
Tree Preservation and Planting
Tree Preservation Orders enable local
authorities to protect trees and woodlands.
Once a tree is protected, it is, in general,
an offence to cut down or carry out most types
of work to it without permission. Courts can
impose substantial fines for breaches of such
315
TI IE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Orders. Where protected trees are felled
in contravention of an Order or are removed
because they are dying, dead or dangerous,
replacement trees must be planted and local
authorities have powers to enforce this.
Tree planting is encouraged through
various grant schemes, including the Forestry
Commission’s Woodland Grant Scheme (see
p. 466). Consequently, the planting of
broadleaved trees has greatly increased since
the 1980s.
Major afforestation projects involving the
Forestry Commission, the Countryside
Agency and 58 local authorities include the
creation of 12 Community Forests in and
around major cities, with a total designated
area of 450,000 hectares (1.1 million acres).
The aims of these forests are: to increase
woodland cover near the cities from 6.5% to
about 30%; to restore areas scarred by
industrial dereliction; to create sites for
recreation, sport and environmental

wildlife. In 1999—2000, about 1,200 hectares of
new woodlands were created in Community
Forest areas, bringing the total since 1991 to
The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in
2001 (see p. 460) had a severe impact on
the rural economy as a whole, with rural
enterprises, farming support services and
countryside tourism being badly affected.
In response to this, in March 2001, the
Government set up the Rural Task Force
to work on a package of measures to help
ease hardship in rural areas. Key issues for
the Task Force included: improving
information about access to the
countryside; restoring confidence, both at
home and abroad, in the tourist industry;
and implementing a package of measures
to help to sustain rural communities.
The Countryside Agency has given
almost £1.5 million to three charities: the
ARC-Addington Fund, the Rural Stress
Information Network and the Cumbrian
Community Foundation to help them as
they deal with the problems that rural
people are facing as a result of foot-and-
mouth disease.
just over 7,400 hectares. This compares with
total new woodland creation in Britain of over
15,000 hectares a year.
In July 2001 NAW published its woodland
strategy, which will be managed by the
Forestry Commission. The strategy will focus
on community woodlands, the environmental
management of existing woodland, and the
contribution that woodlands make to rural,
social and economic development.
Other organisations involved in protecting
existing woods and planting new areas of
woodland include voluntary bodies such as the
Woodland Trust, which owns over 1,100
woods across the UK covering 18,300 hectares
(45,300 acres) and, since 1976, has planted
over 4 million trees.
Public Rights of Way and Open Country
England has about 188,700 km (122,800 miles)
of rights of way: 146,600 km of footpaths,
32,400 km of bridleways, 3,700 km of byways
open to all traffic and 6,000 km of roads used
as public paths. There are 13 long-distance
routes in England and Wales and three in
Scotland, designated as National Trails. Ten
of the National Trails have been fully
developed and three are in the process of
being completed.
About a quarter of the rights of way in
England may be lawfully used by horseriders
and cyclists, although the Pennine
Bridleway—currently under construction—
will be the first long-distance trail designed
specifically for horseriders and cyclists.
In 1996 SNFI launched Paths for All, an
initiative established to facilitate the creation
of 40 path networks across Scotland by 2000
for walkers, riders and cyclists.
County, metropolitan and unitary councils
in England and Wales (see pp. 67-8) are
responsible for keeping public rights of way
signposted and free from obstruction. Public
paths are usually maintained by these
‘highway authorities’, which also supervise
landowners’ duties to repair stiles and gates.
In Scotland planning authorities are
responsible for asserting and protecting rights
of way. Subject to public consultation, and, if
necessary, a public inquiry, local authorities in
316
19: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Great Britain can create paths, close paths no
longer needed for public use, and divert paths
to meet the needs of either the public or
landowners. Farmers in England and Wales
are required by law to restore any cross-field
public paths damaged or erased by agricultural
operations.
Common land in England and Wales totals
more than 550,000 hectares (1.36 million
acres). The open character of commons has
made them popular for informal recreation
although significant areas are still important
for agriculture. Four-fifths of common land is
privately owned and although only 20% has a
right of public access, there is also de facto
access. The Countryside and Rights of Way
Act 2000 will provide a right of access to all
registered common land, subject to
management restrictions. DEFRA estimates
that 65% of common land is no longer subject
to rights of common. Commons are largely
unimproved and therefore have high amenity
and wildlife value; many are protected by law
and by nature conservation designations. For
example, around half of the common land in
England is found within National Parks (see
p. 314) and a similar amount is designated as
SSSIs (see p. 319). Ministerial consent is
usually required to undertake work on
commons or to enclose areas by fencing. In
2000 the Government launched a public
consultation exercise aimed at finding ways to
improve the protection and management of
common land in England and Wales.
The Coast
Local planning authorities are responsible for
planning land use at the coast; they also aim to
safeguard and enhance the coast’s natural
attractions and preserve areas of scientific
interest. The policy for the protection of the
coastline against erosion and flooding is
administered by DEFRA, NAW, the Scottish
Executive and DARD. Operational
responsibility lies with local authorities and, in
England and \\ ales, the Environment Agency.
DEFRA and the NAW are jointly funding
a project which aims to predict how the
coastline in England and Wales will change.
This will help local operating authorities
update their shoreline management plans and
coastal defence systems. It will also allow
coastal management decisions to be placed
within a longer-term and wider-scale
framework, by looking at current coastal
processes such as erosion, beach slipping and
sand movement, cliff stability problems and
landslip. The results of the research are
expected to be available in February 2002.
Certain stretches of undeveloped coast
of particular beauty in England and Wales
are defined as Heritage Coast. There are
45 Heritage Coasts, protecting 1,540 km
(960 miles), about 35% of the total length of
coastline.
The National Trust (see p. 314), through
its Neptune Coastline Campaign, raises funds
to acquire and protect stretches of coastline of
great natural beauty and recreational value.
Around £36 million has been raised since
1965 and the Trust now protects around 960
km (600 miles) of coastline in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland. The National Trust for
Scotland cares for more than 400 km (250
miles) of the Scottish coastline and protects
others through conservation agreements.
English Nature has supported 13 groups in
developing and managing a variety of marine
conservation initiatives. So far, 36 estuary
management plans have been completed or are
in preparation, covering 39 estuaries or 85%
of England’s total estuaries by area (the Dee
and Severn estuary plans were jointly funded
with the CCW). There are also 29 informal
marine consultation areas in Scotland. In
addition, SNH has established the Focus on
Firths initiative to coordinate management of
the main Scottish estuaries. In Wales the
CCW provides grants to the Arfordir (or
Coastal) Group, which is concerned with the
sustainable management of the whole coast of
\\ ales. Altogether there are 163 estuaries in
the UK, representing about 30% of the North
Sea and Atlantic seaboard of Western Europe.
The UK also has about 75% of the European
chalk coast.
Wildlife Protection
The protection of wildlife is an essential
element of the UK Government’s sustainable
development agenda (see p. 378). DEFRA
intends to bring 95% of all nationally

important wildlife sites into a favourable
condition by 2010, compared with the 60% of
sites currently estimated to be in that state.
The UK has over 100,000 separate species,
out of a global total estimated by the JNCC as
being between 5 million and 15 million. The
list of protected species is reviewed by the
three statutory nature conservation agencies,
acting jointly through the JNCC, every five
years, when recommended changes can be
submitted to the Government. As elsewhere in
the world, urban development, changes in
farming methods and other factors have put
pressure on a number of species and plants.
Bird populations are good indicators of the
state of wildlife in the countryside, since they
have a wide habitat distribution and are near
the top of the food chain. There are concerns
about the decline in certain bird species, as
modern farming and forestry methods have
removed the food supply they need for
breeding and surviving the winter. In 2001 the
British Trust for Ornithology (BTO)
published findings from a survey, Breeding
Birds in the Wilder Countryside, which found
that populations of 20 of Britain’s most
common birds have dropped by more than
50% in 25 years. It is for this reason that wild
bird populations are one of the headline
indicators in the UK’s sustainable
development strategy. DEFRA will increase
funding up to 2007 for agri-environment
schemes to restore farmland habitats, and is
funding a study led by the BTO to investigate
the long-term declines of the house sparrow
and starling, as both species have declined by
more than 50% since 1973.
The UK Biodiversity Action Plan (see
p. 320) also includes targets to reverse bird
population decline; 26 species have been
identified, including the skylark, grey
partridge, corn bunting, song thrush and
bullfinch.
Wildlife Crime
Wildlife crime takes many forms and has been
increasing in recent years: for example, theft
of eggs from birds of prey, illegal shooting,
trapping, poisoning, digging up of wild plants,
and the illicit trade in endangered species.
DNA testing is playing an increasing role in
combating crime of this kind, and there are
now specialist wildlife officers in almost every
police force in the UK.
An important role in combating wildlife
crime is played by the Partnership for Action
Against Wildlife Crime, which is chaired by
the police and DEFRA. It provides a forum
for communication and cooperation between
the statutory enforcement authorities and
non-governmental organisations which have
an active interest in wildlife law enforcement
in the UK. The Partnership provides a
strategic overview of wildlife law enforcement
issues and promotes increased awareness of

wildlife crime and the damage it causes to
certain threatened species. DEFRA manages a
team of around 100 wildlife inspectors whose
main role is to carry out visits to premises to
verify information submitted to them for
permits, certificates and other documents to
keep or trade in wildlife species and to check
that people are complying with the
administrative controls contained in certain
wildlife legislation.
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000 has introduced stronger measures to
combat wildlife crime, including greater
powers for police officers and DEFRA wildlife
inspectors, and new penalties, including jail
sentences of up to six months and fines of up
to j£5,000. In Scotland, a process of pre¬
legislative consultation on reform of wildlife
law has been completed and is being
considered by Scottish ministers.
Habitat Protection
Habitat protection is mainly achieved through
the networks of Sites of Special Scientific
Interest (SSSIs) in Great Britain, and Areas of
Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs) in
Northern Ireland. By the end of March 2001,
4,115 SSSIs had been notified in England,
1,009 in Wales, 1,449 in Scotland and 182
ASSIs in Northern Ireland, for their plants,
animals or geological or physiographical
features. Some SSSIs and ASSIs are of
international importance and have been
designated for protection under the EC Wild
Birds and Habitats Directives or the Ramsar
Convention (see p. 321). In England, the
Government’s target is to bring 95% of SSSIs
into favourable condition by 2010. Most
SSSIs and ASSIs are privately owned, but
about 40% are owned or managed by public
bodies such as the Forestry Commission,
Ministry of Defence and the Crown Estate.
English Nature, the CCW and SNH have
powers to enter into land management
agreements with owners and occupiers of
SSSI land, where this is necessary to support
the management of their natural features. The
CNCC advises on the establishment and
management of land and marine nature
reserves and the declaration of ASSIs in
319
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Northern Ireland. In March 2001 the DOE
published a consultation document, Partners in
Protection, which seeks further protection for
the ASSIs. Proposals from this consultation
process are expected to be published in
October 2001.
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000 improves the protection and
management of SSSIs in England and Wales,
by giving enhanced powers to the conservation
agencies and powers to refuse consent for
damaging activities. The conservation
agencies in England and Wales also have new
powers to develop management schemes, in
consultation with owners and occupiers of
SSSIs, and to serve a management notice to
require works to be done where necessary.
Penalties for deliberate damage to SSSIs have
been increased to a maximum of ^20,000 in
magistrates’ courts, with unlimited fines in the
Crown Court.
Wildlife Trusts (based on conurbations,
counties or regions), the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the Scottish
Wildlife Trust play an important part in
protecting wildlife throughout the UK. The
RSPB manages 168 reserves in the UK
covering 114,657 hectares (283,300 acres) of
land. During 2000-01 it acquired 2,910
hectares of land, including six new reserves. It
is the largest voluntary wildlife conservation
body in Europe, with over 1 million members.
The Scottish Wildlife Trust, with a
membership of around 19,000, manages 126
wildlife reserves covering approximately
22,500 hectares (55,600 acres). The Trust has
recently secured funding from the Heritage
Lottery Fund for a £5 million, five-year
reserves enhancement project.
Biodiversity, and Species Recovery and
Reintroduction
The UK is one of 180 Parties to the
Convention on Biological Diversity Treaty,
agreed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro
in 1992 (see p. 378). The Parties have agreed
to develop national strategies and programmes
for the conservation and sustainable use of
biological diversity and ensure the fair and
equitable sharing of benefits from the use of
genetic resources. While the prime focus for
implementation is at national level, much
activity is under way internationally to
elaborate the Convention’s obligations, share
experience and help identify good practice.
The next meeting of the Parties will be in
April 2002 in the Netherlands.
As part of the UK Biodiversity Action
Plan, some 391 species and 45 habitat action
plans have been established and are at various
stages of implementation. In addition, over
100 local biodiversity action plans are being
developed. The UK Biodiversity Group, a
partnership of the statutory, voluntary and
private sectors presented a report on progress
on the first five years of the UK Biodiversity
Action Plans to the Government and devolved
administrations in March 2001. The report
can be found on the UK Biodiversity website
{wrpvp. ukbap. org. uk).
The Countryside and Rights of Way Act
2000 introduced a statutory duty on ministers
and government departments in England and
Wales to have regard to the conservation of
biological diversity in carrying out their
functions. The National Biodiversity Network
Trust is a charity representing 11 voluntary
and public organisations. It was established in
2000 with the aim of bringing together
biodiversity information to meet a wide range
of conservation, research, educational and
public participation needs. The National
Biodiversity Network provides an Internet
service (www.searchnbn.net) to deliver access to
dispersed information sources. The service
provides geographical, species, habitat and
thematic ways of accessing and integrating
information.
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (see
p. 444) has been successful for many years in
the reintroduction of species. Its Millennium
Seed Bank in the Wellcome Trust Millennium
Building, at Wakehurst Place, West Sussex,
holds seeds of 1,312 native UK wild flowers,
plants and trees—90% of British plant species.
It aims to hold 10% of flowering plants from
the arid regions of the world by 2010 and 25%
by 2025. The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh
(RBGE) (see p. 444) promotes conservation
programmes for rare plants in Scotland and for
coniferous trees worldwide, maintaining
genetically diverse populations in cultivation at
many sites, as pools for eventual reintroduction
320
19: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
to the wild. Currently RBGE’s Living
Collections consists of 6% of the world’s
flowering plant species in cultivation and also
includes 1,400 threatened plants.
International Action
The UK’s international obligations to
conserve wildlife include membership of the
World Conservation Union and of several
international Conventions and Directives,
some of which are described below.
The IUCN—the World Conservation
Union—is the largest nature conservation
body in the world, having a membership of
nearly 1,000 governmental and non¬
governmental organisations. The purpose of
the Union is to influence, encourage and help
societies throughout the world to conserve the
integrity and diversity of nature and to ensure
that any use of natural resources is equitable
and ecologically sustainable.
The Convention on Wetlands of International
Importance (the Ramsar Convention) is an
intergovernmental treaty which covers all
aspects of wetland conservation and use,
recognising wetlands as ecosystems that are
extremely important for biodiversity
conservation and for the well-being of human
communities. By March 2001, 138 Ramsar
sites covering 7,347 sq km (2,837 sq miles) had
been established within the UK. There are a
further 11 sites in the British Overseas
1 erritories: seven in Bermuda and one each in
the British Indian Ocean Territory, the British
Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and the
Turks and Caicos Islands, collectively
covering over 55,000 hectares.
The Convention on the Conservation of
European Wildlife and Natural Habitats
(the Bern Convention) aims to ensure
conservation and protection of all wild plants
and animal species, to increase cooperation
between states in these areas, and to afford
special protection to the most vulnerable or
threatened species. It was the inspiration for
the EC Habitats and Wild Birds Directives
and had a direct influence on the Wildlife and
Countryside Act. Under the EC Wild Birds
Directive, 219 UK sites have been designated
as Special Protection Areas (SPAs). The
f orest of Clunie is the most recent area to be
designated in August 2001. Under the EC
Habitats Directive, 546 sites in the UK have
been put forward to the European
Commission as candidate Special Areas of
Conservation (cSACs). Collectively, SPAs and
cSACs form the EU network of nature
conservation sites known as Natura 2000.
The Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
{CITES) strictly regulates trade in endangered
species by means of a permit system. The
parties meet every two years, with the next
round of talks taking place in Chile in 2002. At
these talks, the UK Government will be
pressing for restrictions to the international
trade in basking sharks, and has already
pledged funds of £215,000 for research. The
UK’s bid follows a similar unsuccessful
proposal at the previous talks held in Nairobi
in April 2000.
The Convention on the Conservation of
Migratory Species of Wild Animals (the Bonn
Convention), which is held every two or three
years, coordinates international action on a
range of endangered migratory species. The
LK has signed a number of species-related
agreements under the Convention covering
the conservation of bats, cetaceans, waterbirds
and seabirds. The next meeting of the parties
will be held in Bonn in September 2002.
The Darwin Initiative, launched at the
Earth Summit (see p. 378), is designed to
bring British expertise to bear on the
biodiversity needs of developing countries to
help them implement the Convention on
Biological Diversity (see p. 320). Nine rounds
of funding have so far been approved for over
230 projects at a total cost of £27 million.
Buildings and Monuments
In England, lists of buildings of special
architectural or historic interest are compiled
by the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport (DCMS) with advice from English
Heritage. In Scotland and \\ ales, buildings are
listed by Historic Scotland and Cadw: Welsh
Historic Monuments, an executive agency
within NAW. It is against the law to demolish,
extend or alter the character of any ‘listed’
building without prior consent from the local
321
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
planning authority or—on appeal or following
call-in—the appropriate government minister.
A local planning authority can issue a
‘building preservation notice’ to protect for six
months an unlisted building which it
considers to be of special architectural or
historic interest and is at risk while a decision
is taken on whether it should be listed. In
Northern Ireland, the EHS has responsibility
for historic buildings, following consultation
with the advisory Historic Buildings Council
(HBC) and the relevant local district council.
Ancient monuments are protected through
a system of scheduling. English Heritage
assesses all known archaeological sites in
England in order to identify those nationally
important sites—out of a total of some
600,000—that should be afforded statutory
protection. It then makes its recommendations
to the DCMS, which maintains the schedule
of ancient monuments. Similar arrangements
exist to identify buildings and ancient and
historic monuments eligible for statutory
protection in Scotland and Wales. In
Northern Ireland the EHS assesses all known
archaeological sites in order to identify those
sites which should be afforded statutory
protection. It then makes recommendations to
the Historic Monuments Council (HMC) and
maintains the schedule.
In England details of all listed buildings are
contained in about 2,000 volumes which can
be inspected at the English Heritage offices in
Swindon (National Monuments Record
Centre) and London. The lists for particular
areas are also held by the relevant local
planning authorities, where they are available
for inspection, and at some public libraries. In
Wales records are kept at Cadw in Cardiff,
and in Scotland at Historic Scotland’s head
office in Edinburgh or the relevant local
planning authority. The EHS’s Monuments
and Buildings Record in Belfast holds
information on all historic monuments and
buildings in Northern Ireland.
English Heritage is responsible for the
maintenance, repair and presentation of 409
historic properties in public ownership or
guardianship, and gives grants for the repair of
ancient monuments and historic buildings in
England. In 2000—01 English Heritage offered
.£6.2 million to conservation areas throughout

England under its Heritage Economic
Regeneration Schemes. Most of its properties
are open to the public, and there were nearly
5.7 million visitors to its staffed properties
alone in 2000—01. Government funding for
English Heritage is £112.3 million in 2001-02.
In Scotland and Wales, Historic Scotland,
which cares for over 330 monuments, and
Cadw, with 130 monuments, perform similar
functions. There were nearly 3 million visitors
to Historic Scotland’s properties in 2000-01
and 1.1 million to Cadw properties in 2000.
An Ancient Monuments Board and an HBC
advise Scottish ministers and similar
arrangements exist in Wales. The DOE in
Northern Ireland has 189 historic monuments
in its care, managed by the EHS (another
1,485 are scheduled).
Local planning authorities have designated
more than 9,000 conservation areas of special
architectural or historic interest in England;
there are 504 in Wales, 602 in Scotland and 58
in Northern Ireland. These areas receive
additional protection through the planning
system, particularly over the proposed
demolition of unlisted buildings.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund
(NHMF) helps towards the cost of acquiring,
maintaining or preserving land, buildings,
objects and collections that are of outstanding
interest and of importance to the national
heritage. In addition, trustees are responsible
for distributing the heritage share of the
proceeds from the National Lottery (see
p. 123). By August 2001 over £1.72 billion
had been awarded from the Heritage Lottery
Fund for more than 7,000 projects.

Many of the royal palaces and all the royal
parks are open to the public; their
maintenance is the responsibility of the
DCMS and Historic Scotland. Historic Royal
Palaces, the Royal Household and the Royal
Parks Agency carry out this function on behalf
of the Secretary of State in England.
Industrial, Transport and Maritime Heritage
As the first country in the world to
industrialise on a large scale, the UK has a
rich industrial heritage, including such sites as
the Ironbridge Gorge, where Abraham Darby
(1677-1717) first smelted iron using coke
instead of charcoal (now a World Heritage
Site—see below).
Several industrial monuments in Scotland
are in the care of the First Minister, including
Bonawe Iron Furnace, the most complete
charcoal-fuelled ironworks surviving in
Britain; the working New Abbey Corn Mill;
and Dallas Dhu Malt Whisky Distillery.
The UK pioneered railways, and has a fine
heritage of railway buildings and structures. A
large number of disused railway lines have
been bought by railway preservation societies,
and there are several railway museums.
Reminders of the UK’s maritime past are
also preserved. Portsmouth is home to HMS
Hiaory (Admiral Nelson’s flagship), HMS
Warrior (the world’s first iron battleship,
launched in 1860), and the remains of King
Henry VIII’s Mary Rose, the world’s only
surviving 16th-century warship.
A voluntary body, the Maritime Trust,
preserves vessels and other maritime items of
historic or technical interest. The Trust’s
vessels include the steam coaster Robin (1890)
and Sir Francis Chichester’s Gipsy Moth IV
(1966). In all, about 400 historic ships are
preserved in the UK, mostly in private
hands.
World Heritage Sites
The World Heritage List was established
under the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation’s
(UNESCO’s) 1972 World Heritage
Convention to identify and secure lasting
protection for sites of outstanding value. The
UK has 20 World Heritage sites (see map at
the front of the book), including three in
Overseas Territories: the town of St George in
Bermuda, Henderson Island and Gough
Island W ildlife Reserve. The UK has drawn
up a list of 25 potential World Heritage sites,
and nomination for World Heritage Status
will be drawn from the sites included in this
list over the next five to ten years. Four sites
nominated in June 2000 were Derwent Valley
Mills in Derbyshire; Saltaire in West
Yorkshire; New Lanark in Central Scotland;
and the Dorset and East Devon Coast.
Pollution Control
Administration
Executive responsibility for pollution control
is divided between local authorities and
central government agencies. The central
government departments make policy,
promote legislation and advise pollution
control authorities on policy implementation.
The Secretary of State for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs has general responsibility for
coordinating the work of the Government on
pollution control in England and for some
regulations in Wales. Similar responsibilities
are exercised in Scotland by the Minister for
Environment and Rural Affairs, in Wales by
the National Assembly Environment
Secretary, and in Northern Ireland by the
DOE. Local authorities are responsible for:
> collection and disposal of domestic
waste;
> keeping the streets clear of litter;
^ controlling air pollution from domestic

The Environment Agency for England and
Wales and the Scottish Environment
Protection Agency (SEPA) {pww.sepa.org.uk)
regulate the major pollution risks to air, water
and land, and waste. In Northern Ireland, the
EHS exercises similar functions.

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
The Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution {vpwrp.rcep.org.uk) is an independent
standing body that advises the Government on
dangers to the environment, and suggests
ways of integrating environmental objectives
with other economic and social objectives in
order to achieve sustainable development. It
has produced 22 reports so far, on a variety of
topics, such as climate change and
environmental standards. It intends to publish
its 23rd report on environmental planning
early in 2002.
Industrial Pollution Control
The Environmental Protection Act 1990
established two pollution control regimes for
the UK: Local Air Pollution Control (EAPC),
which regulates emissions to air; and
Integrated Pollution Control (IPC), which
regulates emissions to land and water, as well
as air.
In England and Wales, EAPC is operated by
local authorities and IPC by the Environment
Agency. In Scotland SEPA operates both IPC
and EAPC. In Northern Ireland IPC is
operated by the Chief Industrial Pollution
Inspector. The Chief Inspector also regulates
some processes subject to an Air Pollution
Control (APC) regime. District councils
regulate the remaining APC processes.
A new Pollution Prevention and Control
(PPC) regime, which implements an EC
Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention
and Control (IPPC), came into force in
England and Wales in August 2000, and in
Scotland in September 2000. PPC succeeds
IPC and part of EAPC and will be fully
established by 2007.
Under both the old and new regimes,
regulators are required to ensure that
pollution from industry is prevented or
reduced through the use of best available
techniques, subject to assessment of costs and
benefits. Both regimes require regulators to
take account of the special characteristics of
each installation and its local environment.
Under PPC, the issuing of integrated
permits will apply to a larger number of
industrial activities. These include, for
example, animal rendering, the food and drink
industry, and intensive livestock installations,
which have not previously been controlled
under this type of regime. Regulators are also
required to take into account a wider range of
environmental impacts (including noise,
energy efficiency and site restoration) when
issuing integrated permits.
Existing installations are being phased into
the new PPC regime on a sectoral basis until
2007. Regulators, with some exceptions,
continue to be responsible for those installations
they currently regulate under IPC and EAPC.
In Scotland, SEPA will continue to regulate all
installations falling within the regime.
A Pollution Inventory for England and
Wales, administered by the Environment
Agency, provides details of emissions to air,
water and land from processes regulated under
IPC and their contributions to national
emission levels. The data are updated annually
and can be found on the Agency’s website
{vpwrp. environment-agency.gov. uk). The
implementation of the IPPC Directive will
increase the number of sites reporting from
2,000 to around 7,000 in 2003. A similar
inventory will be developed to include
information on emissions to air and water
from PPC installations.
Land, Waste, Recycling and Litter
Land Quality
Land quality in the UK is relatively good, but
faces pressure from a range of factors,
including urbanisation, localised erosion,
declining organic content and contamination.
Contaminated land is the legacy of an
industrial age that generated wealth but also
caused much pollution. The Environment
Agency estimates that some 300,000 hectares
of land in Great Britain are contaminated to
some degree. Government policy emphasises
the importance of voluntary action to clean up
contaminated land, and most attempts to clean
up sites occur when they are redeveloped. A
strengthened regulatory regime for dealing
with contaminated land came into force in
England in April 2000, in Scotland in July
2000 and in Wales in July 2001.
In 2001 the former DETR and MAFF
jointly published a draft soil strategy for
England promoting the sustainable use of soil
324
19: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
and raising public awareness of the importance
of soil as part of the environment. The
strategy sets out five actions:
> to ensure that all policies and programmes
which affect soil take into account the
strategy’s aims and objectives;
> to develop a national set of key soil
indicators to help provide assessments of,
for example, the extent of soil lost to
development;
> to review current soil monitoring and
develop a national framework for it;
> to examine existing soil research, and
recommend ways to improve its
coordination; and
> to set a five-year goal for evaluating the
success of the soil strategy.
One key objective includes managing and
protecting the diversity of soil, to ensure that
the right balance of soil types is available to
support England’s ecosystems, landscape and
agriculture. Many of the 400 species identified
in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan depend on
the right type and quality of soil for their
survival. By managing soil correctly, wildlife
can be given greater protection.
Also in 2001, SEPA published its first
report on soil quality. It highlighted the range
of pressures on soil from air pollution,
agriculture and forestry practices, and
industrial contamination.
Waste Management and Disposal
In England and Wales, waste regulation is the
responsibility of the Environment Agency,
while local authorities in England and Wales
are responsible for the collection and disposal
of all household waste and some commercial
waste. In ‘two-tier’ areas, district councils are
responsible for waste collection and county
councils for waste disposal, while in unitary
areas the council has both roles. In Scotland,
local authorities carry out both roles while
waste regulation rests with SEPA. In
Northern Ireland, responsibility for waste
regulation is being transferred from district
councils to the DOE.
The Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as
amended) and the Waste Management
Licensing Regulations 1994 regulate waste
management. A waste management licence is
required by anyone wanting to deposit, recover,
or dispose of waste. Licences are issued by the
Environment Agency in England and Wales
and SEPA in Scotland. A duty of care requires
waste producers, and anyone else with
responsibility for waste, to take all reasonable
steps to keep their waste safe. If they give their
waste to someone else they must be sure that
those people are authorised to take it and can
transport, recycle or dispose of it safely. Failure
to comply with either the licensing
requirements or a duty of care is an offence.
The management of waste arisings is one of
the headline indicators of sustainable
development (see p. 378). In 1999-2000 it is
estimated that 29.3 million tonnes of municipal
waste was produced—90% of which came
from households. Although 11% of municipal
waste was recycled, the majority (81%) was
disposed of in landfill—a method which makes
little practical use of waste.' In the 1999
Budget, a staged increase in landfill tax to
encourage less disposal of waste to landfill and
more recycling was announced, bringing the
standard rate of tax to £15 per tonne by 2004,
with a review thereafter. The landfill tax credit
scheme enables landfill site operators to
channel up to 20% of their landfill tax liability
into environmental bodies for approved
projects, which include reclamation of polluted
land, research and education activities to
promote re-use and recycling, provision of
public parks and amenities, and restoration of
historic buildings.
In May 2000 the Government published
Waste Strategy 2000for England and Wales,
setting out its views on waste and resource
management, and the changes needed to
deliver more sustainable waste management
during the next 20 years. It requires action by
many different organisations—including local
authorities, the waste industry and the
business sector—and by individuals. By 2005
the Government aims to reduce the amount of
industrial and commercial waste disposed of in
landfill sites to 85% of 1998 levels and to
recycle or compost at least 25% of household
waste, increasing to 33% by 2015. Between
1 Some landfill sites produce gas that is used for energy.
325
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
1998-99 and 1999-2000, the household
recycling rate increased from 8.8% to 10.3%.
Scotland has its own waste strategy,
launched in 1999. The strategy’s objectives
include: ensuring that waste is disposed of
without endangering human health and
without harming the environment;
establishing an integrated and adequate
network of waste disposal installations;
encouraging the prevention or reduction of
waste production; and encouraging the
recovery of waste. Current planning policy
advice on waste management in Scotland is
contained in National Planning Policy
Guidance 10: Planning and Waste
Management. The Scottish Executive will be
publishing further advice on this issue in a
Planning Advice Note on waste management
by the end of 2001.
A similar waste management strategy in
Northern Ireland was launched in March 2000.
This strategy was designed as a framework
within which planning and developments will
be shaped to achieve sustainable waste
management and to meet the targets for
diversion away from landfill. The main goals for
the term of the strategy are: by 2010 a reduction
of 25% for biodegradable municipal waste going
to landfill, increasing to 50% by 2013 and
75% by 2020 (all set against 1995 levels).
In May 2001 the DOE published a draft
Planning Policy Statement (PPS11) on
Planning and Waste Management for public
consultation. PPS11 will facilitate changes in
waste management proposed in the waste
management strategy. It contains the DOE’s
planning polices for the development of waste
management facilities and explains the
relationship between the planning system and
the authorities responsible for the regulation
and management of waste.
NAW currently has a budget of £40 million
over the three years 2001—02 to 2003—04 for
waste management programmes. In July 2001
it published a draft waste strategy—Managing
Waste Sustainably—for consultation, and
intends publishing a final version early in 2002.
Under the EC Directive on Packaging and
Packaging Waste, at least 50% of the UK’s
packaging waste must be recovered and at least
25% recycled. Regulations that came into force
in 1998 in Great Britain and in 1999 in
Northern Ireland stipulate, among other things,
that all packaging must be ‘recoverable’ through
at least recycling, incineration with energy
recovery, and composting or biodegradation.
Across the UK, banks are available for the
public to deposit various waste material for
recycling, including bottles, cans, clothes,
paper and plastics. In addition, some local
authorities provide kerbside collection of
recyclable material. In early 2001 the
Northern Ireland DOE launched a new
reference manual for businesses entitled
Recycling Directory of Ireland, aimed at helping
businesses throughout Ireland to recycle
materials discarded as waste.
The Spending Review 2000 (see chapter 23)
provided substantial extra resources for waste
and recycling—£140 million specifically for
local authority waste and recycling in England.
It also provided significant resources for the
Waste and Resources Action Programme
(WRAP) to overcome market barriers to the
recovery and recycling of waste—total funding
of around £30 million is planned during
2000-01 to 2002-03. In Scotland a Strategic
Waste Fund has been established to assist local
authorities in their implementation of Area
Waste Plans. The fund has been allocated
£50.4 million over three years (2001-04).
Scotland has also allocated £2.1 million to
WRAP over the same time period.
Hazardous Waste
There is an extensive framework of national and
EC legislation on the manufacture, distribution,
use and disposal of hazardous chemicals. New
and existing chemicals are subject to notification
and assessment procedures under EC
legislation. Pesticides, biocides and veterinary
medicines are subject to mandatory approval
procedures. International movements of
hazardous waste are controlled by the Basel
Convention on the Control of Transboundary
Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their
Disposal. In December 2000 the UK became
one of the first countries to sign the Basel
Convention Protocol on Liability and
Compensation. Once fully ratified the Protocol
requires any exporter of hazardous waste to be
insured against any damage caused on the
journey to the recycler or disposer of that waste.

In Great Britain, the Special Waste
Regulations 1996 are the centrepiece of
hazardous waste controls. However, since
1996, the Hazardous Waste List that defines
the scope of the EC Hazardous Waste
Directive has been refined and increased in
length, and these changes need to be
implemented in national law by 1 January
2002. Furthermore, a number of new
Directives have been or will be made, which
will have an impact on the sector, notably the
Hazardous Waste Incineration Directive, the
Landfill Directive and the IPC Directive (see
p. 324).
The Government is conducting a review of
the Special Waste Regulations and is
consulting on a number of changes. These
include: resolving inconsistencies between the
EC Hazardous Waste Directive/List and the
Special Waste Regulations; encouraging
reductions in the amount of hazardous waste
produced; providing a better audit trail for
hazardous waste and improving its
management by waste producers and the waste
management industry; reducing the
administrative burden on the waste industry
and the Environment Agency; and shifting the
burden of responsibility onto the producer
rather than the recycler or disposer of the
waste.
Litter and Dog Fouling
It is a criminal offence to leave litter in any
public place in the open air or to dump
rubbish except in designated places. The
maximum fine upon successful prosecution is
j£2,500 for littering or up to £20,000 for fly_
tipping offences. The optional litter fixed
penalty fine, which discharges a person’s
liability to prosecution, is £25.
Local authorities have a duty to keep their
public land free of litter and refuse, including
dog faeces, as far as is practicable. Members
of the public have powers to take action
against authorities which fail to comply with
their responsibilities. In England and Wales
local authorities also have powers to make it
an offence not to clear up after one’s dog
in a public place, and may issue a fixed
penalty fine of £25 under the Dogs (Fouling
of Land) Act 1996. In Scotland it is an
offence to allow a dog to foul in specified
places under the Civic Government (Scotland)
Act 1982.
The Tidy Britain Group, Keep Wales
Tidy, Keep Scotland Beautiful and Tidy
Northern Ireland are the national agencies for
tackling litter, in collaboration with local
authorities and the private sector. In 2001 the
T idy Britain Group launched the National
Local Environmental Quality Survey, whose
purpose is to produce reliable national and
regional estimates of cleanliness and other
environmental standards for England. The
survey will be continuous and will be used to
identify factors affecting standards of
cleansing and environmental maintenance.
Conditions to be monitored include
cleanliness, graffiti, physical obstructions and
observed cleansing operations.
The environment agencies, local
authorities, police and the Tidy Britain Group
have been monitoring the incidence of‘fly
tipping’ (illegal dumping of waste) since the
introduction of the landfill tax, and have
found that it has increased since 1994-95. If
indicted to the Crown Court, the maximum
penalty for fly tipping (and other offences
relating to waste) is up to five years’
imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.
In 2001 the Government proposed a new
code of conduct to reduce litter from
takeaway’ outlets. Existing litter legislation
327
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
would be overhauled, including doubling the
fixed penalty for littering from £25 to £50.
Water
Water Quality
Water quality in England and Wales has
continued to show steady improvement in
recent years as a result of strict regulation by
the Environment Agency and substantial
investment by the water industry.
In the UK, 94% of the population live in
properties connected to a sewer, and the waste
water from the majority of these properties is
given secondary treatment or better. Within
the current round of planning, further
investment will be made in effluent treatment
up to 2005. This is expected to deliver:
> improved compliance with EC Directives
such as those on EC bathing waters and
freshwater fish;
> improved compliance with river quality
objectives; and
> improvements to over 3,800 Combined
Sewer Overflows (CSOs) that are
currently regarded as unsatisfactory due
to their environmental impact.
Scottish ministers published a consultation
paper in June 2001, entitled Rivers, Lochs,
Coasts: the Future for Scotland's Waters, which
contains proposals for a new approach to the
sustainable management of the natural water
environment in Scotland and for
implementing the EC Water Framework
Directive. Scottish ministers plan to introduce
primary legislation in the Scottish Parliament
to implement the Directive in 2002.
In November 2000 the Government
published a draft Water Bill which includes
measures to improve customer protection, by
setting up an independent consumer council;
improvements to water conservation and
drought planning; and improvements to the
water abstraction licensing system in England
and Wales. For details on the water supply
industry and the Drinking Water Inspectorate,
see pp. 504—8.
Discharges to Inland Waters, Coastal Waters
and Groundwaters
In the UK, all discharges to water are
regulated by the appropriate authority. For
England and Wales this is the Environment
Agency, which controls water pollution by
issuing legally binding documents, known as
consents, for all effluent discharges into
controlled waters (groundwaters, inland and
coastal waters). The effluent quality is
monitored against the conditions set within
the consents. The Agency maintains public
registers containing information about water
quality, performance and compliance,
consents, authorisations and monitoring.
Trade effluent discharges to the public sewers
are controlled by the water companies.
In Scotland, controlling water pollution is
the responsibility of SEPA; appeals are dealt
with by the Scottish Executive and trade
effluent discharges to the public sewer are
controlled by the Water Authorities. In
December 1999 SEPA produced the National
Waste Strategy: Scotland, providing a
framework within which Scotland can reduce
the amount of waste it produces and deal with
the waste which has been produced in more
sustainable ways. In Northern Ireland, the EHS
is responsible for controlling water pollution.
From autumn 2001, the EHS proposes to
introduce a cost recovery scheme of application
fees in respect of all discharges to waterways
and underground strata. In addition, from
2002-03 annual charges will be payable by those
industries that discharge effluent to waterways
and underground strata that are subject to
compliance sampling by the EHS.
In 1999, the Environment Agency
responded to 36,623 reports of environmental
pollution in England and Wales; 14,374 were
substantiated as having an impact on the water
environment. In 1999-2000, SEPA reported
2,588 routine water pollution incidents in
Scotland; the DOE reported 1,510 in
Northern Ireland.
Under the 1999 Groundwater Regulations
certain dangerous substances may not be
disposed of to land in case they also pollute
groundwater, and others may only be disposed
of following prior authorisation. The
regulations also give the Environment Agency
(in England and Wales) and SEPA (in
328
19: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Scotland) powers to stop activities which
might cause groundwater pollution.
There are 68 Nitrate Vulnerable Zones
(NVZs) in England and Wales, designated
under the EC Nitrates Directive, covering
8% of the total agricultural land area. There
are a further two zones in Scotland and three
in Northern Ireland. Farmers in NVZs are
required to follow rules known as ‘Action
Programme Measures’, which control the
timing and rate of application of fertilisers and
organic manures. The aim of these measures is
to reduce or prevent the pollution of water
caused by the application and storage of
inorganic fertiliser and manure on farmland.
This will have the effect primarily of
safeguarding drinking water supplies, and
secondarily curtailing wider ecological damage
in the form of eutrophication (excess nitrogen
deposition) of freshwater and saline waters.
Bathing Waters and Coastal Sewage Discharges
Bathing water quality is influenced bv natural
factors such as temperature, salinity and
sunlight, discharges from coastal sewerage
treatment works, the operation of CSOs in wet
weather, and run-off from agricultural land.
Over the past 12 years the overall quality of
UK bathing waters has improved
considerably. In 2000, 94% of UK waters
complied with the mandatory coliform
standards of the EC Bathing Waters Directive,
compared with 91% in 1999 and 66% in 1988.
The Thames and Anglian regions, and
Northern Ireland achieved 100% compliance,
while the North West had the lowest
compliance rate—with 82% of bathing waters
meeting the required standard. Consistent
compliance with the mandatory standards of
the EC Bathing Waters Directive is expected
to increase from 95% in England and Wales in
2000 to 97% by 2005 as a result of the
investment programme to improve water
quality (see p. 507).
In 2001 the Tidy Britain Group
(www.tidybntain.org.uk) gave Seaside Awards
(www.seasideawards.org.uk) to 308 beaches in
the UK for meeting appropriate standards of
water quality and beach management. The
Seaside Award was introduced in 1992 to
provide information about a wide range of
Figure 19.6:

The small number of designated bathing waters in Scotland
(60 in 2000, 23 in 1988 to 1999) and Northern Ireland (16) causes
greater fluctuations in percentage compliance than in England and
Wales (over -471 sites).
A direct comparison cannot be drawn between the results for
2000 and the results since 1988 because of the additional 37 waters
that were identified before the start of the 1999 season.

comply with the EC Bathing Waters Directive

The European Blue Flag Campaign
(www.blueflag.org) is an initiative of the
Foundation of Environmental Education in
Europe and is administered in the UK bv the
Tidy Britain Group. To be considered, a
beach must have attained the guideline
standard of the EC Bathing \\ aters Directive
before being assessed for 24 other criteria
including bathing water quality, beach
cleanliness, dog control, wheelchair access, the
provision of life-saving equipment and other
facilities. In 2001, 55 beaches in the UK were
awarded a ‘Blue Flag’ compared with 57 in
2000. In 1999 a ‘Blue Flag’ for marinas
category was introduced in the UK and in
2001 there were 26 flags flying in harbours.
329
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Marine Environment
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (see
p. 373) is responsible for dealing with spillages
of oil or other hazardous substances from
ships at sea. The various counter-pollution
facilities for which it is responsible include:
remote-sensing surveillance aircraft; aerial and
seaborne spraying equipment; stocks of oil
dispersants; mechanical recovery and cargo
transfer equipment; and specialised beach
cleaning equipment. The Agency has an
Enforcement Unit at its headquarters in
Southampton for apprehending ships making
illegal discharges of oil and other pollutants off
the British coast. The maximum fine for
pollution from ships is £250,000 in cases
heard in magistrates’ courts.
Decisions about which areas of the UK
Continental Shelf should be made available for
petroleum licensing take account of advice
from the JNCC. Where areas are made
available for exploration and development,
special conditions may be imposed on the
licence holders to minimise or avoid any
impact on the marine environment. These
conditions are agreed with the JNCC.
Government policy is not to permit any
deposit of waste in the sea when there is a safe
land-based alternative, unless it can be
demonstrated that disposal at sea is the best
practicable option. Disposal of sewage sludge
at sea ceased at the end of 1998. The only
types of waste that are now routinely
considered for deposit in the sea are dredged
material from ports and harbours, and small
quantities of fish waste.
Air and the Atmosphere
Air Quality
Air quality has improved considerably since
the smogs of the 1950s. The first step towards
these improvements was the introduction of
the Clean Air Act in 1956, which controlled
smoke from industrial and domestic coal
burning, a major source of pollution at the
time. Since then, the large-scale replacement
of coal by natural gas for domestic heating,
tighter regulation and structural changes in
industry, and the introduction of progressively
more stringent standards for vehicle exhaust
emissions, have all led to considerable
improvements in air quality. For example, in
1970, 8.5 million tonnes of carbon monoxide
(CO) and 6.5 million tonnes of sulphur
dioxide (S02) were emitted into the air in the
UK. By 1999 these emissions had fallen to
4.8 million and 1.2 million tonnes respectively.
Industrial processes with the greatest
potential for producing harmful emissions are
subject to regulation under IPC and IPPC (see
p. 324). Processes with a significant but lesser
potential for air pollution require approval, in
England and Wales from local authorities, in
Scotland from SEPA and in Northern Ireland
from the Chief Pollution Inspector or district
council, depending on the process. Local
authorities also control emissions of black smoke
from commercial and industrial premises, and
implement smoke control areas to deal with
emissions from domestic properties.
The Air Quality Strategy for the UK was
launched in 1997, with a revised version
published in January 2000. The Strategy
contains air quality standards and objectives
for eight pollutants of particular concern to
human health: nitrogen dioxide, PM10
(particulate matter that is less than 10
microns), S02, CO, ozone, lead, benzene and
1,3-butadiene. It sets out a programme of
action to reduce air pollution and so reduce
any remaining risks to people’s health and the
natural and built environment.
The UK has an automatic air quality-
monitoring network with sites covering much
of the country, in both urban and rural areas.
In recent years this network has undergone a
rapid expansion, with the number of sites
increasing from 74 at the end of 1996 to 119
by April 2001. The increase was mainly in
urban sites to provide more comprehensive
coverage of air quality in UK cities.
In 2000, in urban areas, air pollution was
recorded as moderate or higher for 16 days on
average per site, compared with 30 days in
1999 and 23 days in 1998. The main causes of
moderate or higher air pollution at urban sites
are ground level ozone arising from chemical
reactions of other pollutants such as nitrogen
oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), PM]0 and S02. Pollution caused by
PM]0 and S02 has fallen steeply since 1993, so

The NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology/Paul Rosier
NERC-the Natural Environment Research Council-was established
in 1965 by Royal Charter. It undertakes research in a wide variety
of environmental sciences, in the UK and overseas,
as well as training scientists. NERC funds research in universities and
operates from a series of research centres located throughout the UK.
Scientists from NERC’s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology have been
assisting the South Atlantic island of St Helena with the control
of unmanaged flax plantations in its Diana Peak National Park.
Removal of the overgrown plants, which use up almost all
the water in the soil, and replacement with endemic plants,
has so far shown that this is likely to result in an increased water supply
in the local streams. A longer-term monitoring programme
has also been established, as the demand for water for agriculture, tourism
and the islanders themselves is likely to increase over the next few years.
DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION OVERSEAS
Farmers in Cameroon and Nigeria
have been improving their
domestication of wild fruit trees,

scientists from the UK and West
Africa and the Department for
International Development’s

The scientists helped them identify
the best individual Bush Mango
and African Plum trees in each
village. They analysed different
characteristics of the fruit,
including size and taste. Having
found the best trees, the scientists
showed the farmers how to take
cuttings and set up a village
nursery in which to produce
cultivars of the trees. The farmers
now plant the trees among their
cocoa and coffee crops. The trees
supply staple foods, enrich the
biodiversity of the village and
provide extra income from selling
surplus fruit.

Following the devastating earthquake
in January 2001 in the state of Gujarat,
India, Oxfam worked with Gujarati
Water Supply and Sanitation Board
to provide emergency water and
sanitation to more than 20,000 people.
In these situations Oxfam offers
expertise and provides specialist
equipment developed over many years.
Oxfam-originally known as The Oxford
Committee for Famine Relief’-was
founded in 1942. After the war the
Committee saw a need for its work to
continue and enlarged its objectives.
During the 1960s it employed a growing
network of overseas Field Directors,
supporting self-help schemes whereby
communities improved their own water
supplies, health provision and farming
practices. The name ‘Oxfam’ was
formally adopted in 1965.
During the 1970s Oxfam decided to
employ local people to run and work on
projects. In 1992 Oxfam celebrated its
50th anniversary and was nominated for
the Nobel Peace Prize. Today Oxfam GB
is part of Oxfam International and
continues to work with communities and
other agencies to bring an end to
poverty and suffering around the world.
Oxfam s work has included the design of
an award-winning special bucket,
to be used in emergency situations. These
buckets, plus hygiene packs, were handed
out by Oxfam staff at Stankovic refugee
camp in Macedonia, set up for Kosovar
refugees in 1999. Refugees were recruited
to help Oxfam staff-several of whom
were refugees themselves-having
previously worked with Oxfam in Kosovo.
Members of a community group meeting with Oxfam Project Officer Kafil Ahmed
in central Bangladesh in 1996, to discuss the progress of their work together.
By raising the level of their homesteads-and that of a piece of land to keep their cattle on-
the families were able to reduce significantly the damage caused by the year’s floods.
A good harvest of wheat and groundnuts, the latter sold for income, offset the effects
of weeks with no work when their farmland was covered by water. This meant that the families
did not need to ask for emergency relief. Similar work continues today.

that ozone is now the principal cause of these
criteria being exceeded in urban areas. In rural
areas, air pollution was recorded as moderate
or higher on 25 days on average per site in
2000 compared with 48 days in 1999. This
variability reflects ozone levels—again, the
main cause of the threshold of the ‘moderate
air pollution’ criterion being exceeded.
Daily Air Quality Bulletins make air
pollution data from the monitoring network
available to the public. These give the
concentrations of the main pollutants,
together with an air pollution forecast. The
information features in television and radio
weather reports, and appears in many national
and local newspapers. Information on the
Internet may be accessed through the UK’s
National Air Quality Archive website (www.
aeat. co. uk/netcen / airqual).
Between 1998 and 2001, DEFRA and
the former DETR contributed around
£1.4 million to research on the health impact
of outdoor pollution.
Vehicle Emissions
Measures to reduce pollution from road
transport are seen as being key to achieving
the objectives set out in the UK air quality
strategy. Progressively tighter standards for
fuels and vehicle emissions mean that urban
road transport emissions of CO, NOx and
particulates are projected to fall by around
70% between 1995 and 2015.
Vehicle emissions standards are governed
by a series of EC Directives enforced in the
UK under the Motor Vehicles Construction
and Use and Type Approval Regulations.
All new petrol-engined passenger cars in
the UK are fitted with catalytic converters,
which typically reduce emissions by over
75%. These measures to reduce vehicle
emissions from new vehicles have been
accompanied by improvements in fuel quality
with, for instance, reductions in components
such as benzene and sulphur, which have an
environmental impact, and the phasing out of
leaded petrol. In the UK from 1 March 2001,
people buying a new car must pay vehicle
excise duty according to the amount of carbon
dioxide (C02) their car produces and the type
of fuel it uses (see also chapter 23).
In 2003 three fuel-celled buses running on
hydrogen will be put into operation in
London, as part of a trial involving nine
cities in Europe and 27 buses. A fuel cell
combines hydrogen with oxygen to
produce electricity, heat and water. As
water vapour is the only emission from
fuel-celled vehicles, they are significantly
cleaner than existing petrol and diesel
vehicles. Following the end of the trials in
2005, Transport for London will give
consideration to using more fuel-celled
buses.
  . 
Compulsory testing of emissions from
vehicles is a key element in the UK’s strategy
for improving air quality. Metered emission
tests and smoke checks feature in the annual
‘MoT’ roadworthiness test. Enforcement
checks carried out at the roadside or at
operators’ premises also include a check for
excessive smoke. The Vehicle Inspectorate
(see p. 364) carried out 85,300 roadside
emissions checks in 2000-01 (on cars, coaches,
goods vehicles, buses and taxis), and 3,482
vehicles failed. Under a trial scheme
introduced in 1997, seven local authorities in
Great Britain (five in England, one in
Scotland and one in Wales) were given powers
to enforce vehicle exhaust emissions standards
by random testing at the roadside, with a
£60 fixed penalty fine for offenders exceeding
prescribed standards. The Government has
completed consultation on proposals to extend
these powers to local authorities in England
and Wales which have designated air quality
management areas. The Scottish Executive is
consulting on extending the powers to other
Scottish local authorities.
Climate Change
Several gases naturally present in the
atmosphere keep the Earth at a temperature
suitable for life by trapping energy from the
sun—the ‘greenhouse’ effect. However,
emissions from human activities are increasing
the atmospheric concentrations of several
important gases, causing global warming and
climate change. Globally the temperature rose
by about 0.6°C during the 20th century. In
331
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
England, four of the five warmest years since
records began in 1659 occurred in the 1990s,
with 1990 and 1999 being the joint warmest
years ever. Research at the Hadley Centre,
part of the Met Office, is focused on
improving climate predictions and
investigating the causes of recent climate
change. Results from its latest climate model
suggest that, with the current levels of
increase in greenhouse gases, the global mean
sea level will rise by between 9 and 88 cm by
2100 and there will be a rise in average global
temperature of up to 6°C over the next 100
years. Emissions of greenhouse gases are one
of the UK Government’s sustainable
development headline indicators (see p. 378).
The most significant greenhouse gas
emitted by the UK is C02, followed by
methane and nitrous oxide (N20). Although
still comparatively low, there has been an
upward trend in emissions of
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which have high
global warming potential. This has been due
to an increase in consumption in response to
the phasing out of ozone-depleting substances
under the Montreal Protocol (see p. 333).
HFCs were virtually unused before 1990, but
their emissions accounted for nearly 3% of
total UK greenhouse gas emissions in 1998
and then fell to about 1% in 1999 in response
to pollution control regulations.
In 1997, the Government established the UK
Climate Impacts Programme to help those likely
to be affected by climate change to assess their
vulnerability, so that they can plan to adapt
accordingly. Several regional and sectoral
impact assessments have been implemented and
many others are under way. Possible impacts of
climate change in the UK include more
droughts in the south and east of England, more
flooding in the north and west of England, more
damage as a result of severe storms, threats to
the coast and low-lying agricultural land from
rising sea levels, and changes in wildlife and
habitats. The extensive flooding to parts of the
country during autumn 2000 illustrated the
UK’s vulnerability to extreme events.
Control of global and regional air pollution
requires international cooperation and action.
The first international action dealing with
climate change dates from the Earth Summit
(see p. 378), at which the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change was adopted,
calling for the stabilisation of greenhouse gas
concentrations in the atmosphere at a level
that would prevent dangerous man-made
interference with the climate system. At the
third Conference of the Parties to the
Framework Convention, held in Kyoto in
1997, developed countries established a
Protocol agreeing legally binding targets to
reduce emissions of the basket of six main
greenhouse gases: C02, methane, N20, HFCs,
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur
hexafluoride. The Protocol committed
developed nations to a 5.2% reduction in
greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by
2008-12 (in 1990 the UK emitted 164 million
tonnes of C02, 21 million tonnes of carbon
equivalent of methane and 18 million tonnes
of carbon equivalent of N20). The European
Union agreed to a collective reduction target
of 8%. At a subsequent meeting in June 1998,
the Member States agreed to share out the
EU’s target to reflect national circumstances.
Individual countries’ targets range from a
reduction of 28% for Luxembourg to a
permitted increase of 27% for Portugal. The
UK is on course to meet its legally binding
target, a reduction of 12.5%. Between 1990
and 1999 emissions, weighted by global
warming potential, fell by 14.5%.
In November 2000 Climate Change: The
UK Programme was published. The
programme sets out how the Government and
the devolved administrations intend to:
> deliver the UK’s Kyoto target;
> meet the legally binding target and move
towards a domestic goal of a 20% cut in
CO2 emissions by the year 2010;
> move the UK towards a more
sustainable, lower carbon economy; and
> ensure that all sectors of the economy and
all parts of the UK play their part.
In July 2001 the UK attended the second
part of the sixth Conference of the Parties to
the Framework Convention on Climate
Change in Bonn to discuss the details of the
Kyoto Protocol, following the break-up of
talks in The Hague in November 2000. The
following issues were agreed:
332
19: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
> commitment of additional funding to
developing countries for climate change-
related activities;
> rules on how to make the Kyoto
provisions workable;
> rules on the extent to which ‘carbon
sinks’ (the temporary storage of carbon in
forests and soils) can be used to meet
Kyoto commitments; and
> tighter targets, for subsequent periods,
for countries that fail to achieve their
emission reductions, along with
compliance action plans to show what
measures they will take to get back on
track.
The integrated package of policies and
measures contained in the programme
includes the climate change levy package (see
below) which includes negotiated agreements
with energy-intensive sectors; extra money for
improving business use of energy; emissions
trading (where companies can buy and trade
reductions in emissions) where emission caps
have been taken; reform of the building
regulations; EK-level voluntary agreements
with manufacturers to increase fuel efficiency
in vehicles; a target to deliver 10% of the
KK s electricity from renewable sources of
energy by 2010; and the promotion of energy
efficiency in the domestic sector. The
programme also looks at what the UK may
need to do to adapt to the effects of climate
change.
In May 2001 the Climate Change Projects
Office was launched. This interdepartmental
initiative—between DEFRA and the
Department of Trade and Industry—provides
advice to companies interested in carrying out
climate change projects that reduce
greenhouse gases.
As part of its contribution to ocean climate
monitoring, the UK has commissioned
research to assess the rapid collapse of the
western Antarctic ice sheet. This is due to be
published in 2001—02. The Government has
also funded an instrument to provide highly
accurate temperature readings for the sea
surface, and delivered it to the European
Space Agency for inclusion on its ENVISAT
satellite, due to be launched in 2001.
Stratospheric Ozone Layer
Stratospheric ozone forms a layer of gas about
10 km to 50 km (6 to 30 miles) above the
Earth’s surface, protecting it from the more
harmful effects of solar radiation. British
scientists first discovered ozone losses over
much of the globe, including a ‘hole’ in the
ozone layer over Antarctica, in 1985. This
‘hole’ has been growing steadily and its edges
now reach beyond the Antarctic continent to
the tip of South America. Similar but less
dramatic thinning of the ozone layer occurs
over the North Pole each year as well. Ozone
depletion is caused by man-made chemicals
containing chlorine or bromine, such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and
halons, which have been used in aerosol
sprays, refrigerators and fire extinguishers.
In an effort to repair this damage, over 170
countries have ratified the Montreal Protocol,
an international treaty for the protection of the
stratospheric ozone layer. This is enforced in
the UK by an EC Regulation. In October 2000
a new EC Regulation was introduced with
tougher restrictions, including controls on the
use of most ozone-depleting substances,
production controls on HCFCs, a ban on a
new list of substances, trade controls and an
export licensing system.
Acid Rain
The pollutant gases S02 (mainly from power
stations), NOx (from road transport and
power stations), and ammonia (NH3) (mainly
from livestock) can be carried over long
distances before being deposited directlv on to
vegetation and soil or being washed out as acid
rain. Acidification results when sensitive
ecosystems are not capable of neutralising the
deposited acidity. In the UK, the ecosystems
that are most sensitive to acidification are
located in the northern and western uplands.
The damaging effects of high levels of acid
deposition on soils, freshwaters and trees, and
on buildings, have been demonstrated by
scientific research.
In 1998 the National Expert Group on
Transboundary Air Pollution was set up to
advise the Government on biological and

The climate change levy came into force
on 1 April 2001. The levy applies to sales
of electricity, coal, natural gas and
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to the non¬
domestic sector (business, commerce,
agriculture and the public sector) within
the UK. It aims to encourage business
energy efficiency and is expected to save at
least 5 million tonnes of carbon emissions a
year by 2010. It is forecast to raise around
£1 billion in 2001-02, which will be
returned, in full, to the non-domestic
sector through a cut in employers’
National Insurance contributions and
provision of £120 million of additional
support for energy efficiency measures in
its first year of operation. By July 2001,

such as chemicals, cement and steel—had

chemical trends in the UK environment and
the prospects for ecosystem recovery as a
result of current and projected transboundary
air pollution. In 2001 it published its draft
report for comment, Transboundary Air
Pollution: Acidification, Eutrophication and
Ground Level Ozone in the UK.
The UK is a party to the UNECE (United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe)
Convention on Long Range Transboundary
Air Pollution, which was set up in 1979 in
response to evidence that acidification of lakes
in Scandinavia was linked to European
emissions of S02. Under the Convention,
there have been a number of Protocols to
reduce emissions of acidifying pollutants. The
latest ‘Gothenburg’ Protocol, signed in
December 1999, tackles the three
environmental problems of acidification,
eutrophication and ground-level ozone
(summer smog). Under the Protocol, the UK
agreed annual emission ceilings of 625
kilotonnes for S02, 1,181 kilotonnes for NOx
and 297 kilotonnes for NH3, to be achieved by
2010. By comparison, UK emissions in 1999
were 1,187 kilotonnes for S02, 1,605
kilotonnes for NOx, and 348 kilotonnes for
NH3. The Protocol also sets a ceiling of 1,200
kilotonnes for VOCs (for example, solvents
used in industry, domestic products, dry
cleaning, fumes at petrol pumps and paints).
VOCs contribute to the formation of ground-
level ozone. In 1999 the UK emitted 1,744
kilotonnes of VOCs.
Running in parallel to the UNECE
Gothenburg Protocol is the EC National
Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD),
provisionally agreed in June 2001, which is
intended to tackle the harmful effects to
human health and the environment from
transboundary air pollution. The NECD sets
ceilings for 2010 for the same four pollutants.
The figures negotiated commit the UK to
further cuts in S02 and NOx emissions,
reducing the ceilings to 585 kilotonnes and
1,167 kilotonnes respectively.
Noise
The Air and Environmental Quality Division
(EAQD) in DEFRA is responsible for the
coordination and development of policies and
the promotion of initiatives to address the
problem of noise in England, with the aim of
improving quality of life. The Air Quality
Team, part of the Environment Group in the
Scottish Executive, has equivalent
responsibility in Scotland. The EAQD also
acts as the UK lead organisation in
negotiations on environmental noise in
Europe.
Local authorities have a duty to inspect
their areas for ‘statutory nuisances’, including
noise nuisance from premises and vehicles,
machinery or equipment in the street. They
must take reasonable steps to investigate
complaints, and serve a noise abatement notice
where it is judged to be a statutory nuisance.
There are specific provisions in law to control
noise from construction and demolition sites,
to control the use of loudspeakers in the
streets and to enable individuals to take
independent action through the courts against
noise nuisance.
The Noise Act 1996 strengthened the law
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on
action that can be taken against noisy
neighbours, and a review of this Act is
currently being undertaken. The Housing Act

1996 gave local authorities new powers to deal
with anti-social behaviour by tenants,
including noise. However, these two Acts do
not apply in Scotland, where action against
noisy neighbours is taken under earlier
legislation. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998
introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders in
England, Scotland and Wales, which can be
used against any person who is causing
harassment, alarm or distress to others.
The Government announced in the rural
White Paper (see p. 356) its intention to
consult on a proposed national ambient noise
strategy. The strategy will include mapping
the main sources and areas of noise to enable
policy to take better account of the
implications of noise sources for rural areas.
The first stage is expected to be completed by
2004, and £\3 million has been allocated for
this.
The National Noise Incidence Survey and
the National Noise Attitude Study are
undertaken by DEFRA to establish a baseline
for, and monitor changes in, the noise climate
in Britain. Both surveys (which have recently
been expanded to cover the whole of the UK)
have now taken place and results are expected
to be published in late 2001.

including noise from new or improved public
works such as roads, railways and airports.
Highway authorities (in Scotland, local road
authorities and the Trunk Roads Authority)
are required to make grants available for the
insulation of homes when they are subject to
specified levels of increased noise caused by
new or improved roads. Equivalent
regulations exist for railways.
Under international agreements, noisier
subsonic jet aircraft are due to be phased out by
March 2002: already over 95% of UK-
registered jets are the quieter ‘Chapter 3’ types.
Various operational restrictions aim to reduce
noise disturbances at the UK’s major airports,
and allowable noise levels over airports, during
both day and night, were reduced in spring
2001. The Department for Transport, Local
Government and the Regions is to carry out a
major study to reassess attitudes to aircraft
noise, and will ensure that both environmental
and aviation interests can contribute to the
oversight of the project.
Radioactivity
Man-made radiation represents about 15% of
the total exposure to ionising radiation of the
UK population; most radiation occurs
naturally (for example from the radon gas
given off by some rock formations). A large
proportion of the exposure to man-made
radiation comes from medical sources, such as
X-rays. This and other man-made radiation is
subject to stringent control. Users of
radioactive materials must be registered by the
Environment Agency in England and Wales,
SEPA in Scotland and the Chief Radiological
Inspector in Northern Ireland. The Health
and Safety Executive (HSE—see p. 163) is
responsible for regulating safety at civil
nuclear installations. The National
Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) advises
on health risks posed by radiation and how to
guard against them.
International Commitments
An EC Directive lays down basic standards for
the protection of the health of workers and the
general public against the dangers arising from
ionising radiation. The provisions of the
Directive are implemented in the UK through
a number of Acts including the Radioactive
Substances Act 1993. The UK is also a
Contracting Party to the International Joint
Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel
Management and on the Safety of Radioactive
Waste Management.
The contracting parties to the Oslo and Paris
Convention on the Protection of the Marine
Environment of the North East Atlantic
(OSPAR), including the UK, agreed at Sintra,
Portugal, in 1998 to reduce radioactive
discharges to the North East Atlantic so that,
by 2020, concentrations of radioactive
substances in the marine environment, are
almost reduced to historic levels.
In June 2000 the Government and the
devolved administrations published a
consultation paper, UK Strategy for Radioactive
Discharges 2001-2020, which outlines how the
UK will meet its Sintra commitments, and in
November consultation began on new statutory
guidance to the Environment Agency on the
regulation of radioactive discharges from
nuclear licensed sites in England. Final versions
are to be published around the end of 2001.
Similar arrangements will apply in other parts
of the UK.
Radioactive Waste Management
All solid radioactive waste in the UK is either
disposed of in suitable facilities on land or safely
stored pending the adoption of a final
management strategy. The disposal of such
waste is regulated by law under the Radioactive
Substances Act 1993. This Act makes the
Environment Agency in England and Wales and
SEPA in Scotland responsible for regulating the
safe use and storage of radioactive materials and
the management of waste.
Radioactive wastes vary widely in nature
and level of activity, and the methods of
management reflect this. Most solid waste—of
low radioactivity—is disposed of at the
shallow disposal facility at Drigg in Cumbria.
Some small quantities of very low-level waste
are disposed of at authorised landfill sites.
Some intermediate-level waste is stored at
nuclear licensed sites, usually those sites
where it is generated, but most of the UK’s
336
19: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
inventory is at Sellafield in Cumbria. High-
level or heat-generating waste is stored in
either raw (liquid) or vitrified (glass-like)
form. Once vitrified it will be stored for at
least 50 years to allow it to cool to a safe
temperature for final management.
Businesses and the
Consumer
A number of initiatives have been introduced
to encourage businesses and consumers to
develop environmentally sound practices.
Envirowise—formally known as the
Environmental Technology Best Practice
Programme—launched in 1994, is a
programme that promotes the use of better
environmental practices that reduce business
costs for industry and commerce. It provides
information and advice on environmental
technologies and techniques by means of
publications, events and a freephone UK
helpline. By the end of 2000, it was helping
business to save £120 million a year. It works
in partnership with the Energy Efficiency Best
Practice Programme (EEBPP) (see p. 493),
which supports energy efficiency measures.
In April 1999 the Government launched
the Sustainable Technologies Initiative (STI), to
build on Envirowise and the EEBPP. The STI
provides financial support for developing new
technologies that will help businesses to be
more efficient in their use of resources, and
produce less waste and pollution.
The Advisory Committee on Business and
the Environment (ACBE) {www.defra.gov.uk/
environment/ache/index.htm) consists of
business leaders appointed by the
Government and serving in a personal
capacity. It enables government and business
to discuss environmental issues and aims to
help the business community to demonstrate
good environmental practice and
management. The ACBE was instrumental in
the establishment of the Carbon Trust in April
2001 (see p. 492).
Environmental Management Systems
In 1996 the International Organisation for
Standardisation (ISO) published ISO 14001
which specifies the requirements for an
environmental management system against
which an organisation may be certified.
ISO 14001 is an international standard which
provides organisations with a tool to help
them control and minimise the impact of their
products, services and activities on the
environment. Certification is achieved only
after an audit of the organisation’s
environmental management system by an
independent ‘certification body’ which has
been accredited by the United Kingdom
Accreditation Service.
The EU Eco-Management and Audit
Scheme (EMAS) is a voluntary registration
scheme which registers organisations from the
public and private sector that have established
an environmental management system
consistent with ISO 14001. The scheme was
launched in April 1995 and revised in 2001.
There are currently 124 organisations
registered for EMAS.
Many leading companies now address
environmentally issues in their annual reports
and over 90 publish separate environmental
performance reports. To encourage the top
350 UK businesses to report publicly on their
major environmental impacts, the
Government has produced guidance to help
companies measure and report on greenhouse
gas emissions, water consumption and waste.
Environmental Labelling
Consumers can need assistance in making
environmentally sound decisions about the
goods they buy, and often rely on the
information given on product labels. To help
them, the Government encourages accurate
and relevant environmental labelling, as part

The Qiieen’s Awards for Enterprise:
Sustainable Development are presented in
recognition of products, technology or
processes developed by British industry
which offer major environmental benefits.
Awards are granted only for products,
technology or processes which have
achieved commercial success. In 2001 there
were 15 awards. Examples include B&Qplc
in Eastleigh (Hampshire), for its QUEST
(QUality, Ethics, SafeTy) programme and
Cooks’ Delight Ltd in Berkhamsted
(Hertfordshire) for its organic food.
The biennial European Environmental

Commission and the United Nations
Environmental Programme, recognise and
reward companies that are making
significant contributions to economic and
social development without detriment to
the environment. In 2000, a UK company,
Entec UK Ltd, was one of four winners
chosen from 80 nominations across
Europe. It won the award for international

mandatory EU energy labelling scheme
provides graded information on product

resulted in the removal of inefficient
appliances from the market.
Environmental Research
Several government departments have
substantial environmental research
programmes. For example, DEFRA’s planned
expenditure on research and development for
2001—02 is £186 million.
The European Wildlife Division within
DEFRA manages a significant research effort,
of which the biggest element in 2000 was the
Countryside Survey 2000, carried out by the
Natural Environment Research Council
Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. This was
the fourth survey of its kind—carried out
every six to eight years—of habitats and
landscape features in Great Britain. However,
it was the first survey to combine both the
latest satellite image analysis techniques with
traditional field survey methods to obtain full
national coverage and detailed information on
vegetation, soils and freshwater. The survey
found, among other things, that in the past ten
years, in Great Britain, there has been a 22%
expansion of fen, marsh and swamp, a halt in
hedgerow destruction, and an increase of 38%
in plant diversity around the edges of fields. It
also found there were declines in the quality of
grassland, downland and heaths and a loss of
some plant species. A similar survey was also
carried out in Northern Ireland by the
University of Ulster on behalf of the EHS.
This survey found that: land use
intensification has resulted in a reduction in
habitat biodiversity; the most widespread
wildlife habitats in Northern Ireland are
species-rich grasslands, wetlands, bogs and
hedges; and improved grassland now covers
42% of the Northern Ireland land area.
Early in 2001, thousands of people across
Britain took part in the fifth in a series of
public attitude surveys commissioned by the
former DETR to investigate people’s
environmental concerns, awareness and
behaviour. This latest study was extended to
cover sustainable development and quality of
life issues such as housing development,
health, jobs, air quality, educational
achievement, wildlife and economic
prosperity.
Most of the government-funded Research
Councils (see pp. 431-6) have a role in
environmental science research, but the
Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC) (www.nerc.ac.uk) takes the lead.
NERC, whose R&D budget for 2001-02 is
about £220 million, funds and carries out
scientific research in the sciences of the
environment. It carries out research into five
environmental and natural resource issues of
priority to the UK: biodiversity;
environmental risks and hazards; global
climate change; natural resource management;
and pollution and waste. In 2000—01, NERC
opened four important research centres, the
Tyndall Centre for Climate Change, based at
the University of East Anglia, the NERC
Centres for Atmospheric Science and Data
338
19: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
Assimilation, mainly based at the University
of Reading, and the Centre for Polar
Observation and Modelling, based at
University College London. Other
organisations that carry out environmental
research include the Met Office (including the
Hadley Centre); the Environment Agency,
whose R&D budget for 2001-02 is around £11
million; the Natural Resources Institute of the
University of Greenwich at Chatham (Kent);
and the Climatic Research Unit at the
University of East Anglia. Around 100 British
universities and colleges run courses on
environmental studies or natural resource
management; many also carry out research. In
addition to research funded directly by SEPA
and the EHS, the Scotland and Northern
Ireland Forum for Environmental Research
also commissions research.
A computer program has been developed
by the Natural History Museum which
should enable experts to find combinations
of areas to represent as many species as
possible and which are therefore most
worth preserving. IVorldmap divides up the
area of interest (anything up to and
including the whole planet) into cells, and
then displays a colour-coded map showing
the relative biodiversity of the cells.
Worldmap can also be used to plot maps
and prioritise areas by their genetic
diversity {ypwxv.nhm.ac.uk/science/
projects/worldmap).

As a result of an increase in the population, changes in household composition
and the demands of a growing economy, there are increasing pressures on land
use in the United Kingdom. Planning policy guidance issued by the
Government aims to create a fair and efficient land use planning system, to
promote sustainable, high-quality development and to respect regional
differences. The Government seeks to encourage the use of‘brownfield’ sites,
particularly in inner cities, to promote urban regeneration—thereby
minimising the use of‘greenfield’ land for housing and other development and
preserving the countryside as far as possible.
LAND USE PLANNING
Planning systems regulate development and
land use and contribute to the Government’s
strategy for promoting a sustainable pattern of
physical development in cities, towns and the
countryside.
Land use planning is the direct
responsibility of local authorities in Great
Britain. The Secretary of State for Transport,
Local Government and the Regions has
responsibility for the operation of the system
in England. In Wales and Scotland control
rests with the National Assembly for Wales
and the Scottish Executive respectively. In
Northern Ireland, the Department of the
Environment functions as the single planning
authority. The Planning Service, an executive
agency within the Department, administers
most planning functions.
The Department for Transport, Local
Government and the Regions (DTLR) issues
national planning policy guidance in England
and provides guidance on the operation of the
planning system at regional and local levels.
Working with the Government Offices (for
the Regions), it ensures that regional planning
guidance, local authorities’ development plans
and decisions on planning applications are
consistent with national policies.
In both Wales and Scotland, operation of
the planning system—including the
determination of most planning applications,
and the preparation of development plans—is
the responsibility of planning authorities. The
National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish
340
20: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Executive regulate and provide guidance on
the operation of planning systems. The
Scottish ministers approve structure plans and
take decisions on planning applications that
raise issues of national importance.
In Northern Ireland, the Planning Service
is responsible for issuing operational planning,
policy and guidance, determining planning
applications and preparing development plans.
The National Land Use Database is a
partnership project between the DTLR,
English Partnerships (see p. 354), the
Improvement and Development Agency
(representing the interests of local
government) and Ordnance Survey. It aims to
establish a complete geographical record of
land use in England, and to assist in a variety
of policy issues, such as identifying previously
de\ eloped land which mav be available for
redevelopment. Urban and rural pilot projects
are seeking to develop methodologies for
providing a land use map based on Ordnance
Survey’s new Digital National Framework.
Planning Policy Guidance
The Government’s policy on the planning
s\ stem is contained in Planning Policy Guidance
(PPG) Note 1 General Policy and Principles,
and taken further in other PPG Notes on
housing, economic development, transport,
retail and town centres, the countryside, green
belts, sports and recreation, minerals and waste,
and other topics—25 in all. PPG notes are
subject to a period of consultation before issue
and revision as necessarv.
Housing
The revised Planning Policy Guidance Note 3
on Housing, providing national planning
guidance on the future of housebuilding and
development in England, was issued in March
2000. The guidance set out proposals for
planning authorities to recycle brownfield
(previously developed) sites and empty
properties in preference to greenfield sites; for
using land more efficiently; for assisting with
the provision of affordable housing in both
rural and urban areas; and for promoting
mixed-use developments which integrate
housing with shops, local services and
transport. The Government’s national target
is that, by 2008, 60% of additional housing in
England should be provided on previously
developed land or by re-using existing
buildings. This is one of the Government’s
’headline’ indicators of sustainable
development (see p. 378).
The DTLR has published three good
practice guides1 in support of PPG3, covering
design, monitoring and urban capacity studies
(all available on its website). The Department
has also consulted on a fourth guide on
managing the release of sites and will publish
this as soon as possible.
Research undertaken on behalf of the
DTLR and published in March 2001
suggested that between 18,000 and 26,500
additional homes in England could be
provided each year through the conversion of
buildings and redevelopment of existing
housing. It found that most of the sites for
rede\ eloping and converting dwellings were
available in town centres, throughout the
south, particularly in Greater London.
Possibilities for re-use were greatest in areas
with a buoyant housing market and a large
supply of older housing.
In 1998, 57% of all new dwellings in
England were provided on previously
developed land. In the same year, 47% of land
changing to residential use was previously
developed, compared with 38% in 1985. In
1996 the percentage of dwellings built on
previously developed land varied from 82% in
London to 35% in the South West.
Draft planning guidance for the provision
of sports and recreational facilities, including
further protection for open spaces, was
published in March 2001.
Transport
New planning policy guidance, in line with
the Government’s policy on transport (see
chapter 21), was issued in March 2001. It is
aimed at integrating planning and transport at
the national, regional and local level so as to
promote more sustainable transport choices

Provision of Housing through the Planning System and Tapping the

THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
(both for people and for moving freight), and
accessibility to jobs, shopping, leisure facilities
and services by public transport, walking and
cycling—thereby reducing the need to travel,
especially by car.
Flooding
Following the extensive floods in parts of
England and Wales in autumn 2000 (see
chapter 1), new planning guidance for
development and flood risk was issued in
July 2001. Nearly 2 million homes and
businesses are located in areas at risk of
flooding. In higher-risk areas, including
the functional flood plains used to hold
excess water in times of flood, only a very
limited amount of development of essential
infrastructure should be permitted. In
lower-risk areas, further development may
be permitted if it can be properly defended
from flooding and does not add to flood
risk. Local planning authorities should
make flood risk information available to
prospective developers and property
owners.
Regional Planning Guidance (England)
Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) provides
the regional framework for local authorities’
preparation of development plans (see p. 343)
and local transport plans (see p. 360-1) in
England. It is produced by the regional
planning bodies in consultation with
Government Offices (for the Regions) and
other regional stakeholders. The Guidance is
tested at a non-statutory public examination
before being issued by the Secretary of State.
It sets out a broad development framework for
each region over a period of 15-20 years, and
identifies the scale and distribution of
provision for new housing and priorities for
the environment, transport, infrastructure,
economic development, agriculture, minerals,
and waste treatment and disposal. New
planning policy guidance (PPG11: Regional
Planning), issued in October 2000, places
greater responsibility on regional planning
bodies working together with local authorities,
Regional Development Agencies (see p. 392),
the Government Offices and the public to
resolve planning issues at the regional level
through the production of draft RPG. By
mid-2001, two RPGs (RPG 9 for the South
East and RPG 6 for East Anglia) had been
issued and most of the remainder are expected
to be issued by the end of the year.
The Greater London Authority Act 1999
introduced new arrangements for planning in
London. The Mayor has responsibility for the
production of a ‘spatial development strategy’
covering development, regeneration and
transport issues in London.
Wo/es and Scotland
Planning guidance in Wales is supplemented
by a series of Technical Advice Notes. The
National Assembly’s draft Planning Policy
Wales document, published in February 2001,
contains proposed guidance on land use
planning across Wales. It includes policies
aimed at keeping development away from
flood risk areas; the possible establishment of
Wales’ first Green Belt areas; and measures to
ensure that the development of land and
buildings creates a more accessible
environment for everyone, including those
with limited mobility. The document includes
guidance on the extension of sustainable use of
previously developed land in urban areas
beyond housing needs alone, and encourages
both rural and farm diversification. It
proposes a change to the current strict control
of all developments in the open countryside so
that development on farm complexes can be
permitted, subject to controls to prevent
adverse environmental and transport effects.
National Planning Policy Guidelines
(NPPGs) provide statements of Scottish
Executive policy on nationally important land
use and other planning matters. Circulars
provide guidance on policy implementation
and Planning Advice Notes provide advice on
good practice. The revised NPPG1, which
sets out policy on the planning system, was
issued in November 2000. NPPG6, published
at the same time, sets out the role of the
planning system in promoting renewable
energy. NPPGs on housing and on business
and industry are being reviewed, with revised
versions expected to be issued in 2002.
342
20: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Green Belts
Green Belts are areas of land that are intended
to be left open and protected from
inappropriate development. They aim to
control the unrestricted sprawl of large built-
up areas, prevent towns from merging with
one another, preserve the heritage of historic
towns and encourage the recycling of derelict
and other urban land, thereby encouraging
urban regeneration. Not all Green Belt land is
countryside. It can cover small villages
comprising a mixture of residential, retail,
industrial and recreational land as well as
fields and forests. Development on Green
Belts is only permitted under exceptional
circumstances.
The first major Green Belt was established
around the fringes of Greater London, under
the London and Home Counties Green Belt
Act 1938. Green Belts have also been
established around Glasgow, Edinburgh,
Aberdeen, Greater Manchester, Merseyside
and the West Midlands, as well as several
smaller towns. In 1997, there were 14 separate
designated Green Belt areas in England,
amounting to 1.65 million hectares, about
13% of the land area.
In Scotland there were six Green Belt areas
totalling 156,000 hectares. Proposals for
Green Belts around St Andrews and
Dunfermline are included in the Fife Council
Structure Plan which is currently under
consideration by Scottish ministers. There are
245,000 hectares of Green Belt in Northern
Ireland; this represents about 18% of the total
land area. There are no Green Belts at present
in Wales, but their creation is under
consideration (see p. 342).
Development Plans
Development plans play an integral role in
shaping land use development in an area, and
provide a framework for consistent decision¬
making. Planning applications are determined
in accordance with relevant development plan
policies unless ‘material considerations’
indicate otherwise. In England, local planning
authorities are required to prepare
development plans in line with the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990. Regulations,
which took effect in 2000, provide a statutory
framework for new procedures designed to
improve the delivery of development plans.
Unless justified by specific local
considerations, plans should not conflict with
either national or regional policies.
In England, outside metropolitan areas and
certain non-metropolitan unitary authority
areas, the development plan comprises:
> structure plans, which are produced by
county councils, some unitary authorities
and National Park authorities (in many
cases on a joint basis). They set out the
key strategic policies and provide a
framework for local plans;
> local plans, which are produced by
district councils, some unitary authorities
and National Park authorities, and
contain more detailed policies to guide
development in a particular local
authority area. The plans may include
proposals for specific sites; and
> minerals and waste local plans, which are
produced by county councils, some
unitary authorities and National Park
authorities (which are usually the
development control authorities for these
issues).
\\ ithin metropolitan areas and in some non¬
metropolitan unitary authorities, the
development plan comprises a single unitary
development plan (UDP). There are two parts
to the UDP: Part I consists of the local
authority’s strategic policies for the
development and use of land in its area, and
forms the framework for the detailed
proposals for the use and development of land
set out in Part II.
All unitary authorities and National Park
authorities in Wales are required to prepare a
UDP for their area. The UDP is the
development plan for each county or borough
council and each National Park, replacing the
structure plan, local plan and any other
existing plan. Three-quarters of the land area
and almost 80% of the population of Wales
are currently covered by area-wide plans. It is
expected that UDPs will be reviewed in full at
least once every five years.
The planning system in Scotland is
governed by the Town and Country Planning
343
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
(Scotland) Act 1997. Development plans are
prepared by councils and consist of structure
and local plans. Councils are also responsible
for making decisions on most applications for
planning permission and for taking action
against development that has not been
approved.
In November 2000 the Scottish Executive
announced that current arrangements for
strategic planning were to be reviewed.
A consultation paper was issued in June 2001
inviting views on a range of issues, including
a proposal for strategic development plans
based on city regions as well as local plans for
each planning authority, and single-tier plans
for other areas. An objective of these changes
would be to guide investment in new
development and infrastructure by identifying
priority areas for physical renewal and
regeneration. The Scottish Executive’s
Planning Audit Unit was set up to work with
planning authorities to establish the underlying
reasons for contrasting development control
performance and to identify best practice in
handling planning applications. The work of
the Unit has recently been broadened to
consider development planning as well as
development control.
In Northern Ireland, the Planning Service
put in place its Development Plan Programme
in 1998. The programme is reviewed annually,
and is designed to meet the development
planning needs of all districts. During
2000—01, a new development plan for
Londonderry was adopted, together with the
Armagh Countryside Proposals, an alteration
to the Armagh Area Plan.
Development Control
Development control is the process for
regulating the development of land. Most
forms of development, such as the
construction of new buildings, alterations of
existing buildings or changes of land use,
require permission from the planning
authority. Applications are dealt with on the
basis of the development plans and other
material considerations, including national and
regional guidance. In 2000-01 district
planning authorities in England received
545,000 applications for permission, 4% more
than in the previous year, and made 504,000
planning decisions, an increase of 5%.
Applications granted averaged 87% overall,
varying between 91% in the North East and
81% in London. Householder developments
accounted for 46% of all decisions in 2000-01,
compared with 11% for new dwellings and
19% for other commercial and industrial
developments. Other decisions involved listed
buildings or conservation areas,
advertisements, or change of use. In 2000-01,
63% of all planning decisions in England were
made within the statutory eight-week period.
The Government’s target is for 80% of
applications to be dealt with within this time
frame. Similar targets apply in Wales and
Scotland, with comparable targets in Northern
Ireland.
In England and Wales, a small number of
planning applications are called in to be
decided by the Secretary of State or National
Assembly for Wales rather than being decided
by the local planning authority. Generally this
only happens where the planning issue is of
national or regional importance. A small
number of cases end up as public inquiries.
If a local authority refuses to grant planning
permission, grants it with conditions attached
or fails to decide an application within eight
weeks, or two months in Scotland, the
applicant has a right of appeal to the Secretary
of State in England, the National Assembly in
Wales and Scottish ministers in Scotland. In
August 2000 a package of revised rules and
guidance was introduced aimed at speeding up
decisions on planning appeals in England.
New arrangements are expected to come into
effect in Wales in 2002. In Northern Ireland,
the applicant has the right of appeal to the
Planning Appeals Commission.
The Planning Inspectorate serves both the
Secretary of State for Transport, Local
Government and the Regions in England and
the National Assembly for Wales on appeals
and other casework on planning, housing, the
environment, highways and related legislation.
It also provides information and guidance to
appellants and other interested parties about
the appeal process. In 2000-01, almost 13,000
planning appeal cases were determined.
In Scotland, the Scottish Executive Inquiry
Reporters Unit is responsible for the
344
20: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
determination of the majority of planning
appeals and organises public local inquiries
into planning proposals and related matters.
In Northern Ireland, major planning
applications can be referred to a public inquiry
in certain circumstances.
The Royal Institute of British Architects
and the Architects Registration Board exercise
control over standards in architectural training
and encourage high standards in the
profession, d he Royal Town Planning
Institute carries out similar functions for the
planning profession.
HOUSING
In England, the Secretary of State for
Transport, Local Government and the
Regions has responsibility for determining
housing policy and supervising the housing
programme. Responsibility for housing policy
in \\ ales, Scotland and Northern Ireland rests
with the National Assembly for Wales, the
Scottish Executive and the Northern Ireland
Executive respectively.
In Great Britain, the Government works
with local authorities (which are responsible
for preparing local housing strategies) and
with the private and voluntary sectors. In
England, the DTLR also works with the
Housing Corporation, which regulates
registered social landlords (RSLs—see
p. 350) and provides financial support to help
them supply affordable housing. In Wales, the
National Assembly has responsibility for the
funding and regulation of RSLs. The main
purpose of Scottish Homes is to help provide
good housing and contribute to the
regeneration of local communities. From
November 2001 it will become Communities
Scotland, an executive agency of the Scottish
Executive. In Northern Ireland, the Housing
Division of the Department for Social
Development is responsible for the
development of housing policy issues
throughout Northern Ireland and for the
legislative framework to support the policy.
The Division funds the Northern Ireland
Housing Executive (NIHE) and the housing
association movement and has regulatorv
powers over both, together with oversight of
the section of the private rented sector which
is controlled by the Rent (Northern Ireland)
Order 1978.
The Government issued a housing policy
statement in December 2000, The Way
Forward for Housing, which set out its strategy
for ensuring that everyone in England has the
opportunity to live in a decent home. The aim
is to deliver greater quality and choice across
the housing market, through improving the
quality of stock in all tenures; improving the
quality of housing services; delivering
affordable housing where it is needed; and
giving people greater choice over where they
live. Specific measures include:
> legislation to strengthen the safety net
provided by local authorities for the
homeless;
^ introduction of a new ‘commonhold’
scheme for the ownership of flats;
^ provision of new affordable housing
where it is needed and in forms which are
more sustainable; and
^ a starter homes initiative for key workers
in areas where both housing costs and
demand are high.
By 2003—04, annual capital investment in
housing will be more than £4 billion,
compared with just over £1.5 billion planned
spending in 1997—98. The Government
intends that all housing provided by local
authorities and RSLs should be of a decent
standard by 2010, with a third of
improvements taking place by 2004.
Better Homes for People in Wales, which sets
out the National Assembly’s proposals for a
national housing strategy for Wales, was
issued for consultation in January 2001. The
proposals included increased emphasis on
tackling problems of homelessness, including
the establishment of a homelessness
commission, continued support for sustainable
home ownership, and an extension of the Care
and Repair service to the whole of Wales,
providing help and advice for elderly and
disabled persons, and assisting with repairs
and improvements.
In Scotland, the Housing (Scotland) Act
2001 lays the basis for a radical re-shaping of
social housing in Scotland, through
strengthened and extended rights for homeless
345
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
people; the establishment of a single tenancy
(the Scottish secure tenancy) for tenants of
both local authorities and RSLs; improved
rights for tenants to be consulted and to
participate; an enhanced strategic housing role
for local authorities; a single regulator of
providers of social housing; and a revised
institutional framework, including the
transformation of Scottish Homes into
Communities Scotland (see p. 345).
The Executive announced the formation of
a Housing Improvement Task Force in
December 2000. This will consider current
arrangements to promote housing
improvement and maintenance in the private
sector and will make recommendations for
change. It will report during 2002.
In Northern Ireland a new housing Bill is
currently being drafted. It is hoped that this
will be placed before the Assembly in 2002.
Housing Stock and Housebuilding
The number of dwellings in Great Britain
increased from almost 2 million at the start of
the 19th century to nearly 25 million at the
start of the 21st century. During the 20th
century the number of households tripled,
partly as a result of decreasing household and
family sizes, and, in the latter part of the
century, partly as a result of the increase in the
numbers of people living on their own. The
number of households in England is projected
to increase from 20.2 million in 1996 to 24.0
million in 2021, with the largest increase being
projected in one-person households from 5.8
million in 1996 to 8.5 million by 2021—71%
of the total increase in the number of
households.
In Scotland, the number of households is
projected to increase by 12% from 2.17
million in 1998 to 2.43 million in 2012. One-
person households accounted for an estimated
32% of households in 1998 and are projected
to increase to 38% by 2012 (234,000 extra
households).
A fifth of dwellings in England were built
before the end of the First World War. In the
early post-Second World War years, councils
undertook most of the housebuilding
construction. In 1999-2000, however, private
sector enterprises in the United Kingdom
were responsible for almost 90% of all
housebuilding completions. RSLs now
dominate building in the social sector. An
estimated 17,300 new RSL homes were built
in England during 2000-01.
To minimise new greenfield development
and encourage urban regeneration, the
Government wishes to see empty homes
brought back into use. The number of vacant
dwellings in England was 763,900 at the start
of 2000-01. Four-fifths of all vacant dwellings
are private housing, although two-thirds of
these have been vacant for 12 months or less.
Some dwellings may be vacant for short
periods between purchase and sale or re-let,
while others may be vacant for a longer period
as they are awaiting demolition or renovation.
Home Ownership
A notable feature of the 20th century was the
increase in owner-occupation. At the
beginning of the century, around 10% of
dwellings in England were owner-occupied,
but by the beginning of the 21st century, this
had increased to over two-thirds (16.7 million)
in Great Britain (see Table 20.1).
The increase in the proportion of dwellings
that are owner-occupied is in part due to a
number of schemes that aim to increase low-
cost home ownership. In England, these
include the Right to Buy, Right to Acquire
and Voluntary Purchase Grants, which offer
tenants in social housing a discount against the
market value of the homes they rent if they are
eligible and choose to buy them. In addition,
funding to support low-cost ownership is
provided through the Housing Corporation
and local authorities, including:
> Conventional Shared Ownership, which
allows people to part buy and part rent
homes developed by RSLs. The scheme
allows people to increase their share of
ownership in their home over time;
> Do-It-Yourself Shared Ownership, which
is funded by local authorities in
partnership with RSLs and enables
people to select a house in the private
market and then part own and part rent
it, with the RSL taking on ownership of
the rented share of the property;

three years to 2003-04 is being provided to
help nurses, teachers, police and other key
workers buy homes in places where the cost of
housing might otherwise price them out of the
community. The first schemes are expected to
be implemented from September 2001, with a
significant proportion of the budget allocated
to assist key workers in London, which has the
highest house prices in the UK (see p. 349).
In Wales, local authorities and housing
associations operate a low-cost home
ownership scheme allowing purchasers to buy
a home for 70% of its value, the balance being
secured as a charge on the property. The
Northern Ireland Co-ownership Housing
Association administers a ‘buy half, rent half’
(shared ownership) scheme. By September
2000 it had helped over 15,000 people become
homeowners, while 91,000 NIHE tenants have
bought their homes.
Mortgage Loans
A feature of home ownership in the UK is the
relatively high proportion of homes purchased
with a mortgage; approximately three-quarters
of all homes are purchased with a mortgage
loan facility. In 2000 loans for home purchase
were obtained mainly through banks (70%) and
building societies (21%), with 9% of loans being
obtained from other lenders. Some companies
offer low-interest loans to their employees.
Lenders differ in the amount they will lend
relative to annual income. In 2000 the ratio of
the average advance to income for all
borrowers was 2.26: 2.30 for first-time buyers
and 2.23 for owner-occupiers moving to
another home. There are several different
types of mortgage. A repayment mortgage
provides for regular monthly repayments so
that, over the life of the mortgage (usually 25
years), the debt, together with interest, is
entirely repaid. With an investment-linked
mortgage, only the interest on the loan is paid
from the beginning, so that the capital sum
borrowed does not decrease. Usually the
borrower makes a long-term investment at the
same time as taking out the mortgage, with the
aim of achieving a capital sum sufficient to
repay the mortgage loan. Different types of
investment can be taken out, including
endowment policies, personal pensions or
ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts).
There are also a number of ways in which
the interest on mortgage loans can be charged:
> variable rate mortgage, where payments
vary according to mortgage rate changes;
> fixed rate, where the interest rate remains
fixed for a period of time, after which it
changes to the current variable rate or to
a new fixed rate;
> discounted rate mortgage, where a discount
on the lender’s standard variable rate of
interest is offered. Some lenders also
offer cashbacks, whereby a specified sum
of money is returned to the borrower on
completion of the mortgage; and
> capped rate mortgage, where the interest
rate cannot rise above a certain level for a
given term, but it can fall.
Other types of mortgages exist for those who
want to be able to vary their mortgage
payments without having to pay extra charges.
There are various types of flexible mortgage,
including current account mortgages and
flexible payment mortgages.
Since the late 1980s there has been a
decrease in the popularity of endowment
348
20: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
policies because of the possibility that
investments may not grow fast enough to
repay the capital borrowed. In 1988, 83% of
new mortgages for house purchase in the
United Kingdom were of this type, but by
2000 this had fallen to 17%. Around 60% of
new mortgages were standard repayment
mortgages in 2000. There has also been an
increase in the take-up of variable-rate loans
(which accounted for 66% of new mortgage
loans in 2000) and a greater willingness to
remortgage in order to take advantage of price
differentials between lenders.
Statutory regulation of mortgages is
expected to begin in summer 2002, when
mortgage lenders will have to be authorised by
the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The
Authority will help consumers make informed
decisions and its proposed regulatory approach
will aim to protect those who subsequently fall
into arrears or face repossession.
In Scotland, the Mortgage Rights
(Scotland) Act 2001 provides for people in
mortgage debt to seek suspension of the
creditor’s right of enforcement if, in the view
of the court, taking the whole circumstances
into consideration, it is reasonable to do so.
The Executive is also considering a mortgage
to rent scheme.
In 2000 the sample average dwelling price in
the United Kingdom was £101,550, although
there were marked regional variations (see
Table 20.4), with buyers in London paying the
most for their property. Dwelling prices also
vary according to type, with detached homes
being the most expensive.
In 1999-2000 average weekly mortgage
payments for owner-occupiers ranged from £35
in Northern Ireland to £82 in London. Average
weekly housing costs for all owner-occupiers
were lowest in Wales and highest in London.
The number of properties that were taken
into possession by mortgage lenders in the
L nited Kingdom in 2000 was the lowest since
1989, at 22,960. This was a 24% decrease on
the previous year; the number of mortgage
accounts with mortgage arrears also fell
significantly, by 29% for mortgages with long¬
term arrears (over 12 months).
Rented Housing
As owner-occupation has increased, the
number of dwellings that are rented has

decreased. Between 1981 and 2000, the
number of rented dwellings in Great Britain
fell by 14% to 7.9 million. The Law
Commission is to undertake a major review
of the law on housing tenure in the social
and private rented housing sectors. It will aim
to produce a less complex framework for
housing law which is better understood by
everyone, particularly landlords and tenants.
Private Rented Sector
In England, households renting privately fell
from 1.9 million in 1981 to 1.6 million in 1989
but rose to 2.1 million in 2000. The recovery
may be linked to the deregulation of rents and
to earlier repossession. In its policy statement,
The Way Forward for Housing, the
Government seeks to encourage good practice
through voluntary accreditation schemes for
landlords, through development of the
National Approved Lettings Scheme and
through a pilot tenancy deposit scheme.
Legislation is proposed in order to raise the
standards of houses in multiple occupation
and to target bad landlords in areas of low
demand. For a diminishing number of
regulated tenancies and a few assured
tenancies, five Rent Assessment Panels in
England (and one each in Scotland and Wales)
determine ‘fair rents’. This occurs when either
the landlord or the tenant objects to the rent
fixed by a rent officer.
Social Housing
Much of the Government’s expenditure on
social housing (rented housing at below
market rent) is provided as subsidies to local
authorities to help pay for the costs of nearly
3.8 million rented council homes in the UK.
More than 2,000 housing associations (most of
them RSLs) provide other social housing. The
RSLs manage and build new homes for rent
and sale with the aid of government grants.
Most social housing in England is provided
by local housing authorities which are
responsible for preparing local housing
strategies. In its housing policy statement, the
Government confirmed its commitment to
bring all social housing up to a decent
standard by 2010, and proposes to improve the
supply of social housing by doubling capital
investment.
Most capital expenditure on housing goes
towards renovating and improving existing
council homes. Finance for the authorities’
housing capital programmes comes partly
from their own resources (mainly from
receipts from sales of assets not used to repay
debt and from contributions from the
authorities’ Housing Revenue Account and
their general fund) and partly from central
government. From 2001-02 some of the
capital resources for local authorities provided
in the 2000 Spending Review are being
channelled through the Housing Revenue
Account subsidy, in the form of a new major
repairs allowance (MRA), which was
introduced in April 2001 to ensure that
authorities have the resources necessary to
maintain their stock. The MRA in England
will be around £1.6 billion in 2001-02,
declining to £1.5 billion in 2002-03 and
£1.4 billion in 2003-04, reflecting an
estimated fall in the number of council homes.
Total housing allocations for 2003-04 are
approximately £2.6 billion (including MRA).
The Government’s housing policy
statement proposes to promote diversity and a
wider range of landlords through stock transfer
and through new investment and ownership
options for council housing. By March 2001
there had been 146 approved large-scale
voluntary transfers from local authorities to
RSLs, involving 582,500 homes and raising
more than £9.2 billion in private finance.
Supporting People, a new programme to be
launched in 2003, will help vulnerable people
live independently in the community by
providing them with a wide range of housing
support.
Local authorities in Wales own around
200,000, or approximately 15%, of all Welsh
homes. By law they have to manage their own
stock efficiently and in consultation with their
tenants, address current housing needs in their
area and plan to meet future needs and
demands. Planned provision for local housing
capital expenditure in 2001-02 is £149 million
for local authorities and £56 million for RSLs.
The Scottish Executive has provided local
authorities with nearly £175 million in capital
350
20: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
allocations for 2001-02. Scottish Homes
(Communities Scotland from November 2001)
plans to invest almost £215 million in
Scotland’s housing to help build 5,360 new
and improved homes, and is seeking to attract
a further £120 million in private sector
investment. The majority of homes—5,100—
will be for rent from RSLs. The remaining
homes will be offered to first-time buyers.
The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001
introduced a new legislative framework for the
provision and management of homes in the
social rented sector. It introduced a common
tenancy for local authority and RSL housing,
with an enhanced package of rights including a
new tenant participatory framework. This is
being supported by £4.5 million to improve
tenant involvement and a further £10 million
to help landlords and tenants implement the
new provisions. Communities Scotland will
regulate local authority landlords and RSLs
and be charged with improving housing
management standards. Four local authorities
(Glasgow, Dumfries and Galloway, Scottish
Borders and Shetland) will be transferring
their stock to new RSLs in 2002. A number of
others are considering such transfers or will be
transferring part of their stock via
regeneration and development partnerships.
In Northern Ireland, the Government’s
contribution to housing of £209 million in
2000—01, supplemented by rental income and
capital receipts, meant that gross resources
available were £602 million. The Northern
Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) is the
landlord of nearly one-third of rented homes
in Northern Ireland—125,000 properties. It is
responsible for assessing the need for, and
arranging for the supply of, social housing.
The NIHE’s gross resources in 2001-02 are
£540 million, with some £61 million for
housing associations. An additional £35
million from private finance will supplement
the social housing new build programme
carried out by the Northern Ireland Co-
ownership Housing Association and 41 other
housing associations.
Improving Existing Housing
Whereas slum clearance and large-scale
redevelopment used to be major features of
housing policy in urban areas in the UK, the
modernisation and conversion of sub-standard
homes is now undertaken wherever
practicable.
Action against unfit homes is based on a
fitness standard covering disrepair; structural
stability; dampness; provision for lighting,
heating and ventilation; water supply;
drainage; WC, wash hand basin and
bath/shower; and facilities for food
preparation. The standard is also used to
guide decisions on the declaration of renewal
areas and in surveying the condition of
housing stock. It is generally recognised that
the standard does not reflect a modern
approach to health and safety hazards in the
home and the Government has been
developing a Housing Health and Safety
Rating System. The system was made
available to local authorities in July 2000 and
consultation on enforcement arrangements
(which would require primary legislation)
began in March 2001.
Almost £50 million has been allocated to
local authorities in Wales via the
Supplementary Credit Approv al to improve
standards of housing quality and safety in
2001-02. The money will fund crime
reduction and security and safety work, as
well as stock condition and housing needs
surveys.
The Scottish Executive is consulting on the
introduction of an Index of Housing Quality
to focus action on improvement to ensure that
homes have an acceptable level of comfort, are
sustainable and safe, and are fit for the
households that live in them. The Index
would not be statutory but implemented
through local housing strategies.
Run-down estates are being improved
through various initiatives, including Housing
Action Trusts, Estate Action and the Single
Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund (see
p. 355). Five Housing Action Trusts are
working to regenerate some of the worst
housing estates in England. The Estate Action
programme helps local authorities transform
unpopular housing estates, but it now only
funds schemes approved before 1995. Outside
London it is expected that approved work will
come to an end by March 2002, and within
London by March 2005. Over the past year,
351
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
DTLR has continued to work with eight
pathfinder authorities and the first contracts
will be signed in 2002. A further 12 schemes
are being developed and a third round of
schemes is in prospect. In all, £760 million of
funding under the Private Finance Initiative
(PFI) (see p. 403) is available for housing
projects in the current spending review
period—up to 2004.
Local authorities in England have powers
to help home owners and tenants to improve
the worst quality housing and to assist with
the regeneration of communities. They were
expected to invest about £280 million in
private housing renewal in 2000-01, providing
repairs for some 75,000 homes. Local
authorities also pay disabled facilities grants so
that disabled people can adapt their homes
and live more independently. A subsidy of
£72 million was provided in 2000-01,
generating £120 million of local authority
investment. This was expected to pay for
adaptations to 25,000 dwellings. The
allocation for 2001-02 is £87 million.
Independent advice and assistance with
repairs, improvements and adaptations is
available to elderly, vulnerable or disabled
people via 284 Home Improvement Agencies
(HIAs) operating in 227 local authority areas
in England and via a Care and Repair service
in Scotland.
In Wales, Estate Partnership was set up to
assist local authorities in tackling the worst
problems on local authority housing estates by
coordinating efforts to raise the quality of the
housing stock, along with social and
environmental improvements. Options
include transferring ownership to the private
sector.
In Scotland, local authorities and Scottish
Homes have powers to provide grants for the
improvement and repair of private sector
housing. Funding of £6.8 million has been
made available by the Scottish Executive to
councils to assist with housing improvement
and repair programmes. In Northern Ireland,
funding is allocated through the house
renovation grants scheme, administered by the
NIHE, on a similar basis to that in England
and Wales. In rural areas, financial assistance
to replace isolated dwellings that cannot be
restored is also on offer.
Registered Social Landlords
Registered social landlords (RSLs) are the
major providers of new subsidised homes for
those in housing need. They own and manage
1.4 million self-contained units in England
and are diverse bodies, ranging from small
almshouses to very large housing associations
managing many thousands of homes. They
also include large-scale voluntary transfer and
local housing companies, set up to own and
manage council houses transferred out of local
authorities.
The Housing Corporation, which regulates
RSLs in England, gives capital grants to
provide homes for rent and for sale under
shared ownership terms. The rental
programme includes building new homes and
the purchase or rehabilitation of existing
dwellings. The home ownership initiatives
help tenants (and other first-time buyers) to
buy homes of their own. The capital comes
from the Approved Development Programme
(ADP). Over the next three years, it is
expected that the ADP will provide around
56,000 affordable homes for rent and 7,700
homes for low-cost ownership. In 2000-01 it
anticipated providing around 22,000 homes
for rent and sale to those in housing need.
Local authorities can also fund RSL
schemes. In 2000-01, RSLs were expected to
provide about 10,000 affordable homes
through the local authority social housing
grant scheme.
Similar arrangements apply in Wales
through the National Assembly’s Housing
Department and currently in Scotland
through Scottish Homes. However, the
situation in Scotland is set to change under
Communities Scotland, the new executive
agency. Scottish local authorities will
eventually be expected to take on
responsibility for development funding.
Although stock transfer remains the only
guaranteed method for securing funding,
development funding could also transfer if the
appropriate checks and balances are in place
and there is local support. The Northern
Ireland Housing Executive has continued to
transfer its new build programme to registered
housing associations. The 2002-03 transfer
programme will involve 102 schemes,
representing 1,395 dwellings.
352
20: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
Rural Housing
The Housing Corporation finances a special
rural programme to build houses in villages
with a population of 3,000 or less. Following
the publication of the Rural White Paper
A Fair Deal for England in November 2000
(see p. 356), the Government announced plans
for the Housing Corporation programme for
small settlements to increase from 800 to 1,100
units in 2002, rising to 1,600 by 2003-04. The
National Assembly for Wales supports the
development of housing in rural areas if it is
regarded as a strategic priority by the local
authority. Under the Homebuy scheme (see
p. 347), RSLs in rural communities will now
be able to take an increased equity share in the
property. In Scotland, the Rural Partnership
for Change Initiative is a pilot scheme,
bringing together Highland Council, Scottish
Homes and local housing providers. It is
designed to tackle rural housing problems and
target resources more effectively. In Northern
Ireland, a revised rural housing policy was
introduced in April 2000. It includes a
programme of around 120 new rural dwellings
a year, improvement or replacement of some
600 rural cottages over the next three to five
years and provision of central heating in some
7,000 rural dwellings within the next three
years.
Homelessness
Local housing authorities in England and
Wales have a statutory obligation to ensure
that suitable accommodation is available for
applicants who are eligible for assistance, have
become homeless through no fault of their
own and who fall within a priority need group.
The priority need groups cover households
which include a dependent child or a pregnant
woman; people who are vulnerable as a result
of old age, mental or physical illness or
disability or other special reason; and people
who are homeless as a result of an emergency.
\\ here these criteria are met, the authority
must ensure that suitable accommodation is
available for at least two years. Subject to a
review of the household’s circumstances, these
arrangements can be extended beyond the
initial two-year period. The local authority
duty is likely to continue until settled
accommodation can be found—in most cases
through the allocation of a secure council
tenancy or an assured tenancy with an RSL.
It is proposed to extend the priority needs
categories, through secondary legislation, to
include certain young people and other
applicants who are vulnerable as a result of
having an institutionalised background or as a
result of fleeing violence. The Homelessness
Bill, introduced in the House of Commons in
June 2001, would strengthen the obligations of
housing authorities towards homeless people
and provide new powers for them to secure
accommodation for non-priority need
applicants where resources permit. Authorities
would be required to adopt a homelessness
strategy, based on a review of homelessness in
their district, at least every five years. The Bill
would also encourage authorities to give
applicants more choice when allocating long¬
term social housing.
In the year ended March 2001, local housing
authorities in England made over 252,000
decisions on applications for housing from
households eligible under the existing
legislation, and accepted around 113,600
households as meeting the conditions. Of these
households, 57% contained dependent
children, and a further 10% included a
pregnant woman. Over three in ten acceptances
arose because parents, relatives or friends
(mostly parents) were no longer able, or willing,
to accommodate the applicants. Almost a
quarter (23%) of acceptances were because of
the breakdown of a relationship with a partner,
of which over two-thirds involved violence.
The types of accommodation used for
households accepted under the legislation
include hostels, women’s refuges, bed and
breakfast accommodation, properties owned by
private landlords, and dwellings owned by the
local authority and let on a non-secure tenancy.
A new unit has been set up within the DTLR
to help local authorities in England reduce the
number of homeless families living in bed and
breakfast accommodation. Some 10,800
households (14% of those accommodated
under the legislation) were in bed and breakfast
accommodation at the end of March 2001.
In Scotland there were 46,000 applications
under the homeless persons legislation during
353
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
1999-2000. At the end of December 2000,
3,900 households were in temporary
accommodation. The Housing (Scotland) Act
2001 includes a duty to ensure that
unintentionally homeless people in priority
need are entitled to permanent
accommodation. There is also a basic package
of rights for non-priority applicants, including
enhanced advice and assistance and access to
temporary accommodation. The new
measures are supported by funding of £21
million over the next three years. A further
£6 million has been made available to reduce
the use of bed and breakfast as temporary
accommodation for the homeless and
£1.1 million has been awarded to voluntary
groups for homelessness projects.
The Government aims to reduce the
number of people sleeping rough in England
to as close to zero as possible, and by at least
two-thirds between 1998 and 2002. The
Rough Sleepers Unit has a budget of almost
£200 million in order to achieve this target.
Almost £80 million of the budget has been
administered by the Housing Corporation for
permanent accommodation. Between June
1998 and June 2001, there was a reduction in
the number of rough sleepers of 62%, to
around 700. In coordination with other
government departments, the Unit has set up
projects to help some of the people who may
be most at risk of rough sleeping—namely
those leaving care, prison, or the armed forces.
Responsibility for rough sleeping initiatives
in Wales and Scotland rests with the National
Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Executive
respectively. Over the next three years £3.5
million is being made available to support
projects whose aim is to reduce the number of
people sleeping rough in Wales. In Scotland,
the Executive has set a target to remove the
need for anyone to have to sleep rough by 2003.
Funding of £42 million is provided though the
Rough Sleepers Initiative to March 2002, after
which time local authorities will assume more
responsibility under Local Outcome
Agreements with the Executive.
REGENERATION
Regeneration policies aim to enhance
economic development and social cohesion
through effective regional action and
integrated local regeneration programmes.
These programmes work through partnership
between the public and private sectors and
involve a substantial contribution from the
latter. They support and complement other
programmes tackling social and economic
decline, and initiatives such as Sure Start (see
p. 129), Health Action Zones (see p. 197), the
Crime Reduction Programme (see p. 216) and
the work of the Cabinet Office Social
Exclusion Unit (see p. 118). Rundown areas in
the UK benefit from European Union
Structural Funds, which assist a variety of
projects in the least prosperous industrial,
urban and rural areas of the European Union.
Over £10 billion of Structural Funds,
including £3 billion covering Objective 1 areas
(see p. 393), have been allocated to the UK for
the period 2000-06.
England
In England, government departments and
public agencies work together to develop
national regeneration policies. The
Government and the nine Regional
Development Agencies (RDAs) set out the
priorities for regeneration and ensure that
programmes aim to enhance and complement
those already in place. RDA regional strategies
provide, after consultation, a regional
framework for economic development and
regeneration. The DTI is the lead sponsor of
the RDAs, with the Government Offices (for
the Regions) responsible for day-to-day RDA
sponsorship issues. In London, the
development agency reports to the Greater
London Authority (see p. 9). The DTI,
DTLR, the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs and the Department
for Education and Skills are jointly
responsible for financing RDAs and for
advising and assisting them on the
implementation of regional strategies. English
Partnerships, sponsored by the DTLR, works
together with central and local government,
the RDAs, local authorities and other public
and private sector partners, and seeks to create
new jobs and investment through sustainable
economic regeneration and development in
the English regions.
354
20: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
The Single Regeneration Budget (SRB),
operated by the RDAs, provides funding for
regeneration schemes and supports a range of
economic, physical and social regeneration
activities. Some 80% of new SRB funding
goes to schemes in the most deprived areas,
and 20% to smaller areas elsewhere, including
rural, coastal and former coalfield areas.
Regeneration partnerships, consisting of key
local organisations including the voluntary
sector, bid for resources from the SRB. There
have been six SRB rounds. Under round six,
announced in summer 2000, 189 schemes
were approved, involving planned expenditure
of around j£1.2 billion over the following
seven years. The successful bids from the first
six rounds of the SRB are expected to involve
expenditure of more than ^23.2 billion over
their lifetime: more than £5.6 billion from the
£9.0 billion from other public service
support and European funds and an estimated
£8.6 billion of private sector investment.
From 2001-02 it is for individual RDAs to
decide on the appropriate level of new SRB
activity in their region and from April 2002
the SRB will become part of their single
budget (see below).
In April 2001, the Government announced
that the European Commission had approved
the five new schemes proposed as partial
replacements for the Partnership Investment
Programme which was managed by English
Partnerships and the RDAs and closed to new
projects in December 1999. The new schemes
are designed to regenerate derelict, disused
and vacant land, including projects which can
be taken forward in partnership with the
private sector. From 2002 the RDAs will be
supporting these schemes from a single budget
worth £1.55 billion in 2002-03 and £1.7
billion in 2003-04, giving them greater
budgetary flexibility and freedom. Under this
new framework, they will be required to
deliver outcome and output targets set
collectively by government departments,
moving away from separate funding streams.
Urban Living
Following recommendations from the Urban
Task Force for improving towns and cities,
the Government published a White Paper on
urban policy, Our Towns and Cities: The
Future Delivering an Urban Renaissance, in
November 2000. It set out the Government s
plans for towns, cities and suburbs, with the
aim of encouraging people to return to live in
town and city centres, thereby easing the
pressure on the countryside and helping to
protect it from development. Among the
measures in the White Paper are plans for:
a £1 billion series of taxation measures to
increase investment in urban areas,
including plans to exempt from stamp
duty all property transactions in
disadvantaged communities, higher tax
credits for cleaning up contaminated land,
100% capital allowances for creating flats
(suitable for letting) above shops, and a
package of reforms to value added tax to
encourage additional conversions of
properties for residential use;
> new planning policy guidance putting
urban renaissance at the centre of the
planning system, and a drive to
implement planning policy on housing;
> more L rban Regeneration Companies
(see below) and more Millennium
Communities—such as the ones in
Greenwich (London), Allerton Bywater
(Leeds), the Cardroom Estate in
Manchester and at Nar Ouse in King’s
Lynn;
> the promotion of a culture of innovation
and enterprise through services such as
the Small Business Service and
programmes such as the Phoenix Fund
(see chapter 22);
> a Neighbourhood Renewal Fund of £900
million over the three years to 2004 in the
88 most deprived local authority areas;
and
a comprehensive programme to improve
the quality of parks, play areas and open
spaces.
Urban regeneration companies (URCs) have
been set up in Liverpool, Manchester,
Sheffield and Corby. They are new
independent companies established bv the
relevant local authority, RDA, English
Partnerships (if appropriate), the private sector
and other key partners. They coordinate
355
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
approaches to problems and opportunities in
their target areas, with the aim of engaging the
private sector in an agreed physical and
economic regeneration strategy. The Urban
White Paper announced a rolling programme to
create around 12 new companies over the next
three years, with a limited number in each
region.
In April 2001 the Government announced
funding of £30 million over the next three
years for Home Zones, which aim to improve
the quality of life in residential streets. The
zones are intended to enable local authorities
to design streets as places for people and not
just for traffic.
Rural Regeneration
Although most problems arising from
dereliction and unemployment occur in urban
areas, some rural areas have also been affected
as employment in traditional sectors, such as
mining and rurally based defence
establishments, has declined. Low wages and a
decline in local public transport and other
services have caused problems for some rural
residents.
The RDAs outside London are responsible
for rural regeneration. The Countryside
Agency (see p. 313) promotes and advises on
conserving and enhancing the countryside,
people’s access to the countryside for
recreation, and the economic and social
development of England’s rural areas. It also
administers a number of grants designed to
help meet village needs for transport, shops or
other services.
Wales
Parts of Wales have been adversely affected by
the decline in traditional industries, especially
coal and steel.
Wales will receive up to £1.4 billion from
the European Union to fund a variety of
programmes until 2006. These include
Objective 1 Funds (see p. 393) for West Wales
and the Valleys. The programmes will be
aimed at developing a stronger, more
sustainable economy (especially with an
expanded small and medium-sized company
In November 2000 the former DETR
published an action plan to revitalise
England’s rural areas. The plan, set out in a
White Paper entitled A Fair Deal for Rural
England, includes measures to:
> deliver high-quality health, education,
transport and housing services, backed
up with new standards;
> tackle the causes of social exclusion by
boosting the provision of jobs and
affordable housing;
> support the rural economy with new
measures to encourage diversification,
attract new businesses and support
existing shops and pubs;
> provide better protection for the
countryside; and
> give more local choice with new
powers for parish and town councils.
The implementation plan and timetable for
the measures and initiatives in the White
Paper were published in March 2001. Some
of the key elements of the implementation
package include:
> £37 million of government funding
over three years to help create a £100
million regeneration programme, with
partnership funds, for around 100
market towns;
> legislation to extend 50% mandatory
rate relief to all village food shops, new
small-scale, non-agricultural
enterprises on farms and sole village
pubs and petrol stations;
> new Countryside Agency grant
schemes worth £35 million to support
village shops and services; and
> £62 million to improve rural bus
services and encourage greater bus use.
sector), better infrastructure, a more highly
skilled workforce, and the regeneration of
urban and rural communities.
The new Local Regeneration Fund (LRF)
was established in 2000-01 by merging budgets
available under the Welsh Capital Challenge
and Local Authority Rural Scheme, which will
356
20: PLANNING, HOUSING AND REGENERATION
be phased out. The National Assembly for
Wales has allocated £36.5 million to LRF in
2001-02. The purpose of the Fund is to
support sustainable regeneration or
development within, or benefiting, the most
deprived areas, including the Objective 1 area
in West Wales and the Valleys. Some of the
money is used to match funding provided by
European structural funds.
The Welsh Development Agency
contributes to economic regeneration across
Wales. Its programmes include physical and
environmental regeneration activities, such as
land reclamation and urban, rural and
environmental improvements; activities to
provide site development works to assist with
business infrastructure; and financial support
for community initiatives such as the Market
Towns Initiative and the Small Towns and
Villages programmes.
The National Assembly’s most recent
annual report on social inclusion (published in
March 2001) highlights the steps being taken
to combat poverty and social disadvantage.
Communities First is an area-based
regeneration strategy that will benefit 88
deprived communities in 119 electoral wards.
Sixteen communities have been awarded
funding under the People in Communities
programme. Both emphasise the involvement
of local people in decision-making.
Scotland
During 2000 the Scottish Executive set out its
strategy for tackling poverty and injustice in
the publication Social justice . . . a Scotland
where everyone matters. Supporting
communities is central to the strategy. The
Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP)
programme, established in 1999, involves 48
local partnerships tackling the problems that
disadvantaged groups and communities face
across rural and urban Scotland. The SIPs are
multi-agency partnerships, consisting of all
relevant local public agencies, the voluntary
and private sectors, and representatives from
the community. The SIPs are supported over
three years from 2001-02 by £169 million
from the Social Inclusion Partnership Fund.
Funding is also provided through the
\\ orking for Communities and Empowering
Communities programmes. These
programmes are testing and developing new
models for delivering integrated local services
in deprived areas, and for developing the
capacity of excluded communities to influence
decisions about their lives. Future directions
for regeneration and community
empowerment work in Scotland will be set out
in a Neighbourhood Renewal Statement due
to be produced before the end of 2001.
The Better Neighbourhood Services Fund
(BNSF) is a new programme designed to
advance the Executive’s social justice objectives
and narrow the gap between the poor and better
off. Over the next three years £90 million has
been allocated to 12 local authorities for pilot
programmes to improve the delivery of services
in deprived neighbourhoods and encourage
greater community involvement. Local
Outcome Agreements will be used to link
national and local policy priorities.
Local Enterprise Companies working as
part of the Highlands and Islands Enterprise
Network (in the north of Scotland) and the
Scottish Enterprise Network (in the south),
have a range of functions and powers to
engage in regeneration, and to encourage
business and employment in their areas.
Among recent regeneration projects in
Scotland is Pacific Quay in Glasgow—a
development comprising three elements: a
business park, the Glasgow Science Centre
and the Digital Media Campus, which will
house a new headquarters and production
facility for BBC Scotland.
Communities Scotland (see p. 345) will also
have a responsibility for regeneration. It will
work closely with relevant partners, and
particularly local authorities, which have a
lead role in community planning in Scotland.
Northern Ireland
The Department for Social Development’s
(DSD’s) Urban Generation and Community
Development Group is responsible for the
establishment of policy and strategy;
implementation of programmes targeting
resources to areas of social need; addressing
the social, economic and physical regeneration
of cities, towns and villages in Northern
Ireland; and promoting partnership between
357
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
the Government and the voluntary and
community sector. It also has responsibility
for the Laganside Corporation, a non-
departmental public body managing the
regeneration of Belfast’s riverside and
waterfront areas. The DSD administers the
Urban Development Grant (UDG) scheme,
a discretionary grant used to promote job
creation, inward investment and
environmental improvement in priority areas
in both Belfast and Londonderry by
stimulating the development of vacant,
derelict or underused land or buildings. In
Belfast, priority is currently given to schemes
within the Making Belfast Work areas, while
UDG in Londonderry is targeted at the City
Centre and Waterside Business District.
Underused or derelict land and buildings in
selected areas of towns and cities are identified
for planning and regeneration by the DSD via
Comprehensive Development Schemes.
The Londonderry Regeneration Initiative
has an annual budget of £2.7 million and from
its launch in 1988 to the end of 2000-01
provided almost £33.5 million for a variety of
projects in the most deprived and
disadvantaged areas. The Making Belfast Work
Initiative has an annual budget of around £13.7
million and has provided £248 million for a
variety of projects over the same period.
The International Fund for Ireland’s Urban
Development Programme is designed to assist
in the regeneration of towns and villages by
providing financial assistance for the renovation
of derelict and run-down commercial
properties. Priority will be given to projects
situated in the most disadvantaged areas and to
those which are judged to have the potential to
make the greatest impact. Grants of up to
£100,000 are available. Assistance is also
available, through the Community Property
Development Scheme, to cross-community
groups for the regeneration of key properties in
the most run-down non-disadvantaged areas.
Some £5 million has been committed by the
International Fund for Ireland to nearly 20
projects.
The Community Regeneration and
Improvement Special Programme (CRISP) is
aimed at assisting communities in the
regeneration of the most disadvantaged towns
and villages with a population of less than
10,000. The programme was introduced in
1990 and 70 community-led projects have
been supported, involving financial assistance
of £55 million.

Responsibility for transport policy in the UK is divided between Government
in W hitehall and the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The Transport Act 2000, implemented in England and Wales
m 2001, established the Strategic Rail Authority, required local authorities to
offer concessionary fares to pensioners and certain groups of disabled people
using public transport, and provided for the establishment of a Public-Private
Partnership for air traffic services. In 2001 detailed funding plans were
announced for the first five years of the Government’s ten-year plan, which
aims to modernise the UK transport system.
TRAVEL TRENDS
Passenger travel was 721 billion passenger-
kilometres in Great Britain in 2000 (see Table
21.1). Travel by car, van and taxi has more
than doubled in the past 30 years, but recently
the rate of growth has slowed, and car traffic
in 2000 was virtually the same as in 1999.
Tra\ el by bus has shown a steady decline since
the 1950s, but usage is now increasing, with
the number of bus passenger journeys up
0.5% in the year to 31 March 2001. Rail travel
rose by around 2.0% in 2000-01, and travel on
the various light rail/supertram systems is also
growing. Air traffic, particularly international
travel, has grown substantially.
Travel by car accounted for 85% of
passenger mileage in Great Britain in 2000.
Over the last ten years, the proportion of
households with regular use of one car has
remained relatively constant, at 45%, but
there has been an increase in households with
two cars (from 19% in 1990 to 22% in 2000),
while in 2000, 5% of households had regular
use of three or more cars. Most freight is
carried by road, which accounts for 81%
of goods by tonnage and 65% in terms of
tonne-kilometres.1
At the end of 2000 there were 28.9 million
vehicles licensed for use on the roads of Great
Britain, according to the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency, which maintains official
records of drivers and vehicles in Great
Britain. There were 23.9 million cars (2.4
million company-owned); 2.5 million vans and
light goods vehicles; 418,000 goods vehicles
over 3.5 tonnes; 825,000 motorcycles, scooters
and mopeds; and 86,000 public transport
vehicles with nine or more seats.

I kilometre.

TRANSPORT POLICY
In July 2000 the Government issued its ten-
year transport spending plan, which envisages
public spending and private investment in
transport of some £180 billion: £60 billion for
railways in Great Britain, £59 billion for local
transport in England, £25 billion for transport
in London, £21 billion for strategic roads in
England and £15 billion on future projects
and other transport areas. The total includes
capital investment of £121 billion, which the
Government intends to be implemented
through partnerships between the private and
public sectors.
Many of the provisions in the Transport Act
2000 are closely linked to the targets of the
ten-year plan. The Act provides for the
establishment of the Strategic Rail Authority
(see p. 368) and a Public-Private Partnership
(PPP) to deliver air traffic services provided
by National Air Traffic Services Ltd (NATS);
requires local authorities to prepare five-year
plans to improve their local transport facilities;
enables local authorities outside London to
introduce road charges and workplace
parking levies to help tackle congestion; and
gives local authorities new powers to improve
local bus services and requires them to offer
concessionary fares for all pensioners and
certain groups of disabled people.
The powers allocated to local authorities
under the Act cover England and Wales only.
Local Transport Plans (LTPs) have been
drawn up by local transport authorities in
England (outside London), and by Welsh
authorities; in Scotland all local authorities
and Strathclyde Passenger Transport have
produced local transport strategies. Capital
allocations to English authorities were made in
the LTP capital settlement for 2001-02 (see
box). The London Mayor and Assembly are
responsible for delivering integrated transport
for the city, and a draft transport strategy was
released by the Mayor in January 2001 for
consultation. London authorities produce
Local Implementation Plans in line with the
Mayor’s transport strategy. Key priorities
include reducing congestion, increasing
investment in the Underground system,
improving bus and national rail systems in
London and expanding the overall capacity of
the rail and bus networks. Transport for
London, which took up its powers in July
2000, will be responsible for delivering the
strategy.
The Government has announced its
intention to draft a Safety Bill aimed at
making travel by rail, air, sea and on the roads
safer, and the Bill will include proposals
relating to health and safety at work (see
p. 162). Elements of the Safety Bill would:

21: TRANSPORT
Local Transport Capital Settlement
The settlement, covering the first five
years of the ten-year transport plan,
provided .£8.4 billion for authorities to
implement their LTPs: up to £4.4 billion
on integrated and public transport, and up
to £4 billion on new and existing roads.
Major schemes given full or provisional
approval include 31 major public transport
schemes, such as two new light rail lines,
guided bus schemes, new public transport
interchanges and 39 road improvement
schemes, including urban relief roads and
14 by-passes.
Authorities have discretion over the
exact package of smaller schemes (which
have a gross cost of less than £5 million)
that they deliver using LTP funding.
However, over the five-year period, LTPs
are expected to deliver up to 4,500 km of
faster, more reliable bus routes and up to
8,200 local safety measures, including 20
mph (32 km/h) zones and traffic calming.

recommendations which came from Lord
Cullen’s wide-ranging review of rail
safety;

The Traveline national public transport
information system is to be developed into the
more comprehensive Transport Direct service
by 2003. This system will allow people to
compare prices and routes, and will cover all
types of transport within the UK.
Wales
The National Assembly for Wales continues
to develop an integrated approach to transport
planning, and a £300 million package was
announced in January 2001 to support local
authority transport delivery over the next five
years. Measures included:
> indicative dates for the implementation
of a number of road improvement
schemes;
> rail infrastructure improvements,
including reopening the Vale of
Glamorgan line to passenger services;
> £23.2 million for support for integrated
transport schemes; and
> extra support for Safe Route to Schools
initiatives, which aim to improve
children s safety and reduce reliance on
the car for school trips.
In addition, all \\ elsh local authorities
published local transport plans during
summer 2000, and the Bus Subsidy Grant
and the Welsh Rural Transport Grant were
combined under the control of local
authorities to promote integration.
The Assembly plans to publish its
Transport Framework for Wales in autumn
2001. This will provide the basis for a
coordinated approach to transport for local
authorities, transport operators and the
Assembly when drawing up investment
programmes. The trunk road programme is to
be published by the end of 2001, and is
expected to include schemes intended to
improve accessibility between north and
south Wales.
Scotland
The Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 provides
local authorities with additional powers to
enable them to develop an integrated transport
system at the local level. The Act contains
many provisions similar to those in the
Transport Act for England and Wales,
including the establishment of statutory bus
‘quality partnerships’ and ‘quality contracts’
between local authorities and bus operators.
Expenditure on transport of £986 million is
planned in 2001-02, rising to £1,029 million
in 2002-03. Priorities include: creating an
integrated transport system; encouraging the
use of public transport; tackling congestion;
moving freight off the roads onto both the ’
361
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
railways and waterways, with a target of 21
million lorry miles taken off Scottish roads by
March 2002; and maintaining affordable
lifeline services to islands and other remote
areas. In April 2001 the Scottish Executive
acquired responsibility from the former
Department of the Environment, Transport
and the Regions (DETR) for funding rail
services in Scotland.
The Executive is preparing a plan which
will set out its transport policy and investment
priorities.
Northern Ireland
The Department for Regional Development is
preparing a Regional Development Strategy.
One aim of the strategy is to develop a
modern, sustainable and safe transport system
based on an integrated approach. An
important element is the development of five
key transport corridors: strategic long-distance
routes connecting a number of towns to the
major regional ‘gateways’, including links to
transport corridors within the Belfast
metropolitan area.
Within this context, the Department for
Regional Development is preparing a Regional
Transport Strategy (RTS), taking into
account the ten-year plan and Strategy 2010
(which sets out a range of recommendations
and targets for the Northern Ireland
economy). The draft RTS, which aims to
develop a modern, sustainable, safe transport
system, identifies current problems in three
key areas:
> the key transport corridors, where
Northern Ireland has a low proportion of
motorway carriageway compared with
the rest of the UK;
> urban areas, for example the lack of a rail
link to Belfast international airport; and
> rural areas, for example the age of the
rural bus fleet and underfunding of
bus services compared with the rest of
the UK.
ROADS
The total road network in Great Britain in
2000 was 391,700 kilometres (243,400 miles).

motor vehicles and large buses and coaches.
Source: Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions
Trunk motorways2 accounted for 3,422
kilometres (2,126 miles) of this, less than 1%,
and other trunk roads for over 11,740
kilometres (7,300 miles), or 3.0%. However,
motorways carry 20% of all traffic, and trunk
roads another 16%. Combined, they carry
over half of all goods vehicle traffic in Great
Britain. In Northern Ireland the road network
is over 24,960 kilometres (15,510 miles), of
which 226 kilometres (165 miles) are
motorways.
Motor traffic in Great Britain increased only
very slightly in 2000, to an estimated 467.7
billion vehicle-kilometres (see Table 21.3).
Traffic on motorways was up by 1%, to 94.1
billion vehicle-kilometres.
Road Programme
The Highways Agency—an executive agency
of the Department for Transport, Local
Government and the Regions (DTLR)—is
responsible for maintaining, operating and
improving the national road network in
England, except for London, where

responsibility has been transferred to the
Greater London Authority. In Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland responsibility
for the motorway and trunk road network
rests with the devolved administrations. The
Roads Service, an agency within the NI
Department for Regional Development,
maintains and improves the road network on
behalf of the Assembly.
The Highways Agency is responsible for
6,065 miles (9,760 km) of motorway and trunk
roads in England. The Agency and the
relevant local authorities are in consultation
over the transfer of some 310 miles (500 km)
of this network to local authorities. Its budget
is £1.77 billion in 2002-03, when it expects to
spend £759 million on major network
improvements, ,£668 million on motorway and
trunk road maintenance and £252 million on
making better use of the network. In addition,
local authorities have a budget of nearly £2.1
billion for maintaining roads. In Scotland,
the motorway and trunk road programme
for 2001-04 will cost £680 million.
The Government’s ten-year plan envisages
public investment of £21.3 billion in the
Highways Agency’s strategic road network,
together with £2.5 billion of private capital
investment. Investment will tackle the main
congestion pressures. Extra capacity will be
provided through 30 trunk road by-passes,
80 major schemes to ease bottlenecks at
junctions, and the widening of some 5% of the
strategic road network and associated junction
improvements. For example, one major
scheme is to widen to 12 lanes sections of the
M25 near Heathrow Airport, the most heavily
used sections of the UK motorway network.
The Local Transport Plans settlement also
contained new money to fund capital
maintenance on local highways, in addition to
funding for major new maintenance schemes,
such as for the Central Motorway East in
Newcastle upon Tyne.
Private sector finance is playing a role
through ‘Design, Build, Finance and
Operate’ (DBFO) contracts, under which the
private sector provides the funding for
construction and maintenance, and receives
government payments linked to usage and
performance.
Standards
Minimum ages for driving are:
> 16 for riders of mopeds, drivers of small
tractors, and disabled people receiving a
mobility allowance;
17 for drivers of cars and other passenger
vehicles with nine or fewer seats
(including that of the driver), small
motorcycles, and goods vehicles not over
3.5 tonnes maximum authorised mass
(MAM);
> 18 for goods vehicles weighing over 3.5,
but not over 7.5, tonnes MAM; and
> 21 for passenger-carrying vehicles with
more than nine seats, goods vehicles over
7.5 tonnes MAM and large motorcycles.
New drivers of motor vehicles must pass
both the computer-based touch screen theory
test and the practical driving test in order to
acquire a full driving licence. In 2000, just
over 1.1 million driving tests were conducted
in Great Britain by the Driving Standards
Agency (DSA), the national driver testing
authority. The average pass rate was nearly
46%. About 32 million people hold a full
363
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
driving licence for a car. The DSA also
supervises professional driving instructors, the
compulsory basic training scheme for learner
motorcyclists and a voluntary register for
instructors of drivers of large goods vehicles.
Before most new cars and goods vehicles are
allowed on the roads, they must meet safety
and environmental requirements, based
primarily on standards drawn up by the
European Union (EU). The Vehicle
Certification Agency is responsible for
ensuring these requirements are met through a
process known as ‘type approval’.
The Vehicle Inspectorate is responsible for
ensuring the roadworthiness of vehicles,
through their annual testing. It also uses
roadside and other enforcement checks to
ensure that drivers and vehicle operators
comply with legislation. In Northern Ireland
the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency is
responsible for testing drivers and vehicles.
Road Safety
Since 1981-85 there has been a significant
decline in road deaths and serious casualties in
Great Britain, by 39% and 49% respectively,
while road traffic has risen by 59%. In 2000
there were 233,000 road accidents involving
personal injury in Great Britain, 1% fewer
than in 1999, of which 35,600 involved death
or serious injury. There were 3,409 deaths in
road accidents, 38,200 serious injuries and
278,700 slight injuries.
The Government has set a target of
reducing the number of people killed or
seriously injured on the roads of Great Britain
by 40% by 2010, compared with the average
levels for 1994-98. A higher target reduction,
of 50%, has been set for deaths and serious
injuries to children. Measures to be taken
include:
> creating more 20 mph (32 km/h) zones
around schools and in residential areas;
> enforcing road traffic law more
effectively, with greater use of speed
cameras;
> improving driver training;
> the mandatory fitting of seat belts in new
coaches and minibuses from October 2001;
Motorcycling
There has been a resurgence of interest in
motorcycling in the UK over the last few
years, after a long period of decline. The
number of licensed motorcycles has risen
from a low of 594,000 in 1995 to around
825,000 in 2000, the highest figure since
1990. Motorcycles have a role to play in an
integrated transport policy, and mopeds
and small-engined motorcycles can offer
environmental benefits. An Advisory
Group on Motorcycling has been set up,
bringing together all interested parties to
discuss issues of concern to motorcycle
users. In its first interim report, the Group
requested that local authorities consider
specific measures to assist motorcyclists,
such as better parking and interchange
facilities, and appropriate road
maintenance.
> setting appropriate speed limits for local
conditions;
> supporting the development of safer car
design; and
> improving road safety education.
The Safety Bill (see p. 360) contains
measures that set a framework for the delivery
of these targets. In addition, local authorities
in England and Wales are now required to
include specific road safety measures as part of
their Local Transport Plans, while local
authorities in Scotland are expected to set out
in their local transport strategies their plans
for reducing road casualties.
Congestion
About 7% of the Highways Agency’s network
experiences regular heavy peak and occasional
non-peak congestion, and a further 13% sees
heavy congestion on at least half the days in
the year. Traffic congestion also occurs in
many towns and cities in the main morning
and evening peak periods and for much of the
day in central London. Traffic management
schemes aim to reduce congestion through
measures such as traffic-free shopping
364
21: TRANSPORT
precincts, bus lanes and other bus priority
measures, and parking controls. In London a
512-km (318-mile) network of priority ‘red
routes’, with special stopping controls, is
designed to improve traffic flow'.
The DTLR has a target to reduce
congestion on the inter-urban road network
and in large urban areas to below 2000 levels
by 2010, as part of its commitment to the
Government’s Sustainable Development
Programme (see essay on p. 378).
L nder the Greater London Authority Act
1999 and the Transport Act 2000, local
authorities in London and the rest of England
and \\ ales are able to introduce congestion
charging schemes for road users and a levy on
workplace parking, as part of their Local
Transport Plans, and to retain the net revenue
generated from charges for at least ten years,
provided that it is used to fund local transport
improvements. Congestion charging schemes
in Scotland are provided for by the Transport
(Scotland) Act 2001. Local authorities will
need to consult local people and businesses
and to make improvements to public transport
before starting such schemes. Schemes—in
the Peak District National Park in Derbvshire
and in Durham—are planned to start earlv in
2002, and future schemes are expected to be
brought forward by local authorities over the
duration of the ten-year plan.
The Government is encouraging major
employers to adopt travel plans to reduce car
use for travel to work and on business, for
example by promoting alternatives such as car
sharing, cycling and use of public transport.
Traffic Information
Traffic information is provided throughout
Great Britain by a variety of means, such as
the media, roadside signs and in-vehicle
systems. Information originates from a range
of sources, such as roadside sensors, the traffic
police and highway authorities. It is collated
by motoring organisations, such as the
Automobile Association (AA) and the Royal
Automobile Club (RAC), and by information
service providers like Integrated Traffic
Information Services (ITIS), Metro Networks
and Trafficmaster. Local traffic control
centres across Great Britain help to manage
traffic and provide information about traffic
conditions. Centres covering wider areas exist
in Scotland and Wales. The High wavs Agency
has entered into a Public-Private Partnership
with Traffic Information Services (TiS) to set
up and run the Traffic Control Centre (TCC).
Costing £160 million, the object of the TCC is
to provide a coordinated national information
service to travellers in England by early 2003.
Up-to-the-minute details will be available via
variable message signs, the Highways Agency
information line, the Internet, the media and
commercial driver information services.
Cycling
The National Cycling Strategy aims to
increase the number of cycling journeys
fourfold by 2012 (based on 1996 figures). The
National Cycling Forum is coordinating the
implementation of the strategy, which has
been endorsed by the Government. The
Scottish Cycle Forum coordinates
implementation of the strategy in Scotland.
The DTLR announced its own target of
trebling the number of cycling journeys by
2010, as part of the Government’s ten-year
plan. Cycling strategies form part of Local
Transport Plans, and include measures to
make cycling safer and more convenient.
The first 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometres) of
the National Cycle Network were officially
opened in June 2000. Developed by the
transport charity Sustrans, the network will
cover 10,000 miles (16,000 kilometres) when it
is completed in 2005. Over a third of the
network will be entirely free from motor
traffic by utilising old railway lines, canal
towpaths, river paths and derelict land. The
remainder of the network will follow existing
roads, with traffic calming and cycle lanes
being implemented where necessary. Some
60 million journeys were made on the network
in 2000; 48% of users were cyclists and 51%
pedestrians.
Walking
People in the UK are walking significantly less
than in the past, with fewer journeys on foot
and many more by car. The Government
wishes to reverse this trend, and is expecting
365
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPOR T
local authorities to give more priority to
walking by providing, for example, wider
pavements, pedestrianisation schemes and
more pedestrian crossings.
Almost all local authorities included walking
strategies in their Local Transport Plans,
many identifying targets to encourage walking
through a variety of initiatives. LTP funding
is likely to be used to make walking safer and
more accessible, for example by improving
pavement and footway maintenance, removing
obstructions and improving pedestrian
crossings.
The DTLR is monitoring nine pilot Home
Zones in England and Wales, w ith further
schemes operating in Scotland and Northern
Ireland. Home Zones are residential streets in
which the road space is shared between the
drivers of motor vehicles and other road users,
with the wider needs of residents (including
people who walk or cycle, and children) in
mind. The aim is to change the way that
streets are used, improving the quality of life
of local residents. The Government has
announced a £30 million Home Zone
challenge fund for England, which is expected
to fund about 100 schemes.
Road Haulage
An operator’s licence is required for operating
goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes gross weight in
the UK. About 87% of the 105,700 licences in
issue are for fleets of five or fewer vehicles,
and there are around 423,000 heavy goods
vehicles (HGVs). Road haulage traffic by
HGVs amounted to 150 billion tonne-
kilometres in Great Britain in 2000, 15% more
than in 1990. Road hauliers are tending to use
larger vehicles carrying heavier loads—85% of
the traffic, in terms of tonne-kilometres, is
now carried by vehicles of over 25 tonnes
gross weight.
International road haulage has grown
rapidly. In 2000 about 2.3 million road goods
vehicles travelled by ferry or the Channel
Tunnel to mainland Europe, of which 544,800
were powered vehicles registered in the UK.
UK vehicles carried 14.7 million tonnes
internationally—97% of this traffic was with
the EU.
The Government has a long-term strategy
for freight in the UK, which aims to promote
a competitive and efficient distribution sector
to support future economic growth while
minimising the effects on society and the
environment. The strategy seeks to reduce the
extent to which economic growth generates
additional lorry movements, by improving
efficiency, making the most of rail, shipping
and inland waterways, and improving
interchange links between the different types
of transport. Measures introduced include an
increase in the maximum weight of lorries on
domestic journeys to 44 tonnes, and the
provision of grants towards the costs of fitting
HGVs with emission-reducing equipment or
converting them to run on alternative fuels.
Bus Services
In 1999-2000 some 4,279 million passenger
journeys were made on local bus services in
Great Britain, nearly 16% less than in
1989-90, but a small increase on 1998-99. In
London (which accounts for nearly a third of
bus journeys in Great Britain) passenger
journeys in 1999-2000 were some 10% higher
than ten years earlier. The ten-year plan target
for bus use in England is growth of 10% by
2010 from 2000 levels.
There are around 85,000 buses and coaches
in Great Britain, of which 22% are minibuses,
while 21% are double-deckers. Most local bus
services are provided commercially, with 83%
of bus mileage outside London operating on
this basis. Local authorities may subsidise
services not commercially viable which are
considered socially necessary.
Operators
Almost all bus services in Great Britain are
provided by private sector concerns, apart
from 17 bus companies owned by local
authorities. Transport for London is
responsible for providing or procuring public
transport in the capital. It oversees about 750
bus routes run by about 30 companies under
contract.
Five main groups operate bus services:
Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead Group,
National Express and Stagecoach. All also run
366
21: TRANSPORT
rail services and some have expanded into
transport services in other countries, notably
the United States.
In Northern Ireland almost all road
passenger services are operated by subsidiaries
ol the publicly owned Northern Ireland
Transport Holding Company (NITHC),
collectively known as ‘Translink’. Citybus Ltd
operates services in Belfast, and Ulsterbus Ltd
runs most of the services in the rest of
Northern Ireland, carrying 21 million and
48 million passengers a year respectivelv.
Services
The Transport Act 2000 introduced a new
statutory framework that aims to improve bus
services outside London. Local authorities in
England and W ales are required to develop
bus strategies as part of their Local Transport
Plans. Although there is no statutorv
requirement in Scotland, local authorities are
expected to set out their views on bus services
in their local transport strategies. Statutorv
backing also exists for "bus qualitv
partnerships’ and ‘quality contracts’ between
local authorities and bus operators. Similar
partnerships have already been developed
voluntarily in around 130 towns and cities,
and have led to better services with higher-
quality buses, and typically 10% to 20%
greater passenger use. The Transport Acts
also give authorities powers to promote joint
ticketing, including through tickets and to
work with train operating companies on
bus/rail ticketing.
Bus priority measures, such as bus lanes, are
becoming more extensive, while in some areas
innovative measures, such as guided busways
(with buses travelling on segregated track), are
being adopted. Around 70 park and ride
schemes, in which car users park on the
outskirts of towns and travel by public
transport to the central area, are in operation
in England and are being increasingly used to
relieve traffic congestion in busy urban
centres; over 100 new schemes are envisaged
over the next ten years.
FirstGroup is to pilot US-style yellow
school buses to provide a door-to-door service
for children, using the same driver each dav
and giving each child an allocated seat.
The Government is seeking to improve
rural and local bus services. A number of
schemes are in place which have led to
1,800 extra bus services in rural
communities, carrying 16 million
passengers a year. In England, the Rural
Bus Subsidy Grant (RBSG) is providing
£41.5 million to local authorities in 2001,
with another £21.2 million coming from
the Rural Bus Challenge (RBC)
competition. The RBC is an annual
competition in which local authorities bid
for funding for schemes aimed at
stimulating innovation in rural transport.
Among the award-winning schemes in
2001 was an initiative in Cornwall to create
a demand-responsive service in the
Bodmin Moor area, which will provide
information and infrastructure
improvements. An Urban Bus Challenge,
broadly following the lines of the RBC, is
now being developed to support improved
public transport links to deprived urban
estates.
The Countryside Agency, on behalf of
the DTLR, administers the Rural
Transport Partnership, which encourages
partnerships between the public, private
and voluntary sectors to develop local
solutions to local needs, often at the parish
level. The Scottish Executive’s £6 million
Rural Transport Fund is funding over 350
new and improved rural bus services.
Coaches
Coaches account for much of the non-local
mileage operated by public service vehicles,
and amounted to 1,417 million vehicle-
kilometres in 1999—2000. Organised coach
tours and holiday journeys account for about
60% of coach travel in Great Britain.
High-frequency scheduled services, run by
private sector operators, link many towns and
cities, and commuter services run into London
and some other major centres each weekday.
The biggest coach operator, National Express,
has a national network of scheduled coach
services and carries more than 15 million
passengers each year.
367
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
Taxis
There are about 61,000 licensed taxis in
England and Wales (mainly in urban areas),
around 9,000 in Scotland, and about 11,000 in
Northern Ireland. In London (which has over
20,000 taxis) and several other major cities,
taxis must be purpose-built to conform to
strict requirements. In many districts, taxi
drivers have to pass a test of their knowledge
of the area.
Private hire vehicles (‘minicabs’) may only
be booked through the operator and not hired
on the street. Outside London, private hire
vehicles are licensed; there are about 76,000 in
England and Wales, outside the capital, and
8,000 in Scotland. The Private Hire Vehicles
(London) Act 1998 is currently being
implemented by Transport for London.
Operators must be licensed by October 2001:
driver and vehicle licensing will follow when
the necessary regulations have been made.
RAILWAYS
Railways were pioneered in Britain: the
Stockton and Darlington Railway, which
opened in 1825, was the first public passenger
railway in the world to be worked by steam
power. Most railway services in the UK are
now operated by the private sector.
Railtrack is responsible for operating all
track and infrastructure in Great Britain. Its
assets include 32,000 kilometres (20,000 miles)
of track; 40,000 bridges, tunnels and viaducts;
2,500 stations; and connections to over 1,000
freight terminals. Apart from 14 major
stations operated directly by Railtrack, nearly
all stations and passenger depots are leased to
the passenger Train Operating Companies
(TOCs) that run passenger services under
franchise. There are currently ten TOCs
operating 25 franchises. In April 2001
Railtrack agreed to new licence conditions
under which it operates the rail network, in
return for a £1.5 billion advance payment
from the Government. In addition to
increasing public accountability, the company
will now concentrate on maintenance, and
improving safety and the service to
passengers, with private sector participants,
such as TOCs or construction firms, helping
to expand the network.
The TOCs, such as Great Western Trains,
Virgin and GNER, lease their rolling stock
from the four main rolling stock companies:
Angel Trains, HSBC Rail, Porterbrook
Leasing and GLRailease. Freight services are
run by four companies, and there are a
number of infrastructure maintenance
companies.
There are also over 100 other passenger¬
carrying railways, often connected with the
preservation of steam locomotives. Services
are operated mostly on a voluntary basis and
cater mainly for tourists and railway
enthusiasts.
Rail Regulation
The Transport Act 2000 established the
Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) to promote rail
use, plan the strategic development of the rail
network, work closely with transport
providers and promote integration between
different types of transport. The SRA also
acquired the consumer protection functions of
the Office of the Rail Regulator, including
responsibility for sponsoring the rail users’
consultative committees that represent the
interests of passengers.
The SRA is responsible for negotiating,
awarding and monitoring the franchises for
operating rail services. The public subsidy for
passenger rail services amounted to
approximately £700 million in 2000-01. Most
franchises are for around seven years, but
some are for 10, 12 or 15 years. The SRA
published its strategic agenda in March 2001.
This sets out the progress and next steps of
the replacement of the rail operating
franchises, where the objective is establishing
stronger TOCs with longer franchises and the
ability to invest to provide extra capacity to
meet growing demand. It also includes
objectives for developing rail freight and
enhancing the infrastructure, and covers
ancillary areas such as better training and staff
development. Renegotiation of the shorter-
term franchises is currently in progress.
The Rail Regulator provides independent
economic regulation of the monopoly and
dominant elements of the rail industry,
particularly Railtrack’s stewardship of the
national rail network. In addition, the
368
21: TRANSPORT
Regulator licenses the railway operators,
approves or directs agreements governing
access to track, stations and depots, and
enforces competition law in connection with
the provision of rail services.
Rail Safety
There have been a number of fatal rail
accidents in recent years, including incidents
at Southall (London) in 1997, Ladbroke
Grove, near Paddington (London), in 1999,
Hatfield (Hertfordshire) in 2000 and Selby
(Yorkshire), primarily caused by a road
vehicle, in February 2001. Nevertheless, there
is evidence that some trends in railway safety
are improving. For example, Health and
Safety Executive (HSE) figures show that in
1999-2000, there were 94 train collisions and
89 derailments, the lowest numbers recorded.
Measures taken to improve the safety of the
railway network include:
> the fitting of the train protection and
warning system (TPWS) to the Railtrack
network by the end of 2003. The TPWS
is designed to reduce the risk associated
with signals passed at danger (SPADS—
where a train passes a signal without
authority);
> the introduction of automatic train
protection (ATP) as lines that are
included in the European high-speed
network are upgraded;
> the removal by the end of 2002 of all
rolling stock which does not meet
modern crash resistance standards, with
some modified stock allowed to remain in
service until the end of 2004;
> more consistent and better standards for
driver training; and
> the development of a new national safety
plan to improve safety management and
ensure best practice across the rail
network.
Passenger Services
The passenger network (see map facing inside
back cover) comprises a fast inter-city
network, linking the main centres of Great
Britain; local and regional services; and
commuter services in and around the large
conurbations, especially London and the
South East. Passenger traffic is growing (see
Table 21.4) and on the national railways rose
by 2% in 2000—01 to 39,100 million passenger
kilometres, representing some 973 million
passenger journeys.
Investment
The Government’s ten-year plan includes
substantially increased rail investment to
provide a large expansion of rail services to
meet the growing demand and improve the
quality of service to passengers. Over £34
billion of capital investment is envisaged from
the private sector and nearly £15 billion from
the public sector, of which £7 billion will be
provided through the Rail Modernisation
Fund. The Fund will allow the SRA and the
The Hatfield Crash
The fatal rail crash just north of London,
which occurred in October 2000, killed
four people and injured 34 when a high¬
speed train came off the rails. The HSE
interim report said that the reason for the
derailment was the fracture and
subsequent fragmentation of a rail.
Following the derailment, Railtrack
imposed temporary speed restrictions
(TSRs) on around 1,000 sites throughout
the network where earlier monitoring had
identified problems similar to that
believed to have caused the accident. The
TSRs meant that revised timetables had
to be issued for many services, and the
disruption was compounded by severe
flooding in some areas. However, normal
timetables were restored on most routes
by the end of May 2001. Following the
accident, Railtrack spent £180 million on
re-railing 450 miles (720 km) of track and
renewing points, in addition to paying
£400 million in compensation to the
TOCs.
Despite disruption caused by the
emergency timetables, use of the
railways still increased in 2000-01 (see
Table 21.4).

railway industry to formulate a long-term
investment programme and is designed to
encourage a much greater level of private
sector capital investment. Funds will go
towards new rolling stock, modern signalling,
safety improvements and the provision of
greater capacity by removing bottlenecks. The
first tranche of this investment was announced
in April 2001 and is aimed at major projects,
including expansion of the capacity of the East
Coast main line and construction of the
second and final phase of the Channel Tunnel
Rail Link from north Kent to London
St Pancras.
Freight
Rail freight traffic totalled an estimated 18.4
billion tonne-kilometres, representing the
carriage of 102.9 million tonnes, in 1999-2000.
Over 80% of traffic by volume is in bulk
commodities, mainly coal, coke, iron and steel,
building materials and petroleum. The two
largest operators are English, Welsh &
Scottish Railway (EWS), which also runs
trains through the Channel Tunnel to the
continent of Europe; and Freightliner, which
operates container services between major
ports and inland terminals.
The Government and the devolved
administrations are keen to encourage more
freight to be moved by rail, to relieve pressure
on the road network and to bring
environmental benefits. The SRA published a
strategy in May 2001 which aims to increase
rail freight carriage by 80% by 2010, by
upgrading freight tracks and introducing
longer trains. Grants are available to
encourage companies to move goods by rail or
water rather than by road. In 2001 the SRA
gave grants totalling £6 million to three
companies for the development of innovative
rail schemes.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, Northern Ireland
Railways, a wholly owned subsidiary of the
NITHC (see p. 367), operates the railway
service on about 336 kilometres (211 miles) of
track and handled 6 million passenger
journeys in 2000-01. A task force was set up
in 2000 to advise on how to improve the
network. Following its interim report, the
Department for Regional Development
intends to improve the present network over
the next three years, and has increased
expenditure in 2001-02 by 150% over
2000-01.
Channel Tunnel
The Channel Tunnel was opened to traffic in
1994. It cost about £9 billion and was
constructed by TML (Transmanche Link) on
behalf of Eurotunnel, an Anglo-French group,
under an operating concession from the
British and French Governments.
370
21: TRANSPORT
Eurotunnel Services
As well as managing the infrastructure of the
Channel Tunnel—tunnels, terminals and
track—Eurotunnel operates a drive-on, drive-
off shuttle train service, with separate shuttles
for passenger and freight vehicles, between
terminals near Folkestone and Calais. In 2000
the service carried nearly 2.8 million cars
(54% of car traffic on the Dover/Folkestone
—Calais route), 1.1 million goods vehicles
(48% of accompanied freight traffic) and
79,500 coaches (35% of coach traffic).
Eurostar Passenger Services
Eurostar high-speed train services are
operated jointly by Eurostar (UK) Ltd,
French Railways and Belgian Railways under
the commercial direction of Eurostar Group.
Frequent services connect London (Waterloo)
and Paris or Brussels, taking less than 3 hours
and 2 hours 40 minutes respectively. Trains
also serve Ashford (Kent), Calais, Lille,
Disneyland Paris and, during the winter,
Bourg St Maurice in the French Alps.
Eurostar carried over 7 million passengers
in 2000.
Channel Tunnel Rail Link
The first section of the Channel Tunnel Rail
Link (CTRL) is under construction between
the Channel Tunnel terminal and Ebbsfleet,
near Gravesend (Kent), and is planned to be
completed in 2003. Construction work on the
second section, from Ebbsfleet to St Pancras
(London), began in 2001, and the section is
due to open in 2006. The whole project is
forecast to cost some £5.2 billion. Eurostar
trains will be able to travel at speeds of
500 km/h (185 mph), reducing journey times
by 40 minutes. A new international station for
the CTRL will also be built at Stratford in
east London, enabling services from regional
centres to by-pass central London.
Underground Railways
In 1863 the world’s first Underground railway
opened in London. Today London
Underground is a major business, serving
275 stations on 408 kilometres (253 miles) of
railway. In 2000—01, 972 million passenger
journeys were made on the network.
Under a proposed Public-Private
Partnership (PPP), responsibility for
maintaining and upgrading London
Underground’s infrastructure would transfer
to the private sector, while London
Underground would continue to have
responsibility for safety and all aspects of
operating passenger services across the
network. The private sector would work
under contract to London Underground for a
30-year period, after which all the assets
would return to the public sector. The PPP is
expected to deliver about £8 billion of
investment in the network and up to £5 billion
of maintenance over 15 years. London
Underground Ltd will become part of
Transport for London once the PPP is in
place.
The Glasgow Underground, a heavy rapid
transit system, operates on a 11-km (7-mile)
circle in central Glasgow.
Light Railways and Tramways
There has been a revival in interest in
tram/light rail services, and the Government’s
ten-year plan indicates a growing role for
tramways, with the provision of up to 25 new
lines in major cities and conurbations.
Two systems are in operation in London.
The Croydon Tramlink is a 28-km (18-mile)
light rail network, built and run as a joint
operation between Tramtrack Croydon Ltd
(a private sector consortium) and Transport
for London. The Docklands Light Railway
(DLR) connects Docklands with surrounding
areas and the City, and is operated under
franchise by Docklands Railway Management
Ltd. A link to London City Airport is planned
and could be opened by 2004.
Four other light rail systems are in
operation: the Tyne and Wear Metro,
Manchester Metrolink, Stagecoach Supertram
(in South Yorkshire) and the ^Midland Metro.
DTLR approval has been given for the £100
million extension of the Tyne and Wear
Metro to Sunderland; for the £180 million
Nottingham Express Transit system, which
371
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORT
will run for 13 kilometres (8 miles) and link
Hucknall to the centre of Nottingham from
2003; and for a £190 million light rail system
in South Hampshire. Approval has also been
given for three further extensions, costing
over £500 million, of the Manchester
Metrolink to Manchester Airport, to Oldham
and Rochdale, and to Ashton-under-Lyne.
Four other lines were approved by the
Government in April 2001—three in Leeds
and one in Bristol/South Gloucestershire.
INLAND WATERWAYS
Inland waterways are now used mainly for
leisure and general recreation, but they have a
number of other important roles: as a heritage
and environmental resource, as a catalyst for
regeneration, and in land drainage and water
supply. Some inland waterways still carry
freight.
The UK’s waterways are managed by about
30 different navigation authorities. British
Waterways, a public corporation sponsored by
DEFRA and the Scottish Executive, is the
largest, responsible for some 2,600 kilometres
(1,600 miles) of fully navigable waterways,
about half the UK total (see map at the front
of the book).
In June 2000 the then DETR issued
Waterways for Tomorrow, a policy document
which envisages greater recreational use of,
and access to, the waterways; their wider use
as a catalyst for regeneration; encouragement
for the transfer of freight from road to
waterway; and closer links between British
Waterways and other navigation authorities.
The Government is encouraging partnerships
between navigation authorities and the private
and voluntary sectors and British Waterways
is developing a number of PPPs.
The Millennium Link project in Scotland
reopened the Forth & Clyde Canal and the
Union Canal to navigation in 2001, and the
reconnection of Glasgow and Edinburgh by
canal will be completed in 2002. The
Huddersfield Narrow Canal was also reopened
to navigation for the first time since 1945,
following a major restoration project.
The cross-border body Waterways Ireland
is responsible for the management,
maintenance, development and restoration of
the inland navigable waterways system
throughout the island of Ireland, principally
for recreational purposes.
SHIPPING
It is estimated that about 95°o by weight (75°o
by value) of the UK’s foreign trade is carried
by sea. The UK fleet has declined
considerably in tonnage terms in the last
25 years, reflecting changing trade patterns,
removal of grants, and greater competition.
International revenue (including freight
revenue) earned by the L K shipping industn
in 1999 was £3.4 billion and represented
over 5% of the total export of sendees from
the UK.
At the end of 2000 there were 624 UK-
owned merchant trading ships of 100 gross
tonnes or more, with a total tonnage of 10.5
million deadweight tonnes. There were 160
vessels totalling 5.2 million deadweight tonnes
used as oil, chemical or gas carriers, and 425
vessels totalling 5.2 million deadweight tonnes
employed as dry-bulk carriers, container ships
or other types of cargo ship, together with 39
passenger ships. In all, 72°o of LK-owned
vessels are registered in the UK, the Channel
Islands, the Isle of Man or British Overseas
Territories such as Bermuda.
The Government is implementing a series
of measures aimed at reviving the shipping
industry and reversing the downward trend in
the UK fleet. The Finance Act 2000 provided
for a new fiscal regime, under which shipping
can be taxed on the basis of tonnage, as occurs
in a number of other countries. Other
measures include more training and career
opportunities for seafarers.
Cargo Services
International revenue earned by the L K
shipping industry in 2000 w as £3.8 billion:
£2.9 billion from freight (£2.3 billion on dry
cargo and passenger vessels and £0.6 billion
on tankers and liquefied gas carriers);
£0.2 billion from charter receipts; and
£0.6 billion from passenger revenue.
372
21: TRANSPORT
N early all scheduled cargo-liner sen ices
from the L K are containerised. British
tonnage serving these trades is dominated by a
relatively small number of companies. Besides
the carriage of freight by liner and bulk
services between the UK and the rest of
Europe, many roll-on, roll-off sen ices earn
cars, passengers and commercial vehicles.
Passenger Services
Over 30 million passenger journeys a year take
place on international and domestic fern
services linking the UK with Ireland and with
mainland Europe. A further 18 million
passengers are carried on fern sen ices to
many of Britain s offshore islands, such as the
Isle of \\ ight. Isle of Man, Orknev and
Shetland, and the islands off the west coast of
Scotland. Traffic from southern and south¬
eastern ports accounts for a large proportion
of traffic to the continent.
P&O Ferries is the UK's largest fern
operator, with a fleet of about 50 ships
operating on 18 routes around the UK coast.
Cross-Channel services are operated bv roll¬
on, roll-off ferries, high-speed catamarans and
high-speed monohulls.
Maritime Safety
The DTLR s policies for improving marine
safety and pollution control are implemented
b\ the Maritime and Coastguard Asencv
(MCA), which inspects UK ships and foreign
ships using UK ports to ensure that thev
comply with international safety, pollution
prevention and operational standards. In
2000-01, 116 foreign-flagged ships were
detained in UK ports.
In 2000 the MCA was alerted to 12,016
incidents, of which 6,825 were accidents
requiring search and rescue assistance. In an
emergency ELM Coastguard coordinates
facilities, such as its own helicopters; cliff
rescue teams; lifeboats of the Royal N ational
Lifeboat Institution (a voiuntarv body);
aircraft, helicopters and ships from the armed
forces, and merchant shipping and commercial
aircraft.
Some locations around the UK are
potentially hazardous for shipping. There are
over 1,000 marine aids to navigation around
the L K coast and responsibility for these rests
with three regional lighthouse authorities.
Measures to reduce the risk of collision
include the separation of ships into
internationally agreed shipping lanes, as
applies in the Dover Strait, one of the world’s
busiest seaways, which is monitored by radar
from the Channel Navigation Information
Service near Dover.
In 2000 the Government launched the Port
Marine Safety Code, designed to ensure the
highest standards of marine safety in UK
ports. All harbour authorities are being asked
to implement the code by the end of 2001.
PORTS
There are about JO ports of commercial
significance in Great Britain, while several
hundred small harbours cater for local cargo,
fishing vessels, island ferries or recreation.
There are three broad types of port: ports
owned and run by boards constituted as trusts;
those owned by local authorities; and
company-owned facilities.
Associated British Ports (ABP) is the UK’s
largest port owner and operates 22 ports,
including Cardiff, Grimsby and Immingham,
Hull, Ipswich, Newport, Port Talbot,
Southampton and Swansea. Other major
facilities owned by private sector companies
include Felixstowe, Harwich and Thamesport
(all owned by the Hong Kong group
Hutchison Whampoa).
The Government launched Modem Ports: a
L A Policy in November 2000. It intends to
assist ports in maintaining competitiveness,
develop nationally agreed safety standards,
promote environmental best practice, and
build on the approach detailed in the ten-year
plan, which recognised the importance of port
hubs within integrated transport systems.
Port Traffic
In 2000 traffic through the 52 major UK ports
(generally those handling over 1 million
tonnes a year) amounted to 561 million

tonnes: 308 million tonnes of inward traffic
and 252 million tonnes of outward traffic.
Minor ports handled an additional 16 million
tonnes.
The main ports, in terms of total tonnage
handled, are shown in Table 21.5. Forth,
Milford Haven and Sullom Voe mostly handle
oil, while the principal destinations for non¬
fuel traffic are London, Felixstowe, Grimsby
and Immingham, Tees and Hartlepool, and
Liverpool. Crude oil now accounts for one-
third of all port traffic.
By far the most important port for container
traffic is Felixstowe (which handles about
two-fifths of this type of traffic), w hile Dover
is the leading port for roll-on, roll-off traffic.
Dover is also the major arrival and departure
point for sea passengers, handling well over
half of all international movements to and
from the UK. The top four UK ports are
among the ten largest ports in northern
Europe.
Northern Ireland has four main ports, at
Belfast, Larne, Londonderry and
Warrenpoint. Belfast handles around three-
fifths of Northern Ireland’s seaborne trade.
CIVIL AVIATION
In 2000 UK airlines flew a record 1,471
million aircraft kilometres, 74% higher than in
1990: 1,016 million kilometres on scheduled
services and 455 million kilometres on non-
scheduled flights. They carried 70 million
passengers on scheduled services and
33 million on charter flights. Passenger seat
occupancy was 77%, being much higher on
charter flights (89%) than on scheduled
services (72%). It was also higher for
international flights (78%) than internal
services (65%).
UK airlines are entirely in the private
sector, as are many of the major airports.
Day-to-day responsibility for the regulation
of civil aviation rests with the Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA).
Airlines
British Airways
British Airways is the world’s largest
international airline. During 2000-01 its
turnover from airline operations was £9.3
billion, and the British Airways group carried
over 44 million passengers, achieving an
occupancy of 72% on its main scheduled
services. The airline’s worldwide network
covers 268 destinations in 97 countries, and its
main operating bases are London’s Heathrow
and Gatwick airports.
British Airways was one of the founders,
together with American Airlines, Canadian
International Airlines, Cathay Pacific and
Qantas, of the ‘Oneworld’ alliance. The
alliance now has 31 member airlines and
serves 565 scheduled destinations in 133
countries.
The British Airways group has a fleet of 340
aircraft, including seven Concordes, 54 Boeing
374
21: TRANSPORT
737s, 72 Boeing 747s, 51 Boeing 757s, 35
Boeing 77/s and 27 Boeing 767s. Ten Airbus
A320s and 15 A319s are in service, with a
further 20 and 33 respectively on order.
Other UK Airlines
BMI, formerly British Midland, is the second
largest scheduled carrier and operates an
extensive network of scheduled services with
40 aircraft, carrying 7.1 million passengers in
2000. The company commenced transatlantic
services for the first time in 2001. Britannia
Airways is the world’s biggest charter airline
and carried 8.2 million passengers in 2000 on
its 44 aircraft. Virgin Atlantic operates
scheduled services to 18 overseas destinations
with 27 aircraft. Low fare ’no-frills’ airlines
operating in the UK include easyjet and Go.
Airports
Ol the 150 or so licensed civil aerodromes in
the UK, nearly a quarter handle more than
100,000 passengers a year each. In 2000 the
UK’s civil airports handled a total of 181.2
million passengers (180 million terminal
passengers and 1.2 million in transit), and 2.3
million tonnes of freight.
Passenger traffic has been growing at the
UK’s main airports (see Table 21.6).
Heathrow is the world’s busiest airport for
international travellers and is the UK’s most
important for passengers and air freight,
handling 64.6 million passengers (excluding
those in transit) and 1.3 million tonnes of
freight in 2000. Gatwick is the world’s sixth
busiest international airport and has the
world’s busiest single runway. Stansted is the
fastest growing airport in Europe, with
terminal passengers increasing by 24% in
2000-01.
Ownership and Control
BAA pic is the world’s largest commercial
operator of airports. Its airports handle almost
200 million passengers a year worldwide. In
2000 its seven UK airports—Heathrow',
Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton in
southern England, and Glasgow, Edinburgh
and Aberdeen in Scotland—handled 124.1
million passengers. Overseas, BAA manages
all or part of 12 airports: four in the United
States, six in Australia, including Melbourne
and Perth airports, Naples Airport in Italy and
Mauritius. The UK’s second largest operator
is T BI, which has an interest in 37 airports
worldwide, including Belfast International and
Cardiff.
All UK airports used for public transport
must be licensed by the CAA for reasons of
safety. Stringent requirements, such as
adequate firefighting, medical and rescue

Airport Development
Investment to expand passenger facilities is in
progress at many UK airports. At Heathrow,
BAA has invested over £960 million in the last
five years. A £100 million redevelopment of
departure facilities at Terminal 3 is scheduled
for completion in 2002. BAA’s plans for a fifth
terminal, which could eventually cater for
30 million passengers a year, have been
considered by a public inquiry. If approval is
granted, the new terminal could be operational
by 2007. Expansion at Gatwick’s two
terminals over the next ten years is designed to
raise annual capacity to around 40 million
passengers. Manchester Airport’s second
runway became fully operational during
summer 2001, increasing the airport’s capacity
to over 40 million a year.
Among other large-scale projects at UK
airports are:
> a major £360 million expansion plan at
Birmingham Airport, which will increase
capacity to around 10 million passengers
a year;
> a £200 million investment programme at
Stansted over the next five years to
increase capacity to around 15 million
passengers a year; and
> a £30 million expansion scheme at
Belfast City Airport over the next five
years.
Air Traffic Control
Civil and military air traffic control over the
UK and the surrounding seas, including much
of the North Atlantic, is undertaken by
National Air Traffic Services Ltd (NATS),
working in collaboration with military
controllers. Previously a subsidiary of the
CAA, NATS became a separate organisation
under the Transport Act 2000, and the
company is being restructured, bringing in
private sector investment through a PPP. The
Government’s strategic partner in this venture
is the Airline Group, a consortium of seven
UK airlines—British Airways, BMI, Virgin,
As there is a shortage of capacity at some
of the UK’s major airports, the
Government is seeking ways to increase
provision, and make more efficient use of
the existing infrastructure, while also
reducing the environmental impact of
aviation. A series of studies on regional
airports has been undertaken, and a study
of airport issues in south-east and east
England is in progress. These will
contribute to the development of a White
Paper which will provide a long-term
framework for the future of civil aviation
and airports in the UK.
The DTLR, along with BAA and local
councils, is looking at ways of reducing the
environmental impact of air travel. Both
daytime and night-time noise levels were
reduced in 2001, and plans for the
expansion of Gatwick Airport include
legally binding agreements with the local
authorities to reduce emissions from the
airport and protect air quality. Aircraft
noise is discussed further in chapter 19.
Britannia, Monarch, easyjet and Airtours.
Under the deal, the Airline Group has a 46%
share (with rights giving it voting control), the
Government 49%, and NATS employees 5%.
The CAA retains responsibility for air safety
regulation, and will also regulate the NATS
PPP.
The PPP is intended to attract large-scale
investment, from the private sector, to
undertake the improvements needed in air
traffic control operations. To cope with the
rapid growth in air traffic, NATS is planning
to replace the three existing UK centres for
civil and military en route air traffic control
operations at Prestwick, Manchester and West
Drayton (near Heathrow) with two major
centres. Swanwick (Hampshire) is due to open
in 2002, while a new Scottish centre at
Prestwick will replace the existing centre in
2006-07.
Air Safety
The CAA is responsible for safety standards
on UK airlines. It certifies aircraft and crews,
376
21: TRANSPORT
licenses air operators and air travel organisers,
and approves certain air fares and airport
charges. To qualify for a first professional
licence, a pilot must undertake a full-time
course of instruction approved by the CAA 
or have acceptable military or civilian flying
experience and pass ground examinations
and flight tests. Every company operating
aircraft used for commercial air transport
purposes must possess an Air Operator’s
Certificate, which the CAA grants when it is
satisfied that the company is competent to
operate its aircraft safely. All aircraft
registered in the UK must be granted a
certificate of airworthiness by the CAA before
being flown. The CAA works closely with the
Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA), a European
grouping of aviation safety regulation
authorities.
The DTLR’s Air Accidents Investigation
Branch investigates accidents and serious
incidents in UK airspace and those that occur
overseas to aircraft registered or manufactured
in the UK.

Sustainable Development
The year 2002 marks the tenth anniversary of
the UN Conference on Environment and
Development, held in Rio de Janeiro. At the
conference, known as the ‘Earth Summit’, for
the first time global attention was focused on
the links between environmental problems,
economic conditions and social justice. From
it emerged a commitment to the concept
widely known as ‘sustainable development’.
The Earth Summit brought together policy¬
makers, diplomats, scientists, and media and
non-governmental representatives from 179
countries to discuss how environmental
protection and management of natural
resources could be integrated with socio¬
economic issues of poverty and under¬
development. It set in motion integrated
approaches to social, economic and
environmental management in many
countries, including the UK.
The first UK sustainable development
strategy was published in 1994. In 1996 a
programme was established to monitor a set of
120 indicators. In 1999 the programme was
expanded to 150 indicators in a revised
strategy which emphasised a simultaneous
pursuit of social progress that recognises the
needs of everyone, effective protection of the
environment, prudent use of natural
resources, and maintenance of high and stable
levels of economic growth and employment. It
included 15 headline indicators intended to
focus attention on what sustainable
development means:
Economic: economic output (Gross Domestic
Product—GDP); investment (as % of GDP);
and employment.
Social: poverty and social exclusion; education
(qualifications at age 19); health (expected
years of healthy life); housing; and crime.
Environmental: climate change (greenhouse
gases); air quality (days of air pollution); road
traffic; river water quality; wildlife (farmland
birds); land use (percentage of new homes on
previously developed land); and waste
(arisings and management).
In January 2001 the Government’s first annual
report reviewing progress made against the 15
indicators was published, showing
improvement in eight of them in 2000. At the
same time the first breakdown of the headline
indicators for each of the English regions and
for Wales was published. A website on
sustainable development (vprmv.sustainable-
development.gov.uk) was also launched to
provide both a means for continuous reporting
of progress and a forum for debate and
exchange of information.
In November 2000 the National Assembly for
Wales adopted its own sustainable development
scheme, providing the overarching framework
for all the Assembly’s work. The first annual
report on implementation of the scheme will be
produced in late 2001.
In Scotland, sustainable development is being
built into programmes and policies across the
board. The Scottish Executive is considering
its own set of indicators.
Planned consultation in Northern Ireland will
outline a framework for implementing a
sustainable development strategy aiming for
better coordination of action within and
between central government and other key
sectors.
The principal body responsible for
encouraging and promoting sustainable
development within the UK is the
Sustainable Development Commission
(iPTPTP.sd-commission.gov.uk). It acts to advocate
sustainable development in the UK, review
progress and build consensus on the actions
needed for further progress.
In September 2002 many UN members,
including the UK, and other concerned
parties will attend the World Summit on
Sustainable Development (known as Rio +10)
in Johannesburg, South Africa (mvw.
johannesburgsummit.org). The Summit will
identify areas for further action and examine
the obstacles to the implementation of Agenda
21 (the plan of action adopted at Rio).

The Government’s central economic objective is to raise the UK economy’s
sustainable rate of growth and achieve rising prosperity. It has set five key long¬
term economic goals: raising productivity; increasing employment opportunity
for all, providing educational opportunity for all; abolishing child poverty; and
delivering strong and dependable public services.
In 2000 growth in the UK economy continued for the ninth consecutive year.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at constant market prices rose by 3.1% over the
year, with quarterly growth reaching 0.9% in the second quarter and 0.8% in the
third quarter, although there was a weakening to 0.4% in the fourth quarter
Employment grew by a further 225,000 during the course of the year, contributing
to a total rise of more than 1 million since spring 1997. The economy is seeing the
longest period of sustained low inflation since the 1960s. Underlying inflation was
modestly below the Government’s 21/2% inflation target throughout 2000,
averaging 2.1% for the year as a whole.
STRUCTURE AND PERFORMANCE
The value of all goods and services produced
in the UK economy for final consumption is
measured by Gross Domestic Product. In
2000 GDP at current market prices—‘money
GDP’—totalled £935 billion. Average annual
growth in GDP at 1995 market prices over the
past five years has been 2.8% (see also Table
22.3). Values for two of the main economic
indicators, inflation and GDP, are shown in
Figures 22.1 and 22.2 overleaf.
Output
Real GDP grew by 3.1% in 2000, above its
post-war average of around 272% a year.
Strong growth in domestic demand more than
accounted for the expansion, driven by a 3.7%
rise in household consumption, well above
average rates. Business investment growth
slowed significantly in 2000 following rapid
expansion over previous years, although it
gathered pace in the second half of the year.
Whole economy fixed capital formation w^as
supported by a 15.4% increase in general
government investment. In the 2001 Budget,
FLV1 Treasury expected GDP grow th to ease
back to its assumed trend rate of betw een 274%
and 274% a year in the period 2001 to 2003.
Recent decades have generally seen growth
dominated by the service sector (see chapter
29) and this pattern continued during the
1990s. In 2000, at constant basic prices—that
is, adjusted for inflation, and excluding taxes
and subsidies on products—output of the
service industries increased by 3.4%, with
particularly strong growth in transport,

in the 19/0s was 1.9°o compared with 3.0%
in the EL and 3.4% in the G7 countries. In
the 1980s, annual growth of 2.7% was
slightly above the EU average of 2.4% but
a little below the G7 average of 3.0%. By
the 1990s, however, UK growth was the same
as for the EL and G7 countries, at 2.0% a
year.
Household Income and Expenditure
Total resources of the households sector—
including non-profit institutions serving
households—rose by 4.6% in 2000 to £915
billion. Gross disposable income—after
deductions, including taxes and social
contributions—totalled £622 billion. In 1995
prices, real households disposable income—
the amount of money the household sector has
available for spending after taxes and other
deductions—was 3.0% higher in 2000 than in
1999. Wages and salaries accounted for 60%
of household primary income in 2000, rising
by 5.3% during the year to £449 billion.
Household net financial wealth fell by 10% in
2000 to £2,149 billion.
Household final expenditure—spending by
the household sector on products or services to
satisfy immediate needs or wants—rose in 2000
by 4.7% at current market prices to £589 billion,
representing 74.9% of total final consumption
expenditure (£786 billion). Expenditure on
services remained relatively strong, rising bv
5.6%, with expenditure on durable goods up
by 3.6% and on non-durable goods by 3.8%.
In constant price terms total expenditure grew
by 3.7%.
Households’ saving ratio—saving as a
percentage of total available households’
resources—fell slightly between 1999 and
2000, from 5.2% to 4.5%, partly due to
increases in tax payments and consumption
growth continuing to outstrip income.

Table 22.5 shows the changing pattern of
households’ final consumption expenditure.
Over the longer term, with rising incomes,
people tend to spend increasing proportions of
their disposable income on durable goods,
clothing and certain services. Spending on
leisure pursuits and tourism, communications,
health and financial services have all shown
significant growth in recent years. Declining
proportions are being spent on alcohol and
tobacco, and energy products.
Investment
Gross fixed capital formation represents
investment in assets which are used repeatedly
or continuously over a number of years to
produce goods, such as machinery used to
create a product. Total investment at constant
1995 prices grew by 2.8% in 2000 (see Table
22.6), slower growth than the 5.4% increase in
1999. Business investment rose by 1.9%, and at
14.1% of GDP, remained very close to 1999’s
record high share.
UK whole economy investment has
accounted for a smaller share of GDP than for
other industrialised countries—in 1999
around 19.1% of GDP (at 1995 prices),
compared with the average for the G7
excluding the UK of 22.3%—but strong
growth of business investment in recent years
has helped to narrow the gap.
General government investment rose by
15.4% in 2000 following a 3.0% decline in

1999, and is forecast by HM Treasury to
increase at an average of around 20% a year
between 2001 and 2003, reflecting the
Government’s commitment to the renewal
and modernisation of the public sector capital
stock (see also p. 400).
International Trade
International trade plays a key role in the UK
economy (see chapter 24). The UK is the
world’s fifth largest exporter of goods and
services, with exports accounting for 27% of
GDP in 2000. Other EU countries took 57.3%
of UK exports of goods in 2000 and supplied
50.5% of imported goods.
The UK’s current account deficit (see
p. 411) deteriorated sharply from £9.9 billion
in 1999 to j£16.2 billion in 2000 as domestic
production continued to be outstripped bv
domestic demand. This increased deficit was
partly caused by a record trade in goods deficit
of 3^28.8 billion, and a decreased surplus on
investment income to £5.5 billion. There was
a continued surplus on trade in services of
£11.0 billion and a £3.8 billion deficit on
current transfers.
Business Structure
The UK has around 3.7 million businesses
including many large companies. According to
a Financial Times survey of the world’s 500
largest companies in January 2001, 40 were
UK-based, with a market capitalisation of
US$1,637 billion (£1,115 billion). In Europe,
143 of the top 500 companies were UK-based,
with market capitalisation of almost USS2,148
million (£1,462 billion). There are around
3,485 UK businesses employing over 500
people, representing 39.8% of total
employment by UK businesses and 41.7% of
turnover. A small number of large companies
and their subsidiaries are responsible for a
substantial proportion of total production in
some sectors. This is particularly true for
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, motor vehicle
assembly and aerospace. Of the top 20 UK
companies by market capitalisation, five are in
the retail banking sector, three in
telecommunications and two each in
pharmaceuticals, life assurance and oil and gas
(see Table 22.7).
Expenditure on acquisitions abroad by UK
companies reached a record level of £181.3
billion in 2000, 63% higher than in 1999,
which had itself been a record. The two
largest reported transactions were the
acquisition of Mannesmann AG of Germany
by Vodafone AirTouch (now Vodafone) for a
reported £101.2 billion and of Atlantic
Richfield Company of the United States by
BP Amoco (now BP) for £18.0 billion.

foreign companies also reached a record
level—£64.6 billion—slightly higher than the
previous record in 1999. The largest reported
acquisition was of Orange by France Telecom
for £23.4 billion.
Small firms play an important part in the
UK economy: around 43.6% of the private
sector workforce work for companies
employing fewer than 50 people. Around 2.6
million businesses are sole traders or partners
without employees, while a further 738,685
businesses employ one to four people.
Together these 3.3 million enterprises account
for 89.5% of the number of businesses, over
23.5% of business employment and 16.4% of
turnover.
Private sector firms predominate in the
economy. The public sector has become much
less significant following the privatisation
since 1979 of many public sector businesses,
including gas, electricity supply, coal and
telecommunications. The remaining major
nationalised industries are Consignia
(formerly the Post Office), BNFL (British
Nuclear Fuels) and the Civil Aviation
Authority.
Inflation
Three main measures of retail prices are used
in the UK:
> the all items Retail Prices Index (RPI),
the main domestic measure of prices in
the UK. RPI inflation measures the
average change from month to month in
the prices of goods and services
purchased by most households in the UK
and is commonly called ‘headline’
inflation;
> the RPI excluding mortgage interest
payments (RPIX), which is used to
calculate ‘underlying’ inflation, the target
measure set by the Government (see
p. 386); and
> the harmonised index of consumer prices
(HICP), calculated for each Member
State of the European Union for the
purposes of European comparisons; it is
also used to derive inflation rates for the
eurozone and the EU as a whole.
Annual underlying inflation (RPIX) in the
last 20 years or so has fluctuated considerably,
peaking at 20.8% in the year to May 1980.
However, it was much lower in the 1990s, and
since 1993 has been in a relatively narrow
range, from around 2% to 3.5%. In 2000 it
averaged 2.1% and has been modestly below
the Government’s current target of 2'/2%—set
in May 1997—since April 1999.
In 2000 the all items RPI averaged 3.0%:
goods inflation averaged 0.3% and services
inflation 3.5%. There were above average
increases of 8.9% for housing costs, 8.6% for
384
22: THE ECONOMY
tobacco and 4.9% for leisure services;
conversely, clothing and footwear costs fell by
3.8% and leisure goods by 3.5%.
In 2000 UK inflation on the HICP measure
was 0.8%, the lowest in the EU and well
below the average of 2.1%. During the early
months of 2001 the UK’s HICP continued at
this low level. This situation is partly a
consequence of sterling relative to the euro.
Producer input prices for materials and
fuels purchased by manufacturing industry
rose by 11.5% in 2000 as a whole, but dropped
back slightly in the first half of 2001. This
compares with a 1.6% increase in 1999 and a
9.1% fall in the previous year. Producer
output price inflation was 1.2% in 1999 as a
whole, and 2.6% in 2000, but output prices
were broadly stable in the first half of 2001.
Labour Market
Employment in the UK has continued to grow,
and there were falls both in the International
Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment rate
and in the number of people claiming
unemployment-related benefits. Latest figures
show that employment—at 28.2 million in the
three months to May 2001—was at a record
level, 267,000 higher than in the same period a
year earlier (see chapter 11). Those people
economically inactive (of men aged 16 to 64 and
women aged 16 to 59) rose by 166,000 over the
same period to 7.74 million, but 5.55 million
people did not want jobs. Unemployment
continued to fall, and at 1,453,000 in the three
months to May 2001 was 208,000 lower than a
year earlier, according to ILO measures. This
represented 4.9% of the workforce, well below
the figure (7.6%) for all EU countries and the
lowest UK rate since the series began in 1984.
Long-term (over two years) and youth
unemployment have both declined
substantially.
ECONOMIC STRATEGY
The main elements of the Government’s
economic strategy, which is designed to
deliver high and stable levels of economic
growth and employment, are as set out in the
2001 Budget:
> delivering macroeconomic stability;
> meeting the productivity challenge;
> increasing employment opportunity for
all (see chapter 11);
> ensuring fairness for families and
communities; and
> protecting the environment.
HM Treasury is the department with prime
responsibility for the Government’s monetary
and fiscal frameworks. It is also responsible for
wider economic policy, which it carries out in
conjunction with other government
departments, such as Trade and Industry;
Education and Skills; Work and Pensions; and
Transport, Local Government and the Regions.
The Government’s policy on UK
membership of the European single currency
(see p. 82) is that the determining factor
underpinning any decision on membership is
the national economic interest and whether
the economic case for joining is clear and
unambiguous. As the Chancellor of the
Exchequer said in his October 1997 statement,
the five economic tests will define whether a
clear and unambiguous case can be made.
These tests are:
> sustainable convergence between Britain
and the economies of the single currency;
> whether there is sufficient flexibility to
cope with economic change;
the effect on investment;
^ the impact on the UK financial services
industry; and
whether it is good for employment.
The Government has said that it will
complete an assessment of the five economic
tests within two years of the start of the
current Parliament.
Economic Stability
The Government’s central economic objective
is to raise the economy’s sustainable rate of
growth, and achieve rising prosperity, through
creating economic and employment
opportunities for all. It has introduced new
frameworks for the operation of both
385
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
monetary and fiscal policy in order to achieve
low and stable inflation and sound public
finances. The Government ensures the
coordination of monetary and fiscal policy by
setting mutually consistent objectives for both.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy
Committee (see p. 512) is responsible for
setting interest rates to meet the
Government’s inflation target of Z'/zTo, as
defined by the 12-month change in RPIX.
Official interest rates peaked at 7’/2% in 1998,
compared with a peak of 147/8% in 1989 in the
previous economic cycle, and had fallen to 5%
by August 2001.
International Stability
The crises in emerging markets in the 1990s
brought to light what the Government saw as
fundamental weaknesses in the architecture of
the international financial system and
highlighted the need for new measures to
promote stability at the international level in
parallel with the reforms to the UK’s
macroeconomic framework. The Government
supported the need for all governments to
pursue transparent, consistent and credible
macroeconomic policies with enhanced
international surveillance, greater
international cooperation in financial
regulation and a new framework for managing
crises. In 1998 the G7 Finance Ministers
pledged to create a new international financial
architecture for an integrated global economy.
The UK Government has played a leading
role in taking forward this agenda, building on
the structural changes introduced
domestically. In the past three years there
have been developments in a number of
important areas, including:
> a new framework of codes and standards
against which countries can assess their
performance and improve their economic
accounts and financial policy
frameworks;
> a new model of cooperation in global
financial regulation—the Financial
Stability Forum—which was established
in 1999 to bring together the
International Monetary Fund, World
Bank and key finance ministries, central
banks and regulatory authorities with the
objective of tackling areas of vulnerability
in the international financial system;
> a new framework of partnership for crisis
prevention and resolution between the
private and public sectors which will help
ensure that all parties benefiting from the
international financial system play their
part in maintaining its stability; and
> a new mechanism for informal dialogue
between major developed and emerging
market economies—the G20. This
Group was also established in 1999 to
provide a forum for broader discussion
and cooperation on key economic and
financial issues.
Fiscal Policy
The Code for Fiscal Stability, set up under the
Finance Act 1998, requires fiscal and debt
management policy to be carried out in
accordance with five key principles:
> transparency in setting fiscal policy
objectives, the implementation of fiscal
policy and the presentation of the public
accounts;
> stability in the fiscal policy-making
process and in the way that fiscal policy
affects the economy;
> responsibility in the management of the
public finances;
> fairness, including between present and
future generations; and
> efficiency in the design and
implementation of fiscal policy, and in
managing both sides of the public sector
balance sheet.
Consistent with these principles, the
Government established key objectives for
fiscal policy as:
> over the medium term, to ensure sound
public finances and that spending and
taxation impact fairly, both within and
between generations; and
> over the short term, to support monetary
policy and, in particular, to allow the
‘automatic stabilisers’ to play their role in
386
22: THE ECONOMY
smoothing the path of the economy over
the economic cycle.
These objectives are implemented through
the Government’s two fiscal rules, set out in
HM Treasury’s Economic and Fiscal Strategy
Report (see below), against which the
performance of fiscal policy can be judged:
> the golden rule—over the economic cycle,
the Government will borrow onlv to
invest and not to fund current spending;
and
> the sustainable investment rule—public
sector net debt as a proportion of GDP
will be held over the economic cycle at a
stable and prudent level: other things
being equal, net debt will be maintained
below 40% of GDP.
These rules promote economic stability by
ensuring sound public sector finances, while
allowing flexibility in two key respects. First,
the rules are set over the economic cycle,
allowing fiscal balances to vary between vears
in keeping with the cyclical positions of the
economy. This allows the automatic stabilisers
to operate freely to dampen the effects of the
economic cycle, boosting aggregate demand
when the economy is below trend, and
reducing aggregate demand when it is above
trend. Second, the interaction of the two rules
promotes capital investment w hile ensuring
the sustainability of the public finances in the
longer term.
Across the public sector, planning for the
long term and increasing capital investment
have been supported by the new public
spending framework. The key elements are:
> three-year spending allocations for
departments (Departmental Expenditure
Limits—DELs), providing departments
with greater certainty and flexibility over
their budgets and thereby enabling
improved planning and management of
resources over the medium term;
> Annually Managed Expenditure (AME),
which covers those elements of spending
that cannot reasonably be subject to firm
multi-year limits and are instead subject
to tough annual scrutiny as part of the
Budget process. DEL and AME sum to
Total Managed Expenditure (see p. 402);
> separate resource (current) and capital
budgets for each department, consistent
with the distinction in the fiscal rules.
Departments are required to manage
their resource and capital budgets
separately, removing the bias against
investment w hich was present in the
previous planning regime;
> new Public Service Agreements (PSAs)
through w hich each department is
committed to deliver challenging
outcome-focused targets; and
> Resource Accounting and Budgeting,
which measures the full economic costs
of government activity and provides
better information and incentives for
public sector managers.
The Budget
The Budget is the Government’s main
economic statement of the year and is usually
issued in March. In a major speech to
Parliament, the Chancellor of the Exchequer
reviews the nation’s economic performance
and describes the Government’s economic
objectives and the economic policies it intends
to follow in order to achieve them. The 2001
Budget report comprised two documents:
> the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report,
describing the comprehensive strategy
w hich the Government is pursuing to
meet its economic objectives, the
progress that has been made so far, and
how the 2001 Budget took further steps
to meet the Government’s objectives;
and
> the Financial Statement and Budget
Report, providing a summary of each of
the main Budget measures and updated
forecasts for the economy and the public
finances.
In advance of the spring Budget, the
Government publishes a Pre-Budget Report,
usually in the previous November. As well as
setting out economic and fiscal developments
and prospects, it describes the direction of
government policy and sets out for
387
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
consultation measures under consideration for
the forthcoming Budget.
INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL
POLICY
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) aims to increase UK competitiveness
and scientific excellence in order to generate
higher levels of sustainable growth and
productivity. It has four specific objectives:
> to promote enterprise, innovation and
higher productivity;
> to make the most of the UK’s scientific,
engineering and technological
capabilities;
> to create strong and competitive markets
within a fair and effective regulatory
framework; and
> to assist the competitiveness of UK
companies through export promotion and
inward investment.
Competitiveness
In February 2001 the DTI published the
second in its series of UK competitiveness
indicators, which showed that the UK was
well placed to meet the challenges of the
global economy, although its productivity was
still lagging significantly behind that of its
main competitors in the G7 group of
countries. Among the UK’s strengths
highlighted were:
> economic stability based on low inflation
and strong public finances;
> an open and competitive economy,
relatively free from regulation;
> an economy open to international trade
and investment, with foreign direct
investment reaching record levels in
2000;
> higher levels of business investment;
> an increase in the level of employment,
with unemployment rates at their lowest
since the 1970s;
> a strong science base, with UK research
highly regarded around the world; and
> strengths in some key knowledge-
intensive sectors (such as software,
pharmaceuticals and biotechnology), with
exports of these goods and services
having grown strongly and now
representing a higher proportion of UK
exports than in any other G7 country.
The indicators found that the UK’s
economic performance was held back by low
levels of basic skills (such as literacy and
numeracy) and vocational skills, low spending
levels on research and development (R&D)
and low levels of investment. However, in
recent years there has been a rapid rise in
business investment in the UK, progress
towards the national learning targets (see
p. 144) and the new R&D tax credit (see
p. 406), which is designed to help increase
UK spending on innovation.
In February 2001 the Government issued
a White Paper, Opportunity for All in a
World of Change, setting out its policy for
improving competitiveness and closing
the productivity gap with its competitors.
It includes measures designed to:
> improve the level of skills, including
literacy, numeracy and vocational
skills (see chapter 10) and those in
information and communications
technology (ICT);
> increase the rate of growth in all
regions of the UK, through a new
regional policy (see p. 391);
> promote the exploitation of scientific
advances by business (see chapter
25); and
> create a regulatory and financial
environment that helps to foster
enterprise and growth.
Enterprise, Innovation and Business
Support
The DTI promotes enterprise and innovation
by encouraging successful business start-ups
and offering businesses a number of support
services. Most support is designed to assist
business, especially small and medium-sized
388
22: THE ECONOMY
enterprises (SMEs), to expand and invest, and
to adopt best practice.
The Small Business Service (SBS) was set
up in April 2000 as a separate DTI agency to
act as a strong voice within government for
small businesses and to improve government
programmes promoting small businesses. It
also aims to reduce the burden of regulation
on small businesses, and to ensure that the
interests of SMEs are considered in future
regulations. The SBS is advised by the Small
Business Council, a non-departmental public
body with 20 members, most of whom are
entrepreneurs with experience of running
an SME.
The Business Link network, which reports
to the SBS, was restructured in March 2001.
The network now comprises 45 operators
throughout England formed by partnerships
between local enterprise agencies, local
authorities, chambers of commerce and some
commercial organisations with wider interests.
In addition, the network can be accessed
nationally via a contact centre and associated
website (www.businesshnk.org). Business Link,
which offers information and advice on a wide
range of subjects, is the ‘gateway’ to a network
of business support organisations, as well as to
information from the public, private and
voluntary sectors. The main advice services
are delivered by personal business advisers,
who either give advice or arrange
appointments with the relevant experts.
Elsewhere in the UK similar business
support arrangements apply:
> in lowland Scotland, the Small Business
Gateway, launched in July 2000, offers a
package of measures designed to improve
the quality and consistency of public
sector support for new and small
businesses in the Scottish Enterprise
area, while the Business Information
Source of Highlands and Islands
Enterprise operates equivalent services;
> in Wales, Business Connect covers all the
main business support agencies and has a
network of business support and front¬
line advice centres; and
> in Northern Ireland, small firms are
helped by the Local Enterprise
Development Unit (LEDU), with its
headquarters in Belfast and its network of
five regional offices. LEDU will form
part of the new single agency planned for
the beginning of 2002 (see p. 393).
Business Finance
Small businesses can face particular
difficulties accessing finance and, in the
Government’s view, it has a role to play in
addressing this market weakness. The SBS is
developing new early-growth funding in order
to encourage risk funding of start-ups and
growth firms that are currently too riskv for
the banks or too small for traditional venture
capital. Funding will be stimulated to facilitate
the availability of small amounts of risk capital
for innovative and knowledge-intensive
businesses as well as for smaller manufacturers
needing fresh investment to pursue new
opportunities. The SBS will target businesses
seeking to raise up to £50,000 and aims to
help 1,000 businesses over the next three
years, committing up to £50 million.
The Phoenix Fund has been set up to
encourage entrepreneurship in disadvantaged
areas and w ithin disadvantaged groups.
Funding is awarded to individuals and
companies investing in Community
Development Financial Institutions to
encourage private investment in under-
invested communities. Funding is on the basis
of a competitive bidding process. Of the 57
bids received in the first round of bidding, 16
w ere assessed as suitable for support,
involving funds of some £6 million over three
years from 2001-02. A further round of
bidding w ill be held in autumn 2001.
The Government has created the £180
million Enterprise Fund to stimulate more
finance for small businesses and to address
market weaknesses in the provision of that
finance. The main elements of the Fund are:
> the Small Firms Loan Guarantee
Scheme, which offers guarantees on loans
to small firms with viable business
proposals that are unable to obtain
conventional finance as they lack security
to offer against a loan. For established
businesses that have been trading for tw o
years or more, the SBS provides a
389
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
guarantee of 85% on loans of up to
^250,000 and for other businesses,
including start-ups, the guarantee is 70%
on loans of up to £100,000. Since the
scheme started in 1981 over 71,000 loans,
valued at over £2.5 billion, have been
guaranteed;
> the UK High Technology Fund, which
has raised £126 million and has been
established as a ‘fund of funds’—it is
making commitments to invest in
existing venture capital funds that
specialise in investing in early-growth,
high-technology companies; and
> new Regional Venture Capital Funds
specialising in the provision of small-
scale equity (up to £500,000) to small
businesses with growth potential—they
are being established on the basis of at
least one in each of the English regions.
The £75 million Small Business Service
Business Incubation Fund will provide loans
to those in the English regions setting up or
running business incubation projects (helping
SMEs to survive and grow when they are at
their most vulnerable in their start-up and
early growth stages) whose development plans
are hindered by a shortfall in funding from
other sources. Loans averaging £1 million will
be available for new incubators, and of up to
£500,000 for refurbishment of workspace
premises into incubators and the installation of
infrastructure, such as broadband
communications and relevant support
services. The Fund will be open from autumn
2001 until 2004-05.
The SBS will be inviting proposals from a
variety of organisations, including Business
Links, for initiatives aimed at helping small
businesses to better understand external
finance and to become more investment-
ready. The Small Business Investment
Taskforce was set up in October 2000 and
includes representatives of banks and other
finance providers, accountancy bodies,
academics and representatives of small firms.
It advises the SBS on how best to stimulate
the operation of markets providing finance for
small business. It is also working with the
Regional Development Agencies (see p. 392)
and other bodies towards the creation of a new
fund, with a target of £1 billion, comprising
investment from the UK Government, the
EU and private sector sources to develop the
market in venture capital.
The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise
The Queen’s Awards for Enterprise scheme
recognises outstanding performance by UK
firms. The Awards, which are made annually
and are valid for five years, are granted by the
Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister,
who is assisted by an advisory committee
consisting of senior representatives from
business, trade unions and government
departments. Any self-contained ‘industrial
unit’ in the UK with at least two full-time
employees is eligible to apply so long as it meets
the scheme’s criteria. Winners are entitled to
display the Award Emblem on their goods,
packaging, advertising and letter headings. In
2001, 133 companies received Awards: 76 for
International Trade, 42 for Innovation and 15
for Sustainable Development.
Information and Communications
Technology
The Government is keen to ensure that the
UK benefits fully from the rapid
developments in ICT, including the growth of
the Internet (see p. 286) and of‘e-commerce’.
Its e-commerce strategy aims to ensure that
the UK is the best environment in the world
to do business electronically, and that, by
2005, there will be universal access to the
Internet within the UK, with everyone who
wants it having access. The Office of the
‘e-Envoy’ has been set up to take forward this
strategy. For further information on ICT and
e-commerce, see the essay on p. 536.
Quality, Standards and Design1
Quality is important throughout the business
cycle—design, production, marketing and
delivery to customers. Conformity assessment
is a key part of the quality infrastructure
encompassing certification of products,
1 For more information on Design see the essay on p. 31 I.
390
22: THE ECONOMY
processes, services and personnel to indicate
that they meet certain criteria, such as
standards and technical regulations.
Conformity assessment conducted by third-
party organisations can provide an impartial
assessment, which is given greater emphasis
when these bodies are themselves accredited
by an authoritative body. In the UK the
L nited Kingdom Accreditation Service is
recognised by the Government as the sole
national accreditation body. Companies that
use accredited conformity assessment bodies in
certain sectors are entitled to use the national
accreditation mark—the ‘tick and crown’.
British Standards Institution
The British Standards Institution (BSI) is the
national standards body and is independent of
the Government. It works with business,
consumers and the Government to produce
standards relevant to the needs of the market
and suitable for public purchasing and
regulatory purposes. The Kitemark is BSPs
registered product certification trade mark.
Government support for BSI is directed
particularly towards European and
international standards, which account for
over 90% of its work.
National Measurement System
The National Measurement System (NMS) is
the UK’s national infrastructure of
laboratories (see p. 437), which provides
standards of measurement for use in trade,
industry, academia and government. The
NMS supports innovation in industry
generally, by enabling the benefits of new
products and processes to be measured, and
specifically, by stimulating new product
development in the instrument sector. It also
raises productivity through improved process
and quality control. The DTI is responsible
for government programmes for the NMS and
for policy on measurement standards.
Regional Development
The W hite Paper Opportunity for All in a
World of Change set out the Government’s
new regional policy, which aims to raise GDP
in the regions, improve skills, and help
industry through restructuring and
encouraging new industries as they develop.
Measures planned include:
> establishing University Innovation
Centres (long-term research partnerships
between major business interests and the
universities) and New Technology-
Institutes (based on partnerships between
universities, colleges and local business),
with the aim of boosting the levels of
R&D, innovation and technology
transfer, and of increasing skills in ICT
and high technology;
> creating a Business Incubation Fund (see
p. 390) and Regional Venture Capital
Funds (see p. 390);
> introducing a Manufacturing Advisory-
Service, which will be set up in
partnership with the Regional
Development Agencies and the SBS to
provide practical help with new
manufacturing technology;
> setting up the Job Transition Service (see
p. 156), to enable individuals affected by
large-scale redundancies to find new jobs
more quickly , and to help growing
companies tackle skill shortages; and
> supporting the development of business
‘clusters’, local concentrations of
businesses in a particular sector—the UK
has a number of successful clusters, such
as high technology industries in
Cambridge and Oxford, and several
developing clusters, such as biomedical
industries in the North West and leisure
software in Yorkshire.
Financial help is focused on the Assisted
Areas, covering some 16.5 million people in
Great Britain and all 1.7 million people in
Northern Ireland. Regional Selective
Assistance (RSA) is the main instrument of
government support to industry in the
Assisted Areas in Great Britain, and is now
focusing more on high-quality, knowledge-
based projects that provide skilled jobs. In
2000-01, 304 offers of RSA grants totalling
£205 million were accepted in England in

support of projects with total investment of
£2.2 billion, which is expected to create or
safeguard 32,000 jobs. The Enterprise Grant
scheme is providing grants towards capital
projects to growing SMEs in England in the
Assisted Areas and other specified areas with
particular needs.
England
Nine Regional Development Agencies (RDAs)
have been set up in England (see also chapter
2). They aim to stimulate economic
development and regeneration; promote
business efficiency, investment,
competitiveness and employment; raise the
level of skills; and contribute to the
achievement of sustainable development. The
RDAs have developed regional economic
strategies, which have identified the
importance of developing their skills base,
encouraging enterprise, and building a
stronger capacity for innovation and
technology transfer. They work closely with
other bodies, such as Government Offices for
the Regions, chambers of commerce, the SBS
and Business Links.
Funding for RDAs totalled £1.5 billion in
2001-02, which will rise to £1.7 billion by
2003-04. RDA programmes include the
Single Regeneration Budget (focused on
community-based regeneration) and the Rural
Development Programme (see chapter 26),
and the Skills Development Fund. Financial
support available to stimulate regional
innovation includes DTFs Regional
Innovation Fund, which will provide funding
of £50 million a year for RDAs to invest in
projects which will promote regional
competitiveness, innovation and enterprise,
and to support cluster development and
networks of businesses in their regions. From
April 2002 the different funding streams used
to provide RDA funding will be pooled
together into a single budget, allowing RDAs
the flexibility to concentrate their resources
according to regional priorities.
Scotland
In Scotland the Scottish Executive Enterprise
and Lifelong Learning Department, which has
overall responsibility for development of the
Scottish economy, operates a range of schemes
to support business. Scottish Enterprise and
Highlands and Islands Enterprise are the lead
economic development agencies in lowland
and highland Scotland respectively, operating
mainly through the network of Local
Enterprise Companies (LECs—see p. 142).
Following a major review of the structure,
functions and activities of the enterprise
networks in 2000—01, a number of significant
changes have been implemented with the aim
of delivering a more streamlined and effective
development network in Scotland. The
strategy for enterprise, ‘A Smart Successful
Scotland’ is aimed at clarifying the
relationships with the Scottish Executive and
at laying the foundation for a sustained
improvement in economic performance by
focusing the enterprise networks on three
main aspects of raising productivity:
encouraging entrepreneurship, raising skill
levels and improving international links.
Changes include the launch of the Small
Business Gateway scheme (see p. 389); a
change in the status of LECs, so that they will
become wholly owned by either Scottish
Enterprise or Highlands and Islands
Enterprise; and the creation of Local
Economic Forums, which will consider local
needs within the national framework and aim
to achieve a simpler, more cohesive structure
in local economic development.
Wales
The National Assembly for Wales is preparing
a new national economic development
strategy, which will be launched in December
2001. The Assembly’s priorities are improving
productivity, through focusing on particular
sectors and clusters, and improving skills and
entrepreneurship; tackling unemployment and
supporting community regeneration; ensuring
balanced and sustainable development; and
delivering better government. Following a
review of business support and development
services by the Economic Development
Committee of the National Assembly,
published in January 2001, the Welsh
Development Agency (WDA) is to become
responsible for the ‘gateway’ for all public
392
22: THE ECONOMY
sector business support services; the new
arrangements are expected to take effect in
April 2002.
The Welsh Development Agency is the lead
body for economic development. Its main role
is to support and sustain business success,
enabling businesses to prosper in both the
local economy and the global marketplace.
T he WDA is focusing its activities on
encouraging businesses to increase the level of
value added, on supporting innovation and
encouraging entrepreneurship and
e-commerce.
Northern Ireland
A new agency, to be known as Investment
Northern Ireland (INI), is to be set up by the
beginning of 2002 to promote and support
innovation and entrepreneurship in the
Northern Ireland economy. As well as the
business support aspects of the Northern
Ireland Tourist Board, INI will be responsible
for the functions currently undertaken by
three bodies:
> the Industrial Development Board,
which deals with overseas companies
considering Northern Ireland as an
investment location, as well as the
development of local companies with
more than 50 employees;
> the Local Enterprise Development Unit,
which promotes enterprise and the
development of small business; and
> the Industrial Research and Technology
Unit, which provides advice and
assistance on R&D, innovation and
technology transfer.
European Union Regional Funding
The EU seeks to promote economic and social
cohesion, reducing disparities between the
regions and countries of the Union. The
principal responsibility for helping poorer
areas remains with national authorities, but
the EU provides additional funding and
targets the worst affected areas through its
Structural Funds. The major fund is the
European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF), which supports regional
competitiveness, training, economic
development and innovation.
The UK is due to receive nearly £10.7
billion from the Funds in 2000-06. Funding is
supporting a range of projects, designed to
encourage businesses to grow, create suitable
conditions for inward investment and new
jobs, assist the most disadvantaged areas and
the socially excluded, and help people to learn
new skills.
The highest level of assistance is available to
areas with ‘Objective F status, where GDP is
less than 75% of the EU average. In the UK
about £3 billion is allocated to four Objective
1 areas: Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly,
Merseyside, South Yorkshire, and West Wales
and the Valleys. In recognition of the special
position of Northern Ireland and the
structural problems faced by the Highlands
and Islands of Scotland, both of which used to
have Objective 1 status, these two areas are
eligible for special transition packages, with
funding levels broadly equivalent to Objective
1 status.
Aid is also available to areas qualifying for
‘Objective 2’ status, which covers industrial
and urban areas in need of regeneration,
declining rural areas, and depressed areas
dependent on fisheries. About 13.8 million
people in the UK are in Objective 2 areas and
a further 6 million benefit from transitional
programmes.
Competitive Markets
In the Government’s view, competitive
markets provide the best means of ensuring
that the UK economy’s resources are put to
their most effective use by encouraging
enterprise and efficiency, and widening
choice. The Government is committed to
modernising and strengthening the UK’s
competition laws, with the aim of ensuring
that effective and dynamic competition is
delivered across the economy, as part of its
wider agenda for promoting competitiveness
and growth.
In July 2001 the Government published a
White Paper Productivity and Enterprise—A
World Class Competition Regime, setting out a
consultation process scheduled for completion
393
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
in October 2001. The White Paper proposals
include:
> reforms to the merger and monopoly
regimes, with decisions being taken by
independent competition authorities;
> new duties for the Office of Fair Trading
(OFT) fwwrp. oft.gov.uk) to promote
competition;
> consultation on criminal penalties for
those involved in cartels; and
> a proposal to give the OFT and other
competition regulators a new role to
assess when laws and regulations might
create barriers to entry and competition,
or channel markets in a particular
direction.
Competition Act 1998
The Competition Act 1998 came into force in
March 2000 and is enforced by the Director
General of Fair Trading and the utility
regulators who have concurrent powers in
their sectors. The Act introduced two
prohibitions:
> of agreements which prevent, restrict or
distort competition and which may affect
trade within the UK (the Chapter I
prohibition); and
> of conduct by undertakings that amounts
to an abuse of a dominant position in a
market and may affect trade in the UK
(the Chapter II prohibition).
The Chapter I and II prohibitions are based
on articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of Rome,
and the 1998 Act sets out principles which
provide for the UK authorities to handle cases
in such a way as to ensure consistency with
EC law.
An agreement will infringe the Chapter I
prohibition only if it has as its object or effect
an appreciable prevention, restriction or
distortion on competition in the UK. The
Director General takes the view that an
agreement will generally have no appreciable
effect on competition if the parties’ combined
share of the market does not exceed 25%,
although there will be circumstances when
this is not the case.
For the purposes of the Chapter II
prohibition, an undertaking will be considered
dominant if it can behave ‘to an appreciable
extent independently of its competitors and
customers and ultimately of consumers’ when
making commercial decisions. This has to be
judged against the background of a properly
defined relevant market through the
assessment of the goods and services that form
part of the market (the product market) and
the geographical extent of the market.
The Act gives the Director General the
power to impose financial penalties of up to
10% of turnover in the UK on an undertaking
that has infringed either prohibition.
Between March 2000 and the end of May
2001 the OFT received over 5,000 complaints
alleging breach of the Competition Act 1998
or concerning the complex monopoly
provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973.
These complaints resulted in 2,065
preliminary inquiries being opened to
consider the allegations; 68 resulted in
investigations.
The OFT’s review of competition in the
legal, accountancy and architecture
professions in England and Wales,
published in March 2001, found that there
were numerous possible restrictions on
competition in the professions. It
recommended that the professions should
be fully subject to competition law and
that unjustified restrictions on
competition should be removed, although
it recognised that there might be
countervailing benefits to some of the
potential restrictions it identified. The
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
agreed that the professions should be fully
subject to competition law and announced
that the entitlement to exclusion from the
provisions of the Competition Act 1998
should be removed. Consultation on those
aspects of the report that fall to the
Government is planned for autumn 2001.
394
22: THE ECONOMY
The Competition Commission
{vpvpvp.competition.commission.org.uk) has two
main arms:
> a reporting arm, which investigates
various aspects of monopolies and
mergers referred by the Director General
of Fair Trading or a utility regulator; and
> an Appeal Tribunals arm, which hears
appeals against decisions of the Director
General of Fair Trading and the
regulators on the prohibitions of anti¬
competitive agreements and abuse of a
dominant position.
Monopolies
The framework under the Fair Trading Act
1973 for dealing with scale and complex
monopolies2 has been retained alongside the
Competition Act. The Director General of
Fair Trading, and those utility regulators
which have parallel powers to apply the
monopoly provisions of the 1973 Act, may
examine such monopolies and make a
reference to the Competition Commission to
establish whether a monopoly operates, or
may be expected to operate, against the public
interest.
Mergers
A merger qualifies for investigation if it
involves the acquisition of assets of more than
£70 million or the creation or enhancement of
a 25% share of the supply of a particular good
or service in the UK or a substantial part of it.
There is a voluntary procedure for pre¬
notification of proposed mergers. Qualifying
mergers are considered by the Director
General of Fair Trading, who then advises the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on
whether the merger should be referred to the
2 A scale monopoly exists where a single company (or a group
of interconnected companies) supplies or acquires at least 25%
of the goods or services of a particular type in all or part of the
UK. A complex monopoly exists where a group of companies
which are not connected and together account for at least 25%
of the supply of, or acquisition of, any particular description of
goods or services in all or part of the UK engage in conduct
which has, or is likely to have, the effect of restricting,
distorting or preventing competition.
Competition Commission. The Secretary of
State’s policy is to follow the advice of the
Director General on reference, unless there
are exceptional circumstances. In general, a
reference to the Competition Commission will
be made where the merger raises competition
concerns. In rare cases a merger reference may
be based on other public interest issues.
Alternatively, the Secretary of State may ask
the Director General to obtain suitable
undertakings from the companies involved to
remedy the adverse effects identified.
Most mergers are cleared without being
referred to the Competition Commission.
If the Competition Commission finds that a
merger could be expected to operate against
the public interest, the Secretary of State can
prohibit it, allow it, or allow it subject to
certain conditions being met. Where the
merger has already taken place, action can be
taken to reverse it. There are special
provisions for newspaper and water company
mergers.
The European Commission has exclusive
jurisdiction in mergers which meet certain
domestic, EC and global turnover thresholds.
The Commission can ban mergers if it
concludes that they would create or strengthen
a dominant position which would significantly
impede effective competition within the EU or
a substantial part of it; alternatively, it may
negotiate undertakings to correct the adverse
effect.
Utility Regulation
There are a number of organisations
regulating the privatised utilities, and their
aim is to promote the interests of consumers,
for example through ensuring effective
competition. The Utilities Act 2000 replaced
the two separate regulators for gas and
electricity with a single regulatory body,
Ofgem (see p. 500).
EU Single Market
The Government is working with the
European Commission and other Member
States to ensure effective competition within
the single market (see p. 417). It is looking to
improve the way the market operates through
395
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
wide-ranging economic reforms which target
‘weak areas’ (those areas where the single
market does not work as well as it could)
identified by the Commission. By the end of
May 2001, 96.7% of single market measures
had been incorporated into UK law.
CORPORATE AFFAIRS
Corporate Structure
There are about 1,406,000 ‘live’ companies
registered in Great Britain with the Registrar
of Companies. Companies incorporated
overseas with a place of business or branch in
Great Britain must also register. Most
corporate businesses are ‘limited liability’
companies, in which the liability of members
is restricted to contributing an amount related
to their shareholding (or to their guarantee
where companies are limited by guarantee).
The Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000
created a new type of body, the limited
liability partnership (LLP). Since April 2001
a firm has been able to be incorporated as an
LLP, with the organisational flexibility and
tax status of a partnership but with limited
liability for its members.
Companies may be either public or private;
about 12,800 are public limited companies
(pics). A company must satisfy certain
conditions before it can become a pic. It must
be limited by shares and meet specified
minimum capital requirements. Private
companies are generally prohibited from
offering their shares to the public.
Company Law and Corporate
Governance
Company law is designed to meet the need for
proper regulation of business, to maintain
open markets and to create safeguards for
those wishing to invest in companies or do
business with them. It takes account of EC
Directives on company law, and on company
and group accounts and their auditing.
In 1998 the DTI initiated a fundamental
review of company law to produce a modern
framework which encourages both
competitiveness and accountability. The
review was overseen by an independent
steering group of experts, and the group’s
final report and recommendations to the
Government were published in July 2001. Key
recommendations, which, if accepted by the
Government, would need to be implemented
through a new Companies Act, include:
> simplification of the law for small
companies, with simpler decision-making
and administrative requirements and less
burdensome accounting and audit
obligations;
> a statutory statement of directors’ duties
to encourage responsible and informed
decision-making;
> an operating and financial review, to
improve the quality of reporting by larger
companies;
> tighter annual reporting cycles, with
more effective use of new technology to
open up financial and other information
for shareholders and others; and
> streamlined procedures to remove
unnecessary constraints and costs, and to
improve the operation of the law.
The Government believes that greater
business involvement in corporate social
responsibility (CSR) can make an important
contribution to addressing social problems,
help to tackle deprivation and promote a
fairer, more inclusive society, while at the
same time improving business
competitiveness. In March 2001 it produced
its first report on CSR, business and society,
and identified four key priorities for
government:
> promoting good practice, in particular in
the provision of advice to SMEs;
> supporting work to demonstrate the
business case, in particular in two areas
where the Government is keen to see
greater business involvement—
investment in deprived communities and
work to improve adult literacy and
numeracy skills;
> promoting international action on CSR;
and
> coordinating action across government
departments.
396
22: THE ECONOMY
Insolvent and Bankruptcy
The Government has announced its intention
to make major changes to the law on
insolvency and bankruptcy. In the White
Paper Opportunity for All in a World of Change,
it announced that insolvency law and practice
would be brought up to date to help enhance
entrepreneurial culture. Further details were
given in the White Paper Productivity and
Enterprise: Insolvency—A Second Chance,
published in July 2001. This modernisation
would build on the provisions of the
Insolvency Act 2000, which gives more time to
small firms in short-term financial difficulties
to agree a rescue plan with their creditors, and
has speeded up the process of disqualifying
unfit company directors. Following a review
of the law on personal bankruptcy, the
Government is developing proposals to
distinguish between those who fail to save
their business for reasons beyond their control
(such as insufficient funds) despite their best
efforts and those who are irresponsible,
reckless or negligent. For the large majority of
bankrupts whose failure is genuine, the
Government is proposing a much earlier
discharge from bankruptcy. Those who are
irresponsible, reckless or negligent may be
subject to restrictions for up to 15 years.
Regulation of Business
The Regulatory Reform Act 2001 provides
a new mechanism for reforming regulatory
regimes affecting business and other sectors.
The Government has identified over 50
potential reforms using the Act, to deal with
outdated and over-complex legislation.
Consultation documents have been issued
containing proposals in a number of areas,
including grants and loans for modernising
private sector housing, licensing hours for
public houses, business leases, gaming
machines (allowing people to use banknotes
and smartcards’) and partnerships (where the
restriction on professional and other groups
from forming partnerships of over 20 people
would be ended).
The Cabinet Office’s Regulatory Impact
Unit works to ensure that all proposals for
regulations are fully assessed before their
introduction and that the benefits justify the
costs, while the Small Business Service
assesses proposals from the point of view of
small firms to ensure that they are not
disproportionately affected. Each government
department has a minister responsible for its
regulatory reform programme, and these
ministers are called to account by the Panel for
Regulatory Accountability, which is chaired
by the Minister for the Cabinet Office.
Industrial Associations
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI)
(pxvw.chi.org.uk) is the largest business
organisation in the UK. \\ ith a membership
comprising companies and trade associations,
it represents some 200,000 firms which
employ about 7.5 million people. The CBFs
objective is to help create and sustain the
conditions in which British business can
compete and prosper, both in the UK and
overseas. Examples of its work include
lobbying to minimise the burden of regulation
and campaigning to spread best practice. The
CBI also offers a wide range of advisory
services, including a series of regular economic
surveys. It is the British member of the Union
of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations
(UNICE). The CBI has 13 regional offices
and an office in Brussels, and opened an office
in Washington in the United States in 2001.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC)
comprise nationally a network of chambers of
commerce, which are local, independent, non-
profit-making organisations funded by
membership subscriptions. With over 2,500
staff covering more than 100 locations, the
network provides a wide range of services for
its membership of over 135,000 businesses.
Services provided include business training,
commercial services, export-related services,
financial services and access to information
resources. The BCC represents business views
to the Government at national and local levels
and is also part of the global network of
chambers of commerce.
The Institute of Directors (IOD) has
around 53,000 members in the UK. It
provides business advisory services on
matters affecting company directors, such
as corporate management, insolvency and
397
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
career counselling, and represents the
interests of members to authorities in the UK
and EU. In autumn 2000 it opened the first of
20 new business centres for SMEs in UK
cities.
Enterprise Insight (rpmp.enterpriseinsight.
co.uk), a government-supported initiative
launched in 2000 and led by a company
owned jointly by the BCC, CBI and IOD, is
aiming to encourage more positive attitudes to
enterprise among young people aged 5 to 30
and to develop their entrepreneurial skills.
Up to 1,000 ‘ambassadors’ from business are
helping to develop closer links between
schools and the business community.
The Federation of Small Businesses is the
largest pressure group promoting the interests
of the self-employed and small firms. The
Federation has 160,000 members, and
provides them with expert information and
guidance on subjects such as taxation,
employment, health and safety, and insurance.
Trade associations represent companies that
produce or sell a particular product or group
of products. They exist to supply common
services, regulate trading practices and
represent their members in dealings with
government departments. For information on
trade associations and trade unions see
chapter 11.

Main Sources of Revenue
404
The UK Government’s spending and revenue are forecast to approach .£400
billion in 2001-02. Total public expenditure is forecast to grow by 3%% a year in
real terms in the three years to 2003-04. Public finances have been improving,
reflecting higher revenues and the relatively low growth in social security
spending and the lower cost of interest payments on government debt. As a
result, more resources are available and are being allocated to key public
services, such as education and health.
Total Managed Expenditure—the main
concept in the management of public
expenditure (see p. 401)—rose, in terms of
1999-2000 prices, from £262.4 billion in
1979-80 to £343.5 billion in 1999-2000.
During this period it peaked as a proportion of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at 48.6% in
1982—83, but by 1999—2000 had fallen to
37.9%. In the same period net taxes and social
security contributions as a proportion of GDP
ranged between 33% and 39%, and in
1999-2000 were 36.9%.
MAIN PROGRAMMES
The 2000 Spending Review rolled forward
the three-year planning cycle, established
in the Comprehensive Spending Review in
1998, and set new departmental sptndmg
plans for 2001—02 to 2003—04. Current
spending is planned to grow by 21/2% a year
in real terms, in line with the UK’s economic
growth rate, while net public sector
investment is expected to rise to 1.7% of GDP
by 2003-04.
Spending Priorities
The main categories of expenditure are shown
in Figure 23.2 on p. 401. Social security is the
biggest single element, involving expenditure
of £109 billion (nearly 28% of spending) in
2001—02, followed by spending on the
National Health Service (NHS) of £59 billion
and on education of £50 billion.
Areas in which the Government is planning
higher expenditure include education, health,
transport, law and order, deprived
neighbourhoods, and science. For example,
spending on the NHS is planned to rise at an
annual rate of growth in real terms of 6.3%
between 1999-2000 and 2003-04, and is being
accompanied by reforms to the NHS under
the NHS Plan (see p. 188). In the March 2001
Budget the Government announced an
additional £2.3 billion of spending over the
next three years in three areas:
> £1 billion on education, including £600
million which will be made available to
head teachers to modernise school
buildings and equipment and to improve

help schools implement recruitment and
retention incentives for teachers;
> £1 billion on health, including £450
million for hospital investment to help
pay for new equipment, such as scanners;
and
> £300 million to help tackle misuse of
drugs, with extra resources, for example,
to Crime and Disorder Reduction
Partnerships (see p. 216).
Local authorities are estimated to have
spent about £91 billion in 2000-01, around a
quarter of public expenditure. The main
categories of expenditure are education, law
and order, personal social services, housing
and other environmental services, and roads
and transport.
Net public investment is planned to rise to
£19 billion by 2003-04 (see Table 23.1). The
Capital Modernisation Fund is supporting
innovative capital projects aimed at improving
delivery of public services, and funds have
been allocated to departments on a
competitive basis. Allocations in the first three
rounds of funding totalled £3.3 billion,
including £470 million to provide 1,000 UK
Online and City learning centres across the
UK (see p. 143) and £68 million to match job
seekers to employers online. Under the Invest
to Save Budget, some £380 million will have
been allocated up to the period 2003-04 to
projects designed to improve public service
operations through partnership between
public sector bodies.
Control of Spending
In the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review,
the Government introduced a new framework
for public spending. The main elements of the
reforms include:
> replacing the annual Public Expenditure
Survey with firm plans set for three
years, through Departmental
Expenditure Limits (DELs). Where
expenditure such as social security
benefit payments cannot be planned on a
multi-year basis, it is subject to annual
scrutiny as part of the Budget process—
such expenditure is denoted Annually
Managed Expenditure;
> separating spending into capital and
resource (formerly current) budgets with
tight controls on transfers from capital to
resource spending to ensure that short¬
term pressures do not squeeze out
essential investment;
> allowing underspending within DELs in
a given year to be carried over to the

In the third round of the Invest to Save
Budget, announced in March 2001, 123
projects were selected for funding totalling
£60 million. Among the projects are:
> ‘Police Direct’, a project involving the
police and criminal justice
organisations that will develop a police
‘portal’ to provide services
electronically to the citizen in the most
efficient and cost-effective manner;
> ‘Skill Force’, in which retired military
instructors in a number of pilot
schemes will train disaffected
youngsters aged 15 or 16, with the aim
of reducing truancy and exclusion
from school, cutting juvenile crime
and raising educational attainment;
and
> ‘21st Century Citizen’, a project that
will support the inclusion of
citizenship as a subject in the National
Curriculum (see p. 132) by pooling
the resources of the Office for
National Statistics, the Public Record
Office and the British Library to
create an online resource for schools.
following year, so assisting departments
in managing their budgets and avoiding
wasteful end-of-year spending surges;
> establishing the National Asset Register
to improve the utilisation of existing
public sector assets (valued at over
£500 billion, around one-eighth of the
L K s total assets), while encouraging
departments to dispose of surplus assets;
> establishing Departmental Investment
Strategies to demonstrate that capital
investment is being used efficiently and
effectively—these strategies are taken
into account in the allocation of resources
from the Capital Modernisation Fund;
and
> introducing cross-departmental reviews
to tackle problems such as crime, drugs
and social exclusion—15 were conducted
in the 2000 Spending Review.
The main concept in the measurement of
public expenditure is Total Managed
Expenditure (see Table 23.3), over half of
which is managed through DELs and the
remainder is Annually Managed Expenditure.
In connection with the 2000 Spending
Review, departments have prepared new

Public Service Agreements (PSAs), listing
specific targets for improving public services
and departmental efficiency. For example,
there are PSA targets on reducing preventable
deaths from cancer and heart disease (see
chapter 13) and on increasing pupil
attainment. Departmental performance
against the targets is scrutinised by a Cabinet
Committee, which is chaired by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and supported
by a Public Services Productivity Panel of
experts from outside government. In
November 2000 a White Paper was issued,
containing new Service Delivery Agreements
for every government department, setting out
how the PSAs will be achieved.
The Office of Government Commerce
(OGC) was established as an office of HM
Treasury in 2000 to improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of the Government’s civil
procurement budget, of around £13 billion a
year. It aims to work with civil departments,
agencies and non-departmental public bodies
as a catalyst to achieve value for money in
their commercial activities. The OGC’s
activities include development of best practice,
the management of strategic suppliers, wider
use of‘e-procurement’, improving the
management of major projects, and raising the
professionalism and skills of staff involved in
procurement and project management. The
OGC is leading a wide-ranging programme to
modernise procurement in government and to
deliver substantial value for money gains by
developing the Government’s collective
purchasing power. It has established a new
‘Gateway’ process, which is becoming fully
operational in 2001, under which all large,
complex or novel projects must use
independent review teams to inform each
stage of procurement decision-making.
Under the Government Resources and
Accounts Act 2000, new Resource Accounting
and Budgeting (RAB) procedures (see p. 387)
became fully operational in April 2001. They
apply the financial reporting practices of the
private sector and much of the rest of the
public sector to government departments’
accounts, Estimates and Budgets. The changes
are designed to improve efficiency and focus
more on departmental objectives and outputs
in terms of resources used rather than the
money available for spending. According to
HM Treasury, this represented the biggest
overhaul of financial management in central
government since the 1860s.
Examination of Public Expenditure
Examination of public expenditure is carried
out by select committees of the House of
Commons. These study in detail the activities
of particular government departments and
question ministers and officials. The Public
Accounts Committee considers the accounts
of government departments, executive
agencies and other public sector bodies, and
examines reports by the Comptroller and
Auditor General on departments and their use
of resources.
402
23: PUBLIC FINANCE
Audit of the Government’s spending is
exercised through the functions of the
Comptroller and Auditor General, the head of
the National Audit Office (NAO). The NAO’s
responsibilities include certifying the accounts
of all government departments and executive
agencies, and those of a wide range of other
public sector bodies; scrutinising the efficiency
and effectiveness of their operations; examining
revenue accounts and inventories; and reporting
the results of these examinations to Parliament.
The Government is considering a review of
central government audit arrangements and
accountability, published in February 2001.
Public-Private Partnerships
The Government sees Public-Private
Partnerships (PPPs) as a key factor in the
delivery of high-quality public services, by
bringing in private sector management, finance
and ownership with the intention of improving
the value for money, efficiency and quality of
these services. The PPPs cover a variety of
arrangements, including joint ventures;
outsourcing; the sale of equity stakes in
government-owned businesses; and the Private
Finance Initiative (PFI), in which the public
sector specifies the service needed, in terms of
the outputs required, and private sector
companies compete to meet the requirements.
Major PPP projects include the Channel
Tunnel Rail Link (see p. 371), a scheme for
investment in the National Air Traffic Services
(see p. 376) and several projects for investment
in health and education.
Partnerships UK was set up in 2000 to help
the public sector develop more effective
partnerships with the private sector by
building on the work previously carried out by
a task force within HM Treasury. In April
2001 Partnerships UK became a PPP,
following the sale of 51% of the company to
private sector investors, with 49%
shareholding retained by HM Treasury and
the Scottish Executive.
DEBT MANAGEMENT
The Government finances its borrowing
requirement by selling debt to the private
sector. Public sector net debt has generally
been falling since 1996-97. At the end of
March 2001 it was ^306 billion, 31.6% of
GDP, compared with 36.8% at the end of
March 2000. Public sector net borrowing has
declined substantially, and was in surplus in
2000-01 by around ^16 billion (see Table
23.1) as a consequence of the strict fiscal
frameworks employed by the Government.
The objective of the Government’s debt
management policy is to minimise, over the
long term, the cost of meeting the
Government’s financing needs, taking into
account risk, while ensuring that debt
management policy is consistent with the
objectives of monetary policy. Responsibility
for managing government debt rests with a
Treasury agency, the United Kingdom Debt
Management Office.
Gilt-edged Stock
The major debt instrument, government
bonds, is known as gilt-edged stock (‘gilts’), as
government securities are judged by the
market as having the lowest risk of default.
Gilts include ‘conventionals’, which generally
pay fixed rates of interest and redemption
sums; and index-linked stocks, on which
principal and interest are linked to movements
in the Retail Prices Index. Gilt issues are
primarily by auction. The annual Debt and
Reserves Management Report sets out the
framework for issuing gilts in the coming year.
The financing requirement has been reduced
to a relatively low level. In 2000-01, £5.5
billion of debt was bought back: six reverse
auctions were held, which enabled the
Government to buy back £4.1 billion (cash)
debt from the market and £1.4 billion of gilts
were bought back as a result of net purchases
in the secondary market.
At the end of December 2000 holdings of
marketable gilts were estimated at £287
billion. This comprised £215 billion of
conventional gilts, £70 billion of index-linked
gilts and £2 billion of Treasury Bills.
Insurance companies and pension funds hold
just over 65% of gilts, UK households just
over 7% and participants in the rest of the
world 18%.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
MAIN SOURCES OF REVENUE
Government revenue is forecast to be £398
billion in 2001-02. The main sources (see
Figure 23.2) are:
> taxes on income (together with profits),
which include personal income tax,
corporation tax and petroleum revenue
tax (see p. 493);
> taxes on capital, which include
inheritance tax, capital gains tax, council
tax and non-domestic rates;
> taxes on expenditure, which include
VAT (value added tax) and customs and
excise duties; and
> National Insurance contributions (see
chapter 12).
Taxation Policy
The primary aim of tax policy is to raise
sufficient revenue for the Government to pay for
the services that its policies require, and to
service its debt, while keeping the overall burden
of tax as low as possible. The Government has
based its tax policy on the principles of
encouraging work, raising investment, and
promoting fairness and opportunity. It has taken
measures designed to improve productivity,
increase employment opportunities, tackle
child poverty and protect the environment.
Collection of Taxes and Duties
The Inland Revenue assesses and collects taxes
on income, profits and capital, and stamp duty
(see p. 409), and its Contributions Office is
responsible for collecting National Insurance
contributions. HM Customs and Excise collects
the most important taxes on expenditure (VAT
and most duties). Local authorities collect the
main local taxes, such as council tax.
Most wage and salary earners pay their
income tax under a Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE)
system whereby tax is deducted and accounted
for to the Inland Revenue by the employer, in
a way which enables most employees to pay
the correct amount of tax during the year.
Under the self-assessment system for
collecting personal taxation, some 8 million
The March 2001 Budget included:
> support for families and children,
including increases in the new
children’s tax credit, with a higher rate
in the first year of a child’s birth (see
p. 405) and a series of measures on
maternity pay and parental leave (see
p. 159);
> a widening of the lOp tax band (see
p. 405) by more than the rate of
increase in inflation;
> a series of measures aimed at
encouraging cleaner road transport,
and improving the efficiency of the
road haulage industry (see p. 408);
> measures to assist regeneration; and
> additional public expenditure in three
of the Government’s priority areas
(see p. 399).
people—primarily higher-rate taxpayers, the
self-employed and those receiving investment
income (particularly where this is paid without
tax being deducted at source)—are required to
complete an annual tax return for the Inland
Revenue. Such taxpayers may calculate their
own tax liability, although they can choose to
have the calculations done by the Inland
Revenue if they return the form by the end of
September.
Electronic transmission is already used to a
limited extent in the collection of taxes and
duties. To encourage greater use, tax
discounts have been introduced for electronic
filing of tax returns and payment of tax.
The UK has agreements governing double
taxation with over 100 countries, the largest
network of tax treaties in the world. They are
intended to avoid double taxation arising, to
deal with cross-border economic activity, and
to prevent fiscal discrimination against UK
business interests overseas. They also include
provisions to counter tax avoidance and
evasion.
Following a review of the informal
economy, published in March 2000, which
found that substantial sums were being lost to
the Exchequer, the Government set up a
confidential helpline and provided advice on
404

tax and National Insurance for people starting
their own business. To combat persistent tax
offences and benefit fraud, it has introduced a
number of measures, including making
fraudulent evasion of income tax a statutory
offence and requiring newly self-employed
people to notify the Inland Revenue within
three months of starting up a business.
Taxes on Income
Income Tax
Income tax is the biggest single contributor to
government receipts, accounting for around
11% of GDP in 2000—01, when it brought in
net receipts of £106.7 billion. In general, it is
charged on all income originating in the UK—
although some forms of income, such as child
benefit, are exempt—and on all income arising
abroad of people resident in the UK. Income
tax is imposed for the year of assessment
beginning on 6 April. The tax rates and bands
for 2000—01 and 2001-02 are shown in Table
23.4. The basic rate of 22% is the lowest basic
rate for nearly 70 years. As part of the
Government’s reforms designed to make it
financially worthwhile for people to work at all
levels of the labour market, especially those with
low incomes, a 10% starting rate of income tax
took effect in April 1999. In the March 2001
Budget the starting rate band was widened by
£300 above indexation (to take account of
inflation) from April 2001. Of around 27.6
million income taxpayers, 2.9 million are
expected to pay tax only at the starting rate of
10% in 2001-02, 21 million at 22% and 2.8
million at 40%, while 0.8 million ‘savers’ will
have a marginal rate of 10% or 20%.
Allowances and reliefs reduce an
individual’s income tax liability. All taxpayers
are entitled to a personal allowance against
income from all sources, with a higher
allowance for the elderly (see Table 23.4). One
of the most significant reliefs, which is
designed to encourage people to save towards
their retirement, covers contributions to
pension schemes, including the new
stakeholder pension introduced in April 2001
(see p. 172). Personal tax-free saving is also
encouraged through the Individual Savings
Account (ISA) (see p. 521).
In line with its policies of improving work
incentives, promoting a fair and efficient tax
system, and supporting families, the
Government has changed the system of
allowances and is introducing a series of tax
credits. The married couple’s allowance was
abolished in April 2000, except for married
couples where at least one of the two was aged
65 or over on 5 April 2000. Its successor,
introduced in April 2001, is the Children’s
Tax Credit (CTC), worth up to £520 a year
for families with one or more children under
16 living with them; the credit is reduced
where the main earner in the family is a higher
rate taxpayer. From April 2002 a higher rate
of CTC, worth up to £1,040 a year, will be
introduced for families in the year of a child’s
birth, to recognise the extra costs associated
with having a baby. The Working Families’
Tax Credit (WFTC—see chapter 12) is
designed to provide a guaranteed minimum
income for working families. From 2003 an
integrated child credit will bring together the
support for children in the WFTC, the CTC
and other forms of support, while a new
employment tax credit will extend the
principles of the \\ FTC to people without
children. A new Pension Credit is also
planned for 2003, with the aim of rewarding
pensioners for having built up savings during
their working lives or for continuing to work
beyond the state pension age (see p. 175).
Corporation Tax
The UK rate of corporation tax, payable by
companies on their income and capital gains,
is the lowest among major industrial countries.
The main rate of tax is 30%. Two lower rates
are also levied: a starting rate of 10% for the
smallest firms (those with annual profits of up
to £10,000) and a small companies’ rate of
20% levied on firms with annual profits
between £50,000 and £300,000. A sliding
scale of relief is allowed for companies with
annual profits between £10,000 and £50,000
and between £300,000 and £1.5 million, so
that the overall average rate paid by these
firms is between 10% and 20% and between
20% and 30% respectively.

buildings and scientific research, for
example—may qualify for relief in the form of
capital allowances. To boost investment in
manufacturing and services, the 40% first-
year allowance for expenditure on machinery
or plant by small or medium-sized businesses
has been made permanent. To encourage
more companies to invest in information and
communications technology (ICT) and adopt
electronic commerce, small businesses are able
to claim 100% first-year allowances on
investments in ICT between 1 April 2000 and
31 March 2003, so enabling them to write off
immediately the entire cost against their
taxable income. A new research and
development (R&D) tax credit for small firms
took effect in April 2000. In March 2001 the
Government published a consultation
document containing its proposals for a new
tax credit to encourage R&D and innovation
among larger firms.
Taxes on Capital
Capital Gains Tax
Capital gains tax (CGT) is payable by
individuals and trusts on gains realised from
the disposal of assets. It is payable on the
amount by which total chargeable gains for a
year exceed the exempt amount (£7,500 for
individuals and £3,750 for most trusts in
2001-02). Gains on some types of asset are
exempt from CGT, including the principal
private residence, government securities,
certain corporate bonds, and gains on holdings
of Personal Equity Plans and ISAs. For
individuals, CGT in 2001-02 will be payable
at 10%, 20% or 40%, depending on a person’s
marginal income tax rate.
CGT taper relief was introduced in 1998 to
succeed the previous system of indexation
relief to take account of inflation. The relief
reduces the amount of the chargeable gain
depending on how long an asset has been held.
Changes to the taper relief were introduced in
2000 with the intention of boosting
productivity, stimulating employee share
ownership, and encouraging ‘business angel’
investors to provide risk capital for growing
companies. The current CGT taper reliefs
reduce the percentage of the gain that is
chargeable for a business asset from 100% for
assets held for less than one year to 25% for
assets held for four years or more. For non¬
business assets the chargeable gain falls from
406
23: PUBLIC FINANCE
100% for assets held for less than three years
to 60% for assets held for ten years or longer.
Inheritance Tax
Inheritance tax is charged on estates at the time
of death and on gifts made within seven years of
death; most other lifetime transfers are not
taxed. There are several important exemptions,
including transfers between spouses, and gifts
and bequests to UK charities, major political
parties and heritage bodies. In general, business
assets and farmland are exempt from
inheritance tax, so that most family businesses
can be passed on without a tax charge.
Tax is charged at a single rate of 40% above
a threshold: £242,000 in 2001-02. Only about
4% of estates a year become liable for an
inheritance tax bill.
Taxes on Expenditure
Value Added Tax (VAT)
\ AT is a broadly based expenditure tax, which
is collected at each stage in the production and
distribution of goods and services. The final tax
is payable by the consumer. The standard rate is
17.5%, with a reduced rate of 5% on a number
of goods and services, including domestic fuel
and power, and the installation of energy -saving
materials in homes. Under the Finance Act
2001, the 5% rate is being extended to cover the
cost of converting residential properties into a
different number of dwellings (such as a house
into flats or into a residential care home), the
renovation of homes empty for three vears or
longer, and the purchase of children’s car seats.
Certain goods and services are relieved
from \ AT, either by being charged at a zero
rate or by being exempt:
> U nder zero rating, a taxable person does
not charge tax to a customer but reclaims
any VAT paid to suppliers. Among the
main categories where zero rating applies
are goods exported to other countries;
most food; water and sewerage for non¬
business use; domestic and international
passenger transport; books, newspapers
and periodicals; construction of new
residential buildings; young children’s
clothing and footwear; drugs and
medicines supplied on prescription;
specified aids for handicapped people;
and certain supplies by or to charities.
> For exempt goods or services, a taxable
person does not charge an}- VAT but is not
entitled to reclaim the VAT on goods and
sendees bought for his or her business. The
main categories where exemption applies
are many supplies of land and buildings;
financial services; postal services; betting;
gaming; lotteries; much education and
training; and health and welfare.
The March 2001 Budget contained a
package of measures designed to help small
businesses. A series of measures is being
introduced with the intention of helping small
companies as they grow, allowing them to
manage their entry into the VAT system and
improve their cash flow. This has included
raising the annual level of turnover above
which traders must register for VAT to
£54,000 from April 2001. More businesses are
expected to benefit from lower compliance
costs as a result of the decision to raise the
upper limit for filing VAT returns on an
annual rather than a quarterlv basis from
£300,000 to £600,000 in April 2001.
Customs Duties
Customs duties are chargeable on goods from
outside the European Union in accordance with
its Common Customs Tariff. Goods can move
freely across internal EU frontiers without
making customs entries at importation or
stopping for routine fiscal checks. For
commercial consignments, excise duty and
\ AT are charged in the Member State of
destination, at the rate in force in that state.
Excise Duties
Mineral oils used as road fuel are subject to
higher rates of duty than those used for other
purposes. As part of government measures to
encourage the use of more environmentally
friendly fuels, there are lower rates on fuels
such as ultra low sulphur petrol, ultra low
sulphur diesel, and on road fuel gases, such as
liquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural
gas. The March 2001 Budget further reduced
407
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
the duty on these fuels. Kerosene not used as
road or motor fuel, most lubricating oils and
oils used for certain industrial, horticultural
and marine uses are free of duty or attract very
low rates. Fuel substitutes are taxed at the same
rate as the corresponding mineral oil.
Cigarette duty is charged partly as a cash
amount per cigarette and partly as a
percentage of retail price. Duty on other
tobacco products is based on weight. To
support the Government’s health objectives
(see chapter 13), tobacco duty has been
increased in real terms in recent years and was
increased in line with inflation in the March
2001 Budget. A new strategy was introduced
in March 2000 to tackle the rise in smuggling,
including extra Customs officers, additional
specialist investigators and new equipment,
such as X-ray scanners. In the first nine
months of operation Customs confiscated 2.1
billion cigarettes destined for the UK market.
Duties are levied on spirits, beer, wine,
cider and other alcoholic drinks according to
alcoholic strength and volume. Spirits used for
scientific, medical, research and industrial
processes are generally free of duty.
Duties are charged on off-course betting,
pool betting, gaming in casinos, bingo and
amusement machines. Rates vary with the
particular form of gambling. In October 2001
a new 15% tax on bookmakers’ gross profits
will replace general betting duty of 6.75% on
total stakes (see p. 299). On the National
Lottery (see p. 123) there is a 12% duty on
gross stakes, but no tax on winnings.
Insurance premium tax is levied on most
general insurance at a rate of 5%, with a
higher rate of 17.5% on travel insurance and
on insurance sold by suppliers of cars and
domestic appliances.
A new structure for air passenger duty took
effect in April 2001, introducing a differential
when there are different classes of travel on a
flight. The rate of duty for flights to UK and
to European Economic Area (EEA)
destinations is £5 for the lowest class and
£10 for any other class; the equivalent rates to
non-EEA destinations are £20 and £40
respectively. All flights from airports in the
Scottish Highlands and Islands are now
exempt from duty in recognition of their
remoteness and dependence on air travel.
The system of vehicle excise duty (VED)
changed on 1 March 2001 with the
introduction of graduated annual rates on
new cars. There are four VED bands,
depending on the rate of carbon dioxide
emissions and the type of fuel used: £100 to
£155 for cars using petrol, and £110 to
£160 for those using diesel. In addition,
cars using cleaner fuels are subject to a
VED discount, with the overall duty
varying from £90 to £150. For cars first
registered before 1 March 2001 the
standard rate of VED is £160, with a lower
rate of £105 for cars up to 1,549 cc.
A new system of VED for goods vehicles
will come into operation in December 2001,
with seven broad rate bands replacing the
current system of around 100 different
rates. These new rates better reflect the
environmental and road damage caused by
goods vehicles, and are set according to the
gross vehicle weight and the number of
axles. The new annual standard rate will
range from £165 to £1,850, with the rate
for lorries with reduced pollution
certificates ranging from £160 to £1,350.
The UK rates will be among the lowest in
Europe for the cleanest lorries. Duty on
buses varies according to seating capacity,
and duty on motorcycles according to
engine capacity.
Landfill tax is levied at £12 a tonne, and
this will rise by £1 a tonne each year until
2004, when it will be reviewed; a lower rate of
£2 a tonne applies for inert waste. To reduce
the environmental impact of quarrying, a new
aggregates levy of £1.60 a tonne on the
extraction of sand, gravel and crushed rock
will be introduced in April 2002. Some of the
revenue from the levy will be used through a
new Sustainability Fund to address the
environmental costs associated with aggregates
extraction, including noise, dust, visual
intrusion, loss of amenity and damage to
biodiversity.
The climate change levy was introduced on
1 April 2001 on the non-domestic use of
energy at the rate of 0.43p per kilowatt-hour
(kWh) for electricity, 0.15p per kWh for gas,
408
23: PUBLIC FIN ANCE
0.96p per kilogramme (kg) for liquefied
petroleum gas and 1.17p per kg for solid fuels.
All revenues are recycled back to business
through a reduction in employers’ National
Insurance contributions and additional
support for energy efficiency measures (see
p. 492). An 80% discount on the levy is
available to energy-intensive business sectors
that have agreed targets with the Government
for increasing energy efficiency and reducing
greenhouse gas emissions.
Stamp Duty
Some transfers are subject to stamp dutv.
Transfers of shares generally attract duty at
0.5% of the cost, while certain types of
document, such as declarations of trust,
generally attract a small fixed duty of £5.
Transfers by gift and transfers to charities
are exempt. Duty on land and property is
payable at 1% of the total price when above
£60,000, 3% above £250,000 and 4% over
£500,000.
Local Authority Revenue
Local authorities in Great Britain have four
main sources of revenue income: grants from
central government; council tax; non-domestic
rates (sometimes known as business rates); and
sales, fees and charges. About 75% of
expenditure (excluding sales, fees and charges)
is financed by government grants and
redistributed non-domestic rates.
Non-domestic rates are a tax on the
occupiers of non-domestic property. The
rateable value is assessed by reference to annual
rents and reviewed every five years. Separate
non-domestic rates are set for England, Wales
and Scotland, and collected by local authorities.
They are paid into separate national pools and
redistributed to local authorities in proportion
to their population.
Domestic property in Great Britain is
generally subject to the council tax. Each
dwelling is allocated to one of eight valuation
bands, based on its capital value (the amount it
might have sold for on the open market) in
April 1991. Discounts are available for
dwellings with fewer than two resident adults,
and those on low incomes mav receive council
tax benefit of up to 100% of the tax bill (see
p. 181). In 2001-02, in England the average
council tax payable per dwelling will be £741:
£764 in London, £684 in other metropolitan
areas and £755 in shire areas.
In Northern Ireland, rates—local taxes on
domestic and non-domestic properties—are
based on the rental value of the propertv. For
2001-02 the average domestic rates bill in
Northern Ireland will be £420.

International Trade Policy 415
Trade has been of vital importance to the British economy for hundreds of
years. Although it has under 1% of the population, the UK is the world’s fifth
largest trading nation, accounting for over 5% of world trade in goods and
services in 1999. About one in four British jobs is linked to business overseas. As
one of 15 Member States of the European Union (EU), the world’s largest
established trading group, 52% of the UK’s trade in goods and services in 2000
was with fellow EU members. The UK has a higher degree of inward and
outward investment than any of the other G7 economies, relative to Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), and was second only to the United States as a
destination for international direct investment in 1999. Within the World Trade
Organisation (WTO), the UK as part of the EU is calling for a new round of
negotiations aimed at lowering tariffs, eliminating non-tariff barriers and
liberalising world markets.
The UK exports more per head than the
United States and Japan. Its sales abroad of
goods and services were 21% of gross final
expenditure in 2000. Receipts from trade in
services (such as financial services, business
services, travel, transport and
communications) and investment income
account for about half of total UK current
account credits, and the UK consistently runs
large surpluses on these accounts. The UK
was the world’s biggest foreign investor in
1999 and UK direct investment abroad since
1992 has significantly exceeded direct
investment into the UK.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
The UK balance of payments measures the
economic transactions between UK residents
and the rest of the world. It also draws a series
of balances between inward and outward
transactions, provides an overall net flow of
transactions between UK residents and the rest
of the world, and reports how that flow is
funded. Economic transactions include:
> exports and imports of goods, such as oil,
agricultural products, other raw
materials, machinery and transport
equipment, computers, white goods
(such as refrigerators and washing
machines) and clothing;
> exports and imports of services, such as
international transport, travel, financial
and business services;
> income flows, such as dividends and
interest earned by non-residents on
investments in the UK and by the UK
investing abroad;
410
24: INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT
> financial flows, such as investment in
shares, debt securities, loans and
deposits; and
> transfers, such as payments to, and
receipts from, EU institutions, foreign
aid and funds brought by migrants to the
UK.
The balance of payments classification
comprises the following groups of accounts:
> the current account, which comprises
trade in goods and services, income
(compensation of employees and
investment income) and current
transfers;
> the capital account, which comprises
capital transfers and the acquisition and
disposal of non-produced, non-fmancial
assets (such as copyrights);
> the financial account, which covers direct,
portfolio and other investment and
reserve assets; and
> the international investment position,
which measures the UK’s stock of
external financial assets and liabilities.
Table 24.1 summarises the UK’s balance of
payments position over recent years. In 2000
the current account was in deficit, at £16.2
billion, the largest since 1990. This compares
with a recorded deficit of £9.9 billion in 1999.
There were sharp deteriorations in both the
deficit on goods and services and in the
surplus on income in 2000. The capital
account surplus rose from £0.8 billion in 1999
to a record £1.9 billion in 2000.
Trade in Goods and Services
Table 24.2 summarises the UK’s trade in
goods and services over recent years. More
detailed analyses for 2000 can be found in
subsequent tables. In 2000, UK exports of
goods amounted to £187.1 billion and imports
to £215.9 billion, giving a deficit on trade in
goods of £28.8 billion, slightly higher than in
1999 and the largest deficit on record. The
trade in services surplus in 2000 of £11.0
billion was marginally lower than the £11.3
billion surplus recorded in the previous vear.
Commodity Composition of Goods
UK exports of goods are dominated by
manufactures—finished manufactures and semi¬
manufactured goods. In 1971 they accounted for
84% of total goods exports. Although the advent
of North Sea oil meant their share declined into
the early 1980s, they have subsequently
recovered and in 2000 again stood at 84% of
exports of goods (see Table 24.4).
Historically the UK was predominantly an
importer of foods and basic materials.
However, over the last 30 years, imports of
manufactures have grown rapidly. Between
1970 and 2000 the share of finished
manufactures in total imports rose from 24%
to 61%, while the share of basic materials fell
from 14'/2% to just under 3%. The percentage
of food, beverages and tobacco has been
dropping since the 1950s, down to 7>/2% of
imports in 2000. The UK has not had a
surplus on manufactured goods since 1982.

Geographical Distribution of Goods
Most of the UK’s trade in goods is with other
developed countries (see Table 24.5). In 2000,
85% of UK exports were to other member
countries of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), and
81% of imports came from the same
countries. The proportion of export trade w ith
the European Union was 57%, while imports
from the EU accounted for over 50% of the
total. Western Europe as a whole took 61% of
UK exports in 2000.
EU countries accounted for eight of the
UK’s top ten export markets in 2000—the
United States and Japan took the other two
places—and seven of the top ten leading
suppliers of goods to the UK (see Table 24.6);
the other three places were taken by the
United States, Japan and Hong Kong. The
United States maintained its position as the
UK’s largest external market for the fourth
year running and regained its position as the
UK’s largest single supplier, with Germany in
second position. Both total exports and
imports grew strongly in 2000—by 13% and
12% respectively. In particular, exports to the
United States rose by 21% and imports from
the same country by 17%.
Services
There has been a surplus recorded for trade in
services every year since 1966. Exports of
services grew by 3.7% to £67.2 billion in 2000
(see Table 24.7), with the largest contributions
to growth from financial and other business

Income and Transfers
Earnings on UK investment abroad rose
sharply from 10.4 billion in 1999 to
£145.2 billion in 2000, while debits (earnings
of foreign-owned assets in the UK) also
increased significantly, by 38%, to £139.9
billion, giving a modest surplus of £5.3 billion
(see Table 24.8), down appreciably on the
record surplus of £9.0 billion in 1999. The
surplus on direct investment income of
£11.0 billion, down a little from the £12.4
billion surplus in 1999, was partly offset by an
increased deficit of £6.1 billion on other
investment income (including earnings on
reserve assets). The deficit on current
transfers fell slightly from £4.2 billion in 1999
to £3.8 billion in 2000.
Financial Account and International
Investment Position
The financial account (see Table 24.9) shows
that in 2000 UK direct investment abroad was
£165.1 billion, compared with £128.1 billion
in 1999. Foreign direct investment in the UK
was £86.2 billion, compared with £52.1 billion
in 1999. The increased investment reflects the
high level of acquisition and merger activity
taking place throughout the year (see p. 383).
Portfolio investment abroad in 2000 amounted
to £85.5 billion compared with £5.3 billion in
1999. Portfolio investment in the UK rose
from £109.7 billion in 1999 to £174.6 billion
in 2000—a large increase in investment in UK
equity securities reflecting the counterpart to
the large outward direct investment paid for
by the issue of new shares. Other investment
abroad rose from £56.8 billion in 1999 to
£270.8 billion in 2000, mainly due to
increased deposits by banks. Other
investment in the UK was £281.8 billion
compared with £39.1 billion in 1999. This
large increase was mainly due to deposits of
sterling and foreign currency with UK banks.
Reserve assets increased by £3.9 billion
in 2000.
At the end of 2000, direct investment in the
UK was £323 billion (see Table 24.10), while
direct investment abroad was £604 billion—a
net balance of £281 billion. Inward portfolio
investment stood at £1,032 billion, while the
stock of UK portfolio investment abroad was
£858 billion. In total, UK external liabilities
exceeded assets by £123 billion.
INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICY
The Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI) pursues the UK’s interest in
international trade policy in cooperation with
other government departments. This covers
goods, services and investment, and involves

European Union
The establishment of the Single Market is one
of the key achievements of the EU, although
in the Government’s view further reform is
needed in key areas such as services, public
procurement, liberalisation of utilities,
simplifying the regulatory environment, and
tightening up on state aids. UK priorities are
to push forward this reform and improve the
level of transposition and enforcement of
Single Market legislation across the EU.
In the Government’s view, the benefits of
the Single Market include:
> a wider market for UK goods,
comprising 380 million consumers, with
intra-EU trade accounting for around
25% of world trade;
> greater competition and liberalisation,
which have helped to bring about lower
prices;
> better consumer protection;
> British manufacturers can sell their
products throughout the EU without
expensive re-testing in every countrv
as a result of the Single Market principle
of mutual recognition of standards;
> there has been a significant reduction in
export bureaucracy for UK business—
the Single Market is in effect a domestic
market for European business; and
> the right of UK citizens to work, study or
retire in all other Member States—
around 750,000 Britons live in other EU
countries.
The European Commission sets out in its
Internal Market Strategy a long-term strategic
vision and framework for measures aimed at
achieving better functioning of the Single
Market. First produced in 1999, it is reviewed
annually. The 2001 review, endorsed by the
Internal Market, Consumer and Tourism
Council, largely reflects UK views on priorities
for action to further improve the operation of
the Single Market, including completion of
work by the end of 2001 on patents and public
procurement. In the longer term, the UK looks
to take forward work on other key elements in
the Strategy, such as on services and plans to
simplify the regulatory environment.
417
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
More than 88% of Directives have now
been implemented in all Member States. At
the Stockholm European Council in March
2001, EU Heads of Government agreed a
target of no more than 1.5% of Single Market
directives to be overdue in any Member State
by the time of the Barcelona Summit in 2002.
In addition, a framework for ensuring the
even and effective enforcement of Single
Market rules has been established. This
involves encouraging cooperation between
national administrations, setting up contact
points for businesses and citizens, and
improving the efficiency of the Commission’s
complaints procedure. In the UK, the DTFs
Action Single Market acts not only as a
contact point for UK business and citizens but
also as a first port of call for similar units in
other Member States when Single Market
problems arise. Initiatives for simplifying
national and Community rules include SLIM
(Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market)
and the European Business Test Panel, which
allows for consultation of business during the
drafting stage of new legislation.
World Trade Organisation (WTO)
The UK Government works to promote an
open and stable economic environment in
which trade flows freely and which stimulates
prosperity. It believes that this can best be
achieved through a multilateral framework of
rules that are designed to promote an open
and liberal trading system, where barriers to a
free flow of trade—such as high import duties
or subsidies—are minimised. These rules are
held and enforced primarily by the WTO.
The WTO (wwTP.iPto.org) was established
in 1995 and currently has a membership of
141 countries. It and its predecessor, the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,
have helped to establish a multilateral trading
system through successive rounds of trade
negotiations. However, the WTO Ministerial
Conference in Seattle in November 1999
failed to agree on the launch of a new round of
trade negotiations. With the next Ministerial
Conference in Doha, Qatar, scheduled for
November 2001, the UK and its EU partners
are pressing for the launch of a new round,
which they see as having the potential to
deliver a substantial liberalising package for
the benefit of all countries, so promoting
economic growth and new job creation. The
Government, in partnership with UK
businesses, has identified a number of priority
areas which they would like to see included in
such a round, including a further substantial
reduction of tariffs, removal of other barriers
to trade, simplification of trade procedures
and further opening of government
procurement markets. The UK would also
like a round to consider investment,
competition and environmental issues.
The DTI monitors actions by third
countries which represent obstacles to UK
exports. It seeks to resolve problems bilaterally
in conjunction with EU partners where such
efforts fail through the initiation of WTO
dispute settlement action. In particular, the
UK is seeking to ensure that the current major
trade disputes between the EU and the United
States are carefully handled and, if possible,
resolved at minimum cost to the UK and
world economy. The Department is keen to
ensure that bilateral agreements between the
EU and third countries (for example the
Transatlantic Economic Partnership and the
Asia-Europe Meeting) are established and
implemented in a way which secures open
markets. A similar approach is adopted in the
negotiations with countries seeking to join
the WTO, including the People’s Republic
of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the
Ukraine.
Developing Countries
The DTI works closely with the Department
for International Development (DFID) to
ensure that developing countries benefit from,
and participate in, the world trade system. An
inter-departmental Working Group on Trade
and Development, chaired by the DTI, meets
regularly to ensure consistency of approach.
In June 2000 the EU and the 71 African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries signed
in Cotonou, Benin, a new agreement, which
sets out a framework for economic and
political cooperation, development aid and
trade. After a transitional period of eight
years, during which the ACP countries will
continue to enjoy their current preferential
418
24: INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT
access to the EU, new WTO-compatible
arrangements will be put in place.
Other developments in 2000-01 have
included:
> a commitment in the White Paper
Eliminating World Poverty: Making
Globalisation Work for the Poor (see
p. 94) to make the next round of
negotiations a Development Round that
brings real benefits to developing
countries across a range of issues;
> a proposal by the European Commission,
agreed by the General Affairs Council in
February 2001, to open up immediately
duty- and quota-free access for all
exports from Least Developed Countries,
except arms. Only three products—
sugar, rice and bananas—are treated
differently, with full duty-free access
being phased in gradually in the period
up to 2009; and
> encouraging a Commonwealth consensus
in favour of development of the
multilateral trading system, in particular
by working to remove barriers which
prevent developing countries playing
their part in the global economy.
Special Trading Arrangements
The multilateral trading system provides the
foundation for the EC’s common commercial
policy. However, the EU has preferential
trading arrangements with a number of
countries, falling into three main categories:
> those that prepare countries in Central
and Eastern Europe for possible EU
membership. Europe (Association)
Agreements (see p. 86) are designed to
facilitate closer political and economic
ties and the eventual full liberalisation of
trade with a view to helping these
countries prepare for becoming full EU
members. Similar agreements—
Stabilisation and Association
Agreements—are being negotiated with
the \\ estern Balkan countries;
> the EU has association and cooperation
agreements with virtually all non¬
member countries with Mediterranean
coastlines, plus Jordan. These provide for
the setting up by 2010 of a free trade area
between the EU and these countries; and
> those that provide an economic dimension
to its assistance to former dependent
territories. Trade relations with these
ACP countries, formerly beneficiaries of
the Lome Convention, are now governed
by the EU/ACP Cotonou Partnership
Agreement, which gives them tariff-free
access, subject to certain safeguards, to
the EU for industrial and agricultural
products. The EU also operates a
Generalised System of Preferences
(GSP), available to nearly all developing
countries and applying to industrial
products, including textiles and certain
(mainly processed) agricultural products.
The EU will negotiate a new GSP
Regulation to take effect once the current
scheme expires in December 2001.
New trade relationships with countries and
regions of Latin America and the Gulf
Cooperation Council are being pursued. A
free trade agreement with Mexico came into
force in July 2000, and negotiations for new
agreements with the Mercosur regional
economic area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Uruguay) and Chile are under way.
Partnership and cooperation (non-
preferential) agreements have been concluded
with ten states of the former Soviet Union.
Non-preferential cooperation agreements have
also been made with countries in South Asia
and Latin America, as well as the People’s
Republic of China, the Association of South
East Asian Nations, the Andean Pact, and the
Central American States.
Controls on Trade
Import Controls
Following the completion of the Single
European Market, all national quantitative
restrictions were abolished. However, the EU
does restrict imports of textiles and clothing,
steel, footwear and ceramics from certain
countries under EU import regimes using
licensing controls; these are also used to
monitor imports and deter quota fraud.
419
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Imports into the UK may also be subject to
prohibition or restriction, either as a result of
UN resolutions (for example imports of rough
diamonds from Angola, Liberia and Sierra
Leone) or for reasons of national security.
These include firearms and ammunition,
nuclear materials, landmines and chemical
weapons.
The DTPs Import Licensing Branch has
responsibility for issuing import licences in
accordance with UK and EC law. Its principal
customers are UK importers dealing in goods
controlled by the DTI. In 2001 it expected to
issue 280,000 licences.
Other products may be prohibited or
restricted to protect human, animal or plant
life or health. Examples include certain drugs,
explosives, endangered wildlife and derived
products (under the CITES Convention),
pornographic material, and certain
agricultural, horticultural and food products.
These are controlled and enforced by other
government departments such as the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, and HM Customs and Excise.
Strategic Export Controls
Governments control the export of goods and
technology for a variety of reasons. In
particular, irresponsible transfers of arms,
ammunition and related material can contribute
to internal repression or regional instability,
while goods intended for civil purposes can also
contribute to the development of weapons of
mass destruction and the missiles to deliver
them. Controls are also imposed to meet various
international commitments.
Licences to export arms and other goods
controlled for strategic reasons are issued by
the DTI acting through its Export Control
Organisation (ECO). All relevant individual
licence applications are circulated by the DTI
to other departments with an interest,
including the Foreign & Commonwealth
Office (FCO), the Ministry of Defence and
DFID. The ECO also issues licences for
exports and some other activities that are only
controlled because of trade sanctions.
Strategic export controls apply to a range of
goods, components and spare parts and
technology and include the following:
> military equipment, such as arms,
ammunition, bombs, tanks, imaging
devices, military aircraft and warships;
> nuclear-related items, including nuclear
materials, reactors and processing plant;
> dual-use goods—goods designed for civil
use but which can be used for military
purposes—such as certain materials,
machine tools, electronic equipment,
computers, telecommunications
equipment, cryptographic goods, sensors
and radar, navigation and avionics
equipment, marine equipment and space
and propulsion equipment;
> chemical weapons precursors, and related
equipment and technology;
> certain micro-organisms, biological
equipment and technology; and
> goods used in programmes involved in
weapons of mass destruction and missiles
used for their delivery.
The Export Control Bill was introduced in
the House of Commons in June 2001. Among
the powers in the Bill are those to impose
controls on:
> trafficking and brokering;
> the transfer of technology from the UK
and by UK persons anywhere by any
means (other than by export); and
> the provision of technical assistance
overseas.
Inward and Outward Investment
The UK has an open economy, with no
restrictions on the outward flow of capital.
Outward investment helps develop markets
for UK exports while providing earnings in
the form of investment income (see p. 415).
Inward investment is promoted by Invest UK
(see p. 421). This inward investment is seen as
a means of introducing new technology,
products and management styles to the UK.
Inward Investment
The UK was ranked second in the world at
attracting inward investment according to the
latest (2000) United Nations World Investment
420
24: INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND INVESTMENT
Report. North America continues to be the
largest source in terms of stock levels. Britain is
the premier inward investment location in
Europe and inward investment is a significant
contributor to the economy. It attracted 24% of
all inward investment into the EU in 1999.
There are nearly 18,000 foreign investors in the
UK, including 5,600 from the United States.
Recent inward investment announcements
have included:
> the Japanese car maker Nissan will invest
around £214 million to build its new
Micra model at its Sunderland plant;
> the Matsushita Communication
Industrial Co. of Japan plans a new
telecommunications R&D centre creating
400 highly skilled jobs and developing
Panasonic’s third generation (3G) mobile
telephone systems;
> the Bertelsmann Group of Germany has
set up its new European customer service
centre in Liverpool, and expects to create
350 jobs over the next three years;
> the IT group Insight from Arizona in the
United States will build its new
European headquarters in Sheffield,
creating around 1,750 jobs—700 of
which will be in software development
and programming; and
> Ford will invest £250 million at its
Bridgend plant in south Wales where
around 600 new jobs will be created,
building engines for Ford’s premium
models, including Jaguar.
Outward Investment
According to the latest United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD) report, the UK was the
world’s largest outward investor in 1999
(US$199 billion), surpassing the United States
for the first time since 1988.
GOVERNMENT SERVICES
The Government provides a wide range of
advice and practical support to meet the needs
of exporters. This is designed to help
businesses, especially small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), through all stages of the
exporting process.
British Trade International
British Trade International (BTI), established
in 1999, brings together the work of the DTI
and FCO in support of international trade and
investment. It aims to enhance the
competitiveness of companies in the UK
through overseas sales and investments, and to
maintain a high level of inward direct
investment. Its two operating units, Trade
Partners UK and Invest UK (formerly the
Invest in Britain Bureau), are responsible for
these activities respectively.
The Group Chief Executive reports to the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and
the Secretary of State for Foreign &
Commonwealth Affairs, and to the Board of
BTI. A single Minister for International
Trade and Investment was appointed for the
first time in June 2001.
Trade Partners UK
Trade Partners UK (www.tradepartners.gov.uk)
provides a single point of access to the full
range of support in Britain and in over 200
diplomatic posts overseas, delivering a range of
services to its customers including:
> providing basic trade information—
delivered via its website and by market-
based staff;
> offering access to information sources
and data through the Trade Partners UK
Information Centre—increasingly
focused on providing access to electronic
sources which SMEs would not
otherwise be able to access; and
^ facilitating participation in overseas trade
fairs and enabling visits and meetings for
exporters travelling abroad, and
supporting inward missions from
overseas countries to the UK.
Invest UK
Invest UK (www.invest.uk.com) is a business
service organisation, which communicates the
benefits of the UK to potential investors,
421
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
identifies and approaches potential investors,
and assists them with all aspects of locating
and expanding in the UK. It works with
Regional Development Agencies in England,
as well as national agencies in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland. Invest UK is
represented in Embassies and Consulates in
over 41 cities around the world.
In 2000-01, 869 inward investment
decisions were notified to Invest UK and these
are expected to create 71,488 new jobs (see
also Table 24.11). Around a third of these
investment projects were from companies with
an existing presence in the UK. The largest
single investor country was the United States,
with 48.4% of projects, followed by Germany
(8.2%), Canada (6.4%) and Japan (5.9%).
The UK is particularly successful at attracting
investment in industries linked to the
knowledge-driven economy—computer
software, Internet, telecommunications,
electronics and e-business sectors—together
forming the largest category of foreign direct
investment, with some 455 projects (52.4%).
Other main sectors for UK inward investment
are the automotive sector, pharmaceuticals
and financial services.
Export Insurance
The Export Credits Guarantee Department
(ECGD) {rprprp.ecgd.gov.uk), Britain’s official
export credit agency, is a separate department
reporting to the Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry. It aims to benefit the economy
by helping UK exporters win business, and
UK firms to invest overseas, by providing
guarantees, insurance and reinsurance against

More Nobel Prizes for science (over 70) have been won by scientists from
Britain than any country except the United States. The UK is responsible for
about 4.5% of global expenditure on science, produces about 8% of scientific
publications and receives 9% of citations. UK scientists claimed about 10% of
internationally recognised prizes in the 20th century. Government policy aims
to reinforce the UK’s international scientific standing, and maximise the
contribution of science, engineering and technology (SET) to economic
competith eness and the quality of life by promoting innovation.
BACKGROUND
The public sector is the prime funder of basic
science in Britain. i\s well as playing a crucial
part in advancing scientific knowledge and
producing well-trained people, such research
can often lead to exploitable results. Business
has the prime responsibility for researching
and developing new and improved products
and services. The Government’s aim is to
create a knowledge-driven economv by
building on the UK’s science base and
promoting the right climate to encourage
innovation and the exploitation of new ideas.
The Government’s policies for science,
engineering and technology were set out in the
July 2000 White Paper Excellence and
Opportunity—a science and innovation policy for
the 21st century. The White Paper set out the
actions being taken by the Government to
ensure that UK science remains world class, to
open up opportunities for innovation
throughout the economy and to increase
public confidence in science. Details are set
out in the Science Budget 2001-02 to 2003-04.
Specific priority research areas for the
Spending Review 2000 period are genomics,
e-science and basic technology.
The Fifth Framework Programme of the
European Union (EU)—a further round of its
collaborative research and development
(R&D) programme (see p. 440)—was launched
in March 1999 with a budget of 14.96 billion
euro. UK companies, higher education
institutions and research organisations are
playing an active role in this transnational
collaborative research programme. EU proposals
to create a European Research Area are expected
to offer new opportunities for the UK to
compete as part of the EU in global markets.
The Sanger Centre at Hinxton in
Cambridgeshire (funded mainly by the
423
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Wellcome Trust) has contributed a third of
the sequence data to the international Human
Genome Project, while the Medical Research
Council (MRC) Human Genome Mapping
Project Resource Centre on the same site also
played a major role in supporting work on the
human genome. The near complete set of
human genes was announced in February
2001 and has involved scientists working at 16
research institutes in six countries. In
addition, the Centre for Genome Research,
supported by the Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) at the
University of Edinburgh, is now a world
leader in stem cell biology.
The UK has been at the forefront of many
other world-class advances in science. For
example, in the latter part of the 20th century
there was the discovery by Natural
Environment Research Council (NERC)
British Antarctic Survey scientists of the hole
in the ozone layer over the Antarctic. Earlier,
researchers at the MRC Laboratory of
Molecular Biology, Cambridge, had produced
the first monoclonal antibodies—proteins with
enormous potential in the diagnosis and
treatment of disease. Among British
breakthroughs in genetics research are the
identification of the gene in the Y chromosome
responsible for determining sex, and of other
genes linked to diseases such as cystic fibrosis
and a form of breast cancer. Another
internationally recognised breakthrough came
with the birth of the first cloned mammal,
Dolly the sheep, at the BBSRC-funded Roslin
Institute near Edinburgh. Pioneering studies
into the transfer of the nucleus between cells at
Roslin have made the research institute a world
leader in this field. Professor Sir Harold Kroto
of Sussex University shared the 1996 Nobel
Prize for chemistry with two US scientists for
discovering in 1985 the fullerene molecule—60
carbon atoms arranged in a symmetrical cage.
Notable areas of UK achievement in R&D
include biotechnology, biomedicine, materials,
chemicals, electronics and aerospace. Among
the British research achievements reported in
the first half of 2001 are:
> Professor A. Fabian of the Cambridge
Institute of Astronomy shared the 2001
Bruno Rossi Prize (in high-energy
astrophysics). This was awarded for
observations revealing the very large
black holes at the centre of distant
galaxies. He is the first to have observed
X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei
being broadened by the strong pull of
gravity, thus indicating that black holes
lurk at their core. This is an important
confirmation of Einstein’s theory of
gravity—the General Theory of
Relativity.
> Researchers at the University of
Plymouth and the Institute of Arable
Crops Research investigating
environmentally friendly pest control
have undertaken field-trials of a novel
method for controlling aphid
populations—using predatory ground
beetles.
> It used to be thought that plants could
take up nitrogen from the soil only if it is
in an inorganic form. Researchers at the
University of Lancaster have found that
most grasses can take up and use organic
nitrogen in the form of amino acids—a
form of nitrogen less ‘mobile’ than
inorganic forms such as nitrate, which
can leach into and pollute watercourses.
> The MRC Programme on AIDS in
Uganda has established that survival
times and disease progression rates in
HIV-1 infection in rural Uganda are
similar to those in industrialised
countries before anti-HIV drugs were
used. This research has disproved the
idea that AIDS in Africa is a distinct
disease from AIDS in developed
countries and shows that there is an
opportunity to mitigate the effects of the
African AIDS epidemic.
> Research from the MRC Laboratory of
Molecular Cell Biology has provided the
first evidence that specialised precursor
cells, destined to become a particular cell
type, can be re-programmed into stem
cells, which are able to self-renew and
generate a diverse range of other cells.
The work could have implications for
developing stem cell therapies, because
precursor cells are easier to purify and
expand than stem cells.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
EXPENDITURE
Gross domestic expenditure in the UK on
R&D in 1999 was £16.7 billion, 1.8% of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and a 5% increase
over 1998. Of this, £14.4 billion was on civil
R&D, with the rest going to defence projects.
Business enterprise provided 49% of total
funding of R&D and government 28% in
1999; a further 18% came from abroad. Other
contributions were made by private
endowments, trusts and charities. As well as
financing R&D carried out within business
enterprise itself, business enterprise supports
university research and finances contract
research at government establishments. Some
charities have their own laboratories and offer
grants for outside research. Contract research
organisations (see p. 443) carry out R&D for
companies and are playing an increasingly
important role in the transfer of technology to
British industry.
Total spending on R&D in business
enterprise amounted to £11.3 billion in 1999.
Of this total, business enterprise’s own
contribution was 67%, with 10% coming from
government and the rest (23%) from overseas.
The two biggest investors in R&D—
AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline (formed
by a merger of Glaxo Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham)—both operate in the
pharmaceuticals sector, and pharmaceuticals
account for 22% of UK R&D expenditure.
The motor vehicles and parts and aerospace
sectors are also big investors in R&D.
GOVERNMENT ROLE
Science, engineering and technology (SET)
base issues are the responsibility of the
Secretary of State for Trade and Industry
assisted by a Minister for Science; they are
supported by the Office of Science and
Technology (OST). A Cabinet Office Science
Policy Committee has been created for the
collective consideration of, and decisions on,
major science policy issues. The OST, headed
by the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser,
is responsible for policy on SET, both
nationally and internationally, and coordinates
science and technology policy across
government departments. The Chief
Scientific Adviser also reports directly to the
Prime Minister. An independent Council for
Science and Technology advises the Prime
Minister on the strategic policies and
framework for science and technology in the
UK. Its members are drawn from academia,

business and charitable foundations/
institutions. The policy and management of
some aspects of science and technology are
reserved to the UK Government, while in
other instances this has been devolved to the
new administrations in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland.
In 1999 the Government announced a new
framework for overseeing developments in
biotechnology. The Human Genetics
Commission, which advises on genetic
technologies and their impact on humans, and
the Agricultural and Environment
Biotechnology Commission, which advises on
all other aspects of biotechnology except food,
work alongside the Food Standards Agency
(see p. 210) as part of the strategic framework.
The term ‘science and engineering base’ is
used to describe the research and postgraduate
training capacity based in the universities and
colleges of higher education and in
establishments operated by the Research
Councils (see pp. 431-6), together with the
national and international central facilities
(such as CERN—see p. 441) supported by the
Research Councils and available for use by
British scientists and engineers. There are also
important contributions from private
institutions, chiefly those funded by charities.
The science and engineering base is the main
provider of basic research and much of the
strategic research (research likely to have
practical applications) carried out in the UK.
It also collaborates with the private sector in
the conduct of specific applied research.
The OST, through the Director General of
Research Councils, has responsibility for the
Science Budget, and for the government-
financed Research Councils. Through the
Research Councils, the Science Budget
supports research by awarding research grants
to universities, other higher education
establishments and some other research units;
by funding Research Council establishments
to carry out research or provide facilities; by
paying subscriptions to international scientific
facilities and organisations; and by supporting
postgraduate research students and
postdoctoral Fellows. The Science Budget
also funds programmes of support to the
science and engineering base through the
Royal Society and the Royal Academy of
Engineering. The other main sources of funds
for universities are the higher education
funding councils (see p. 442).
Strategy and Finance
Planned total government expenditure on
SET (both civil and defence) in 2001-02 is
£7.8 billion. This represents an increase of
about 9% in real terms over the estimated
outturn of expenditure in 2000-01. Of the
2001-02 total, £4.9 billion is devoted to civil
science, including £1.8 billion for the Science
Budget.
In 1998 the Government announced that it
would provide an additional £1 billion for the
science and engineering base between 1999
and 2002—£700 million through the Science
Budget and £300 million through the
Department for Education and Employment
(now the Department for Education and
Skills). A further £400 million is being
provided by the Wellcome Trust. About
£700 million of the extra funding, including
£300 million of the Wellcome contribution, is
devoted to upgrading university laboratories
and other essential equipment (see p. 428).
Another £400 million is being used by the
Research Councils to support research in
priority areas, such as life sciences (including
genetic research, medical science and
biotechnology). In July 2000 a further
£1 billion investment partnership with the
Wellcome Trust—for the years 2002-03 and
2003-04—was announced (see p. 429) as part
of the Spending Review.
Key features of the Spending Review 2000
and the associated W hite Paper, Excellence and
Opportunity—a science and innovation policy for
the 21st century, are:
> an average increase in spending on
science and engineering of 7% in real
terms over the three vears 2001-02 to
2003-04;
> a Science Research Investment Fund, in
partnership with the Wellcome Trust, of
£1 billion over two years (see p. 429);
> through the Higher Education
Innovation Fund, increasing funding to
£140 million over three years, to help

Many shows and exhibitions take place every year
throughout the UK, relating to all aspects of industry
and commerce, including leisure and food.
The Daily Mail Ideal Home Show has showcased
domestic trends and tastes annually since 1908. Over the
years the exhibition has grown in size and has a strong
international flavour. The displays include purpose-built
showhomes. In 2001 many exhibits had a futuristic feel,
such as the robotic lawnmowers shown above.
The exhibition has been held at Earl’s Court
in London since 1979.

The Foresight Programme
The funding and organisation of British SET
aim to create a close partnership between
government, industry and the scientific
community in developing strengths in areas of
importance to the future economic well-being
of Britain. In particular, the Government’s
Foresight Programme encourages the public
and private sectors to work together to
identify opportunities in markets and
technologies likely to emerge over the next
10 to 20 years that would support sustainable
427
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
growth, and the actions needed to exploit
them. Government priorities in SET
programmes, and in overall policy, regulation,
and education and training, are being guided
by the Programme.
The Foresight Programme is coordinated
by a joint industry/academic steering group
headed by the Chief Scientific Adviser. The
current (second) round of Foresight was
launched in 1999. This has three thematic
panels and ten sectoral panels, made up of
people from industry, academia and
government. The thematic panels addressed
the issues of ageing population, crime
prevention and manufacturing in 2020, while
the sectoral panels looked at business sectors
or broader areas. The panels produced visions
of the future—published in December 2000—
which might drive wealth creation and shape
the quality of life. A report bringing many of
these ideas together—Messages from the
Current Round—was published in 2001.
Government departments, universities and
higher education funding councils, as well as
the Research Councils, are reflecting
Foresight priorities in their research spending
allocations. The private sector is being
encouraged to take account of the priorities
both in its participation in collaborative
research programmes and in its own strategic
planning.
A new Foresight fund, initially of up to
.£15 million, was announced to implement the
best ideas from the current round quickly.
This has resulted in a third round of Foresight
LINK Awards, recipients of which were
announced in July 2001.The Foresight
website (wrpw.foresight.gov.uk) is an integral
part of this round—it has an electronic library
of strategic visions, information and views
about the future.
The Secretary of State for Trade and
Industry announced a review of Foresight in
December 2000. Proposals for the future of
the programme are due to be announced in
late 2001.
LINK
The LINK scheme provides a government¬
wide framework for collaborative research in
support of sustainable growth and
improvements in the quality of life, in line
with Foresight priorities. LINK aims to
promote partnerships in commercially
relevant research projects between industry
and higher education institutions and other
research base organisations. Under the
scheme, government departments and
Research Councils fund up to 50% of the cost
of research projects, with industry providing
the balance.
Since 1988, 71 LINK programmes have
supported over 1,300 projects with a total
value of more than £650 million and
involving some 2,100 companies. Over 950 of
these projects have been completed. The latest
programmes deal with mobile telephones and
health; bioremediation; e-science; and the
manufacture of chemicals. Within LINK,
Foresight LINK Awards support research
projects outside areas covered by LINK
programmes. A third round of Awards, with a
total value of £12 million, includes: the use of
nanotechnology in producing next-generation
computing technology; tissue engineering; and
zero-emission power plants.
Joint Research Equipment Initiative
The Joint Research Equipment Initiative
brings together the higher education funding
councils, the Department for Employment
and Learning in Northern Ireland and the
Research Councils. It directs funds for
research equipment in strategic priority areas.
Since 1996 over £275 million of public and
private money has been committed for
‘leading edge’ equipment for UK universities
and colleges.
Joint Infrastructure Fund
The Joint Infrastructure Fund (JIF) was a
three-year programme to address the
infrastructure problems of universities and
was created by the Wellcome Trust and the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI),
each contributing £300 million. The Higher
Education Funding Council for England also
contributed £150 million, raising the total
fund to £750 million. A competition was run
over five rounds from May 1999 to March
428
25: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
2001. More than 150 projects from over
40 universities shared the £750 million.
Successful bids included a new research
laboratory for research into tissue engineering;
infrastructure for research on global climate
change; equipment for developing optical fibre
technology—photonic crystal fibre; astronomy
facilities to help with the identification of
black holes, stellar collapses and pulsars; a fire
safety engineering research facility; and a
post-genomic research centre to make
advances in healthcare using data amassed by
the Human Genome Project.
Science Research Investment Fund
A £1 billion initiative, announced in July
2000, builds on the Joint Infrastructure Fund.
The Science Research Investment Fund
(SRIF)—a two-year partnership between the
Government and the Wellcome Trust—will
finance new infrastructure schemes across the
spectrum of science and engineering during
2002-04. The Government will provide £775
million and the Wellcome Trust £225 million.
Funds will be allocated to universities for
them to decide priorities. Universities will be
required to find 25% of the total investment
in projects from their own resources, business
or other third parties. Contributions from
SRIF already announced by the Wellcome
Trust include grants of more than £10 million
each towards: a new biomedical sciences
research building at Leicester University; a
research institute for medical cell biology at
the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh; and a
research institute for molecular medicine at
Leeds University.
University Challenge Fund
The University Challenge Fund is a
competitive scheme that offers financing to
universities to help them in the early stages of
turning research into commercial products.
The first round involved over £65 million of
investment funds: the Government
contributed £25 million, the Wellcome Trust
£18 million and the Gatsby Charitable
Foundation £2 million, with the remainder
raised by universities. Fifteen seed funds were
established, allowing 37 institutions (28
universities and nine institutes) to access
investment capital. A second round of the
University Challenge Fund competition was
launched in April 2001 and awards will be
announced later in 2001.
Science Enterprise Challenge
In 1999 UK universities were invited to bid
for a share of a £25 million fund to establish
centres that would teach enterprise and
business skill to scientists, and promote
commercialisation of technological innovation.
Since then a total of £28.9 million has been
invested in 12 Science Enterprise Centres
located throughout the UK. Each centre is
hosted by a leading research university, and
seven centres are run by university consortia,
drawing in an additional 22 institutions. A
further round of bidding was announced in
the 2000 Spending Review and White Paper,
with an additional £15 million available to
fund either new centres or expand existing
ones: awards will be announced later in
2001.
Cambridge-MIT Institute
A strategic collaboration has been established
between Cambridge University and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to
carry out joint educational and research
initiatives to improve the competitiveness of
UK industry, focusing on the role of
technology and enterpreneurship. The
Institute is funded by a £65.1 million award
over five years from its launch in 2000.
Faraday Partnerships
The Faraday Partnership scheme
(www.faradaypartnerships.org.uk) is intended
to improve the exploitation of SET in the UK.
The partnerships bring together universities,
independent research organisations, industry
associations and manufacturers, with support
from DTI, DEFRA and some of the Research
Councils. It is intended to have a national
network of 24 Faraday Partnerships by
2002-03.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The first awards under the Wolfson
Foundation and Royal Society scheme to
attract and retain the best scientific talent
in the UK were announced in mid-2001.
Research specialisms represented by these
initial winners range across health, the
environment, the economy and
computing. The awards range from
£45,000 to £75,000. Of the first seven
winners of awards, four are at, or
associated with, University College
London. A further 30 awards are expected
to be made in 2001 and about 35 in the
second year of the scheme. The awards are
jointly funded by the Wolfson Foundation
and the OST.
Public Engagement in Science
The Government seeks to raise the status of
SET among the general public, by increasing
awareness of the contribution of SET to the
UK’s economic wealth and quality of life. To
this end, the Government supports activities
such as the annual science festival of the
British Association for the Advancement of
Science (BAAS), National Science Week and
the Committee on the Public Understanding
of Science (COPUS). COPUS—set up by
the Royal Society, BAAS and the Royal
Institution (see p. 444)—provides a strategic
focus for science communication in the UK
and promotes best practice in the field.
Science festivals are also a growing feature
of local cooperative efforts to further
understanding of the contribution made by
science to everyday life. Schools, museums,
laboratories, higher education institutions and
industry contribute to a variety of special
events. The longest established single-location
annual science festival is the Edinburgh
International Science Festival.
Activities such as these are important in
assuring continued interest in SET among
young people making educational and career
choices. They also help to enhance the
public’s ability to relate to scientific issues in
general and to make informed judgments
about scientific developments.
National Science Week 2001, held in
March, was marked by science events and
activities throughout the UK. From lI
wonder for Tots’ in Halifax to ‘Granny on
the Net’ in Kidderminster, all age groups
were catered for in a wide-ranging array of
events that also included a ‘how balls really
bounce’ look at the science of ball impacts
at Loughborough and a ‘magical mystery
tour’ through the sounds of‘Scouse’ at the
Liverpool Museum. In total, about 6,200
activities received some 1.4 million
visitors. The week is coordinated by the
BAAS and aims to popularise science and
provide debates on key scientific issues.
See the picture section between pp. 426
and 427.
An increase in the number of science
centres in the UK is intended to change the
way that the public interacts with science.
Investment in these new centres will total
more than £500 million—half of which will
come from UK National Lottery funding with
matching funding from other public and
private sources. The centres aim to bring
science and technology to the public in an
informative and enjoyable way (see p. 445).
Science Year is a government-funded
initiative which was launched in
September 2001. The Year aims to
increase pupil engagement in science
subjects; increase parents’ engagement in
science, both for themselves and to help
them support their children; raise the
profile of science; and celebrate
achievements in science and identify role
models through a Science and Engineering
Ambassadors initiative. Other planned
activities include a Science Discovery Day
at the Royal Albert Hall in South
Kensington, London; a ‘Future of Science
in Society’ conference at the BAAS
Festival of Science in Leicester; mass
participation experiments around the UK;
and events and conferences enabling
people to take part in debates on important
issues.

Women
The Promoting SET for Women Unit within
OST was established in 1994 in response to a
report which found that women were under¬
represented in the SET sectors, especially at
senior levels. The Unit has highlighted the
benefits to business of providing a working
environment sensitive to the needs of women
scientists and engineers who combine a career
and family responsibilities. It seeks to ensure
that careers information for girls and women is
widely available and to promote good
employment practices, such as the provision of
childcare facilities and job sharing. The Unit’s
website (vpwvp.set4women.gov.uk) promotes
SET for girls and women and gives details of
the Unit’s activities.
Industrial and Intellectual Property
The Government supports innovation
through the promotion of a national and
international system for the establishment of
intellectual property rights. These matters are
the responsibility of the Patent Office, an
executive agency of the DTI. The Office is
responsible for the granting of patents, and
registration of designs and trade marks. In
2000 it received over 31,400 applications for
patents and almost 76,000 applications for
trade marks. The Patent Office encourages
worldwide harmonisation of rules and
procedures, and the modernisation and
simplification of intellectual property law.
International patenting arrangements include
the European Patent Convention and the
Patent Co-operation Treaty. For trade marks
the European Community Trade Mark
System and the Aladrid Protocol provide
means of extending rights beyond the
borders of the U nited Kingdom. The Patent
Office Central Enquiry Unit and the website
(www.patent.gov.uk) offer detailed
information about intellectual property rights.
R&D’s important role in a knowledge-
driven economy is further recognised in an
intellectual property rights action plan, which
focuses on making these rights more
affordable and accessible. In August 1999 the
Baker report on the exploitation of public
sector research, Creating Knowledge: Creating
Wealth—Realising the Economic Potential of
Public Sector Research Establishments, was
published. The key recommendations were:
reducing the risk avoidance culture in central
government that inhibits entrepreneurial
behaviour; giving government laboratories
greater financial and management freedom;
and reforming Civil Service conduct rules so
as to reward scientists for exploiting their
work. The Government has welcomed the
report and has announced:
> guidelines on intellectual property in
government research contracts;
> changes and guidelines to provide
government scientists with greater
incentives and rewards for participating
fully, subject to safeguards, in
exploitation; and
> a ^10 million fund to support
commercialisation of the intellectual
property from research carried out in the
public sector, including public sector
research establishments, Research
Council institutes and the National
Health Service (NHS).
RESEARCH COUNCILS
Each Research Council is an autonomous body
established under Royal Charter, with
members of its governing council drawn from
the universities, professions, industrv and
government. The Councils support research,
study and training in universities and other
higher education institutions, and carry out or
support research, through their own institutes
and at international research centres, often
jointly with other public sector bodies and
international organisations. They provide
awards to about 15,000 postgraduate students
in science, social sciences, engineering and
technology. In addition to funding from the
OST, the Councils receive income from
research commissioned by government
departments and the private sector.
The Quinquennial Review of the seven
Research Councils was launched in 2001. The
review has two stages: the first stage, now
complete, considered the role and organisation
of the Councils; and the second stage will
431
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the
Councils’ operations.
Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC)
The EPSRC (www.epsrc.ac.uk), the Research
Council with the largest budget (£461 million
in 2001-02), promotes and supports high-
quality basic, strategic and applied research
and related postgraduate training in
engineering and the physical sciences. It also
provides advice, disseminates knowledge and
promotes public understanding in these areas.
Its remit is delivered through ten programme
areas: physics, chemistry, mathematics, the
generic technologies of information
technology and materials, three engineering
programmes (engineering, innovative
manufacturing and infrastructure, and
environment), the life sciences and basic
technology. The life sciences programme
covers research and training at the interface
between the life sciences and all areas of
engineering and the physical sciences. The
basic technolog}' programme is a joint council
programme managed by the EPSRC on behalf
of all the Research Councils.
EPSRC ‘Partnerships for Public Awareness’
awards were launched in 1998 to improve
public awareness of leading research and its
possible impact on society. The awards
encourage researchers to communicate the
value of their work to the public. In the first
three years, 68 projects received awards
totalling over £1.7 million. The Maths on the
Underground project from Cambridge
University has reached a large audience
through its use in schools and on a Channel 4
TV programme as well as on Circle Line trains
of the London Underground and a series of
events. It received the ‘Heist’ Merit Award for
marketing, and a book of the posters is
planned. A Reading University ‘Robot League’
project for schools had coverage on two
Channel 4 programmes, including a broadcast
The Research Councils were awarded
additional funding under the
Government’s 2000 Spending Review for
three priority areas—genomics, basic
technology and e-science:
> Genomics—the Research Councils have
established a Genomics Co-ordinating
Group to integrate post-genome
strategies, including interfacing with the
industrial sector, engagement of the
public, and analysis of the UK’s
strengths and weaknesses in genomics
research within the international context.
> Basic Technology/—this programme will
contribute to the development of
fundamental new technology that will be
available to scientific, engineering and
technology endeavour in the next 10 to
20 years. The £41 million programme is
being taken forward by the EPSRC, on
behalf of and in discussion with the other
Councils. It will support a different type
of project, that aims to encourage
consortia and develop a new ‘technology
community’ unconstrained by Research
Council remit or academic discipline.
> E-science—Science is increasingly
undertaken through global collaboration,
enabled by the Internet, and involves
very large volumes of data and using the
most powerful computer resources. The
e-science programme has two strands:
tackling generic grid infrastructure
problems common to all Research
Council disciplines and developing
e-science test beds specific to each
Council. It will help scientists to develop
the computing technolog} and
infrastructure that will be necessan to
process, store and analyse increasing
amounts of data. This £120 million
programme will be overseen by the
EPSRC. The Research Councils are
working closely together to capitalise on
potential joint funding opportunities. In
addition, links have been established
with other international programmes; for
example, there is collaboration with the
EU DataGrid Project, and Computer
Science Fellowships are being funded
at CERN in grid technologies.
432
25. SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Developments in quantum cryptography
could lead to completely secure
unhackable Internet, data and voice
communications. Researchers based at
Imperial College, London and the
University of Oxford are carrying out
research based on exploiting quantum
principles—the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle and quantum entanglement—
instead of the current mathematical
methods. They are working towards new
encryption systems. As industry and
commerce become increasingly reliant on
secure communications, the potential for
code-breaking techniques of the future
being able to breach current security
methods makes improving data encryption
a priority.

Royal Institution (see p. 444).
Medical Research Council (MRC)
The MRC {wwTv.mrc.ac.uk), with an overall
budget of £393 million for 2001-02, is the main
source of public funds for biomedical and
related sciences research. It supports research
and training aimed at maintaining and
improving human health. The MRC advances
knowledge and technology to meet the needs
of user communities, including the providers
of healthcare and the biotechnology, food,
healthcare, medical instrumentation,
pharmaceutical and other biomedical-related
industries. About half the JVIRC's research
expenditure is allocated to its own institutes
and units, the rest going mainly on grant
support and research training awards to teams
and individuals in higher education
institutions. The Council has three major
institutes, including the National Institute for
Medical Research at Mill Hill in London, the
Laboratory of Molecular Biology in
Cambridge and the Clinical Sciences Centre at
Imperial College, London. It has some 30
smaller research units and scientific teams in
the UK, most of which are attached to higher
education institutions and hospitals. The
MRC works closely with a number of
government bodies, in particular the UK
Health Departments; this includes
cooperation in developing research priorities,
and joint initiatives in areas such as primary
care research and in research training.
The Government has identified cancer as
one of the three most important service
priorities for the NHS (see p. 200). The
MRC is contributing in a number of ways
to research that will underpin
improvements in cancer health care. The
Council has established a Cancer Cell Unit
at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge,
that will work with the university’s
Department of Clinical Oncology to
translate basic research into new tests,
treatments and preventive measures.
Research at the nearby MRC Laboratory of
Molecular Biology has led to the design of
cytotoxic molecules that specifically target
cancer cells, rather than attacking normal
cells as well. This may lead to clinical
treatment for common cancers. MRC
funds many cancer clinical trials and is
hosting the new National Cancer Research
Institute, launched in April 2001, that will
provide a strategic focus for all aspects of
cancer research.
Natural Environment Research
Council (NERC)
The NERC {www.nerc.ac.uk) carries out Earth
system science. In 2001-02 it will spend its
budget of £220 million addressing issues
related to biodiversity, environmental risks
and hazards, global change, natural resource
management, and pollution and waste.
The Council invests in research in its own
and other research centres as well as research
and training in universities. It also provides a
range of facilities for use by the wider
environmental science community, including
a marine research fleet. NERC research
centres include the British Geological
Survey, the British Antarctic Survey, the
Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the
Southampton Oceanography Centre (a
partnership with Southampton University),
433
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
the Plymouth Marine Laboratory and the
Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory. The
NERC also supports a number of university-
based units. One of these is the Tyndall
Centre for Climate Change, jointly funded by
NERC, EPSRC and ESRC (see p. 435), with
headquarters at the University of East
Anglia. The Tyndall Centre brings together
scientists, economists, engineers and social
scientists, who together are working to
develop sustainable responses to climate
change. Their research involves dialogue
with the research community, with business
leaders, policy advisers, the media and the
general public.
Scientists at the Plymouth Marine
Laboratory (PML) have been researching
how the microscopic floating algae of the
sea—the phytoplankton—produce
ultraviolet sunscreen compounds of low
molecular weight to protect themselves
from the potentially damaging effects of
the sun. There is commercial interest in
these compounds—for algal sunscreens—
as the chemical properties match
requirements for a marketable product and
because they derive from a natural,
renewable source.
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC)
The BBSRC (www.bbsrc.ac.uk) has a budget of
£226 million for 2001-02. It supports basic
and strategic research and research training
related to the understanding and exploitation
of biological systems, which underpin the
agriculture, bioprocessing, chemical, food,
healthcare, pharmaceutical and other
biotechnology-related industries. The
scientific themes are biomolecular sciences;
genes and developmental biology;
biochemistry and cell biology; plant and
microbial sciences; animal sciences; agri-food;
and engineering and biological systems. As
well as funding research in universities and
other research centres, the BBSRC sponsors
eight research institutes.
The BBSRC funds research that provides
the UK with world-class genetics resources,
databases and genomics technologies for a
variety of model laboratory species and for
important microbes, crops and livestock. The
BBSRC has launched a £25 million initiative,
Exploiting Genomics, on research that brings
together genetics, engineering and information
science to address industrial and policy needs
in areas such as improving food safety,
overcoming bacterial resistance to antibiotics,
and developing new cell- and gene-based
therapies.
The BBSRC has established six specialist
Centres for Structural Biology, the science
that underpins understanding of, and ability
to predict how, the function of individual
biological molecules and large molecular
assemblies, such as virus particles, is
determined by their structure.
The Bioscience Business Plan competition
has been developed and piloted by the BBSRC
with support from the MRC and private
sector funding. It encourages the formation of
new bioscience ventures by enabling
participants to develop and submit ideas for
new start-up businesses.
Campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of
debilitating food poisoning in the UK and
around the world. A collaborative study by
scientists at the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine, and the
Universities of Leicester and Birmingham
has used comparative genomics,
microarrays and protein analysis
(proteomics) to look at patterns of gene
activity in this organism. The organism
has been shown to possess a capsular coat,
which has implications for its survival
inside its host and outside. Some of its
proteins have carbohydrate attachments—
something that was thought not to occur in
bacteria, and which is probably important
in Campylobacter's ability to alter its
surface characteristics and camouflage
itself against a host’s immune system.
These findings will help suggest new
strategies for controlling C. jejuni and for
designing vaccines.
434
25: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
Particle Physics and Astronomy
Research Council (PPARC)
The main task of the PPARC
{vpvprv.pparc.ac.uk), which has a budget of
£212 million for 2001-02, is to encourage and
support a balanced and cost-effective research
programme into fundamental physical
processes. Its four main areas of research are:
> particle physics—theoretical and
experimental research into elementary
particles and the fundamental forces of
nature;
> particle astrophysics—theoretical and
computational studies of the structure of
the early Universe following the Big
Bang;
^ astronomy (including cosmology and
astrophysics)—the origin, structure and
evolution of the Universe, stars and
galaxies; and
> planetary science (including solar and
terrestrial physics)—the origin and
evolution of the solar system and the
influence of the Sun on planetary bodies,
particularly Earth.
Researchers at Imperial College, London
and the University of Durham have been
investigating the possibilities of adaptive
optics techniques—methods of reducing
the distorting effects of the Earth’s
atmosphere on images produced by large
telescopes—in studies of the eye
(ophthalmology). Imaging the eye’s retina
is an important diagnostic tool but is
difficult because of the internal aberrations
of the eye. Adaptive optics can correct for
the aberrations and enable doctors to see
the retina in detail. It could also help to
simplify and improve the accuracy of
optometry and allow the production of
specialised contact lenses for correcting the
vision of people whose eyes have
complicated aberrations.
The PPARC’s support involves the provision
of funds to universities to undertake research
and the provision of facilities to enable that
research to take place. Facilities are provided
on a national and international basis, the latter
including membership of ESA and CERN,
and, from July 2002, ESO (see pp. 439-42).
The 2001 Census of Population in the UK
(see pp. 3-1—6) is using a new measure of
social class—the National Statistics Socio¬
economic Classification (NS-SEC). This
was developed through a collaborative
arrangement between the ESRC and the
Office for National Statistics. Information
about the eight NS—SEC categories—
which replace earlier Social Class
categories—can be found on the National
Statistics website (ipww.statistics.gov.uk).
Economic and Social Research
Council (ESRC)
The ESRC (www.esrc.ac.uk), with an R&D
provision of £78 million for 2001-02, supports
research and training in the social sciences to
address economic and social concerns of
importance to business, the public sector and
government—including economic
competitiveness, the quality of life, and the
effectiveness of public services and policy.
Research funded by the ESRC is conducted in
higher education institutions or independent
research establishments. The Council has
seven priority themes: economic performance
and development; environment and human
behaviour; governance and citizenship
knowledge, communication and learning;
lifecourse, lifestyles and health; social stability
and exclusion; and work and organisations.
A major research programme on devolution
and constitutional change in the UK has been
launched. It will explore the political,
economic, social and geographical effects of
constitutional changes connected with the
creation of the Scottish Parliament, the
National Assembly for Wales, the Northern
Ireland Assembly, Regional Development
Agencies (see p. 10) and the London
Assembly and Mayor (see pp. 9-10). The
programme’s aim is to increase understanding
of these processes of change and the
consequent effects on people’s lives.
435
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Council for the Central Laboratory of
the Research Councils (CCLRC)
The CCLRC (www.cclrc.ac.uk) promotes
scientific and engineering research by
providing facilities and technical expertise
primarily to meet the needs of the research
communities supported by the other Research
Councils. Its R&D budget for 2001—02 is
£114 million, of which £83 million comes
through agreements with other Research
Councils and another £23 million from
contracts and agreements with the EU,
overseas countries, and other industries and
organisations. It covers a broad range of
science and technology, including materials,
structural and biomolecular science using
accelerators, synchrotrons and lasers, satellite
instrumentation and data processing, remote
sensing, electronics, sensor technology,
computing, mobile communications, micro¬
engineering, microsystems and particle
physics.
The CCLRC is responsible for three
research establishments: the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire; the
Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire; and the
Chilbolton Observatory in Hampshire. These
centres provide facilities too large or complex to
be housed by individual academic institutions.
Among the facilities are ISIS (the world’s
leading source of pulsed neutrons and muons),
some of the world’s brightest lasers and the
pioneering Daresbury synchrotron source.
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS
Department of Trade and Industry
In 2001-02 DTI’s planned expenditure on
SET is £418 million: £274 million on R&D
and £144 million on technology transfer.
Expenditure covers innovation and technology
for a number of industrial sectors, including
aeronautics, biotechnology, chemicals,
communications, engineering, environmental
technology, IT, space (see pp. 439-40), and
nuclear and non-nuclear energy. DTI is
committed to helping UK businesses
successfully exploit their ideas, and to
promoting a business environment to
encourage this. DTI’s innovation expenditure
in 2001-02 will be some £334 million, of
which £58 million will be for industrial
exploitation of science, £87 million on support
for competitiveness and £76 million on
technical and design infrastructure.
Innovation embraces the development,
design and financing of new products, services
and processes, exploitation of new markets,
creation of new businesses and associated
changes in management of people and
organisational practices. Through its
Innovation Unit, a mixed team of business
secondees and government officials, DTI
seeks to promote a culture of innovation in all
sectors of the economy. In Northern Ireland
the Industrial Research and Technology Unit
has a similar role to that of DTI, supporting
industrial R&D, technology transfer and
innovation.
Technology and Knowledge Transfer
DTI aims to increase collaboration and the
flow of knowledge between the SET base and
businesses; improve access to sources of
technology and technological expertise;
improve the capacity of business to use
technology effectively; and increase the
uptake of the latest technology and best
practice techniques.
One example of a technology and
knowledge transfer mechanism is TCS
(previously known as the Teaching Company
Scheme). Now a Business Link service in
England, TCS is managed by the Small
Business Service (see p. 389) and funded by
DTI, two other government departments, five
of the Research Councils and the devolved
administrations, and by the participating
companies. As well as facilitating technology
and knowledge transfer between the
knowledge base and businesses, TCS also
provides business-based training and
experience for high-calibre graduates. They
work in companies on two-year projects that
are central to the needs of the businesses and
are jointly supervised by personnel from the
knowledge base and the companies. There are
around 900 individual TCS Programmes, each
involving one or more graduates, with around
90% of the Programmes involving small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

25: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
To help UK companies remain competitive
in an increasingly global market, DTFs
International Technology Service (ITS)
enables UK companies to become aware of,
and gain access to, new technological
developments and management practices not
present in the UK. The ITS highlights
developments and opportunities overseas; and
assists companies to access technologv, set up
licensing agreements and collaborative
ventures, and gain experience of new
technology and leading management practices.
Smart
The ‘Smart’ scheme helps individuals and
SMEs review their use of technology, access
technology, and research and develop
technologically innovative products and
processes. Traditionally, help has been
available for feasibility studies into innovative
technology and for projects to develop new
products and processes up to prototype stage.
Since 1999, Smart has also provided help for:
> technology reviews, which provide grants
towards the consultancy costs of an
expert review of a companv’s use of
technology compared to best practice in
its industry sector;
technology studies, which provide grants
for a more in-depth consultancy to help
a business identify technological
opportunities leading to innovative
products and processes; and
> micro projects, which provide grants of
UP t0 £10,000 to help individuals and
small firms with fewer than ten
employees to develop low-cost
prototypes of products and processes
involving technical advances and/or
novelty.
Business Links (see p. 389) have an
important role in providing advice on all
aspects of Smart, generating suitable
feasibility studies and development projects,
and in helping firms to submit applications.
Smart is managed in England by the Small
Business Service. Separate Smart schemes are
operated in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland.
Aeronautics
DTEs Civil Aircraft Research and
Technology Demonstration Programme
(CARAD) supports research and technologv
demonstration in aeronautics as part of the
industrial exploitation of science programme.
In 2001—02 the CARAD budget is £20
million. CARAD is part of the national
aeronautics research effort, with most of the
supported research work being conducted in
industry, and with significant involvement of
QinetiQ, formerly the Defence Evaluation and
Research Agency (see p. 438). Universities
and other research organisations receive about
7% of funding. CARAD and earlier
programmes have supported a range of
projects, including aluminium and composite
airframe materials, more efficient and
environmentally friendly engines, and
advanced aircraft systems.
Measurement Standards
DTI is responsible for the National
Measurement System (NMS—see p. 391)
which funds science and technologv
programmes in measurement science,
including materials metrology. DTI invests
£50 million on the NMS and a further
£8 million a year on materials metrology. The
NMS provides world-class measurement
standards and calibration facilities. These
enable businesses and public authorities to
make accurate measurements which are
nationally and internationally accepted.
Although most of the work is carried out at
the National Physical Laboratory, the
Laboratory of the Government Chemist, the
National Engineering Laboratory and the
National W'eights and .Measures Laboratory,
DTI is taking steps to increase competition in
these programmes and to work more closelv
with business in order to identify its future
needs.
Ministry of Defence
The Government invests about £450 million
a year in technological research to ensure that
the L K’s armed forces stay ahead of threats
from potential adversaries. The MoD has a
437
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
research budget and also a much larger
equipment procurement budget. Some
£2 billion a year is spent on equipment
procurement, including the development—the
design and testing (normally by industry for
the MoD as customer)—of specific equipment.
All MoD research was previously carried
out by the Defence Evaluation and Research
Agency (DERA), which used to be the largest
single scientific employer in the UK. In July
2001 DERA was disbanded and replaced by
two new organisations—Defence Science and
Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and QinetiQ^
pic. About 25% of the staff (some 3,000) have
been retained in MoD to form Dstl which is a
trading fund agency. It will carry out research
in key areas, provide a high-level overview of
defence science and technology, act as an in-
house source of impartial advice and manage
international research collaboration.
About 75% of DERA’s staff were
transferred to QinetiQ^plc. This is a wholly
government-owned company which will be
floated during 2002, with the Government
probably retaining a financial stake initially.
Department for Transport, Local
Government and the Regions (DTLR)
The DTLR funds research to provide the
evidence base for all its major policy and
operational responsibilities: local and regional
government; housing, urban policy and
planning; roads and local transport; and
railways, aviation and shipping. Total
expenditure for 2001-02 is £87 million,
including spending by executive agencies.
Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
DEFRA coordinates its research programme
with the devolved administrations and the
Research Councils. The programme supports
the Department’s wide-ranging
responsibilities for protecting the public in
relation to farm produce and animal diseases
transmissible to humans; protecting and
enhancing the rural and marine environment;
reducing risks from flooding and coastal
erosion; improving animal health and welfare;
and encouraging modern, efficient and
competitive agriculture, fishing and food
industries. The budget for research
expenditure in 2001—02 is £186 million,
including support for the Royal Botanic
Gardens, Kew (see p. 444). Through the
Darwin Initiative (see p. 321), British
expertise is being made available to assist
countries that are rich in biodiversity but
have insufficient financial or technical
resources to implement the Biodiversity
Convention.
The Report of the BSE (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalitis) Inquiry headed by
Lord Phillips was published in late 2000 (see
p. 460) and the Government’s response to the
report was published in September 2001. A
Review of the origin of BSE, presenting
results of a committee headed by Professor

Department of Health (DH)
The DH supports R&D to provide the
evidence needed to inform policy and practice
in public health, healthcare and social care. It
delivers this objective through:
> National Health Service (NHS) R&D
funding, which supports projects funded
by other non-commercial R&D sources
(including charities) carried out in the
NHS, and also specific health and social
care projects meeting identified research
needs of the DH and the NHS;
> a Policy Research Programme (PRP),
directly commissioned by the DH; and
> ad hoc project funding from other DH
R&D budgets and support for non-
departmental public bodies (NDPBs).
The DH expects to spend some £538
million on research in 2001-02: £476 million
on NHS R&D, £33 million on the PRP and
about £29 million involving the NDPBs and
ad hoc budgets.
Department for International
Development (DFID)
DFID commissions and sponsors knowledge
generation and sharing in natural resources,
health and population, engineering,
438

education and social sciences. Financial
provision in 2001-02 is about £90 million,
covering research projects and programmes
that respond to identified development
needs and that help build research capacity
in developing countries. DFID also
contributes to international centres and
programmes generating knowledge on
development issues. These contributions
include support for the EU Framework
Programmes, which sponsor research and
technological development in renewable
natural resources, agriculture, health and
information technologies, for the
Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR) and for the
\\ orld Health Organisation which
administer programmes that include
international research and research capacity
strengthening.
Scottish Executive
In many areas—electrical and electronic
engineering, medicine, agriculture and
biological sciences, fisheries and marine
science—Scotland’s science base has an
international reputation for research
excellence. The majority of the Scottish
Executive’s support for the science base is
disbursed by the Scottish Higher Education
Funding Council. In total this amounts to
some £616 million for 2001-02, including
£133 million for research and £23 million to
support the strategic development of the
sector. A further £52 million encourages and
funds agricultural and fisheries research, and
related biological, food, environmental,
economic and social science—most of this
goes to the Scottish Agricultural and
Biological Research Institutes, the Fisheries
Research Service and the Scottish Agricultural
College. In addition, about £145 million goes
to Scottish research institutions from the UK
Research Councils.
The Scottish Executive Enterprise and
Lifelong Learning Department encourages the
development of science-based industry, for
example, by promoting and administering
government and EU industrial R&D schemes.
The enterprise network in Scotland, including
Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, addresses the need for innovation
and technology transfer, both through grant
support for innovation and through a wide
range of initiatives.
Space Activities
The L K’s civil space programme is brought
together through the British National Space
Centre (BNSC), a partnership of government
departments and the Research Councils.
BNSC’s key aims are to develop practical and
economic uses of space, to promote the
competitiveness of British space companies in
world markets, to maintain the UK’s position
in space science, to foster the development of
innovative technology and to improve
understanding of the Earth’s environment and
resources. These are realised primarily by
collaboration with other European nations
through the European Space Agency (ESA).
Through BNSC, the Government spends
around £180 million a year on space activities.
About three-quarters of this is channelled
through ESA for collaborative programmes on
Earth observation, telecommunications and
space science, much of which returns to the
UK through contracts awarded to British
industry. The remaining quarter of the space
budget is spent on international
meteorological programmes carried out
through the European Meteorological Satellite
Organisation (EUMETSAT), developing
experiments (such as the Beagle 2 Mars
Lander) for ESA satellites, and on the national
programme, which is aimed at complementing
R&D supported through ESA. Around half of
the British space programme is concerned
with satellite-based Earth observation (remote
sensing) for commercial and environmental
applications.
The LK is also a major contributor to
ESA’s latest Earth observation satellite,
ENVISAT, due to be launched in 2001. This
will carry a new generation of radar and
radiometer systems as well as other scientific
environmental instruments, some of which
have been either designed or constructed in
Britain. British companies are also active in
the development of microsatellites.
A quarter of the UK’s space budget is
devoted to space science led by the Particle
439
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Physics and Astronomy Research Council, in
support of astronomy, planetary science and
geophysics. The UK is contributing
substantially to the SOHO mission to study
the Sun; to the Cluster mission launched in
2000 to study solar-terrestrial relationships; to
the Infrared Space Observatory, which is
investigating the birth and death of stars; and
to the Cassini Huygens mission, a seven-year
programme to send a probe to Saturn and its
moon Titan, launched in 1997. It is also
participating in XMM, ESA’s X-ray
spectroscopy mission launched in December
1999 to investigate X-ray emissions from black
holes.
The UK is taking an active role in the
largest current international project in
ground-based astronomy. The Gemini project
involves building two 8 m telescopes at Mauna
Kea (Hawaii) and Cerro Pachon (Chile): the
former became operational in 1999 and the
latter in 2001. The other partners are the
United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil and
Chile. The UK has a 25% stake in the work,
with major responsibility for the primary
mirror support system and much of the
control software.
ESA’s £400 million Living Planet
environmental research programme, to help
scientists understand and predict the Earth’s
environment and humankind’s effects upon it,
was launched in 1999. BNSC will contribute
£67 million to this programme. The first
project to benefit from the programme will be
the British CRYOSAT mission, to be
launched in 2002, which will study the effects
of global warming on the polar ice caps and
floating Arctic sea ice. UK environmental
scientists also have a significant interest in a
second mission, which will measure soil
moisture and ocean salinity.
Two new centres of excellence in Earth
observation will use satellites and models to
help forecast environmental change and play a
role in exploiting data from ENVISAT and
the Living Planet programme. The Data
Assimilation Research Centre will forecast
changes in the Earth’s systems, while the
Centre for Polar Observation Modelling will
measure changes in polar ice which could
cause rising sea levels and changes in ocean
circulation.
The UK is also developing the
Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget
instrument, which is intended to provide
accurate measurements of the energy source
for the Earth’s climate and, together with the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), the High Resolution
Dynamics Limb Sounder, which will provide
measurements of upper atmosphere trace
chemicals and temperature.
The UK has many bilateral agreements for
scientific research with other countries, such
as Russia, Japan and the United States. For
example, British scientists contributed to the
high-resolution camera for Chandra (the
NASA X-ray satellite).
Another major area of British space
expertise is satellite communications and
navigation. In Europe, the UK is both a
leading producer and user of satellite
communications technology (see p. 487). It is
taking a leading role in preparations for future
ESA satellite communications missions,
including ARTEMIS, which will provide
important communications links for the
ENVISAT programme. Britain is also
contributing to the Galileo global navigation
satellite system.
INTERNATIONAL
COLLABORATION
European Union
Since 1984 the EU has operated a series of
R&D framework programmes, across a range
of disciplines and sectors, to strengthen the
scientific and technological basis of European
industry and support the development of EU
policies. The Fifth Framework Programme,
which runs for four years (1999-2002),
supports strategic and applied multi¬
disciplinary research targeted at tackling
pressing European problems, such as
aeronautics, land transport and marine
technologies, the ageing population,
e-commerce and climate change. The six
grant-giving Research Councils maintain a
joint office in Brussels to promote UK
participation in European research
programmes. The UK is actively engaged in
440
25: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
the development of a common European Space
Strategy involving ESA, EU and others.
Other International Activities
Over 800 UK organisations have taken part in
EUREKA (www.eureka.be), an industry-led
scheme to encourage European cooperation in
developing advanced products and processes
with worldwide sales potential. There are 32
members of EUREKA, including the 15 EU
countries and the European Commission.
Some 650 projects are in progress, involving
firms, universities and research organisations.
About 1,100 projects have finished. Examples
of projects include the development of
biological tracers for use during oil spills to
identify the source of the spill; new designs for
lamp posts which will be less dangerous if hit
by oncoming vehicles; and a Tiopackaging’
project to develop food trays made from
potato starch, coated in a waterproof film,
which will biodegrade harmlessly when they
come into contact with soil.
The COST programme (European co¬
operation in the field of scientific and
technical research) is a multilateral agreement
involving 32 countries (including all the EU
member states, many Mediterranean, Central
European and Eastern European countries and
Israel). Its purpose is to encourage co¬
operation in national research activities across
Europe, with participants from industrv,
academia and research laboratories.
Transport, telecommunications and materials
have traditionally been the largest areas
supported. New areas include physics,
chemistry, neuroscience and the application of
biotechnology to agriculture, including
forestry. The UK participates in the majoritv
of COST actions and in the management of
the COST programme.
Another example of international
collaboration is CERN, the European
Uaboratory for Particle Physics, based in
Geneva, where the Targe Hadron Collider is
due to be completed by 2006. Scientific
programmes at CERN aim to test, verify and
develop the ‘standard model’ of the origin and
structure of the Universe. There are 20
member states. The Particle Physics and
Astronomy Research Council (see p. 435)
leads UK participation in CERN. The
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research
Council provides the UK contribution to the
costs of access by UK researchers to the high-
flux neutron source at the Institut Laue-
Langevin and to the European Synchrotron
Radiation Facility, both in Grenoble.
The PPARC is a partner in the European
Incoherent Scatter Radar Facility within the
Arctic Circle, which conducts research on the
ionosphere. The Natural Environment
Research Council has a major involvement in
international programmes of research into
global climate change organised through the
\\ orld Climate Research Programme and the
International Geosphere-Biosphere
Programme. It also supports the UK’s
subscription to the Ocean Drilling Program.
The Medical Research Council pays the
UK subscription to the European Molecular
Biology Laboratory (EMBL), which has its
home research base at Heidelberg. The
European Bioinformatics Institute, an
outstation of the EMBL, at Hinxton, near
Cambridge, provides access to important
molecular biology, sequencing and structural
databases. The MRC is also responsible for
the UK’s subscriptions to the International
Agency for Cancer Research and the Human
Frontier Science Programme, which supports
international collaborative research into brain
function and biological function through
molecular-level approaches .
The Research Councils have a number of
bilateral arrangements to promote international
collaboration. For example, the BBSRC has
agreements with its equivalent organisations in
France, the Netherlands, the United States,
China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and India,
and provides travel funding and fellowships to
encourage international linkages.
The U K is a member of the science and
technology committees of such international
organisations as the OECD and NATO, and
of various specialised agencies of the United
Nations, including the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation (UNESCO). The Research
Councils, the Royal Society and the British
Academy are members of the European
Science Foundation—an association of 67
international funding agencies in 24 European
countries, representing all scientific

disciplines-—and a number of British scientists
are involved in its initiatives.
The British Government also enters into
bilateral agreements with other governments
to encourage closer collaboration in science,
engineering and technology. Staff in British
Embassies, High Commissions and British
Council offices conduct government business
on, and promote contacts in, SET between the
UK and overseas countries; and help to
inform a large number of organisations in the
UK about developments and initiatives
overseas. There are science and technology
(S&T) attaches in British Missions in
Washington, Tokyo, Moscow, Ottawa, Paris,
Bonn, Munich, Rome, Beijing, Taipei and
Seoul. The S&T network is being expanded
by the creation of some 30 new posts across
the world—likely to be in North and South
America, Europe and Asia—and a London-
based S&T unit. A number of British Council
offices have designated Science Officer posts.
The British Council promotes the
creativity and innovation of cutting-edge UK
science through events, partnership
programmes, seminars, exhibitions and
information provision. It balances one-to-one
scientific links with projects aimed at raising
awareness of scientific issues among
overseas public audiences through popular
communication.
RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
INSTITUTIONS
Universities carry out most of the UK’s long¬
term strategic and basic research in science
and technology. The higher education funding
councils provide the main general funds to
support research in universities and other
higher education institutions in Great Britain.
These funds pay for the salaries of permanent
academic staff, who usually teach as well as
undertake research, and contribute to the
infrastructure for research. The quality of
research performance is a key element in the
allocation of funding. In Northern Ireland
institutions are funded by the Department for
Employment and Learning.
Basic and strategic research in higher
education institutions is also financed by the
Research Councils. Institutions undertaking
research with the support of Research Council
grants have the rights over the commercial
exploitation of their research, subject to the
prior agreement of the sponsoring Research
Council. They may make use of technology
transfer experts and other specialists to help
exploit and license the results of their
research. The other main channels of support
are industry, charities, government
departments and the EU. The high quality of
research in higher education institutions, and
their marketing skills, have enabled them to
attract more funding from a larger range of
external sources, especially in contract income
from industry and charities.
Science Parks
A Science Park is a business support and
technology transfer initiative—it has formal or
operational links to a higher education
institution or other major research centre,
encouraging and supporting the start-up,
incubation and growth of innovation-led,
high-growth, knowledge-based businesses.
The UK Science Park Association
(rmpw.ukspa.org.uk) numbers 63 such
initiatives, which between them host over
1,600 firms employing over 28,000 people in
total. Many of these firms are spin-offs from
the associated institution or are start-up
enterprises in fields of high technology such as
442
25: SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
software, biotechnology, analytical services or
consultancy.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Research and Technology
Organisations (RTOs)
RTOs are independent organisations carrying
out commercially relevant research and other
services on behalf of industry, often relating to
a specific industrial sector. Others are contract
research organisations undertaking specific
projects for any client. The Association of
Independent Research and Technologv
Organisations has 44 members that together
employ about 10,000 people.
Charitable Organisations
Medical research charities are a major source
of funds for medical research in the UK.
Their combined contribution to research
activities in the UK in 2000-01 was £632
million (excluding capital and infrastructure
costs). The three largest contributors are the
Wellcome Trust, the Imperial Cancer
Research Fund and the Cancer Research
Campaign.
Professional and Learned Institutions
There are numerous technical institutions,
professional associations and learned societies
in the U K, many of which promote their own
disciplines or the education and professional
well-being of their members. The Council of
Science and Technology Institutes has ten
member institutes representing biologv,
biochemistry, chemistry, the environment,
food science and technology, geology, hospital
physics and physics.
The Engineering Council (www.engc.org.uk)
promotes and regulates the engineering
profession. It is supported by over 125
industry affiliates, which include large
private sector companies and government
departments, and 35 professional engineering
institutions. In partnership with the
institutions, the Council accredits higher and
further education courses and advises the
Government on academic, industrial and
professional issues. It also runs a number of
promotional activities. Some 257,000
individuals have satisfied the Council’s
regulations for registration through their
institution as either Chartered Engineers,
Incorporated Engineers or as Engineering
Technicians.
Royal Society
The Royal Society (www.royalsoc.ac.uk),
founded in 1660, is the UK’s academy of
science and has 1,130 Fellows and 113 Foreign
Members. Many of its Fellows serve on
governmental advisory councils and
committees concerned with research. The
Society has three roles: as the national
academy of science, as a learned society and as
a funding agency for the scientific communitv.
It offers independent advice to government on
science matters, acts as an international forum
for discussion of ground-breaking scientific
research, supports many of the brightest
young scientists and engineers in the UK,
facilitates dialogue between scientists and the
public and promotes science education. Its
government grant for 2001-02 is £26 million.
One of the 42 new Fellows of the Roval
Society (FRS) in 2001, Professor Timothy
Berners-Lee was elected in recognition of
his work that has ‘revolutionised
communication via the Internet, enabling
universal access to information placed on
the web, and has had a profound economic
impact’. Professor Berners-Lee, now at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in
the United States, invented the web’s
address system and layout while working
at CERN in Switzerland in 1990, thus
revolutionising the way information is
presented and accessed.
Royal Academy of Engineering
The national academy of engineering in Britain
is the Royal Academy of Engineering
(www.raeng.org.uk), which has 1,175 Fellows
and 82 Foreign Members. It promotes
excellence in engineering for the benefit of
society, and advises government, Parliament
and other official organisations. The Academy’s
programmes are aimed at attracting first-class
443
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
students into engineering, raising awareness of
the importance of engineering design among
undergraduates, developing links between
industry and higher education, and increasing
industrial investment in engineering research in
higher education institutions. It has a
government grant of £4.3 million in 2001-02.
Other Societies
In Scotland the Royal Society of Edinburgh,
established in 1783, promotes science by
offering postdoctoral research fellowships and
studentships, awarding prizes and grants,
organising meetings and symposia, and
publishing journals. It also acts as a source of
independent scientific advice to the
Government and others.
Three other major institutions publicise
scientific developments by means of lectures
and publications for specialists and
schoolchildren. Of these, the British
Association for the Advancement of Science,
founded in 1831, is mainly concerned with
science, while the Royal Society of Arts
(wwip.rsa.org.uk), dating from 1754, deals with
the arts and commerce as well as science. The
Royal Institution (www.ri.ac.uk), founded in
1799, also performs these functions and runs
its own research laboratories. It also arranges a
large and varied public programme of events
to bring science to a wider audience, including
the Christmas Lectures and the Friday Evening
Discourses. These are all presented in the Royal
Institution’s historic Albemarle Street lecture
theatre—some 35,000 schoolchildren and
25,000 members of the public attend events
here each year. The Christmas Lectures now
reach a worldwide audience, being broadcast
in Britain, other parts of Europe, Japan and
the Republic of Korea.
Zoological Gardens
The Zoological Society of London (ZSL)
(www.zsl.org), an independent conservation,
science and education charity founded in
1826, runs London Zoo, which occupies about
15 hectares (36 acres) of Regent’s Park
(London). It also owns and runs Whipsnade
Wild Animal Park (243 hectares/600 acres) in
Bedfordshire. ZSL is responsible for the
Institute of Zoology, which carries out
research in support of conservation. The
Institute’s work covers topics such as ecology,
reproductive biology and conservation
genetics. ZSL also operates in overseas
conservation projects, and is concerned with
practical field conservation, primarily in East
and Southern Africa, the Middle East and
parts of Asia. Other well-known zoos in the
UK include those in Edinburgh, Bristol,
Chester, Dudley and Marwell (near
Winchester).
Botanic Gardens
The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew
(www.rbgkew.org.uk), founded in 1759, covers
121 hectares (300 acres) at Kew in south-west
London and a 187-hectare (462-acre) estate at
Wakehurst Place (Ardingly, in West Sussex).
They contain one of the largest collections of
living and dried plants in the world. Research
is conducted into all aspects of plant life,
including physiology, biochemistry, genetics,
economic botany and the conservation of
habitats and species. The Millennium Seed
Bank, containing the world’s most
comprehensive collection of seeds of flowering
plants, at Wakehurst Place in Sussex, opened
in August 2000. By August 2001 it held
266,425,433 seeds. These are stored in large
underground vaults at -20°C in the Wellcome
Trust Millennium Building. Staff are also
active in programmes to reintroduce
endangered plant species to the wild. Kew
participates in joint research programmes in
some 50 countries.
The Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh
was established in 1670 and is the national
botanic garden of Scotland. Together with its
three associated specialist gardens, which were
acquired to provide a range of different
climatic and soil conditions, it has become an
internationally recognised centre for taxonomy
(classification of species); for the conservation
and study of living and preserved plants and
fungi; and as a provider of horticultural
education.
A National Botanic Garden and research
centre for Wales has been developed on a 230-
hectare (570-acre) site on the Middleton Hall
estate at Llanarthne, near Carmarthen and was
opened in May 2000—the first botanic garden
to be built in Britain for two centuries.

programme of demonstrations, talks,
‘hands-on’ workshops and team activities
starts at around 7 p.m. and finishes at
10 a.m. the next morning. Each season of
Science Nights has a theme—Light
Fantastic, Space and Stars, Forces and
Motion, and Material World. The
programme provides a mixture of
education and fun, and is designed to
introduce science to children and interest
them in science at an early age.
Scientific Museums
The Natural History Museum
{rvww.nhm.ac.uk) is one of Britain’s most
popular visitor attractions (with 1.7 million
visitors in 2000-01), with exhibitions devoted
to the Earth and the life sciences. It is founded
on collections of 68 million specimens from
the natural world, has 350 scientists working
in 60 countries, and has 500,000 historically
important original works of art. It also offers
an advisory service to institutions all over the
world. The Science Museum
{www.nmsi.ac.uk), which had 1.4 million
visitors in 2000-01, promotes the public
understanding of the history of science,
technology, industry and medicine.
Around 80 science and discovery centres
in the E K have formed a new network
which will be the UK wing of ECSITE—
the European Collaborative for Science
Industry and Technology Exhibitions. It
will be known formally as ECSITE-UK,
the Science and Discovery Centre
Network. It brings together more than
40 regional science centres and a similar
number of discovery centres in a wide
range of museums, botanic gardens,
aquariums and zoos. In recent years the
number of science centres has increased
rapidly through Millennium Commission
funding, matched by capital investment
from other public and private sources. The
largest private supporter is the Wellcome
Trust, which has invested £45 million in
science centres in Birmingham, Bristol,
Dundee, Glasgow, London, xManchester
and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A new wing added 10,000 sq m of display
space to the Museum in June 2000. This
contains galleries on biomedical science and
information technology and a 450-seat 3D
IMAX (large-format screen) theatre. These
two museums are in South Kensington,
London. Other important collections include
those at the Museum of Science & Industry in
Manchester, the Museum of the History of
Science in Oxford, and the Royal Scottish
Museum, Edinburgh.

Although agriculture, forestry and fishing together accounted for only 1.1% of
the total economy in terms of gross value added in 2000, their impact across the
United Kingdom was far greater. The UK is about 66% self-sufficient for all
food and about 80% for indigenous food.
Agriculture
The major issue facing the farming community
in the UK in 2001 was the outbreak of foot-
and-mouth disease (see p. 460). This dealt the
industry another blow, coming as it did after
the BSE epidemic and then the severe flooding
which affected many parts of the UK,
especially parts of south-east England, and
areas close to the River Severn and the
Yorkshire Ouse, during autumn 2000. Farm
incomes remained low in 2000, another key
factor being the further decline in the value of
the euro against sterling during the year.
In 2000 UK agriculture contributed
6.6 billion to the total economy, employed
some 557,000 people and used nearly three-
quarters of the country’s land area.
A new Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) was created after
the 2001 General Election. It has a crucial role
in promoting sustainable development, rural
renewal, and sustainable and competitive food
chains, both in the UK and internationally. It
brings together all the functions of the former
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(MAFF), the Environment Protection Group
and Wildlife and Countryside Directorate
from the former Department of the
Environment, Transport and the Regions
(DETR) and responsibility for certain animal
welfare issues and hunting with hounds from

budget.
Farming
In 2000 there were some 233,200 farm
holdings in the UK (excluding minor holdings
in Great Britain but including all active farms
in Northern Ireland). These holdings had an
average area of 70.9 hectares (175.2 acres).
About 27% of them are smaller than eight
European size units (ESUs).1 About two-
thirds of all agricultural land is owner-
occupied; the rest is tenanted or rented.
Agricultural land represents about 75% of
1 ESUs measure the financial potential of the holding in terms of
the margins which might be expected from stock and crops:
8 ESU is judged the minimum for full-time holdings.

for the EU as a whole.
Total income from farming in the UK is
estimated to have fallen by 2/% in real terms,
from £2,578 million in 1999 to £1,882 million
in 2000. The value of output (including
subsidies directly related to products) was
4.5% (£729 million) lower in current prices
than in 1999. This fall is largely due to
pressure on prices for agricultural outputs
caused by a further rise in sterling against the
euro, compared with 1999. Prices have fallen
particularly for milk and cereals and also,
because of domestic market conditions, for
potatoes. The wet autumn caused problems
for many farmers. Industry productivity rose by
2.5% in 2000; the volume of inputs fell by
3.8%, largely due to an 11% fall in the volume
of paid labour, whereas a lesser fall of 1.4% in
the volume of final output reflected
significant drops in the production of oilseed
rape, linseed, potatoes, pigs and breeding
livestock.
The first of over 300farmers’ markets now
operating in the UK—selling produce directly
to consumers—started in 1997, and a National
Association {www.farmersmarkets.net) was
launched in May 2000.
Agricultural Landlords and Tenants
About 34% of agricultural land in England
and 21% in Wales is rented. Since 1995 a
simplified legal framework for new tenancies,
known as farm business tenancies, has allowed
landowners to benefit from full income tax
relief.
There is a similar proportion of rented land
in Scotland, much of it under crofting tenure
(see below), including common grazings. The
Scottish Executive is committed to changing
the law relating to agricultural tenure.
Most farms in Northern Ireland are owner-
occupied, but the conacre system allows
owners not wishing to farm all their land to
let it annually to others. Conacre land, about
30% of agricultural land, is used mainly for
grazing.
Smallholdings and Crofts
In England and \\ ales county councils let
smallholdings to experienced people who want
to farm on their own account. Councils mav
lend working capital to them. In January 2001
there were approximately 31,000
smallholdings in England and 7,000 in Wales.

Land settlement in Scotland has been carried
out by the Scottish Executive, which still
owns and maintains about 104,500 hectares
(668,800 acres) of land settlement estates,
comprising 1,390 crofts and holdings.
Crofting is a system of land tenure
regulated through the Crofting Acts and
found only in the Highlands and Islands of
Scotland. A croft is a unit of land subject to
these Acts, not a house. It rarely provides a
full-time income and most crofters have other
off-croft employment. An estimated 30,000
family members live on 17,500 crofts, the
main crofting areas being in the Western Isles
(about 6,000 crofts), Shetland (2,700), Skye
and the Inner Hebrides (1,800) and the north¬
west Highlands (2,300). Croft land covers
some 800,000 hectares (2 million acres) and
accounts for more than 25% of the
agricultural land area of the Highlands and
Islands. The Crofters Commission develops
and regulates the crofting system and
promotes the interests of crofters. The
Scottish Executive plans to issue a White
Paper in 2002 containing proposals for an
amended crofting Act.
PRODUCTION
Home production of the principal foods is
shown in Table 26.2 as a percentage by weight
of total supplies. Total new supply is home
production plus imports less exports.
Livestock
About half of full-time farms are devoted
mainly to dairy farming or to beef cattle and
sheep. Most of the beef animals and sheep are
reared in the hill and moorland areas of
Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and
northern and south-western England. Among
world-famous British livestock are the
Hereford, Welsh Black and Aberdeen Angus
beef breeds, the Jersey, Guernsey and
Ayrshire dairy breeds, the Large White pig
breed and a number of sheep breeds.
Livestock totals are given in Table 26.3.
Cattle and Sheep
Cattle and sheep constitute about 35% of the
value of the UK’s gross agricultural output.

Dairy production is the largest part of the
sector, followed by cattle and calves, and then
sheep and lambs. In 2000 the average size of
dairy herds in England was 79. The average
yield of milk for each dairy cow in the UK
was 5,915 litres (1,300 gallons). The total
value of milk and milk products for human
consumption fell by 10%.
More than half of home-fed beef
production originates from the national dairy
herd, in which the Holstein Friesian breed
predominates. The remainder derives from
suckler herds producing high-quality beef
calves, both in the hills and uplands and in
lowland areas. The traditional British beef
breeds (see p. 448) and, increasingly, imported
breeds, such as Charolais, Limousin,
Simmental and Belgian Blue, are used for beef
production.
The size of both the beef-breeding and
dairy herds decreased by 4.3% in 2000. The
value of beef and veal production fell by 2.3%
t0 £^>011 million. Despite increased
production—output rose by 4.0% to 706,000
tonnes—there were falls in finished cattle
prices and in subsidy payments.
The UK has more than 60 native sheep
breeds and many cross-bred varieties. The size
of the British breeding flock declined by
4.7% in 2000 to 20.4 million and the value of
sheepmeat production by 1.9% to £982
million. Prices were generally higher than in
1999. Exports fell in 2000, hampered by the
continued strength of the pound.
Pigs
The output value of pigs increased by 5.0% in
2000 to £826 million due to a 20% increase in
prices which offset a 12% fall in the home-fed
production of pigmeat. Marketing of clean
pigs2 fell by 14%, reflecting the continuing
contraction of the breeding herd and also an
outbreak of Classical Swine Fever (see
2 Pigs which have not been used for breeding.
449
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
pp. 460-1) in the autumn, which removed
over 220,000 pigs from the food chain.
Poultry
The total UK poultry population in 2000
comprised 105.7 million chickens and other
table fowls; 28.7 million birds in the laying
flock; 9.9 million fowls for breeding; and
12.9 million turkeys, ducks and geese.
Poultrymeat production in 2000 was 1.5
million tonnes, a 0.6% decrease on 1999. The
overall value of production in 2000 rose by
2.0% to £1,299 million. Poultry prices overall
rose by 1.3%, with the price for turkeys
increasing by 11% to the highest level since
1996. The value of hen eggs for human
consumption increased by 6.7%.
Crops
Farms devoted primarily to arable crops are
found mainly in eastern and central-southern
England and eastern Scotland. The main crops
are shown in Table 26.4. In the UK in 2000,
the area planted to cereals—predominantly
wheat, barley and oats—totalled 3.35 million
hectares, an increase of 6.6% on 1999, largely
as a result of good planting conditions and a
switch away from oilseed rape and linseed.
Total cereal production increased by 8.4% to
24.0 million tonnes and total value by 1.0% to
£2,350 million.
The output value of oilseed rape fell by 32%
to £249 million in 2000 and that of linseed by
74% to £34 million, due to lower plantings
and a reduction in subsidy rates. The output
value of sugar beet fell by 9% to £253 million.
Large-scale potato and vegetable cultivation
takes place on the fertile soils throughout the
UK, often with irrigation. Principal areas are
the peat and silt fens of Cambridgeshire,
Lincolnshire and Norfolk; the sandy loams of
Norfolk, Suffolk, West Midlands,
Nottinghamshire, South Yorkshire and
Lincolnshire; the peat soils of south Lancashire;
and the alluvial silts by the River Humber.
Early potatoes are produced in Shropshire,
Pembrokeshire, Cornwall, Devon, Essex,
Suffolk, Kent, Cheshire and south-west
Scotland. Production of high-grade seed
potatoes is confined mainly to east Scotland,
Northern Ireland, the northern uplands of
England and the Welsh borders. Total area for
all potatoes fell by 7.3% in 2000, with an overall
reduction in production of 7.6%. Waterlogged
ground caused by continuous rain from mid-
October onwards meant that over 20,000
hectares of the Great Britain crop remained
unlifted by the end of the year. The output
value of potatoes fell by 33% to £501 million.
Arable Area Payments Scheme
Under this scheme within the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP—see p. 457),
farmers may claim area payments on cereals,
oilseeds, proteins and linseed, and on fibre flax
and hemp for fibre. A condition for claiming
area payments is that large-scale farmers must
‘set aside’ a certain percentage of their land,
thereby avoiding overproduction, and must
comply with the strict rules for managing
set-aside. The minimum rate for set-aside
for 2001 is 10% of the total area claimed.
In 2000 there were approximately 59,200
claims for area payments in the UK in respect
of nearly 4.5 million hectares of land. Payments
of approximately £990 million were made.
Pesticides
The Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD), an
executive agency of DEFRA, administers the
regulation of agricultural, horticultural,
forestry, food storage and home garden
pesticides. Its principal functions are to
evaluate and process applications for approval
of pesticide products for use in Great Britain
and provide advice to government on
pesticides policy. The PSD aims:
> to protect the health of human beings,
creatures and plants;
> to safeguard the environment; and
> to ensure that methods of pest control are
safe, efficient and humane by providing
effective controls on the sale, supply and
use of pesticides.

total area devoted to horticulture (excluding
mushrooms, potatoes, and peas for harvesting
dry) amounted to 172,310 hectares, a decrease
of 3.7% on the 1999 figure. This area relates
to field area and does not take into account the
number of crops in the year. Vegetables and
salad grown in the open for human
consumption accounted for 118,500 hectares;
total orchards, small fruit and grapes 37,500
hectares; other horticultural crops grown in
the open 14,100 hectares; and area under glass
or plastic covered sheets 2,200 hectares.
The output value of all horticultural
products (including seeds and peas harvested
dry) in 2000 was £1.9 billion, virtually
unchanged from 1999. A slight rise of 1.9% in
the value of production for vegetables was
offset by decreases of 0.6% for ornamentals
and 3.2% for fruit.
Agri-industrial Materials
The Agri-Industrial Materials (AIMS) section
in DEFRA is responsible for the coordination
and development of plant-based renewable
raw materials. It aims:
> to encourage the development of crops
for energy and industry, to the benefit of
UK agriculture, manufacturing
businesses, and the environment;
> to stimulate market-led opportunities for
renewable raw materials from
environmentally acceptable crops with
prospects of commercial viability;
> to ensure cohesion between agriculture
and other areas of government policy,
and between policies on different
agricultural crops and other aspects of
agriculture so that worthwhile and
potential developments are not hindered;
and
> to provide the strategic research on
which future developments can be based.
AIMS is also providing the secretariat for a
new government-industry forum on non-food
uses of crops.
452
Genetically Modified Crops
Now that the location and function of
individual crop genes are being discovered,
26: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
scientists have the chance to alter the genetic
make-up of plants by adding or removing
specific genes. Some 44 million hectares of
genetically modified crops were estimated to
have been grown in 14 countries across the
world in 2000.
A three-year UK programme of farm-scale
evaluations (FSEs), begun in 1999, will allow
independent researchers to study the effect, if
any, that the management practices associated
with genetically modified (GM) herbicide
tolerant crops might have on farmland
wildlife, when compared with those used with
non-GM crops. Three crops are involved:
oilseed rape (both spring and autumn sown);
beet (fodder and sugar varieties); and maize.
The project will involve between 60 and 75
fields of each crop in total. Sites for autumn
2001 were announced in July 2001. At the end
of the programme in 2002-03, the results will
be reported, made publicly available and
considered by the Government. The FSE
programme includes a project to monitor
gene-flow, including cross-pollination. There
will be no commercial growing of GM crops
until the FSEs are completed and unless they
are assessed as posing no unacceptable effects
on the environment.
Food Safety
The Food Standards Agency (FSA—see
chapter 13) (Tvvprp.foodstandards.gov.uk),
launched in 2000, aims to ensure that the food
consumers eat is safe, and to offer
independent, balanced advice to government
throughout the UK. The Meat Hvgiene
Service, an executive agency of the FSA, is
responsible for enforcing legislation on meat
hygiene, inspection, animal welfare at
slaughter and specified risk materials controls
in all licensed abattoirs and cutting premises
in Great Britain.
EXPORTS, MARKETING AND
PROMOTION
Exports of food, feed and drink were around
£8.8 billion in 2000, compared with £17.0
billion for imports. EU countries accounted
for 61% of all UK food and drink exports. In
2000 the main markets were the Irish Republic
(£1.2 billion) and France (£1.0 billion). Sales
to the United States increased by 4% to £832
million and to Asia by 12%, to £961 million.
Drinks and cereals were key contributors to
exports. Drinks were up overall by 5% for the
year, with whisky and fruit juices recording
the highest gains, at 7% and 19% respectively.
Rising world prices for wheat and barley
resulted in a 5% increase in exports of cereals.

foodfrombritain.com), an organisation funded
by DEFRA on behalf of the four agricultural
Departments (£5.4 million in 2000-01) and by
industry (£7.0 million), provides specialist
marketing and international business
development services to the food and drink
industry. It has a network of 11 international
offices, each with local food industry expertise
and trade contacts. It also fosters the
development of the speciality food and drink
industry in the UK through a range of tailored
business development and marketing services,
delivered nationally by FFB and locally by
regional and county food groups. Speciality
companies have an annual turnover of about
£3.6 billion and a workforce of 52,000.
The British Farm Standard red tractor
logo, launched in June 2000, has been
designed by the National Farmers’ Union as
an authoritative mark to identify food that
meets high—and independently verified—
production standards covering food safety,
animal welfare and environmental issues.
Several major shows are held annually3

GOVERNMENT ROLE
DEFRA, the Scottish Executive Environment
and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD), the
National Assembly for Wales Agriculture
Department (NAWAD), and the Department
of Agriculture and Rural Development in
Northern Ireland (DARD) have varying
degrees of responsibility for agriculture and
fisheries affairs. Matters not devolved or
transferred to the devolved administrations,
such as relations with the EU and other
international organisations, remain with the
Government in London. The work of
DEFRA’s nine Regional Service Centres in
England and SEERAD’s eight areas in
Scotland relates to payments under domestic
and EU schemes, licensing and other services
for farmers and growers.
UK Agriculture Strategy
The Government launched a long-term
strategy for the agriculture industry—New
Direction—in December 1999. It is designed
to help the farming industry become more
competitive, diverse, flexible, responsive to
consumer wishes and environmentally
responsible. The strategy aims to deliver
short-term support to those sectors hit hardest
by the farming crisis and longer-term action to
encourage industry restructuring and
adaptation.
New Rural Development Programmes (see
pp. 455—6), implementing the EU Rural
Development Regulation, will help implement
the strategy. These programmes have been
approved by the European Commission. In
total, these will invest nearly £3 billion in the
UK rural economy over seven years. A new
partnership between government across the
EU and the farming community will mean
that some of the existing production-linked
payments to farmers will be recycled into rural
development measures and matched with
equivalent UK government funding.
These programmes have been supplemented
by other measures, in particular the Action
Plan for Farming, which was launched in
March 2000 in response to the crisis in farm
incomes in the UK. The plan provides short¬
term financial relief and longer-term support
for business restructuring and development,
improved marketing and food chain
cooperation, training and innovation.
Although a number of measures in the Plan
are UK-wide, others are focused on England.
The devolved administrations are developing
strategies to meet priorities in their own areas.
For example, in Scotland the Scottish
Executive published a policy document,
A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture,
in June 2001.
The Government announced in August
2001 the establishment of an independent
Policy Commission on the future of farming
and food in England. The Commission will
advise the Government how a sustainable,
competitive and diverse farming and food
sector can be created which contributes to a
thriving and sustainable rural economy, and
advances environmental, economic, health and
animal welfare goals. Its work will be
consistent with the Government's aims for
CAP reform, enlargement of the EU and
increased trade liberalisation.
In Wales, an advisory group has been
established to assist in the preparation of a
long-term direction for farming. The National
Assembly’s Agriculture and Rural
Development Committee has been invited to
discuss and comment on the draft strategy
prior to its publication, planned for autumn
2001.
In Northern Ireland, a separate strategic
review, aimed at developing a vision for the
future development of the local agri-food
sector, is expected to produce a final report in
autumn 2001.
The Government published a Rural White
Paper, Our Countryside: the future—a fair deal
for rural England, in November 2000. The
main areas of focus were:
454
26: AGRICULTURE. FISHING & FORESTRY
> sustainable growth and regeneration in
rural areas;
> a new direction for agriculture;
> access to services in rural areas and
countering social exclusion; and
> conservation and recreation.
The Scottish Executive published Rural
Scotland: a New Approach in May 2000. This
set out the Executive’s priorities on rural issues
and how it is working to deliver its rural
commitments. The Executive commissioned a
report into innovative service provision, and is
currently considering how to take the report
forward. It also set up the Rural Poverty and
Inclusion \\ orking Group to advise on rural
poverty and social exclusion matters.
Rural Development Programmes
The England Rural Development Programme
(ERDP), launched in October 2000, will
invest £1.6 billion in rural development and
agri-environment measures over seven years.
The programme identifies two priority areas
for funding: the conservation and
improvement of the environment and creation
of a productive and sustainable rural economy.
It sets out how these priorities will be met
through a substantial expansion in funds for
four schemes described below:
> the Countryside Stewardship Scheme;
> the Organic Farming Scheme;
the \\ oodland Grant Scheme; and
> the Farm W oodland Premium Scheme.
The Environmentally Sensitive Areas
Scheme will continue, with support for hill
farming refocused through the new Hill Farm
Allowance Scheme. Four new schemes opened
to applications in October 2000:
> the Rural Enterprise Scheme;
> Processing and Marketing Grants;
> the Energy Crops Scheme; and
> the Vocational Training Scheme.
These schemes aim to assist the creation of
more diverse and competitive agriculture and
forestry sectors, more jobs in the countryside,
the development of new products and markets
and greater collaboration, and to provide
training to support these new activities.
The Scottish Rural Development
Programme incorporates the new Rural
Stewardship Scheme and the Organic Aid
Scheme, the new area-based scheme to
support Less Favoured Areas, and the
continuation of the Farm W' oodland Premium
Scheme and the Woodland Grant Scheme.
The new Less Favoured Areas Support
Scheme will be worth £61 million in 2000-01.
Payments are based on area, and land
capability and remoteness are taken into
account. Around £685 million will be spent
over the lifetime (seven years) of the Rural
Development Programme on these schemes.
Under the Highlands and Islands Special
Transitional Programme, which operates
under the Rural Development Regulation,
SEERAD introduced the Agricultural
Business Development Scheme across the
programme area. The scheme will provide
assistance to farmers and crofters for
investments in agricultural holdings and
diversification projects, while immediate
family members may apply for assistance with
diversification projects. Assistance is also
available for marketing and training.
The Hales Rural Development Plan,
published in December 2000, will involve the
investment of around £450 million in rural
development and agri-environment measures
over seven years. The National Assembly is
supporting a number of the measures
permitted under the Plan, aimed at conserving
and improving the environment and enabling
farming, forestry and other rural businesses
and communities to adapt to changing
circumstances and to develop. The
programme will make funds available for Tir
Gofal (Land in Care); the Organic Farming
Scheme; support for hill farming through Tir
Mynydd; a range of forestry and farm
woodland initiatives; training for farmers and
their families; investment in agricultural
holdings; and the processing and marketing of
agricultural products through the Processing
and Marketing Grant Scheme.
The Rural Development Regulation Plan for
Northern Ireland, worth £266 million between
2000 and 2006, comprises a new Less Favoured
455
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Area support scheme to replace the existing
Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances; an
enhanced agri-environment programme, with
additional funding for the Countryside
Management Scheme and the Organic Farming
Scheme; continuation of the Environmentally
Sensitive Areas Schemes; and a continuation of
the private forestry programme.
DARD also manages a Rural Development
Programme targeted at the broader rural
community. It is expected to be worth about
£80 million between 2001 and 2007, and
combines several programmes, such as the
Northern Ireland Programme for Building
Sustainable Prosperity (see p. 457).
Agri-environment Schemes
Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs)
The Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme,
introduced in 1987, offers incentives to
farmers to adopt agricultural practices which
will safeguard and enhance parts of the
country of particularly high landscape, wildlife
or historic value. There are now 22 ESAs in
England, covering some 10% of agricultural
land, and six in Wales (operating under Tir
Gofal), ten in Scotland and five in Northern
Ireland. In 2000-01 a forecast £68.4 million
was spent in the UK under ESAs.
Hill Farm Allowance Scheme (HFA)
The new HFA scheme is designed to
compensate hill farmers for the difficulties of
farming in Less Favoured Areas. It replaces
the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance
scheme, under which farm incomes continued
to decline. Some £12.6 million is forecast to
have been spent on the new scheme in
2000-01.
Countryside Stewardship
The Countryside Stewardship scheme is the
main scheme for the wider countryside which
aims, through the payment of grants, to
improve the natural beauty and diversity of
the English countryside; to enhance, restore
and recreate targeted landscapes, their wildlife
habitats and historical features; and to
improve opportunities for public access. It
operates outside ESAs. Farmers and land
managers enter ten-year agreements to
manage land in an environmentally beneficial
way in return for annual payments. Grants are
also available towards capital works, such as
hedge laying and planting, or repairing dry
stone walls. Some £34.7 million is forecast to
have been spent on the scheme in 2000-01. In
Scotland, the Rural Stewardship Scheme has
replaced both ESA and the Countryside
Premium scheme as the main scheme for
encouraging environmentally friendly farming
practice.
Organic Farming Schemes
Organic Farming Schemes offer payments to
farmers—in the form of financial help during
the conversion process—to aid them in
converting to organic farming and to manage
their land in some additional environmentally
beneficial ways. Total expenditure on these
schemes is budgeted at £18 million in the UK
in 2001-02.
There are over 425,000 hectares (about
1 million acres) of land converted or in the
process of conversion to organic farming,
representing 2.5% of the agricultural area of
the UK. It is estimated that the UK market
for organic food is currently worth around
£500 million a year.
The Organic Conversion Information
Service, funded by DEFRA in England,
provides free advice to farmers considering
conversion to organic farming. In Scotland
SEERAD funds the Scottish Agricultural
College to operate a telephone helpline for
farmers considering conversion. Standards of
organic food production in the UK are set by
the UK Register of Organic Food Standards.
Farm Woodland Premium Scheme
The Farm Woodland Premium Scheme
(partly funded by the EU) aims to encourage
farmers to convert productive agricultural
land to woodlands by providing annual
payments for ten years (for predominantly
conifer woodland) or 15 years (for
predominantly broadleaved woodland) to help
456
26: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
offset agricultural income foregone. It is
intended to enhance the environment through
the planting of trees, improve the landscape,
provide new habitats and increase
biodiversity. In the eight years to 1999-2000,
in England, 5,829 applications covering 23,277
hectares had been approved for planting (of
which 662 applications covering 3,412
hectares were for 1999-2000). A total of £11
million over seven years has been provided for
under the ERDP. In Wales, from 1992-93 to
1999-2000, 580 applications were approved
covering 2,769 hectares and in Scotland some
2,707 applications covering 43,933 hectares
had been approved for planting to the end of
2000.
Structural Funds Programmes in Northern
Ireland
In parallel w ith the Rural Development
Regulation Plan, Northern Ireland will benefit
from two further EU-funded programmes.
The Northern Ireland Programme for
Building Sustainable Prosperity is worth some
£80 million between 2000 and 2006 and
comprises training and development,
processing and marketing of agricultural
products, afforestation of non-agricultural
land and investment in forests and rural
development. The programme provides an
additional £23 million towards assisting the
fishing sector. The Programme for Peace and
Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the
Border Counties of Ireland provides some
£38 million between 2000 and 2004 towards
assisting the agri-food and wider rural
economy to address the legacy of the conflict
and take opportunities arising from peace.
Assistance is available for training, investment
in agricultural holdings, diversification, rural
tourism and rural development.
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
In 2000—01 total UK public expenditure on
agriculture—under the CAP and on national
grants and subsidies—is forecast to have
increased to £3,182 million. Spending in the
UK under the CAP is forecast to have
increased from £2,816 million in 1999-2000 to
£2,869 million in 2000—01. The increase is

mainly attributable to additional BSE
compensation and disposal costs. There was a
sharp increase in beef intervention sales
activity during the last quarter of 1998-99,
which was sustained throughout 1999-2000
resulting in significantly higher receipts. For
2000-01 beef intervention sales are forecast to
be significantly reduced. The increased
forecast for expenditure on pigs arose from the
outbreak of Classical Swine Fever, which
resulted in the creation of the Pig Welfare
(Disposal) Scheme (see p. 461). Decreases in
non-BSE-related expenditure are mainly
attributable to higher receipts following the
sale of intervention cereals and skimmed milk
powder, a reduction in animal numbers and
rates on the sheep annual premium, and a
reduction in the level of sugar export refund
rates. The continuing depreciation of the euro
on the foreign exchanges was also a
contributory factor to the reduction in support
prices in sterling terms.
457
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Agrimoney Compensation
In 2000 the Government announced a series of
packages of agrimonetary compensation to
offset falls in CAP direct payments to the UK
resulting from the euro/sterling exchange
rate. In March, it was announced that £66
million would be paid: £22 million each to the
beef, dairy and sheepmeat sectors. In
November, £34 million was announced in
compensation to the arable sector. This is all
optional funding, and comes in addition to the
nearly £400 million to be paid in compulsory
compensation from 1999 to 2001. Member
States not participating in the European single
currency have the opportunity to offer
producers, processors and traders the option
of CAP payments in euros. Following
European Commission approval of its scheme,
the Government offered CAP market support
measures, such as export refunds, to traders
and processors from the autumn. By the end
of the year 14 businesses had taken up the
offer, receiving £100 million in euro payments
in a full year (around 3.5% of total CAP
market support payments in the UK). Further
consideration is being given to extending this
option to direct aid recipients.
Other EU Developments
Developments in the past year have included:
> Agreement in December 2000 on a
comprehensive EU proposal for
submission to the World Trade
Organisation agriculture negotiations (see
p. 418). The proposal meets a key UK
objective in committing the EU to
constructive negotiations on continuing
trade liberalisation and reform of
agricultural policy.
> Agreement of EU-wide rules on
compulsory beef labelling', these require
fresh, chilled and frozen beef, offered for
sale throughout the supply chain, to be
labelled from 1 September 2000 with
information on place of slaughter and
cutting/mincing, and from 1 January 2002
with full country of origin information
(place of birth, raising and slaughter).
> New EU-wide feed controls: against a
background of rising incidence of BSE
(see p. 460) in other EU Member States
(notably France) and of the first reports
of BSE in homebred animals in Spain
and Germany, new controls were agreed
requiring Member States to prohibit,
until the end of 2001, the feeding of
processed animal protein to any animals
kept, fattened or bred for the production
of food. This decision was made to avoid
the risk of cross-contamination of cattle
feed with feed intended for other animals
containing animal proteins possibly
contaminated by the BSE agent.
> Beef Market Support Measures: among
other proposals it was agreed that meat
and other materials derived from cattle
over 30 months of age not tested for BSE
should be removed from the food chain.
A purchase and destruction scheme for
such animals was introduced; and
> Specified Risk Materials: intestines of
bovine animals of all ages were added to
the list of materials which must be
removed and destroyed in all Member
States with effect from 1 January 2001.
Integrated Administration and Control System
(IACS)
The purpose of IACS is to protect
expenditure under the CAP arable and
livestock schemes. Controls to prevent and
detect fraud and irregularity are major
features of the System. These include
verification checks of claimed land and
animals, including on-the-spot inspections
and remote sensing by observation satellites.
Professional, Scientific and Technical
Services
In the UK, professional, scientific and
technical services are provided by a number of
organisations:
> in England the Rural Development
Service of DEFRA provides scheme
implementation services for the ERDP,
involving professional and technical work
458
26. AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
in relation to the enhancement and
protection of the environment, including
biodiversity and rural development;
> in Scotland the Scottish Agricultural
College (SAC) provides professional,
business, scientific and technical services
in the agriculture, rural business, food
and drink, and environmental markets;
> the Department of Agriculture and Rural
Development (DARD) has a similar
remit in Northern Ireland; and
^ Lantra, the UK National Training
Organisation for the sector, which
receives government support under
contracts from DEFRA and the Scottish
Executive.
ANIMAL HEALTH AND WELFARE
Professional advice and action on the statutory
control of animal health and the welfare of
farm livestock are the responsibility of the
State Veterinary Service. It is supported by
the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA),
which also offers its services to the private
sector on a commercial basis. Similar support
is provided in Scotland by the SAC. In
Northern Ireland, DARD’s Veterinary
Service carries out a similar role to the State
Veterinary Service in Great Britain, supported
by its Veterinary Sciences Division.
Farm Animal Welfare
DEFRA works to ensure priority is given to
maintaining the standards for welfare of animals
on the farm, during transport, at markets and at
slaughter. Work currently being undertaken on
the farm includes improved welfare conditions
for laying hens; broiler chicken welfare
standards; a newr sheep code and negotiations on
pig welfare. Since June 2001 DEFRA has also
been responsible for welfare work concerning
farm animals, previously the responsibility of
the Home Office.
Farm Animals
Britain enforces controls on imports of live
animals and genetic material, including checks
on all individual consignments originating from
outside the EU and frequent checks on those
from other EU Member States at destination
points. Measures can be taken to prevent the
import of diseased animals and genetic material
from regions or countries affected by disease.
Veterinary checks also include unannounced
periods of surveillance at ports.
Cattle Tracing System (CTS)
The British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS)
for Great Britain, at Workington, Cumbria,
was launched in 1998 to record all cattle in
the national herd on a CTS database. A
recommendation that herd cover should be
extended to all cattle has nowr been
implemented. Cover has been extended to over
98% of the 10 million cattle in the herd. Work
is in hand to collect the remaining data and
apply checks to help ensure that information
held on the database is accurate and complete.
Since the end of January 2001 it has been a
legal requirement to notify the BCMS of all
movements. In Northern Ireland, all cattle and
cattle movements are recorded on the Animal
and Public Health Information System
(APHIS), which has been approved by the EU
since 1999 as a fully operational database for
cattle traceability.
Tuberculosis (TB) in Cattle
The Government’s strategy is to find a
science-based policy to control TB in cattle.
An annual £5 million research programme has
been put in place to find out howr the disease is
spread among cattle and w ildlife, including
research into improved diagnostic tests and the
development of a TB vaccine. An on-farm
epidemiological survey, known as TB99, to
identify the factors causing TB in cattle herds,
is starting to provide data to help understand
the disease and focus future research. A sample
survey of badger carcases found dead on the
roads started in November 2000 to collect data
on the prevalence of TB in badgers, but w as
suspended in February 2001 due to foot-and-
mouth disease. The former Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food also
commissioned and published an independent
report on the role husbandry might play in
reducing TB risk and this w ork is being taken
forward in 2001 by DEFRA.
459
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
F oot-and-mouth
A significant outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease occurred in the UK during 2001.
By the time that foot-and-mouth disease
was confirmed in pigs at an abattoir, and in
cattle on a neighbouring farm in
Brentwood (Essex) on 20 February 2001,
the disease had already been present in the
country, undetected, for two to three
weeks—the original outbreak was
subsequently found to have been a farm at
Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.
During this time it had already been
spread widely throughout the country by
large-scale commercial movements of
sheep. As a result, cases occurred in many
areas of the country, with particular
clusters in Cumbria, Dumfries and
Galloway, Devon and North Yorkshire,
together accounting for over two-thirds of
all confirmed cases. Up to 16 September a
total of 2,020 cases had been confirmed
and 3,117,000 sheep, 597,000 cattle,
139,000 pigs, 2,000 goats and 500 deer
slaughtered. There were 9,395 premises on
which animals had been or were due to be
slaughtered. The number of cases peaked
at between 40 and 50 a day at the end of
March 2001, but subsequently declined
and by early September averaged between
one and two a day.
Foot-and-mouth disease is highly
virulent in pigs, cattle, sheep and other
ungulates, spreading rapidly by contact
between animals, transmission via people
or transport, or through the air. Strict
controls on the movement of animals in
affected areas were introduced as was an
export ban. Estimated compensation costs
are £1,142 million, of which £986 million
had been paid to farmers up to 13
September. In addition, a Livestock
Welfare Disposal Scheme was opened as
an outlet of last resort for livestock farmers
whose animals face welfare difficulties as a
result of foot-and-mouth related
movement restrictions. The scheme
provides for the removal and disposal of
animals, for which the Government will
bear the costs. Up to 13 September, claims
totalling £174 million had been paid.
A major consequence of the outbreak
was the postponement of local council
elections in England and Wales, from
3 May to 7 June, the same date as the
General Election. Several prestigious
agricultural shows (see p. 453) and
sporting events were also cancelled.
An important element of the Government’s
strategy is the badger culling trial, designed to
establish the contribution that badgers, as
opposed to other factors, make in spreading
TB to cattle. By the end of 2000, ten areas had
been enrolled in the trial and initial culling
had been carried out in seven of these. The
trial is expected to produce conclusions by
2004 and possibly earlier.
BSE Inquiry
In October 2000 the Government published
the report of the public inquiry into the history
of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)
and variant CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease)
and how the diseases were handled by the
Government and others in the period up to 20
March 1996. The report found that most of
those responsible for responding to the
challenge posed by BSE emerged with credit.
However, it identified a number of aspects of
the response that were inadequate, and set out
some fundamental lessons for public policy
and administration in the future. An interim
government response to the report in February
2001 formed the basis of further consultations
and discussions, which enabled those
interested to contribute to the final response
the Government made to the report’s
recommendations in September 2001.
Classical Swine Fever
The first outbreak of Classical Swine Fever in
Great Britain since 1986 was confirmed in
August 2000. Disease was confirmed on 16
premises in East Anglia, the last being in
November. By the end of December, all area
movement restrictions around those premises
460
26: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
had been lifted. In order to deal with the
animal welfare problems resulting from
movement restrictions, the UK introduced a
Pig \\ elfare (Disposal) Scheme in August
2000. The scheme came to an end when all
movement controls were lifted. Payments to
producers under the scheme were linked
strictly to dealing with animal welfare
problems and were in addition to the free
transport, slaughter and disposal of pigs made
available by the scheme.
The Pet Travel Scheme
The Pet Travel Scheme, launched in Februarv
2000, allows pet cats and dogs from 24 Western
European countries and 26 ‘long-haul’
countries—including Australia, New Zealand,
Singapore and Japan—to enter or re-enter the
UK without quarantine, provided they meet
certain conditions, including vaccination
against rabies. The scheme operates on certain
approved sea, air and rail routes into the UK.
L K residents can, having taken their pets to
these countries, bring them back without the
need for quarantine, providing the scheme’s
requirements are met. By the end of July 2001,
26,271 pets had been brought into the UK
under the scheme.
Veterinary Medicinal Products
The Veterinary Medicines Directorate
(www.vmd.gov.uk), an executive agency of
DEFRA, aims to protect public health, animal
health and the environment and to promote
animal welfare, by ensuring the safety, quality
and efficacy of all aspects of veterinary
medicines in the UK. The Government is
advised by the independent scientific
Veterinary Products Committee on standards to
be adopted in the authorisation procedures for
veterinary medicines.
The Fishing Industry
Overview
The UK has a major interest in sea fisheries,
reflecting its geographical position in the
North East Atlantic, and is one of the EU’s
largest fishing countries, taking about a fifth of
the total catch in major species. It has an
interest in more than 100 ‘allowable catches’
set by the European Commission (see
p. 463). In 2000 the British fishing industry
provided around 50% by quantity of total UK
fish supplies, and household consumption of
fish in the UK was provisionally estimated at
442,000 tonnes.
Fisheries Departments, in partnership with
the European Commission, are responsible for
the administration of legislation concerning
the fishing industry, including fish and
shellfish farming. The Sea Fish Industry
Authority (www.seafish.co.uk), a largelv
industry-financed body, undertakes R&D,
provides training and promotes the marketing
and consumption of sea fish.
British vessels have exclusive rights to fish
within 6 miles of the British coast. Certain
other EU Member States have historic rights
in British waters between 6 and 12 miles.
British vessels have similar rights in other
Member States’ 6 to 12 mile belts. Between 12
and 200 miles, EU vessels may fish wherever
they have access rights. Non-EU countries’
vessels may fish in these waters if they
negotiate reciprocal fisheries agreements with
the EU. British fishery limits extend to 200
miles or the median line (broadly halfway
between the L K coast and the opposing
coastline of another coastal state), measured
from baselines on or near the coast of Britain.
Fish Caught and the Fishing Fleet
U K fishing industry statistics are shown in
Table 26.7. Altogether, some 526,000 tonnes
of sea fish, with a total value of ^483 million,
were landed into the UK by both the UK fleet
and foreign fishing vessels in 2000. Another
major source of supply is the import into the
L K in bulk of fish caught by other countries.
In 2000 demersal fish (caught on or near
the bottom of the sea) accounted for 34% by
weight of total landings by British fishing
vessels, pelagic fish (caught near the surface)
for 48% and shellfish for 18%. Landings of all
types of fish (excluding salmon and trout) by
British fishing vessels into the UK totalled
748,000 tonnes. Cod and haddock represented
15% and 14% of the total value of demersal
and pelagic fish landed respectively. The

quayside value of landings of all sea fish,
including shellfish, by British vessels in 2000
was £550 million.
Catches of crabs, lobsters, scampi and other
shellfish have increased to supply a rising
demand. In 1985 British fishermen landed
75,000 tonnes of shellfish worth about £65
million. By 2000, landings were 135,400
tonnes worth £170 million.
Britain aims to achieve the EU target for
reducing its fleet by both cutting its numbers
and limiting the time some vessels spend at
sea. At the end of 2000 the UK fleet consisted
of 7,818 registered vessels, including 115
vessels greater than 24.39 m (80 ft). There are
an estimated 15,121 professional fishermen in
Britain. A national licensing scheme now
limits the shellfish fleet to 3,000, mainly small
boats. New minimum landing sizes for
shellfish to be introduced across the EU in
2002, and which make it illegal to land a
lobster smaller than 87 mm (3.4 inches), now
apply in the UK.
There is a substantial fish processing
industry of around 700 businesses which
employ some 19,000 people. At the retail level,
there are approximately 3,000 fishmongers
employing 7,000 people. An increasing
proportion of all fish (67.7% by volume and
66.4% by value, excluding canned produce) is
sold through supermarkets. Fish is also
consumed in restaurants and in takeaway form
from fish and chip shops. A small proportion
of the catch is used to make fish oils and
animal feeds. Some of the species caught by
UK fishing vessels find a better market
overseas and these species are usually exported
or landed directly abroad. In 2000 UK vessels
landed directly into non-UK ports 283,500
tonnes of sea fish with a value of £128 million.
Aquaculture
Fish farming is a significant industry in
remote rural areas on the west coast of
Scotland, as well as in Orkney, Shetland and
the Western Isles, producing primarily
salmon. In addition, species such as cod,
halibut and turbot are entering commercial
production. Trout is also farmed as a
freshwater species in Scotland, England and
Northern Ireland, and various shellfish species
are produced all round the coast of the United
Kingdom. Total value at first sale in 1999 is
estimated at over £300 million, and the
industry employs over 3,000 people.
Production in 1999 was 127,000 tonnes of
salmon, 16,000 tonnes of trout, 125 tonnes of
other fish, and some 10,500 tonnes of
shellfish.
Aquaculture is subject to a comprehensive
regulatory regime covering such issues as fish
health and disease control, control of
discharges into the marine environment, site
leasing and planning, and the use of medicines
and other chemicals.
Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)
The primary aim of the CFP is to ensure
rational and sustainable exploitation of fish
stocks through conservation and management
policies designed to protect resources and
reflect the needs of the fishing industry. The
462
26: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
CFP aims to improve the balance between
catching capacity and available resources by
regulating the amount of fishing and the
quantities of fish caught, through a system of
Total Allowable Catches (TACs) based on
scientific advice. These TACs are then
distributed to Member States according to the
system of relative stability. This means that
national quota allocations are based each year
on a fixed proportion reflecting, among other
things, historical fishing patterns. Catch limits
are complemented by a series of technical
conservation measures intended to achieve
more selective fishing, for example by setting
rules on minimum landing sizes, minimum
mesh sizes and gear design, as well as defining
areas of seasonal closures, methods of fishing
and target species. Opportunities to fish in
third country waters are also secured through
the CFP.
Fish Quotas
EU fisheries ministers set TACs for a wide
range of stocks each year in December. The
TACs are then divided into Member States’
quotas. The LK’s separate quotas are then
apportioned between various groups within
the LK fishing fleet. The size and structure of
the fishing fleet is governed by a licensing
system (see below), and vessels work to an
agreed quota of allowable catches, based on
scientific assessment of fish stocks. Some
allocations are managed by fishermen’s
organisations, known as Producer
Organisations. However, overall responsibility
for managing the UK’s quotas rests with
DEFRA and the other Fisheries Departments
in the LK administrations. Quotas, technical
conservation and other management measures
allow balanced fish populations to renew
themselves.
In December 2000 at the EU Fisheries
Council in Brussels, the UK secured a deal on
fishing quotas which sought to strike a balance
between the advice given by international
scientists on rescuing threatened fish stocks
and the needs of UK fishermen. The
European Commission had in some cases
suggested cuts in TACs for some species
which were even more severe than the serious
reductions suggested by scientists from the
International Council for the Exploration of
the Sea. However, the UK succeeded in
halving the TAC cuts initially put forward by
the Commission for some species, reflecting
the need to leave open fishing opportunities
where there are no risks to the state of the
stocks.
North Sea Cod Recovery Plan
Agreement in principle was reached with
Norway in January 2001 on emergency
closures of large areas of the North Sea to
protect cod at spawning time. Trawling for all
white fish species was prohibited, between
14 February and 30 April, in an area of more
than 40,000 square miles, with closures
concentrated in the north, east and south of
the North Sea. Local inshore fishermen were
allowed to continue fishing within 12-mile
limits. All EU Member States with North Sea
fishing interests will continue to share the
burden of reduced fishing effort and increased
protection for spawning cod in 2002 through a
series of additional technical conservation
measures.
Restrictive Licensing System for Fishing Vessels
This system, also operated by the
Government, controls the activities of the UK
fishing fleet in accordance with the EU and
L K aims on fleet and catch management. All
engine-powered UK-registered or British-
owned vessels which fish for profit for sea fish
(other than salmon, migratory trout and eels)
are required to hold a licence issued bv UK
Fisheries Departments. In order to keep the
fleet the same size, additional licences are not
granted. Licences must therefore be
transferred and aggregated according to
detailed rules.
Sea Fisheries Committees
There are 12 Sea Fisheries Committees
(SFCs) which regulate local sea fisheries
around virtually the entire coast of England
and W ales out to 6 miles. SFCs were
established in the 19th century and are
empowered to make bye-laws for the
management and conservation of their
463
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
districts’ fisheries. In Scotland, inshore
fisheries legislation has allowed the
establishment of local management bodies.
Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries
A Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Review
Group has reviewed all aspects of existing
policies and legislation on salmon and
freshwater fisheries in England and Wales.
The Group’s report was published in 2000
and the Government accepted most of its
proposals in February 2001. Its main
recommendations were:
> an increase of £3 million a year in
fisheries grant-in-aid to the Environment
Agency from April 2002. The Agency
will be able to increase its work on
conserving and restoring salmon stocks,
and improving controls over
unauthorised transfers of coarse and non¬
native fish;
> up to £750,000, subject to matching
funds from interested parties, to launch
compensation arrangements to accelerate
the phase-out of mixed stock fisheries on
a voluntary basis; and
> a commitment to introduce proposals for
new legislation when parliamentary time
permits.
Research
Departmental funding of R&D in agriculture,
fisheries and food in 2000-01 included about
£105 million commissioned by MAFF—now
DEFRA—which acts in this context on behalf
of the National Assembly for Wales, and
£6 million conducted by DARD in Northern
Ireland. In Scotland about £50 million is
invested annually in the agricultural and
biological sciences-related research programme
and £15.3 million in fishery research. Priority
areas in the DEFRA programme are public
health (covering food safety, transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies and zoonoses)
and protection of the environment (improved
sustainability in production methods, with
benefits for the environment and agricultural
efficiency). The total expenditure of DEFRA
on research and development in 2001-02 is
planned to be some £186 million.
Research Bodies
The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council (BBSRC, see p. 434)
supports research related to food and
agriculture. The Natural Environment
Research Council includes some agricultural
aspects in its remit. Research institutes
sponsored by these Councils receive income
from work commissioned by DEFRA,
industry and other bodies.
ADAS carries out R&D, at a network of
research centres across England and Wales
and on clients’ premises, for DEFRA and
other organisations and companies. DEFRA
receives scientific expertise and technical
support from two of its other agencies: the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency and the
Central Science Laboratory. Horticulture
Research International, a non-departmental
public body, receives funding for its research
from DEFRA, BBSRC and industry, transfers
the results of its R&D to the British
horticulture industry and the wider public.
SEERAD supports agricultural, biological
and related sciences primarily through
sponsorship of the five Scottish Agricultural
and Biological Research Institutes, the
Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) and the
Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh. It
contracts additional research through these
bodies and provides funding for Education
and Advisory Services at the SAC. In
Northern Ireland DARD maintains an
integrated Science and Technology
programme to improve the economic
performance of the agri-food, fishing and
forestry sectors, to conserve the rural
environment and to strengthen the economy
and social infrastructure of disadvantaged
rural areas. Fisheries research is undertaken
by the Fisheries Research Service (FRS) in
Scotland and by the Centre for Environment,
Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS)
in England and Wales.
Forestry
Land area under forestry in 2000 amounted to

a total of 11.6% for the UK, or 2.828 million
hectares (7 million acres), almost double the
cover in 1947. This compares with 36% for
the EU as a whole. The area of total
productive woodland in Great Britain at 31
March 2000 was nearly 2.5 million hectares
(6.1 million acres) (see Table 26.8), 31.2% of
which was managed by the Forestry
Commission.
The area of new planting (including natural
regeneration) in 1999-2000 was 300 hectares
(740 acres) by the Forestry Commission and
Northern Ireland Forest Service and 17,600
hectares (43,500 acres) by other woodland
owners. In 1999-2000, 14,600 hectares (36,000
acres) of broadleaved trees were planted, both
new planting and restocking. Table 26.9 gives
more details.
In 1999-2000, 306 hectares (756 acres) of
land were acquired by the Forestry
Commission/Forest Service, which disposed
of 5,305 hectares (13,109 acres).
Forestry and primary wood processing in
Great Britain employed around 30,000 people
in 1998-99, around 43% of whom were
engaged in forest activity. Its woodlands
produced 9.56 million cubic metres (338
million cubic feet) of timber in 1999, 92% of
which was softwood.
The UK uses a large amount of timber,
paper, board and other wood products each
year, equivalent to about 50 million cubic
metres (over 1,750 million cubic feet). Around
85% of this has to be imported at a cost of
about £8 billion—the fourth largest single
import commodity. The development of the
British timber industry, using wood from
Britain’s sustainable forests, has been a major
success story. Over £1.6 billion has been
invested in sawmills and paper and board mills
over the last 15 years, and a further £2 billion
is expected to be invested over the next 15
years, creating many new jobs. The volume of
wood supplied from Britain’s forests each vear
has more than doubled from 4 million cubic
metres in the 1970s to more than 9 million.
This is forecast to increase to over 15 million
cubic metres by 2020, offering scope for
further substantial investment in the
processing industry.

Very few, if any, woodlands in Britain are
planted w ithout some form of grant. The
Forestry Commission offers grants through
the Woodland Grant Scheme (WGS), and
operates the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme
(FWPS) on behalf of DEFRA and SEERAD.
In Wales, there is a joint application form for
farmers who enter land into the WGS and
FWPS, which is administered by the National
Assembly. The WGS aims to encourage
the creation of new woodlands and the
management of existing woodlands by
providing money towards the cost of the work
involved. The FWPS is designed to encourage
the creation of new woodlands on farms but
can only be given where the WGS is also
payable. Expenditure of £139 million over
seven years on the W GS is provided for under
the England Rural Development Programme.
The Forestry Commission and
Forestry Policy
The Forestry Commission {mvrv.forestry.gov.uk)
is the government department responsible for
forestry throughout Great Britain and is the
UK’s largest land manager and biggest single
provider of countryside recreation. It has a
Board of Commissioners with duties and
powers prescribed by statute which, following
devolution, they exercise separately in
England, Scotland and W ales. DEFRA directs
the Commissioners’ activities in England and,
after consultation with Scottish ministers, the
National Assembly for Wales and the
Northern Ireland Assembly, represents the
UK’s forestry interests within the EU and in
the wider world. Scottish ministers and the
National Assembly for Wales direct the
Commissioners’ activities in Scotland and
Wales respectively. The Commission is
responsible for advising ministers and for
implementing each country’s separate and
distinct forestry policy. It is funded separately
in each country.
Its objectives are to:
> protect Britain’s forests and woodlands;
> expand Britain’s forest area;
> enhance the economic value of forest
resources;
> conserve and improve the biodiversity,
landscape and cultural heritage of forests
and woodlands;
> develop opportunities for woodland
recreation; and
> increase public understanding and
community participation in forestry.
The Forestry Commission has two executive
agencies. Forest Enterprise is responsible for
managing the forests and woodlands owned by
the nation. It aims to maintain and increase
the productive potential of the forest estate
and to increase opportunities for public
recreation, the conservation value of its forests
and the net value of commercial activities.
Forest Enterprise has a total forest estate of
466
26: AGRICULTURE, FISHING & FORESTRY
826,000 hectares of mainly productive forest
with complementary land for grazing,
conservation and recreation, and employs
around 2,300 staff. A further 3,000 people
work in the forests as contractors or are
employed by the timber purchasers.
Fores/ Research aims to deliver high-quality-
scientific research and surveys, to inform the
development of forestry policies and practices,
and to promote high standards of sustainable
forest management. It is the principal
organisation in the L K engaged in forestry
and tree-related research.
Forestry Initiatives
The new National Forest covers 520 sq km
(200 sq miles) of the English Midlands
spanning parts of Derbyshire, Leicestershire
and Staffordshire and incorporates the towns
of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Burton upon Trent,
Coalville, and Swadlincote. The aim is for
woodland to increase from 6% to about one-
third of the area, a third to remain in
agriculture with the remainder comprising the
towns and villages. Thirty million trees (60%
broadleaf and 40% conifer) will eventually be
planted. For Community Forests, see p. 316.
Forestry in Northern Ireland
Woodland and forest cover about 83,000
hectares (201,000 acres) of Northern Ireland.
State-owned forest constitutes 61,000 hectares
(151,000 acres).
The Forest Service (www.dardni.gov.uk/
forestry) is an executive agency within DARD
and promotes the interests of forestry through
sustainable management and expansion of
state-owned forests. It encourages private
forestry through grant aid for planting. The
Forest Service offered 350,981 cubic metres
(12.4 million cubic feet) of timber for sale
during 2000-01, with receipts of £4.4 million.
Forestry and timber processing employ about
1,050 people. It is estimated that some 2.0
million people visited forests during the year.

27 Manufacturing and
Construction
Introduction 468 Construction 488
Sectors of Manufacturing 468
Manufacturing continues to play an important role in the UK economy, even
though service industries generated 3.8 times as much Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) and over five times as much employment in 2000. Important industries
include chemicals, plastics, pharmaceuticals, electronics, motor vehicles and
components, aerospace, offshore equipment, and paper and printing, where
British companies are among the world’s largest.
Introduction
Manufacturing accounted for 18.7% of gross
value added (at current basic prices) in 2000
and for 15.2% of employment (3.9 million
people) in the UK at the end of December
2000. The highest proportions of employees in
manufacturing are to be found in the East
Midlands (23%) and West Midlands (22%),
with London the lowest (7%). Overseas
companies have a strong presence.
The recession in the early 1990s led to a
decline in manufacturing output, but it began
to rise again in 1993. By 1999, the volume of
output was 10% above the level in 1992, rising
by a further 1.6% in 2000. Some industries,
notably electrical and optical equipment—
where output was up by 76% between 1992
and 2000—but also chemicals and rubber and
plastic products, have achieved substantial
growth following the recession. However,
output of other sectors, such as textiles and
leather, remains well below their 1990 levels.
The construction industry contributed
5.2% of gross value added in 2000. Following
a period of marked decline as recession
affected the industry in the early 1990s,
output picked up and was 11.8% higher in
2000 than in 1993, although still a little below
pre-recession levels.
Sectors of Manufacturing
Relative sizes of enterprises are shown in
Tables 27.1 and 27.2, with output and
investment, industrial production and
employment by sector in Tables 27.3 to 27.5.
An outline of the main manufacturing sectors
follows. In some cases statistics in the text and
in tables have come from alternative sources to
National Statistics, such as trade associations.
Any variations usually reflect differences in
coverage of the industry concerned.
Food, Drink and Tobacco
In December 2000 the food, drink and tobacco
industry employed over 466,000 people.
Food and Drink
The UK’s food and drink manufacturing and
processing industry has accounted for a

concentration of enterprises is in the
production of bread, cakes and fresh pastry
goods, followed by those engaged in
processing and preserving meat and meat
products. The greatest number of food and
drink manufacturing jobs are in the South
East and London (15.8% of the total for Great
Britain), Yorkshire (13.8%) and the North
West (12.5%). Spirits production gives
Scotland the highest concentration of
employment in the alcoholic and soft drinks
manufacturing industry, with a significant
proportion of jobs in its economically deprived
rural areas. The biggest food and drinks
export category in 2000 was alcoholic drinks,
accounting for 35% of the total (£8.8 billion)
value of food and drink sales overseas. The
largest food-exporting sector was biscuits and
confectionery, worth £395 million.
Among the best-known companies involved
in food and drink manufacturing and
processing are Unilever, Cadbury Schweppes,
Nestle, Associated British Foods, Tate and
Lyle, Ranks Hovis McDougall and Allied
Domecq. Specialist small and medium-sized
firms in the food and drink manufacturing
industry thrive alongside these large concerns,
supplying high-quality ‘niche’ products, often
to small retail outlets, such as delicatessens.
Frozen foods and chilled convenience
foods, such as frozen potato products and
ready-prepared meals, fish and shellfish
dishes, salads and pasta, together with
yogurts, desserts and instant snacks, have
formed some of the fastest-growing sectors of
the food market in recent years. The trend
towards snacking—eating less, more often—
and higher consumption outside the home
means that snacks are filling the gap left bv the
decline of the traditional family meal. Many
new low-fat and fat-free items are being
introduced, ranging from dairy products to
complete prepared meals. Organic foods are
also becoming more widely available. There
has been a substantial rise in sales of
vegetarian foods (both natural vegetable dishes
and vegetable-based substitutes of meat
products, where soya plays a big role). For
genetically modified foods, see chapter 26.
The L K bread and morning goods market is
worth over £3 billion each year and is one of
the largest sectors in the food industry—total
volume is about 2.9 million tonnes. Large
plant bakers accounted for 81% of bread
production by volume in 2000, with 13% by
in-store bakeries (ISBs) and 6% bv high street
retail bakers. Some ISBs use the bake-off
method, where dough is part-baked and
frozen and then baked off later at the retail
outlet—this is particularly popular at smaller
supermarkets. The two largest bread
producers are Allied Bakeries and British
Bakeries, with 33 manufacturing sites between

them. In terms of volume, 66% of bread sold
in the UK in 2000 was white, and 23%
brown/wholemeal. Morning goods, or bakery
snacks (including rolls and baps, scones,
teacakes and croissants), account for 11% by
volume of the bread market. Sandwiches are
the UK’s most frequently consumed snack
food and have a wider range of distribution
outlets than other bread sales. Some 2.6 billion
sandwiches are consumed each year in a
market valued at £3.0 billion in 2000 which is
growing at around 7% to 8% a year.
Around 30% of household liquid milk
supplies in Great Britain are distributed
through a doorstep delivery system employing
about 15,000 people. However, the proportion
is declining (employees have declined by 58%
since 1991) as supermarkets have increased
their share of the market. Household
consumption of liquid milk per head—2.2
litres (3.9 pints) a week—is among the highest
in the world. Consumption of skimmed and
semi-skimmed milk accounted for 65% of
total milk sales in 2000. The British dairy
industry accounts for 67% of butter and 62%
of cheese supplies to the domestic market, and
achieves significant sales in overseas markets.
Over 400 different types of cheese are
produced in the UK.
Beer (including lager) production in 2000,
at 55.3 million hectolitres, was 4.5% lower
than in 1999; beer released for home
consumption amounted to 57.0 million
hectolitres. Exports were valued at £244
million in 2000, amounting to some 2.5
million barrels. The brewing industry
currently has three major national brewery
groups—Scottish & Newcastle (incorporating
Scottish Courage, Britain’s leading beer
company), Bass (whose brewery operations
were acquired by Interbrew of Belgium in
2000, although in September 2001 the DTI
ordered Interbrew to dispose of three Bass
brands) and Carlsberg-Tetley—and over 470
regional and local breweries. Brewers
throughout the world use British malt, which
is made almost entirely from home-grown
barley. Beer consumption per head in the UK
in 2000 was 168 pints, equivalent to 27.4
million pints sold every day or 34.8 million
barrels a year. Lager accounted for 63.7% of
all sales, up from 62.2% in 1999, but there is
still a strong demand for the vast range of
traditional cask-conditioned and brewery-
conditioned ales and stouts. Recently there has
been a shift towards stronger bottled beers,
many of which are imported. Another recent
trend has been a sizeable import of beer
bought on the continent, mainly in Calais, by
British travellers. The main brewers are
modernising their brewing and distribution
facilities to meet the changing pattern of
demand.
Home-produced whisky production in 2000
was 3.62 million hectolitres, 13% down on
1999. The Scotch whisky industry is one of
the UK’s top export earners, with overseas
sales worth £2.2 billion in 2000, 3% higher

than in 1999. By volume, about 90% of
production was exported to over 200 markets
worldwide, the European Union (EU) taking
40%, the United States 14% and Japan 6%.
Some 11,000 people work in the Scotch
whisky industry and a further 30,000 are
employed in associated sectors, for instance
supplying ingredients and materials. There
were 97 malt whisky distilleries and eight
grain distilleries in Scotland in 2000, the
majority in the Highlands and in Speyside,
producing either malt whisky or grain
whisky—most Scotch consumed is a blend of
the two. Well-known blended brands include
Ballantine’s, Bell’s, Famous Grouse, J & B,
Johnnie Walker and Teacher’s. Glenfiddich,
Glen Grant, Glenmorangie and Macallan are
some of the best-known single malt Scotch
whiskies. Gin and vodka production is another
important part of the spirits industry, with over
70% of UK-produced gin and 32% of vodka
exported, worth nearly £192 million in 2000.
In a highly competitive market, English and
Welsh wines have a distinctive local identity.
There are nearly 400 vineyards, covering
approximately 800 hectares (2,000 acres) of
land, nearly all in the southern half of the two
countries. Over 90% of wine produced each
year is white, mainly from Germanic vines.
Quality continues to improve with a
combination of more experienced winemakers,
modern technologies and better winemaking
equipment. Cider and perry are made
predominantly in the west and south-west of
England.
The soft drinks industry produces still and
carbonated drinks, dilutable drinks, fruit
juices and juice drinks, and bottled waters.
The UK market was worth £8.0 billion by
retail value in 2000, with Coca-Cola
Enterprises (formerly Coca-Cola and
Schweppes Beverages) the largest supplier.
Soft drinks are one of the fastest-growing
sectors of the grocery trade, responsible for
introducing many innovative products each
year. Bottled waters—natural mineral waters,
spring and table waters—have experienced the
fastest growth within the sector during the
period 1994-2000, averaging increases in
volume of 12% a year, and with sales of
£600 million in the UK in 2000. In 2000 UK
consumption of soft drinks was 11.96 billion
litres, compared with 8.33 billion litres in
1989—an increase of 44%. There was a 5%
decline in 2000 in the volume of the still fruit
drinks market. Sales of energy and sports
drinks have risen by 366% since 1996, with
sales of £700 million in the UK in 2000.
Tobacco
Around 7,500 people in the UK are directly
employed in tobacco manufacturing with a
further 53,000 jobs indirectly supported in
supplier industries, and through forward
linkages into distribution and retailing. Three
major manufacturers—Imperial Tobacco Ltd,
Gallaher Ltd and Rothmans (UK) Ltd (now
part of British American Tobacco)—supply
the market. British American Tobacco, which
mainly manufactures cigarettes in the UK for
export only, is the second largest tobacco
company in the world. UK consumers spent
almost £12.5 billion on tobacco products in
2000, of which £9.6 billion was accounted for
by taxes. Although the figures in Table 27.7
show a substantial decline in sales, in recent
years there has been a rapid growth in
‘bootlegging’ and smuggling. The official

estimate of revenue lost through tobacco
smuggling in 2000 was £3.8 billion, making a
total of almost £9 billion since 1996. The
industry achieves significant export sales—in
excess of £1 billion in 2000—with Europe, the
Middle East and Africa important overseas
markets. The UK tobacco industry remains
one of the top ten balance-of-payments
earners in the UK economy.
Textiles, Clothing and Footwear
Around 276,000 people were employed in the
UK textiles, clothing and footwear industry in
December 2000. Annual turnover in 1999 was
£18.0 billion. The sector has been adversely
affected by imports from low labour-cost
suppliers, changing sourcing patterns in the
UK high street and the weakness of the euro
and related European currencies—in 2000
output was over 21% below the level in 1995.
UK manufacturers have modernised their
domestic operations to meet these challenges,
in some cases investing in production facilities
abroad. In addition, to compete in areas other
than price, firms have shifted into higher-value
products to benefit from the UK’s strengths in
fashion, design, product and process
innovation, and information technology. New
technologies, largely designed to improve
response times and give greater flexibility in
production, are used throughout the industry.
Textiles and Clothing
The textiles industry has a high degree of
regional concentration, reflecting the
traditional centres for this sector: cotton
textiles in the North West, fine knitwear in
Scotland, linen in Northern Ireland, woollens
and worsteds in Yorkshire and Scotland, and
knitted fabrics in the East Midlands. The
clothing industry is more dispersed
throughout the UK, but also has significant
concentrations in the Midlands, north and east
London and the North East.
The UK textile and clothing industry
comprises a few multi-process companies, but
in the main companies operate vertically.
However, small and medium-sized firms
dominate, some of which subcontract work to
other companies or to homeworkers. Two of
the mainstays of the industry, Coats Viyella
and Courtaulds Textiles, have undergone
radical changes over the past year or so.
Courtaulds has been taken over by the US
conglomerate Sara Lee, and Coats Viyella has
withdrawn from a number of markets,
including home furnishing and contract
clothing.
The principal textile and clothing products
are yarns, woven and knitted fabrics, interior
(including printed) textiles, technical textiles,
carpets and a full range of clothing (including
knitwear). Tables 27.8 and 27.9 show
manufacturers’ sales for a range of products.
Worsted yarns are finely spun for use mainly
in suit fabric and fine knitwear. As well as
spinners, weavers and knitters, the sector
supports a number of other processes, such as
scouring of raw w ool and dyeing and finishing
of wool, yarn or fabric. British mills also
process rare fibres such as cashmere and
angora. In addition, the UK produces
synthetic fibres, cotton/synthetic mixed yarns
and fabrics, and has a large dyeing and
finishing sector (which includes fabric
printing).
Axminster and Wilton are the main types of
woven carpets in the UK, which is recognised
for its high-quality products, variety of design
and use of new technology. UK companies are
also continually improving their capability in
the manufacture of higher-volume, lower-
value tufted carpets.
Technical textiles are usually defined as
such for their performance characteristics.
They include non-wovens for filtration and
absorbency, textiles used in construction,

automotive textiles, sewing thread, rope and
medical/healthcare textiles and a very wide
range of fabrics used in the automotive,
aviation, aerospace and defence sectors.
The clothing industry is more labour-
intensive than textiles. Although a broad range
of clothing is imported, British industry still
supplies about two-fifths of domestic demand.
As a result of the rising prominence of the
British fashion designer industry in the 1980s,
and continued strength of traditional branded
clothing companies such as Burberry and
Jaeger, exports rose consistently until 1996.
UK firms have also had success in the growing
market for branded street and club-wear.
However, exports fell by 20% between 1996
and 2000 to £2.7 billion.
Footwear
Britain is home to some of the world’s leading
footwear brands. UK shoemakers are
renowned for high-quality formal footwear,
youth street fashion footwear, safety and
protective footwear, high-quality children’s
shoes and ‘made to order’ shoes. With around

12,000 employees, manufacturers are
predominantly found in Northamptonshire,
Leicestershire, Somerset and Lancashire.
Manufacturers’ sales were over 35 million
pairs in 2000, worth around £920 million (see
also Table 27.10). The domestic market is,
however, dominated by increasinglv
competitive imports and has been particularly
affected by the strength of sterling.
Paper, Printing and Publishing
In total, the UK paper, printing and
publishing industry employed some 466,000
people in December 2000. Output has been
fairly constant in recent years and was only
6% higher in 2000 than in 1992.
Paper
The paper and board sector is dominated by a
small number of medium and large firms—97
pulp, paper and board mills, employing 18,800
people in 2000, concentrated in the north of
Kent, Lancashire, the West Country and
central Scotland. UK production in 2000 was
6.6 million tonnes, over 40% higher than in
1989, with 1.4 million tonnes exported, 73% to
the EU. Imports amounted to 7.7 million
tonnes, 85% of which came from the EU and
Norway. Hundreds of different grades of paper
and board are converted into a wide range of
products for use in industry, commerce,
education, communications and distribution,
and in the home—such as tissues for household
and personal use—together with a host of
speciality papers for industrial use, for example
filters and papers which are subsequently
coated, sensitised or laminated. There has been
a significant trend towards waste-based
packaging grades. Recycled paper made up
60.4% of the raw material for UK newspapers
in the first half of 2000 (including imports).
Printing and Publishing
Unlike the paper and board sector, the
printing industry in particular has many small
businesses—only about 500 firms emplov
more than 50 people and approximately 90%
of firms employ fewer than 20 employees.
Much publishing and printing employment
and output is carried out in firms based in
south-east England. Mergers have led to the
formation of large groups in newspaper,
magazine and book publishing. The British
book-publishing industry is a major exporter,
with exports of £1.17 billion in 2000, 4.5%
higher than in 1999 (see also Table 27.11).
Over 116,000 new titles (including new
editions) were issued in 2000, a 6.8% increase
on 1999.
The UK printing industry has an annual
turnover of around £12 billion and employed

Chemicals and Chemical Products
The chemicals industry is one of the primary
manufacturing sectors in the UK. It employed
almost 238,000 people directly in December
2000 in over 3,400 companies, and had total
product sales of £32 billion in 2000, of which
77% was exported (see also Table 27.13). The
sector underpins much of the rest of UK
manufacturing industry, with chemicals being
essential feedstocks for most other industrial
processes. Growth in output was strong in
2000—up 4.6%—and was over 27% higher
than in 1992.
It is a diverse industry, with important
representation in all principal chemical
sectors—ranging from bulk petrochemicals to
low-volume, high-value specialised organics.
It includes key industrial materials such as
plastics and synthetic rubber, and other
products such as man-made fibres, soap and
detergents, cosmetics, adhesives, dyes and
inks, and intermediates for the pharmaceutical
industry.
Bulk Chemicals
The UK’s North Sea oil and gas provide
accessible feedstocks for its large organics
sector, including such products as ethylene,
propylene, benzene and paraxylene. These
provide the basic building blocks for the
manufacture of many chemical products,
including plastics whose strength, durability
and light weight have led to their increasing
use in transport and packaging applications;
and synthetic fibres such as nylon, and
polyester used in textiles, clothing and home
furnishings.
There is substantial inorganics
production, including sulphuric acid
(1 million tonnes in 2000), chlorine and
caustic soda, based on minerals such as salt,
sulphur, and phosphate ores, or reaction
between gases. These also serve many other
chemical processes.
Formulated Products
The UK is strong in the ‘formulation’ of
chemical products, in areas such as coatings,
inks, soaps and detergents, and cosmetics and
toiletries. This group includes familiar
household items such as decorative paint,
home laundry and cleaning products and
personal care items like toothpaste, shampoos
and skincare products.
Speciality Chemicals
Speciality chemicals meet specific needs
through the development and application of
sophisticated ‘chemistry’. The pharmaceutical
and agrochemical sectors are at the forefront
of this kind of innovation. In recent years, the
application of chirality1 in synthesis has
allowed firms to make drugs more closely
tailored to specific targets. Leading-edge
research by international pharmaceutical
companies in the UK is supported both by a
strong academic research capability and a
network of specialist manufacturers of‘fine’

Pharmaceuticals
The UK pharmaceuticals industry, largely
based in the South East, North West and
North East of England, is the world’s third
largest exporter of medicines, accounting for
12°o of the developed world’s export market.
It researches and manufactures the complete
range of medicinal products—human and
veterinary medicines, medical dressings and
dental materials. Latterly, the largest growth
has been in medicines that act on the
respiratory system, followed by
cardiovascular, muscular and skeletal,
anti-infective and alimentary tract remedies.
Exports in 2000 were worth £7.1 billion. The
main overseas markets are Western Europe,
North America and Japan.
Over 300 pharmaceutical companies
operate in the UK, with indigenous and US
parent multinationals dominating production.
GlaxoSmithKline (employing 21,000 people
in the UK) and AstraZeneca (UK-Swedish:
10,000) are the two largest UK-based
companies (see p. 384).
Some 62,000 people are directly employed
in the UK pharmaceutical industry, with
another 250,000 in related sectors. About a
third are engaged in R&D, expenditure on
which grew7 by 162% between 1990 and 2000;
the industry invested £2.9 billion in UK-
based R&D in 2000, around 23% of all UK
manufacturing industry R&D. AstraZeneca
and GlaxoSmithKline are the UK’s top two
477
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
companies in terms of R&D expenditure, with
Pfizer (US), Merck (US) and Novartis (Swiss)
also significant investors.
Major developments pioneered in the UK
are semi-synthetic penicillins and
cephalosporins, both powerful antibiotics, and
new treatments for ulcers, asthma, arthritis,
Meningitis C, cancer, migraine, HIV/AIDS,
coronary heart disease, hypertension, fungal
infections, erectile dysfunction and
schizophrenia. The UK pharmaceuticals
industry is second only to the United States in
the discovery and development of leading
medicines, including five of the world’s
current top 25 best-selling drugs. UK
laboratories place about 20 new
pharmaceutical products on the market each
year. Among the best-selling drugs produced
by the two largest UK-owned companies are:
> GlaxoSmithKline—Seroxat/Paxil
(central nervous system), Augmentin
(infections), Avandia (diabetes),
Flixotide/Flovent (asthma) and Imigran
(migraine); and
> AstraZeneca—Losec (anti-ulcer),
Nexium (successor to Losec), Zestril
(heart disease), Seroquel (schizophrenia/
Parkinson’s disease/Alzheimer’s disease)
and Zoladex (cancer).
Biotechnology
The UK has the leading biotechnology sector
in Europe, with 281 biotechnology companies,
employing an estimated 18,400 people. As well
as AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Celltech,
Cambridge Antibody Technology Group and
Oxford Glycoscience, there are numerous
smaller specialist biotechnology firms—about
18% of the number in Europe—with
particular strengths in biopharmaceuticals. Of
the potential new drugs under development in
Europe, 46% are from publicly quoted UK
companies. Companies are clustered
particularly around Cambridge, Oxford and
southern Scotland. The industry benefits
strongly from the UK’s science base.
Bioscience research in UK universities is of
world renown, and the major research
laboratories of leading pharmaceutical
multinationals are based here. The UK has a
number of world-class research institutes,
such as the Sanger Centre in Cambridge,
which played an important part in the Human
Genome project (see p. 424).
Rubber and Plastics Products
In December 2000 around 229,000 people
were employed by 6,565 enterprises in the
rubber and plastics industries. Output fell
slightly by 0.8% in 2000 although it was 18%
higher than in 1992.
Rubber products include tyres and tubes,
pipes, hoses, belting and floor coverings, many
of which have applications in the automotive
industry. The industry employs around
40,000 people in 1,000 enterprises. The largest
firms in this sector are major tyre
manufacturers such as Goodyear, making
tyres in the UK since 1927, and Michelin.
Cellulose nitrate, or celluloid, was the first
plastic to achieve real success, and was
displayed at the Great International
Exhibition in London in 1862. Since then
plastics have made great advances and have a
multitude of applications today. The
packaging industry is the largest user,
accounting for 36% of the market, followed by
the construction (23%), electrical and
electronic goods (11%) and transport
industries (8%). The highest concentrations
of plastics employment are in the Midlands
(25% of the total), the South East, North
West and the South West of England. The
UK’s plastics industry continues to be a world
leader in material specification and design,
with new processes allowing stronger plastics
to replace traditional materials and develop
new applications. Among the larger firms in a
sector characterised by many small and
medium-sized businesses is British Polythene
Industries, manufacturing products such as
carrier bags, sacks and shrink film. In the
moulded plastics sector, Linpac’s output
includes trays, fast food packaging, egg
cartons and disposable tableware.
Glass, Ceramics and Building Materials
Around 142,000 people were employed in this
sector in December 2000; output was little
478
27: MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
changed from 1999 and just 1% higher than in
1992.
Glass
The LK is a world leader in the manufacture
of glass. Flat glass is made through the float
process, invented by Pilkington in 1952, which
manufactures clear, tinted and coated glass for
buildings, and clear and tinted glass for
vehicles. It is licensed to more than 40 glass
manufacturers in 30 countries. About 48% of
Pilkington’s total sales are in building
products and another 47% in automotive
products—the company is one of the world’s
largest suppliers of glass for cars, trucks and
buses—with around one in four of the world’s
cars containing its glass. The company
employs 5,500 people in the UK. The
manufacture and supply of building
components containing glass, windows, doors,
partitioning and cladding is carried out by
many other companies operating from within
the timber, metal (aluminium and steel) and
plastic (UPVC) sectors. The UK also has
several leading lead crystal suppliers, such as
Waterford-Wedgwood, Dartington and
Edinburgh Crystal.
Ceramics
‘Ceramics’ covers tableware, giftware,
ornamentalware and catering ware; floor and
wall tiles and sanitaryware; bricks, clay roofing
tiles, clay pipes and land drains; industrial
ceramics and refractories; and ceramic
materials and machinery. The industrv has
sales of more than £2 billion a year, emplovs
over 46,000 people and is heavily concentrated
in the West Midlands. Domestic tableware
production includes fine china, bone china,
earthenware and stoneware and is produced
predominantly in the Potteries (Stoke-on-
Trent) area of Staffordshire. Wedgwood,
Spode and Royal Doulton are among the most
famous names in fine bone china, and the UK
is one of the world’s leading manufacturers
and exporters. Research is being conducted
into the use of ceramics in housebuilding and
diesel and jet engines. Important industrial
ceramics invented in the UK include some
forms of silicon carbide and sialons, which can
withstand ultra-high temperatures.
Building Materials
Most crushed rock, sand and gravel quarried
by the aggregates industry (some 221 million
tonnes in Great Britain in 1999) is used in
construction. In 2000, 2.86 billion bricks were
produced by, and 2.89 billion bricks were
delivered from, sites in Great Britain.
Portland cement, a 19th-century British
innovation, is the most widely used chemical
compound in the world. Blue Circle
Industries (now part of the French group
Lafarge) is the UK’s largest producer of
cement—6.3 million tonnes in 2000, of which
400,000 tonnes were exported—and has 1,620
employees.2
Metals and Fabricated Metal Products
The Industrial Revolution in the UK was
based to a considerable extent on the
manufacture of iron and steel and heavy
machinery. These sectors remain important
parts of the industrial economy; around
519,000 people were employed in December
2000. Output in 2000 was little changed from
1999 and at the same level as in 1993.
The major areas of steel production are
concentrated in south Wales and northern
England, with substantial processing in the
Midlands and Yorkshire. Major restructuring in
the steel industry took place during the 1980s
and 1990s. Metals can be recycled many times;
every year the British metals recycling industrv
processes about 8 million tonnes of scrap metal.
From total crude steel output of 15.1
million tonnes, British producers delivered
14.4 million tonnes of finished steel in 2000;
50% was exported. Over three-quarters of
U K steel exports go to other EU Member
States. Germany is the UK’s biggest market.
Annual steel industry exports have risen from
4.7 million tonnes in 1985 to 7.8 million
tonnes in 2000. Exports of UK steel products
were valued at £2.1 billion in 2000. The main
U K markets for steel are in the construction
(22%), engineering (24%), automotive (17%)
and metal goods industries (14%). Corus,
Europe’s third largest steelmaker and the

seventh largest in the world, employed 33,200
people in the UK at the end of June 2000 and
produced 85% of the UK’s total crude steel.
Its output is based on strip mill products,
plate, sections, specialist engineering steels,
bars, wire rods and tubes. The company owns
23% of Avesta Polarit, formed in 2001 from
the merger of Avesta Sheffield (the Anglo-
Swedish stainless steel group) and the stainless
steel division of Outokumpu of Finland.
Corus’s worldwide aluminium output is
around 500,000 tonnes.
Products manufactured by other UK steel
companies include reinforcing bars for the
construction industry, wire rod, hot rolled
bars, bright bars, tubes, and wire and wire
products. The production of special steels is
centred on the Sheffield area and includes
stainless and alloy special steels for the
aerospace and offshore oil and gas industries.
Steel has had a notable success in UK
construction, with its market share in
buildings of two or more storeys more than
doubling from 30% in the early 1980s to 70%
today. It has 90% of the single storey market.
Total iron and steel sales in this sector are
£2.3 billion a year and consumption of
constructional steelwork 1.1 million tonnes.
Several multinational companies have
plants in Britain producing non-ferrous metals
from both primary and recycled raw
materials. The aluminium industry supplies
customers in the aerospace, transport,
automotive and construction industries.
Other important non-ferrous metal sectors
are copper and copper alloys, used for electrical
wire and cables, power generation and
electrical and electronic connectors,
automotive components, plumbing and
building products, and components for
industrial plant and machinery; lead for lead
acid batteries and roofing; zinc for galvanising
to protect steel; nickel, used principally as an
alloying element to make stainless steel and
high temperature turbine alloys; and titanium
for high-strength, low-weight aerospace
applications. Despite an overall decline in the
castings industry, some foundries have
invested in new melting, moulding and
quality control equipment.
Fabricated metal products include those
made by forging, pressing, stamping and roll
forming of metal. They are used for builders’
carpentry and joinery equipment; tanks,
reservoirs and metal containers; central
heating radiators and boilers; steam
generators; treatment and coating of metals;
cutlery, tools and general hardware.
Machinery and Equipment
Around 353,000 people were employed in this
sector in December 2000, with highest
concentrations found in the West Midlands,
followed by the South East and the East
region. Output declined marginally in 2000
and was 6% lower than in 1992—93.
Mechanical machine-building is an area in
which British firms excel, especially internal
combustion engines, power transmission

The UK is a major producer of industrial
engines, pumps, valves and compressors, and
of pneumatic and hydraulic equipment.
Companies manufacture steam generators and
other heavy equipment for power plants.
Alstom, a global specialist in transport and
energy infrastructure, is one of the world’s
leading suppliers of major components for
complete power station projects along with the
transformers and switchgear needed in
transmission and distribution of electricity. In
the UK the company’s strengths are steam
turbine manufacture, switchgear manufacture,
industrial gas turbines, and project design and
management.
The mechanical lifting and handling
equipment industry makes cranes and
transporters, lifting devices, escalators,
conveyors, powered industrial trucks and air
bridges, as well as electronically controlled
and automatic handling systems. The
commercial heating, ventilation, air-
conditioning and refrigeration sector is served
to a great extent by small and medium-sized
firms, although several large multinational
companies have sites in Britain.
Tractors and equipment used in
agriculture, horticulture, forestry, sportsturf
and gardens achieved export sales of £1.2
billion in 2000. Most tractor exports were
supplied by three major multinationals with
plants in the UK which, together with JCB
Uandpower, export to nearly every country in
the world. A wide range of specialist golf,
parks and sports field machinery, lawn and
garden products, and agricultural equipment
complement the tractor business.
Machine tools, most of which are computer-
controlled, are used in all sectors of
manufacturing, including the engineering,
aerospace and automotive industries. In 2000
total turnover of companies classified to the
metalworking machine tools industry was
£937 million, of which exports accounted for
£432 million, or 46%.
The mining and tunnelling equipment
industry leads the world in the production of
coal-cutting and road-heading (shearing)
equipment, hydraulic roof supports, conveying
equipment, flameproof transformers,
switchgear, and subsurface transport
equipment and control systems. In
construction equipment, the UK has the largest
production volume in Europe, approximately
one-third of the total. It also has the highest
export ratio of any major producing country.
JCB and a number of major multinational
companies contribute to construction
equipment exports of over £2 billion a year.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The UK has one of the largest engineering
construction sectors in the world, serving the
whole spectrum of process industries, with
particular strengths in oil, gas and related
industries. Most sales of textile machinery are
to export markets. British innovations include
computerised colour matching and weave
simulation, friction spinning, high-speed
computer-controlled knitting machines and
electronic jacquard attachments for weaving
looms. British companies also make advanced
printing machinery and ceramic processing
equipment, and other types of production
machinery.
The domestic appliances sector includes the
manufacture of refrigerators and freezers,
dishwashers, washing machines, tumble
dryers, vacuum cleaners, floor polishers,
microwave ovens and cookers, as well as water
heaters and showers, ventilation products and
small appliances for the kitchen and bathroom.
Energy efficiency and water conservation are
progressively improving in home laundry
products, and new technology is being applied
to many products. Visual design of what were
traditionally ‘white goods’ is changing, giving
a new look to kitchens, and modern design is
also being applied to vacuum cleaners and
small appliances such as kettles and toasters.
The UK is Europe’s largest manufacturer of
tumble dryers, with an annual trade surplus in
this product of around £23 million.
Electrical and Optical Equipment
In total 490,000 people were employed in this
sector in December 2000. There were 52,000
working in the office machinery and
computers sector, 178,000 in electrical
machinery, 132,000 in radio, TV and
communications equipment and 129,000 in
medical, precision optical equipment and
watches. Overall, output has been rising
sharply—by over 13% in 2000, when it was
almost 76% higher than in the early 1990s.
Production of office machinery and computers
rose by 274% between 1990 and 2000, while
radio, television and communications
equipment output was up by 132%. However,
output of medical and optical instruments fell
by 2%, while that of electrical machinery and

Southern England provides a substantial
proportion of employment (especially sales
and administrative jobs) in these sectors, with
Scotland and Wales having become important
areas for inward investors. Scotland’s
electronics industry (‘Silicon Glen’—in effect
all of central Scotland) directly employed
about 40,600 people in 1998. In 2000 electrical
and instrument engineering accounted for
exports worth £10 billion, 56% of Scotland’s
manufactured exports.
Many of the world’s leading overseas-based
multinational electronics firms have
substantial manufacturing investment in the
UK. The main electronic consumer goods
produced are television sets, with UK
production concentrated in the high-value
market and with an increasing proportion of
widescreen and digital sets. High-fidelity
audio and video equipment is also produced.
The computer industry in the UK is the
largest in Europe, producing an extensive
range of systems for all uses—for information
on software, see p. 533. There are several
multinational computer manufacturers in the
UK. Others, such as Psion (a British pioneer of
the ‘palmtop’ computer), have concentrated on
developing new lines for specialised markets.
A broad range of other electrical machinery
and apparatus is produced in the UK by both
British and foreign companies, covering power
482
27: MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
plant, electric motors, generators,
transformers, switchgear, insulated wire
and cable (including optical fibre cables for
telecommunications), and lighting
equipment.
The past few years have seen the
development of electronic service providers
(contract electronic manufacturers) which
manufacture and assemble products to the
specification of other companies. This global
trend has encouraged some multinational
producers to move away from manufacture to
become designers, developers, marketers or
sellers of their products; the UK is one of the
leading locations in Europe for this type of
business.
Communications Equipment
The domestic telecommunications equipment
market is worth .£15 billion a year.
Manufacturers have invested heavily in
facilities to meet rapidly increasing demand
for telecommunications services (see chapter
17). The main products are switching and
transmission equipment, telephones and
terminals. Transmission equipment and cables
for telecommunications and information
networks include submarine and high-
specification data-carrying cables.
There was remarkable growth in the mobile
communications sector in 2000 (see p. 285),
with the UK among Europe’s leading markets
and manufacturing bases. Many producers
have UK production or design centres. Fibre
optics (a UK invention) and other
optoelectronic components have also
experienced rapid growth, due to the demand
for ultra high-speed transmission rates for
Internet use. However, in 2001, there has
been a general downturn in the
telecommunications sector due mainly to the
downturn in the US economy. This has led to
rationalisation and job losses across the sector
in recent months.
Another sector of the industry
manufactures radio communications
equipment, radar, radio and sonar navigational
aids for ships and aircraft, thermal imaging
systems, alarms and signalling apparatus,
public broadcasting equipment and other
capital goods. Radar was invented in the UK
and British firms are still in the forefront of
technological advances. Solid-state secondary
surveillance radar is being supplied to
numerous overseas civil aviation operators.
Medical Electronics
The high demand for advanced medical
equipment in the UK stems from its
comprehensive healthcare system and
extensive clinical research and testing facilities
in the chemical, biological, physical and
molecular sciences. Important contributions
have been made by British scientists and
engineers to basic R&D in endoscopy,
computerised tomography scanning, magnetic
resonance imaging (pioneered in the UK),
ultrasonic imaging, CADiagnosis and renal
analysis. Firms in the UK medical electronics
sector continue their tradition of developing
and manufacturing a range of medical
equipment for domestic and overseas health
sectors.
Instrumentation and Control
The instrumentation and control sector covers
the design, development and manufacture of
scientific and industrial equipment and
systems for analysis, measurement, testing and
control. The instrumentation sector is
generally broken down into six specific
categories: navigation and surveying;
electronic and electrical testing;
laboratory/analytical; process monitoring and
control; automotive; and drafting and
dimensional measurement. The UK
instrumentation and control sector has an
estimated annual output of £9 billion, with a
trade balance of £884 million. The sector is
diverse and exceeds 3,000 firms, employing
79,000 people. It is the fourth most important
manufacturer of instrumentation and process
control equipment in the world behind the
United States, Japan and Germany.
Motor Vehicles
New UK car registrations rose by 1.1% in 2000
to 2.22 million, the fourth highest figure on
483
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
record. UK-based manufacturers’ share of the
UK market in 2000 was 28.3%, marginally
down on 1999. By customer type, the private
sector took 44.7% of the total, the fleet sector
45.8% and the business sector 9.5%.
Commercial vehicle registrations, at 298,000,
were 3.5% higher than in 1999. Car
production, at 1.63 million, was 8.8% lower
than in 1999, but has risen almost 26% since
1990. Vehicle manufacturers are increasingly
pursuing a global market, with production no
longer dominated by their traditional home
markets. This is reflected in the rise in both
UK exports and imports of motor vehicles.
Over 1 million passenger cars were produced
for export in 2000, more than two-and-a-half
times as many as in 1990 and the highest
figure ever. Commercial vehicle production in
2000 was 184,000, 1% lower than in 1999 and
significantly down on previous years; 87,000
units were for export. The sector is dominated
by light commercial vehicles.
Around 720,000 jobs are dependent on the
UK automotive industry, including 220,000
engaged in vehicle and component production
and manufacturing activities. There are
around 40 motor vehicle manufacturers in the
UK. Seven groups now dominate car output,
accounting for 99% of the total: Ford
(including Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston
Martin), Vauxhall/IBC, Peugeot, Honda,
Nissan, Toyota and the newly independent
MG Rover. There are still many companies
making cars and commercial vehicles in
Britain: Table 27.18 shows the main
producers, plus some specialist manufacturers.
Since 1997 motor vehicle manufacturers
have announced over £4 billion in new capital
investment in the UK, which is expected to
create over 10,000 new jobs. This includes
£440 million by Nissan at its Sunderland
plant to introduce the new Micra and Primera
models; £150 million by Toyota at its engine
plant in Deeside, raising capacity to 400,000
engines a year; £330 million invested by GM
in its Vauxhall and IBC plants for the new
Vectra and van projects; £400 million by
BMW at Hams Hall (West Midlands) to
create the world’s most advanced engine plant;
and £130 million by Ford to modernise Land
Rover’s Solihull plant. Ford will also invest
£360 million in the Dagenham diesel engine
plant to enhance its status as Ford’s European
centre of excellence. Investment by
component manufacturers includes four
Unipart joint ventures totalling over £80
million, and investment by Visteon on four
facilities in the UK.
The main truck manufacturers are Paccar
(which manufactures Leyland Trucks) and
ERF, now owned by MAN of Germany.
Medium-sized vans are manufactured by
LDV at Birmingham, Ford at Southampton
and by the new GM/Renault joint venture at
the IBC plant in Luton. The merger of the
UK bus manufacturing interests of Mayflower
and Henlys to form Transbus has resulted in a
powerful new group able to compete
successfully in European and other world
markets. London Taxis International, owned
by Manganese Bronze Holdings, the
engineering and automotive components
group, now produces 3,000 taxis a year at its
Coventry factory.
The automotive components manufacturing
sector, with an annual turnover of £8 billion
and employing 95,000 in Great Britain, is a
major contributor to the UK motor industry.
There are around 1,400 companies involved
(some 23% of them small and medium
enterprises, in terms of employment), many of
which also supply other sectors. The sector
has enjoyed strong growth and rising
productivity in recent years.
Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering
The UK merchant shipbuilding industry,
located mainly in Scotland and northern
England, consists of some 19 yards employing
in the region of 3,500 to 4,000 people,
producing ships ranging from tugs and fishing
vessels to fast ferries and large specialist craft
for offshore exploration and exploitation work.
The industry’s current order book is in the
region of 20 ships. The merchant ship repair
and conversion industry, which has a strong
presence in the UK, comprises over 60
companies employing 4,000 to 7,000 people
depending on workload. Naval construction
accounts for a further 15,000 people. Vosper
Thornycroft and BAE SYSTEMS dominate
warship production. During 2000 the
Ministry of Defence announced orders for the

construction of troop landing ships and troop
carriers which will safeguard and create
thousands of jobs at UK shipyards. Overall,
shipyards employ about 26,000 people and
tend to concentrate around Southampton,
Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne, Glasgow
and Belfast. In addition, the UK has a range of
world-class companies in the boat-building
sector. A few internationally known builders
dominate the sector.
The UK marine equipment industry has an
annual turnover of ^1.7 billion and employs an
estimated 16,600 people in about 700
companies. About 60% of its output is
exported. Production ranges from traditional
marine equipment to sophisticated navigational
and propulsion systems, as well as equipment
and supplies for the cruise industry.
Oil and gas exploitation in the North Sea
has generated a major offshore industry (see
pp. 495—6). Shipbuilders and fabricators
design and build semi-submersible units for
drilling, production andemergency/
maintenance support; drill ships; jack-up rigs;
modules; and offshore loading systems as well
as undertaking ‘floating production storage
and offload’ vessel (FPSO) conversions.
Harland and Wolff of Belfast is a world leader
in the offshore sector, specialising in drill
ships, while Swan Hunter and Aker McHulty
have had recent successes in the FPSO field.
Many other firms supply equipment and
services to the industry, notably diving
expertise, consultancy, design, project
management and R&D. A number have used
their experience of North Sea projects to
establish themselves in oil and gas markets
throughout the world.
Railway Equipment
There are several hundred UK companies
engaged in the manufacture of railway
equipment for both domestic and overseas
markets, mainly producing specialist
components and systems for use in rolling
stock, signalling, track and infrastructure
applications. Two large multinational train
builders, the UK/French-owned Alstom and
the Canadian-owned Bombardier—which
acquired German-owned Adtranz in 2000—
have UK bases. After a period in the early
485
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
1990s with few orders, privatised train
operating companies have placed orders for
more than 3,000 passenger carriages. One
notable order is for 53 electric tilting trains,
due to begin operating on Virgin West Coast
routes out of London Euston in 2002.
Aerospace and Defence
The UK’s aerospace industry is one of the few
in the world with a complete capability across
the whole spectrum of aerospace products and
technology. For the aerospace industry as a
whole, turnover in 2000 was £18.3 billion, of
which £11.95 billion (60%) was exported. It
contributed £3.8 billion to the UK’s balance of
payments in 2000. Around 151,000 people are
directly employed in the industry in Great
Britain, with the North West, South West and
East Midlands providing the highest number of
jobs. Farnborough International, held in July
every other year, and organised by the Society
of British Aerospace Companies, is the world’s
premier aerospace business event. At the 2000
show there were 1,287 exhibitors from 30
countries, with trade attendance of 170,000 and
public attendance of 133,000. Orders worth
£35 billion were announced during the event.
Industry activities cover designing and
constructing airframes, aero-engines, guided
weapons, simulators and space satellites,
materials, flight controls including ‘fly-by-
wire’ and ‘fly-by-light’ equipment (see
p. 487), avionics and complex components,
with their associated services. The UK also
has the Western world’s second largest
defence manufacturing industry after that of
the United States.
Among the leading companies are BAE
SYSTEMS and Rolls-Royce, both of which
are among the UK’s top five exporters. BAE
SYSTEMS is a global systems, defence and
aerospace company. It employs more than
100,000 people around the world and has
annual sales of some £12 billion; its order
book in 2000 was £41 billion. It designs and
manufactures civil and military aircraft,
surface ships, submarines, space systems,
radar, avionics, guided weapons systems,
communications, electronics and a range of
other defence equipment.
Civil Aircraft
BAE SYSTEMS has a 20% share of Airbus-—
EADS (European Aeronautic Defence and
Space Company) controls the other 80%. BAE
SYSTEMS has responsibility for designing and
manufacturing the wings for the whole family of
Airbus airliners, from the short- to medium-
haul A320 series (the first civil airliner to use
fly-by-wire controls) to the large long-range
four-engined A340. The company will also
design and manufacture the wings for the new
A380 ‘superj umbo’—a twin-deck, twin-aisle
jetliner with 555 or more seats—expected to
directly create 8,000 jobs in the UK. Airbus and
its related businesses support 62,000 UK jobs.
In 2000 Airbus received firm orders for 520 new
aircraft worth a total of US$41.3 billion from
42 customers around the world, and in the first
half of 2001 it had 52% of the world market for
large civil aircraft.
Short Brothers, owned by Bombardier of
Canada, the third largest civil aircraft
manufacturer in the world, employs about
6,000 people, the vast majority of whom are
based in Northern Ireland. The company is
mainly engaged in design and production of
major civil aircraft sub-assemblies, advanced
engine nacelles and components for aerospace
manufacturers as well as the provision of
aviation support services.
Military Aircraft and Missiles
The Eurofighter Typhoon is being built by
BAE SYSTEMS, EADS and Alenia of Italy.
BAE SYSTEMS also has the Harrier, a
vertical/short take-off and landing (V/STOL)
military combat aircraft, the Tornado combat
aircraft (built jointly with EADS) and the
Hawk fast-jet trainer, being supplied to
17 customers worldwide. The company is
involved in the Joint Strike Fighter
programme teams of both Boeing and
Lockheed Martin of the US.
BAE SYSTEMS is a major supplier of
tactical guided weapon systems for use on
land, at sea and in the air, having merged its
missile business with that of France’s Matra
Corporation and subsequently Alenia to form
Europe’s largest guided weapons concern,
MBDA (Matra BAe Dynamics Alenia). Shorts

THALES, operates in the area of very short-
range air defence systems.
Helicopters
Agusta Westland manufactures the multi-role
EH 101 medium-lift helicopter for civilian and
military markets—two British variants are the
Royal Navy’s Merlin HM.l advanced anti¬
submarine warfare helicopter and the RAF’s
Merlin HC.3 combat transport helicopter. It
also manufactures the Super Lynx light
battlefield and naval helicopter, and is
currently building the Apache attack
helicopter for the UK Army, under licence
from Boeing. Agusta Westland is now, after
Boeing, the world’s second largest helicopter
manufacturer, when including its product line
inherited from Agusta and the manufacturing
facilities in Italy.
Land Systems
The UK’s main armoured fighting vehicle
capability is concentrated in two companies:
Rolls-Royce, which acquired Vickers (Defence
Systems) in 1999, and Alvis. RO Defence, a
division of BAE SYSTEMS, is the UK’s only
indigenous ordnance company.
Engines and Other Aviation Equipment
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s three leading
manufacturers of aero-engines, with a
turnover in 2000 of £3.2 billion for its
aerospace business. More than 17,000 Rolls-
Royce civil engines are in service, in over 130
countries. Customers include over 500
airlines, 2,400 corporate and utility operators
and 100 armed forces. Rolls-Royce is a partner
in the low-emission V2500 aero-engine, now
in service on the Airbus A320 family. It
produces military engines for both fixed-wing
aircraft and helicopters, and is a partner in the
EJ200 engine project for the Eurofighter and
with GE on the alternative US Joint Strike
Fighter programme.
A number of UK companies produce
aerostructures (doors, windows and aircraft
body parts), equipment and systems for
engines, aircraft propellers, navigation and
landing systems, engine and flight controls,
environmental controls and oxvgen breathing
and regulation systems, electrical generation,
mechanical and hydraulic power systems,
cabin furnishings, flight-deck controls and
information displays. BAE SYSTEMS is the
world’s largest manufacturer of head-up
displays (HUDs). British firms have made
important technological advances, for example,
in developing fly-by-wire and fly-by-light
technology, in which control surfaces on the
wings and elsewhere are moved by means of
automatic electronic signalling and fibre optics
respectively. UK companies provide radar and
air traffic control equipment and ground
power supplies to airports and airlines
worldwide (see also p. 483).
Space Equipment and Services
Between 300 and 400 organisations
employing more than 5,000 people are
engaged in industrial space activities (see
pp. 439-40), with turnover of £365 million in
1999. UK participation in the European
Space Agency, and the British National
Space Centre’s role in coordinating UK
space policy (see p. 439), has enabled UK-
based companies to participate in manv
leading space projects covering
telecommunications, satellite navigation,
Earth observation, space science and
astronomy. The industry is strong in the
development and manufacture of civil and
military communications satellites and
associated Earth stations and ground
infrastructure equipment. In the field of
Earth observation, it plays a major role in
manufacturing platforms, space radar and
meteorological satellite hardware, and in the
exploitation of space data imaging products.
The largest British space company is
Astrium Limited. Jointly owned bv BAE
SYSTEMS and EADS, it is one of the
world’s major space companies. It has become
the leading provider of direct broadcast
television satellites, and is involved in all of
Europe’s space science and Earth observation
projects and its launcher and navigation
programmes.

Construction
The total value of work done in the
construction industry in Great Britain during
2000 was £69.5 billion at current prices, of
which £31.5 billion was new work and £32.0
billion repair and maintenance (see also
Table 27.19). The volume of output at
constant 1995 prices grew by 1.5% compared
with 1999. The main areas of construction
work within the GB industry covered by these
statistics are:
> building and civil engineering—ranging
from major private sector companies with
diverse international interests to one-
person enterprises carrying out domestic
repairs; and
> specialist work—companies or
individuals undertaking construction
work ranging from structural steelwork
and precast concrete structures to
mechanical and electrical services
(including the design and installation of
environmentally friendly building control
systems).

87% of the total compared with 75% in 1993.
In 2000 construction of over 176,000
dwellings was started in Great Britain. Starts
by private enterprise concerns were 158,300,
by registered social landlords 18,000, and by
the public sector 300. New dwellings completed
by sector are shown in Table 27.20 below.
Other areas of construction work not

in mass production of manufactured
items, to small, highly specialised
manufacturers; and
> consultancy work—companies or
individuals engaged in the planning,
design and supervision of construction
projects.
In December 2000, there were 1,845,000
workforce jobs in Great Britain in the
construction industry, just over 6% of the
total workforce. Of these, 721,000 (39%) were

Project Procurement, Management
and Financing
Private and public sector projects are managed
in a variety of ways. Most clients invite
construction firms to bid for work by
competitive tender, having used the design
services of a consultant. The successful
488
27: MANUFACTURING AND CONSTRUCTION
contractor will then undertake on-site work
with a number of specialist subcontractors.
Alternative methods of project procurement
have become more common in recent years—
for example, contracts might include
subsequent provision of building maintenance,
or a comprehensive ‘design-and-build’ service
where a single company oversees every stage
of a project from conception to completion.
Financing of major projects has also been
changing. Traditionally, clients raised the
finance to pay for schemes themselves. Today,
they often demand a complete service package
that includes finance; as a result, larger
construction companies are developing closer
links with banks and other financial
institutions. In public sector construction the
Government’s Private Finance Initiative/
Public-Private Partnerships (see p. 403) have
also heralded a move away from traditional
financing.
Overseas Contracting and Consultancy
UK companies operate internationally and in
any one year British consultants work in almost
every country in the world.
UK contractors have pioneered management
contracting and design and build, and also the
financing mechanisms that have been
developed in the domestic market through
innovations such as the Private Finance
Initiative. During 2000 they won new
international business valued at £4.0 billion,
8% more than in 1999 (see Table 27.21).
Contractors have been particularly successful
in North America, their most valuable market,
which accounted for 47% of all new contracts.
Recent major contracts have included:

UK energy production fell by 3% in 2000 and primary energy consumption was
0.4% higher. Oil production was 7.9% down, while production and consumption
of gas rose by 9.2% and 3.8% respectively, although the growth rate of its use in
power stations was lower than in recent years. The Government has allocated
£267 million over three years to promote new and renewable energy technologies.
Energy Resources
Production of coal continued to fall in 2000,
by 16% on 1999, to just over 31 million
tonnes. Nuclear electricity output went down
by 10.6% to 85.1 terawatt hours. Production
of natural gas rose to 108.5 billion cubic
metres—a record level for the eleventh
consecutive year. Coal still supplied a
significant proportion of the country’s
primary energy needs: 32% of the electricity
supplied in 2000 was from coal, while gas
supplied 39% and nuclear 21%.
For 2000, in value terms, total imports of
fuels were 85% higher than in 1999, largely
owing to a 75% increase in the value of
petroleum product imports. Exports were
69% higher, mainly because of a 66% increase
in the value of exports of crude oil. These
increases reflect high world oil prices during
2000 (see p. 495).
Overall the UK remains a net exporter of
all fuels, with a surplus on a balance of
payments basis of £6.7 billion in 2000, nearly
£2.4 billion higher than in 1999. The trade
surplus in crude oil and petroleum products
was £6.2 billion. In volume terms, imports of
fuel in 2000 were 18% higher than in 1999,
while exports were 6% higher. The UK had a
trade surplus in fuels of 43.5 million tonnes of
oil equivalent—the eighth year in succession
that it has had a trade surplus in volume
terms.
ENERGY POLICY
The Government’s energy policy is based on
diversity of sources and on sustained and
secure energy production at competitive
prices, within a framework where competition
can flourish, markets can operate efficiently
for the benefit of suppliers and consumers,
490
28: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
and the UK can make best use of its
indigenous resources. The electricity and gas
markets in Great Britain are open to full
competition, with the aim of giving consumers
a choice from a growing number of suppliers.
In June 2001 the Government announced a
review of the strategic issues surrounding
energy policy in Great Britain. This is
being carried out by the Cabinet Office’s
Performance and Innovation Unit and is
due to be completed by the end of 2001.
The main aim of the review is to set out the
objectives of energy policy and to develop a
strategy that ensures current policy
commitments are consistent with longer-
term goals. In particular, the review is
considering the impact of current and
projected energy demand and supply on:
the potential conflict with environmental
objectives; continued security and diversity
of energy supplies over the long term; and
managing potentially conflicting policy
goals for energy prices. The review covers
the roles of coal, gas, oil and renewables in
the country’s future energy balance, as well
as Combined Heat and Power and energy
efficiency. It is also considering what part
the nuclear industry should play. The
results of the review will be a key input to
the Government’s future policy on security
and diversity of energy supply and on
climate change.
In April 2001 the Government introduced
the climate change levy, a tax on business use
of energy, designed to encourage energy
efficiency across business, and thus help to
bring about lower emissions of greenhouse
gases. It is a key component in the
Government’s Climate Change Programme,
published in November 2000. It will
contribute towards climate change
commitments, including the UK’s binding
target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5% from 1990
levels by 2008-12 (see p. 332).
The levy is designed to balance
environmental gains and the protection of
business competitiveness. It is expected to cut
carbon emissions by about 5 million tonnes a
year by 2010 and to raise £1 billion in
2001—02. All revenues, however, are being
recycled, mainly through an offsetting cut in
employer National Insurance contributions,
but also through support for energy efficiency
programmes and renewables (see pp. 492-3
and 503). To protect the international
competitiveness of energy-intensive
industries, an 80% levy discount is available to
users who can demonstrate high emissions-
saving targets in negotiated agreements with
the Government.
International Developments
Since 1999 the European Union’s (EU) Fifth
Framework Programme of Research and
Technological Development (see p. 440) has
been the focus of research, development and
demonstration of energy technologies in the
EU. It has a non-nuclear energy budget of
1,042 million euro over 1999-2002. In
addition, the EU Energy Framework
Programme has six separate components:
ETAP (shared studies and analyses);
SYNERGY (international cooperation);
AUTENER (renewable energy); SAVE
(strategic action for vigorous energy
efficiency); SURE (safe transport of nuclear
materials and safeguards); and CARNOT
(clean and efficient use of solid fuels). The
programme has a total budget of 170 million
ecu (£119 million) over five years
(1998-2002). Since 1999 eight agencies, which
conduct research into, and promote, energy
conservation, have been established in the UK
under the SAVE II programme, which
provides up to 50% of start-up funding.
The European Commission (EC)
collaborates with specialist international
organisations, such as the International
Energy Agency (IEA), which monitors world
energy markets on behalf of industrialised
countries and whose membership consists of
all members of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development except
Iceland and Mexico.
Over 60% of the EU internal electricity
market has been legally opened to
competition. Great Britain, Finland, Germany
and Sweden have introduced the right of
consumer choice for all domestic, industrial
and commercial customers. The UK gas

market has been fully open to competition
since 1998.
An EC Green Paper, launching a debate on
the future of EU energy policy, calls for
stronger demand management (using taxes
and efficiency measures), and greater
promotion of renewable energy sources.
Otherwise the EU would increase its
dependency on imported energy from 50% to
70% by 2030, raising the share of fossil fuels
in meeting total energy demand from 79% to
86%. The EC has also proposed a directive
that aims to achieve full liberalisation of the
electricity and gas markets by 2005.
ENERGY CONSUMPTION
In 2000 consumption of primary fuels (oil,
gas, coal, nuclear) in the UK was only 9%
higher than in 1970, while Gross Domestic
Product (at constant market prices) rose by
96%. Energy consumption by final users in
2000, allowing for losses in conversion and
distribution, and excluding non-energy use,
amounted to 16.1 million tonnes of oil
equivalent,1 of which transport took 34.5%,
residential users 29.3%, industrial users
22.6%, commerce, agriculture and public
services 12.1%, and other users 1.6%.
Primary energy demand in 2000 was 0.4%
higher than in 1999. Primary demand for coal
and other solid fuels was 3.8% higher than in
1999, reflecting a late surge in coal use for
1 I tonne of oil equivalent = 41.868 gigajoules.
electricity generation. Primary demand for oil
fell by 1.7%, but gas rose by 3.8%, again
fuelled by the demand for gas for electricity
generation. On a temperature-corrected basis,
which shows what the annual intake might
have been if the average temperature during
the year had been the same as the average for
1961-90, energy consumption grew by 1.2%
in 2000, compared with an increase of 0.2%
between 1998 and 1999.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY
The Government funds a number of energy
efficiency programmes in the UK. Over £200
million of the revenue from the climate change
levy in its first two years will go to support
energy efficiency measures and renewables,
including 100% first-year capital allowances
for energy-saving investments. These
initiatives are an essential part of the UK
strategy for reducing greenhouse gas
emissions (see p. 332) and achieving the
Government’s domestic goal of a 20%
reduction in carbon by 2010.
The Carbon Trust was set up in April 2001
as an independent, non-profit-making
company with the aim of accelerating take-up
by business of low carbon technologies. The
Trust’s first-year funding is about £50
million—from recycled receipts from the
climate change levy and the Energy Efficiency
Best Practice Programme (EEBPP), which the
Trust will manage. It will also administer a
new Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme for
492
28: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
energy-saving technologies. This will be
worth about £70 million in 2001-02 and £130
million in 2002-03, depending on take-up.
The EEBPP is the prime national source of
independent authoritative information and
advice on energy efficiency. It is estimated to
have stimulated energy savings worth about
£800 million a year (at 1990 prices). These
energy savings are equivalent to saving more
than 4 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2000.
The 2000-01 EEBPP budget was £16.7
million.
The Energy Saving Trust (EST) was set up
by the Government and the major energy
companies. Its purpose is to work through
partnerships towards the sustainable and
efficient use of energy. In 2000-01 it received
an estimated £24.2 million in direct
government funding for work with the
domestic and small business sectors and
£16.4 million on transport-related programmes;
its UK-wide programmes brought in an
extra £75 million of investment. Under the
government-funded programme of work,
advice was given to some 430,000 individuals
and organisations during 2000-01. Since 1994
the public electricity suppliers (see p. 499)
have invested nearly £26 million a year in
energy efficiency under the regulator’s
successive Energy Efficiency Standards of
Performance (EESOP) schemes. The energy
companies are increasing their investment in
schemes under EESOP3 to about £55 million
a year over 2000-02, including scheme
delivery costs. Since 1994 EESOP
programmes have resulted in more than
500,000 insulation improvements and the sale
of 13.5 million energy-efficient light bulbs.
The Utilities Act 2000 has transferred the
power to set future EESOPs to the
Government. The Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) has published proposals for its
Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC) to
cover 2002-05.
The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme
(HEES) is to be relaunched in England as the
\\ arm Front Team in autumn 2001. It has a
budget of over £600 million during 2000-04,
and is aimed at those households for whom the
health risks are the greatest: the elderly, those
with children, and the disabled and
chronically sick. A fuel-poor household is one
that needs to spend more than 10% of its
income on maintaining a satisfactory heating
regime—about 4.5 million households in the
UK in 1999. HEES offers grants of up to
£1,000 for insulation and heating
improvements (not central heating) for low-
income families with children and for the
disabled, and up to £2,000, including
insulation and central heating packages, for
those aged 60 or more on low incomes. In
accordance with the Warm Homes and Energy
Conservation Act 2000, the Government
published in February 2001 a draft Fuel
Poverty Strategy setting out its goal to assist
all vulnerable ‘fuel poor’ by 2010.
OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND
PRODUCTION
The UK Continental Shelf (UKCS)
comprises those areas of the seabed and
subsoil up to and beyond the territorial sea
over which the UK exercises sovereign rights
of exploration and exploitation of natural
resources. In 2000, either through direct use
or as a source of energy for electricity
generation, oil and gas accounted for 73% of
total L K energy consumption, with UK
production supplying 98% of gas consumed.
About 10% of UK production was exported to
Ireland or through the UK-Belgium
interconnector (see p. 495), although on some
winter days imports were required to meet
demand. In 2000 output of crude oil and
natural gas liquids (NGLs) in the UK
averaged 2.7 million barrels (about 359,500
tonnes) a day, making it the world’s tenth
largest producer.
Taxation
The North Sea fiscal regime is a major
mechanism for gaining economic benefit for
the UK from its oil and gas resources. The
Government grants licences to private sector
companies to explore for and exploit oil and
gas resources (see p. 494). Its main sources of
revenue from oil and gas activities are
petroleum revenue tax, levied on profits from
fields approved before 16 March 1993;
corporation tax, charged on the profits of oil

from fields approved after 15 March 1993; and
royalty, which applies only to fields approved
before April 1982 and is paid at 12.5% of the
value of petroleum ‘won and saved’.
Licensing
The 19th seaward licensing round, inviting
applications for blocks in the White Zone—the
most recently designated part of the UKCS
between the Faroes and Shetland Islands—was
concluded in May 2001, with the aw ard of nine
licences covering 12 blocks. In addition, a tenth
round of landw ard licensing was announced in
July 2001. By the end of 2000, some 7,675 wells
had been, or were being, drilled in the UKCS:
2,126 exploration wells, 1,333 appraisal w ells
and 4,216 development wells. Some 26
exploration wells and 33 new appraisal wells
were started in 1999. The Government must
approve all proposed wells and development
plans.
Production and Reserves
Some 223 offshore fields were in production
in March 2001: 113 oil, 93 gas and 17
condensate (a lighter form of oil). During
2000, 12 new development projects were
approved. Offshore, these comprised six
oilfields and five gasfields; onshore, one
gasfield. In addition, approval for 12
incremental offshore developments
(elaborations to existing fields) was granted.
Cumulative UKCS crude oil production to
the end of 2000 was 2,448 million tonnes, with
Forties (327 million tonnes) and Brent (250
million tonnes) the largest producing fields.
Britain’s largest onshore oilfield, at Wytch
Farm (Dorset), produces 85% of the total
crude oils and NGLs originating onshore.
Possible maximum remaining UKCS reserves
of oil are estimated at 1,490 million tonnes.
Offshore Gas
Natural gas nowr accounts for over 40% of
total inland primary fuel consumption in the
UK. In 2000 indigenous production amounted
to a record 115 billion cubic metres, 9.5% up
on 1999.
Production from the three most prolific
offshore gasfields—Leman, Indefatigable and
the Ilewett area—has accounted for 34% of the
total gas produced so far in the UKCS. The
Southern Basin fields, the Morecambe fields
and the Liverpool Bay fields in the Irish Sea
produce more gas in w inter to satisfy increased
demand, with the North Sean and South Sean
fields also augmenting supplies to meet peak
demand on very cold days in w inter. The
partially depleted Rough field is used as a gas
store for rapid recovery during peak w inter
periods (see map at the end of the book).
Cumulative gas production to the end of
2000 is 1,604 billion cubic metres. Maximum
possible remaining gas reserves in present
discoveries now stand at just under 1,630
billion cubic metres.
494
28: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Pipelines
Some 10,640 km (6,650 miles) of major
submarine pipelines transport oil, gas and
condensate from one field to another and to
shore. Nine landing places on the North Sea
coast bring gas ashore to supply a national and
regional high- and low-pressure pipeline system
some 273,000 km (170,625 miles) long, which
transports natural gas around Great Britain. A
pipeline (40 km; 25 miles) takes natural gas from
Scotland to Northern Ireland; exports to the
Irish Republic are conveyed by the Britain-
Ireland interconnector. The pipeline from
Bacton to Zeebrugge in Belgium (232 km; 145
miles), which opened in 1998 and cost £420
million, has an export capacity of 20,000 million
cubic metres a year and an import capacity of
8,500 million cubic metres a year.
Economic and Industrial Aspects
Throughout 2000 world oil prices continued
to rise; the average price received bv
producers from sales of UKCS oil was £137 a
tonne, compared with £108 a tonne at the end
of 1999. UKCS oil and gas production rose
from 1.9% of the UK’s gross value added in
1999 to an estimated 2.7% in 2000. Total
revenues from the sale of oil (including
NGLs) produced from the UKCS in 2000
rose to some £17.2 billion, while those from
the sale of gas rose to £6.6 billion. Taxes and
royalty receipts attributable to UKCS oil and
gas rose to some £4.8 billion in 2000-01.
PILOT, the successor to the Oil and Gas
Industry Task Force, is pursuing specific
initiatives, with industry support, to maintain
exploration and development momentum on
the U KCS in the face of increasing maturity
Since 1965 the oil and gas production
industry has generated operating surpluses
of some £272 billion, of which about £108
billion (including £24 billion of exploration
and appraisal expenditure) has been
reinvested in the industry, £95.7 billion
paid in taxation, and about £68.3 billion
retained by the companies. Total annual
income of the oil and gas sector rose to over
£25 billion in 2000.
of its oil reserves, and to prolong UK self-
sufficiency. Among its targets are a production
level of 3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day
in 2010, a sustained investment level of
£3 billion a year, a 50% increase in the value
of industry-related exports by 2005, an
additional revenue of £1 billion from new
businesses, and 100,000 more jobs in 2010
than there would otherwise have been.
Production investment in the oil and gas
extraction industry fell back to some £2.8 billion
in 2000. Including exploration and appraisal
investment of a further £0.4 billion, it formed
about 12% of total British industrial
investment and some 2% of gross fixed capital
investment. Some 26,400 people were engaged
in extraction offshore and onshore by the
industry (which also supports about 360,000 jobs
in related sectors) in 2000. Various initiatives,
such as LOGIC (Leading Oil and Gas Industrv
Competitiveness), are currently aimed at making
the UKCS more attractive to investors and
sustaining activity through 2010 and beyond.
The Offshore Environment
Environmental impact assessments (under the
EC Environmental Impact Directive) are
mandatory for all field developments. The
Offshore Chemicals (Pollution Prevention and
Control) Regulations 2001 require the use and
discharge of offshore chemicals to be subject
to a permit issued by the Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry.
The EC Habitats and Wild Birds
Directives were applied to offshore oil and gas
activities on the UKCS through the Offshore
Petroleum Activities (Conservation of
Habitats) Regulations 2001, which came into
force in May 2001.
During 2000, 300 hours of unannounced
aerial surveillance of oil and gas rigs detected
minimal amounts of oil on the surface of the
sea. Offshore environmental inspections were
also carried out. The 2000 figure for accidental
oil spills (78 tonnes) was lower than that for
1999 (120 tonnes).
Decommissioning
The Petroleum Act 1998 places a
decommissioning obligation on the
495
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
co-venturers of every offshore installation and
the owners of every offshore pipeline on the
UKCS. Companies have to submit a
decommissioning programme for ministerial
approval and ensure that its provisions are
carried out. In 1998 the OSPAR Commission
(see p. 336) agreed rules for the disposal of
defunct offshore installations at sea. This
decision prohibits the dumping of offshore
installations and leaving them wholly or partly
in place. Derogations, however, are possible
for concrete platforms and for the footings of
steel installations with a jacket weight above
10,000 tonnes. All installations put in place
after 9 February 1999 must be completely
removed. The Government encourages the re¬
use of facilities and expects operators to show
that they have investigated such a course. It
also encourages free trade in mature offshore
oil and gas assets, as a means of extending field
life and maximising economic recovery.
Offshore Safety
Offshore health and safety are the
responsibility of the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE—see p. 163). In 1999
Aberdeen University’s Petroleum and
Economic Consultants Ltd published an
evaluation of the offshore health and safety
regime, which resulted from the Cullen
inquiry into the explosion that destroyed the
Piper Alpha oil platform in 1988. The
evaluation, which considered the regime
among the safest in the world, covers offshore
installations, pipeline works, prevention of fire
and explosion and emergency response, and
design and construction.
Suppliers of Goods and Services
The number employed in UK fabrication
yards declined to about 2,000 by early 2001.
Many companies have needed to seek work in
other sectors and overseas, and the Oil and
Gas Directorate of the Department of Trade
and Industry (DTI) works with the PILOT
initiatives and by other direct action to help
the industry realign to the changed market
circumstances. Britain’s largest ever overseas
offshore contract, worth £300 million and
placed by Shell with Amec to build an
oil-processing module for Nigeria, announced
in March 2001, will create over 4,000 jobs in
north-east England and in London, and will
inject work worth £100 million into the UK
supply chain.
DOWNSTREAM OIL
Oil Consumption
Deliveries of petroleum products for inland
consumption (excluding refinery
consumption) in 2000 included 21.4 million
tonnes of petrol for motor vehicles, 15.6
million tonnes of DERV (diesel-engined road
vehicles) fuel, 10.7 million tonnes of aviation
turbine fuel, 6.5 million tonnes of gas oil
(distilled from petroleum) and 1.8 million
tonnes of fuel oils (blends of heavy
petroleum).
Oil Refineries
In 2000 the UK’s 13 refineries processed 88
million tonnes of crude and process oils, a
slightly lower level than in 1999, but higher
than might have been expected after the
closure of Shell’s Shell Haven refinery in
December 1999. About 80% of UK output by
weight is in the form of lighter, higher-value
products, such as gasoline, DERV and jet
kerosene. The UK is much more geared
towards petrol production than its European
counterparts; this accounts for about a third of
each barrel of crude oil, compared with a
European average of just over a fifth.
TRADE
In 2000 UK exports of refined petroleum
products rose by 60% to £1.4 billion.
Virtually all exports went to its partners in the
EU and in the IEA, especially France and
Germany, and the United States.
Exports of UKCS gas rose by 73% over
1999. Some 13.5 billion cubic metres went to
the Netherlands, from the British share of the
Markham transboundary field and the
neighbouring Windermere field, to the Irish
Republic and to Belgium through the
UK-Belgium interconnector. About 2.3
billion cubic metres were imported from
496
28: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
Norway, and from Belgium via the
interconnector, representing 2.5% of total
supplies in 2000, compared with 1.3% in 1999.
GAS SUPPLY INDUSTRY
Structure of the Industry
The holder of a public gas transporter’s
licence in Great Britain may not also hold
licences for supply or shipping in a fully
competitive market.2 Of the two entirely
separate companies formed from the
demerged British Gas pic, the supply business
is now part of the holding company Centrica
pic (which still trades under the British Gas
brand name in Great Britain), while the
pipeline and storage businesses, most
exploration and production, and research and
technology (R&T) became part of the holding
company BG Group pic. In October 2000 BG
Group pic demerged its transport,
telecommunications, R&T and other
businesses into a separately listed company,
Lattice Group pic, while the rest of the group
continues as BG Group pic.
The national and regional gas pipeline
network is owned by Transco, now part of
Lattice Group, which retains responsibility for
dealing with leaks and emergencies, and also
has had a monopoly in gas metering, which
the energy regulator, Ofgem (see p. 500), plans
to open to competition. Shippers participate in
balancing supply and demand in the pipeline
network, within a regime partly driven by
commercial concerns, and utilising gas trading
arrangements, which include a screen-based
on-the-day commodity market for trading in
wholesale supplies of gas. In addition, there
are auctions for the allocation of entrv capacity
into the high-pressure national transmission
system; and commercial incentives for
Transco to operate and balance the system
efficiently. Because of the increasing use of gas
for electricity generation, the energy regulator
is considering changes to the gas balancing
regime—the way gas supply is matched to
demand, at present on a daily basis.
2 Suppliers sell piped gas to consumers; public gas transporters
(PGTs) operate the pipeline system through which gas will
normally be delivered; shippers arrange with PGTs for
appropriate amounts of gas to go through the pipeline system.
In Northern Ireland supplies of natural gas
have been available since 1996, when the
Scotland to Northern Ireland gas pipeline was
put into operation. Phoenix Natural Gas Ltd
has been awarded a combined licence for the
conveyance and supply of gas in Greater
Belfast. There are proposals both to extend
the gas system to other parts of Northern
Ireland and for a South-North pipeline from
outside Dublin to the Belfast area.
Competition
Since 1994 suppliers other than British Gas
have captured 83% of the industrial and
commercial gas market. Some 60 companies are
licensed to sell gas to the commercial sector.
By December 2000 about 6 million (out of
20 million) domestic customers had switched
from British Gas to one of 25 other companies
now in the domestic market, and also between
these other companies; but about 1 million
have since returned to British Gas. In 2000 the
changes that competition has brought about
were estimated to have brought each standard
credit customer average savings of about £60
a year on a gas bill (the average annual bill now
being £300, including VAT).
Only companies that have been granted
a supplier’s licence are allowed to sell gas.
Licence conditions include providing gas to
anyone who requests it and is connected to the
mains gas supply. Special services must be
made available for elderly, disabled and
chronically sick people. Suppliers must offer
customers a range of payment options; they
are able to set their own charges, but have to
publish their prices and other terms so that
customers can make an informed choice.
Ofgem (Office of Gas and Electricity
Markets) has removed price controls from
British Gas Trading, as it considers the
market to be competitive. However, it
continually monitors the market to ensure that
anti-competitive practices do not take place.
Consumption and the Market
Natural gas consumption, at an estimated
1,030.7 terawatt hours (TWh)3 in 2000, was up
3 I TW = 1,000 gigawatts (GW). I GW = 1,000 megawatts
(MW). I MW = 1,000 kilowatts (kW).
497
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
3.3% on 1999, with gas supplied for electricity
generation (amounting to 312.5 TWh) up
1.5%. Sales to industry (214.4 TWh) were
4.1% up and to the commercial sector
(126.8 TWh) 5.8% up, while domestic sales
(369.9 TWh) were nearly 3.3% higher.
Sharp rises in the wholesale prices of gas
have occurred since spring 2000, affecting in
particular industrial and commercial customers
(for whom prices have risen on average by about
50% in the year to March 2001). The major
causes have been arbitrage (trading on the price
differences) across the UK-Belgium gas
pipeline, at a time when continental gas prices
are linked to oil prices, which have themselves
been at high levels, and the associated
tightening of the UK supply/demand balance.
Liberalisation and competition in the
continental European markets are not yet as
developed as in Great Britain.
COAL
The UK coal industry is entirely in the private
sector. The main deep-mine operators in the
UK are UK Coal pic (formerly known as RJB
Mining pic, in England); Mining Scotland
Ltd; Tower Colliery (in south Wales);
Hatfield Colliery in South Yorkshire; and
Blenkinsopp Collieries Ltd in north-east
England. UK Coal pic, Mining Scotland Ltd,
H. J. Banks and Company Ltd, and Celtic
Energy, which operates in Wales, are the main
opencast operators. In May 2001 there were
33 underground mines in production,
including 17 major deep mines, employing
8,600 workers; and 45 opencast sites,
employing 2,600. Opencast production
accounts for most of the relatively low sulphur
coal mined in Scotland and south Wales, and
contributes towards improving the average
quality of coal supplies. Opencast mining is
subject to approval by local authorities and can
take place only where it can comply with strict
environmental guidelines, which stress the
highest standards of operation, restoration and
aftercare.
Market for Coal
In 2000 inland consumption of coal, at 59
million tonnes, was up 5.8% on 1999, partly
because high gas prices at the end of the year
led to an increase in generation by coal-fired
power stations. About 78% was used by the
electricity generators, 15% by coke ovens and
blast furnaces, 1% by other fuel producers,
2.5% by industry, 3% by domestic consumers
and 0.5% by other final consumers. Exports
were 661,000 tonnes, while imports amounted
to 23.4 million tonnes—mainly of steam coal
for electricity generation and coking coal.
Total production from British deep mines fell
by 18%, from 20.9 million tonnes in 1999 to
17.2 million tonnes in 2000. Opencast output
went down from 15.3 million tonnes to 13.4
million tonnes in the same period.
The Government’s lifting of the stricter
consents policy on the building of gas-fired
power stations has helped win EC approval for
the UK Coal Operating Aid Scheme, which
provides for up to £170 million to help the
coal industry through short-term energy
market problems while its production costs are
higher than world market prices for coal.
Clean Coal
Cleaner coal technologies reduce the
environmental impact of coal used for power
and industrial applications by increasing the
efficiency of its conversion to energy and
reducing harmful emissions which are the
cause of acid rain. Improvements in the
efficiency of coal-fired power stations lead
directly to reductions of carbon dioxide (C02),
a major contributor to climate change. The
DTI allotment of £12 million during
1999-2000 to 2001-02 to the cleaner coal
research and development (R&D) programme
aims to encourage collaboration between UK
industry and universities in the development
of the technologies and expertise. The DTI is
also developing a sub-commercial
underground coal gasification project to meet
government criteria on cleaner coal.
The Coal Authority
The Coal Authority is a public body sponsored
by the DTI. It has five main responsibilities:
licensing coal-mining operations; repairing coal
subsidence damage; managing coalfield
498
28: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
property; managing minewater pollution and
other environmental problems associated with
coal-mining; and providing information to
house buyers, other purchasers of property and
local authorities about mining activity near
property.
ELECTRICITY
England and Wales
In December 2000, over 60 companies held
generation licences in England and Wales. The
largest generators are Innogy (formerly National
Power), PowerGen, AES, British Energy, TXU
Europe (which has taken over Energy Group,
including Eastern Electricity), Edison Mission
Energy, and British Nuclear Fuels’ (BNFL’s)
Magnox Generation Group. The National Grid
Company (NGC) owns and operates the
transmission system, and is responsible for
balancing electricity supply and demand.
Distribution—transfer of electricity from
the national grid to consumers via local
networks—is carried out by the 12 regional
electricity companies (RECs) in England and
Wales. Supply—the purchase of electricity
from generators and its sale to consumers—
has been fully open to competition since 1999.
All consumers in Great Britain, including
24 million homes and 2 million small
businesses, are free to choose their electricity
supplier.
Cross-border acquisitions and takeovers have
become a feature of the European power market.
RECs are now restructuring as separate
distribution and supply companies, most of
them overseas-owned. All the main UK
generators are vertically integrating through
ownership of supply businesses. British
electricity companies continue to invest overseas.
In 2000—01, 2 GW of coal-fired plant was
sold by major generators to other concerns.
Coal-fired plant is now owned by eight
unrelated companies and the total market shares
in generation of Innogy and PowerGen, now
demerged, have fallen to 10.5% and 14%
respectively.
Reform of Electricity Trading
In March 2001 new wholesale electricity
trading arrangements (NETA) came into
operation. NETA introduces greater
competition into electricity trading, which
should ensure downward pressure on prices.
In a wholesale market worth about £7.5 billion
a year in 1998, such pressure could result in a
saving of up to £2 billion, or about 30% in
real terms. Generators, suppliers, traders and
customers are encouraged to enter into
bilateral contracts in forwards and futures
markets and short-term power exchanges.
Participants are free to trade electricity until
3'/2 hours ahead of real time for any half-hour
period. From that point until real time, the
market operates through a balancing
mechanism run by the NGC—because of the
need to balance the system on a second-by-
second basis. NETA has taken effect through
new conditions inserted into generation,
supply and transmission licences. These have
been designated by the Secretary of State
for Trade and Industry under the Utilities
Act 2000.
Scotland
ScotdshPower pic and Scottish and Southern
Energy pic generate, transmit, distribute and
supply electricity within their respective
franchise areas. They are also contracted to
buy all the output from British Energy’s two
Scottish nuclear power stations (Hunterston B
and Torness) until 2005. The over-100-kW
market in Scotland comprises about 6,750
customers and accounts for around 45% of all
electricity consumed. ScottishPower and
Scottish and Southern Energy have second-
tier licences that allow them to compete in
each other’s area. In 2000-01, 29.5% of
customers in the over-100-kW market
obtained their power from holders of second-
tier supply licences. In 1999 Ofgem proposed
the establishment of BETTA (British
Electricity Transmission and Trading
Arrangements), an extension of NETA to
Scotland, aimed at bringing greater
competition to the Scottish market. Included
in the BETTA proposals is the creation of a
single system operator, which would monitor
the balancing of supply and demand and
trading; establish new interconnector and
transmission access arrangements; and
develop new connections policies.

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Northern Ireland
Three private companies, AES (NI) Ltd,
Premier Power Ltd and Coolkeeragh Power
Ltd, generate electricity from four power
stations. Most of the electricity generated is
sold to Northern Ireland Electricity pic (NIE),
which has a monopoly of transmission and
distribution, and a right to supply. As
required by the EC Electricity Liberalisation
Directive, the market has been gradually
opened up to competition since 1999. From
2001 the right to choose a supplier has been
extended to 35% of the total market (mainly
large industrial and public sector consumers).
In addition, a number of second-tier suppliers
are now operating.
Northern Ireland has a power surplus, with
a peak demand of 1,500 MWh. However, two
of the four power stations are due to close
within four years. Plans have been announced
to replace the Coolkeeragh station by a 400
MW CCGT (see p. 501). Additional capacity
will also be available when the Northern
Ireland-Scotland (‘Moyle’) interconnector
(500 MW capacity) is commissioned early in
2002, and when work finishes later in 2001 on
strengthening the links between the networks
in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic,
with an interconnector capacity of 660 MW.
Northern Ireland’s Energy Action Plan
(Vision 2010) envisages—within a European
context—an all- Ireland energy market with
the aim of increasing competition and
consumer choice, tackling the consequences
that arise from two small markets operating on
the periphery of Europe, and reducing costs,
particularly in Northern Ireland, where
standard domestic consumers paid some 25%
more for electricity than their counterparts in
Great Britain in 2000. Consultants have been
appointed to advise on the steps needed to
create a more cohesive energy market.
Regulation and Other Functions
The gas and electricity markets in Great
Britain are regulated by Ofgem, which is
governed by an authority whose powers are
provided under the Gas Act 1986, the
Electricity Act 1989 and the Utilities Act
2000. Ofgem’s principal objective is to protect
Figure 28.3:
Electricity Demand by Sector, UK, 2000'

the interests of gas and electricity customers,
wherever appropriate, by promoting effective
competition. Other duties and objectives
include ensuring that reasonable demands for
electricity are met and that electricity and gas
licensees are able to finance their statutory
obligations. Ofgem is responsible for setting
performance standards for gas and electricity
companies, and for price regulation of
companies where competition has not yet fully
emerged or where there is a natural monopoly.
In Northern Ireland the energy regulator
holds two separate statutory appointments:
Director General of Electricity Northern
Ireland and Director General of Gas Northern
Ireland.
Consumption
In 2000 sales of electricity through the public
distribution system in the UK amounted to
314.6 TWh. Domestic users took 36% of the
total, industry 32%, and commercial and
other users the remainder. The average price
for electricity in the UK has fallen by 22% in
real terms between 1990 and 2000 for
domestic customers and by 32% for industrial
500
28: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
customers. In 2000 an average annual
domestic electricity bill for a customer paying
by standard credit is estimated at £257.40.
Generation
The shares of generating capacity during
1999-2001 are shown in Table 28.4.
Non-nuclear power stations owned by the
UK’s major power producers consumed
53.5 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2000, of
which coal accounted for 51.9% and natural gas
for 45.6%. Other power companies (for which
gas is the most widely used fuel), and over
2,000 small autogenerators (which produce
power for their own use), have equal access
with the major generators to the grid
transmission and local distribution systems. A
ten-year programme to control emissions of
oxides of nitrogen (NOx) through the
installation of low-NOx burners at 12 major
power stations in England and Wales is in
progress. Scottish and Southern Energy has
completed a £220 million refitting of Peterhead
power station, which has reduced the emissions
by 50%. ScottishPower has fitted low-NOx
burners at Longannet power station.
Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT)
In 2000 CCGT stations accounted for 35% of
the electricity generated by major power

producers, compared with 16% in 1995. This
increase has been balanced by a fall in coal- and
oil-fired generation. CCGT stations, favoured
by the smaller, independent producers and
using natural gas, offer cheap generation, and
give out almost no sulphur dioxide and some
55% less CO2 than coal-fired plant per unit of
electricity. At the end of March 2001, 29 such
stations in the UK (with a total registered
capacity of 20.6 GW) were generating power.
With the introduction of NETA (see p. 499),
the Government has lifted restrictions on the
building of new CCGTs.

Combined Heat and Power (CHP)
CHP plants are designed to produce both
electricity and usable heat. They convert
about 80% of fuel input into useful energy,
compared with conventional generation,
which wastes at least half the energy content
of the fuel and emits considerably more CO2.
CHP thus benefits the environment by
reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. It is
also used for cooling and chilling.
CHP can be fuelled by a variety of energy
sources. It offers particular benefits where
there is a regular need for heat as well as
electricity—in hospitals, leisure centres and
housing developments for example—and can
be provided on a local scale. About 83% of
CHP plants are less than 1 MW capacity;
large-scale plant (above 10 MW) represents
just under 80% of total CHP capacity. In 2000
over 1,500 CHP schemes supplied more than
4,600 MW of generating capacity (with some
2,700 MW under development) and produced
a total of 23.3 TWh. This represents 6% of
the UK’s total electricity generated (and
16.5% of electricity consumption). The
Government aims to have at least 10,000 MW
by 2010. EU strategy is to double CHP’s share
of the electricity market from 9% to 18% by
the same year.
The Government promotes CHP by
administering a quality assurance programme
under the EEBPP (see p. 493)—to assess CHP
schemes for exemption from the climate
change levy and for other benefits.
Trade
The NGC and Electricite de France run a
2,000 MW cross-Channel cable link, allowing
transmission of electricity between the two
countries. The link has generally been used to
supply ‘baseload’ power—which needs to be
generated and available round the clock—
from France to England. Imports met just
over 4% of the UK’s electricity needs in 2000.
Scotland has a peak winter demand of
under 6 GWh and generating capacity of over
9 GW. The additional available capacity is
used to supply England and Wales through
transmission lines linking the Scottish and
English grid systems. This interconnector’s
capacity is now 1,600 MW, with plans to
increase it to 2,200 MW. The 60-km (37-mile)
500 MW undersea interconnector between
Scotland and Northern Ireland (see p. 500)
will allow further exports of power from
Scotland.
The capacity of the interconnector between
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is
being doubled to 660 MW along with the
upgrading of the two present standby
connectors to full system interconnectors,
each with a capacity of 125 MW.
Nuclear Power
Nuclear power generates about one-sixth of
the world’s energy and over a third of
Europe’s. It substantially reduces the use of
fossil fuels that would otherwise be needed for
generation. In the UK nuclear stations
generated 85.1 TWh in 2000 and contributed
23% of total electricity generation.
The private sector company British Energy
owns and operates seven advanced gas-cooled
reactor (AGR; five in England and Wales)
stations and the pressurised water reactor
(PWR) at Sizewell B. British Energy’s reactors
have a rated output of 7,281 MW in England
and 2,440 MW in Scotland. British Nuclear
Fuels (see below) and Magnox Electric, which
merged in 1998, operate seven magnox power
stations, and four more that are being
decommissioned.
There are currently no proposals for new
nuclear power stations in the UK, principally
because the cost, compared with new
generation from other sources, is not
competitive. While projecting a 17%
reduction in nuclear output by 2010, the
Government sees nuclear as having an
important role well into the future. This role
will depend on nuclear competitiveness and on
securing public confidence in nuclear safety
and its environmental impact.
British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL)
BNFL is Britain’s primary provider of nuclear
products and services, including spent fuel
management, recycling, reprocessing oxide
fuel, decommissioning and cleaning up
redundant nuclear facilities, and treating
502
28: ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
historic wastes, to both UK and international
customers. The company’s turnover in
2000—01 was £2.1 billion. In February 2000
the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (Nil)
issued three critical reports after quality
checks on mixed oxide fuel (MOx)
manufactured at Sellafield were found to have
been falsified. In early 2000 both Japan and
Germany, two of BNFL’s biggest customers,
put contracts to buy large quantities of MOx
on hold. The Government has ordered BNFL
to make improvements and has delayed
consideration of a proposal to introduce a
Public-Private Partnership into the company
until at least 2002. Following a fifth public
consultation, the Government has given
permission for the Sellafield Mox plant (to
mix oxide fuel with depleted, natural or
recycled plutonium) to begin operations.
UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)
UKAEA’ s main function is to maintain and
decommission safely and cost-effectively its
redundant nuclear facilities used for the UK’s
nuclear R&D programme. UKAEA owns the
sites at Dounreay (Caithness), Culham and
Harwell (Oxfordshire), and Winfrith (Dorset);
and operates the Windscale (Cumbria) site. In
2000 it published a comprehensive plan for
decommissioning the Dounreay site and its
environmental restoration. UKAEA is also
responsible for Britain’s fusion programme
(see below).
Fusion Research
Nuclear fusion in the UK is funded by the DTI
and Euratom. The UK Government spends £15
million a year on fusion research, of which the
main focus is magnetic confinement, based at
Culham science centre, where Britain’s own
nuclear fusion research is carried out. The UK
also operates the experimental JET (Joint
European Torus) project at Culham. Through
the EU, the Euratom/UKAEA Fusion
Association contributes to the international effort
to demonstrate the principle of power production
from fusion, currently embodied in the
International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor.
Nuclear Safety
Responsibility for ensuring the safety of
nuclear installations falls to nuclear operators
within a system of regulatory control enforced
by the HSE.
The International Convention on Nuclear
Safety has been ratified by 46 countries,
including the UK, and each has reported on
how it has progressed towards meeting its
nuclear safety obligations. The UK’s main
contribution to the international effort to
improve safety in Central and Eastern Europe
and in the former Soviet republics is
channelled through the EU PHARE and
TACIS nuclear safety programmes.
NEW AND RENEWABLE SOURCES
OF ENERGY
The Government is committed to meeting
ambitious targets to reduce UK emissions of
greenhouse gases. It is putting in place
measures designed to ensure that the UK
exceeds its commitment to reduce emissions
of these gases by 12.5% below 1990 levels by
2010. A growth in the proportion of
electricity generated from renewable sources
will play a vital role in these efforts. The
Government aims to increase the percentage
of electricity generated from renewable
sources from the current level of just under
3% to 10% by 2010, subject to the cost being
acceptable to consumers. The proposed
Renewables Obligation for England and
Wales, and the associated Scottish
Renewables Obligation, will oblige all licensed
electricity suppliers to ensure that a specified
proportion of their supplies is derived from
renewable sources.
The Government is allocating over

Britain’s coastal waters offer the potential
of an abundant supply of wind power, if it
can be harnessed effectively and efficiently.
The UK’s first offshore wind farm (two
2 MW turbines off the Northumberland
coast) began generating enough power to
supply 3,000 homes in October 2000. It was
developed by the Border Wind consortium,
with financial help from the Non Fossil
Fuel Obligation (which preceded the
Renewables Obligation) and an EU
THERMIE grant. The Government is
seeking to streamline the planning consent
process for wind power. A major step has
been the announcement of 18 potential sites
as having pre-qualified for leases from the
Crown Estates, which could result in a
maximum of 540 turbines if all were to go
ahead.
TXU Europe has introduced ‘net
metering’ at its Eastern subsidiary in the
UK. This involves utilities buying excess
electricity from solar-powered households
at the same price as it is sold.
Elean power station at Sutton
(Cambridgeshire) is the UK’s first straw-
fired power plant. With a potential output
of 36 MW, it will burn 200,000 tonnes of
straw a year and generate enough power for
80,000 homes. The world’s first
commercial wave power station has been
commissioned on the coast of Islay in

of which has been allocated £10 million.
DEFRA will distribute £12.5 million in the

further development of energy crops.
A large number of British companies are
involved in an expanding global market for
renewables technologies, directly employing
several thousand people, and with a multi¬
million-pound export business.
Non-energy Minerals
Output of non-energy minerals in 1999 came
to 309 million tonnes, valued at nearly
£2.4 million. The total number of employees
in the extractive industry was about 24,300.
The UK is virtually self-sufficient in
construction minerals, and produces and
exports several industrial minerals, notably
china clay, ball clay, potash and salt. The
Boulby potash mine in north-east England is
the UK’s most important non-energy mineral
operation. Production in 1999 was down to
825,000 tonnes, of which 51% was exported.
Sales of china clay (or kaolin), the largest
export, were 2.3 million tonnes, of which 88%
was exported. A UK company, Baseresult,
bought the South Crofty tin mine (closed in
1998) in Cornwall in September 2000 and has
announced plans to restart mining in 2001.
The largest non-energy mineral imports are
metals (ores, concentrates and scrap—valued
at £1.5 billion in 1999), refined non-ferrous
metals (£3.1 billion), iron and steel (£2
billion) and non-metallic mineral products
(£5.9 billion, of which rough diamonds
account for £3.8 billion).
Water Supply
About 75% of the UK’s water supplies is
obtained from mountain lakes, reservoirs and
river intakes; and about 25% from
underground sources (stored in layers of
porous rock). South-east England and East
Anglia are more dependent on groundwater
than any other parts of the UK. Scotland and
Wales have a relative abundance of unpolluted
water from upland sources. Northern Ireland
also has plentiful supplies for domestic use
and for industry.
Water put into the public supply system
(including industrial and other uses) in
England and Wales averaged 15,331 megalitres
a day (Ml/d)4 in 1999-2000, of which average
daily consumption per head was about 151
litres. An average of 2,443 Ml/d was supplied
in Scotland in 1999-2000. In Northern Ireland
the figure was 704 Ml/d.

Some 35,144 Ml/d were abstracted from
surface waters (for example, rivers and
reservoirs) in England and Wales in 1998, of
which public water supplies accounted for
11,723 Ml/d. The electricity supply industry
took 15,955 Ml/d; fish farming 5,182 Ml/d;
and agriculture 11 Ml/d, with spray irrigation
accounting for a further 144 Ml/d.

Water Companies
The 24 water companies across England and
Wales have statutory responsibilities for
public water supply, including quality and
sufficiency. Ten of these companies are also
responsible for public sewerage and sewage
treatment.
The Water Industry Act 1999 prohibits
water companies from disconnecting
households, as well as other premises vital to
the community. It also protects water
customers, such as low-income families, the
elderly and the disabled, who are vulnerable to
hardship because of high bills for metered
water. Since 1989 water bills have risen by
more than a third in real terms. The
Government’s draft Water Bill, published in
November 2000, comprises clauses to
encourage the efficient use of water, including
changes to the licensing system for water
506

abstraction (with increased penalties for
abstraction and impounding offences), and
provisions to improve the regulation of the
water industry and promote the interests of
consumers.
\\ atermark, a government-backed
initiative, aims to develop a database that will
give the public sector, which has a water bill of
£600 million a year, reliable benchmarks
against which to measure its consumption.
Such data, it is estimated, could save
£60 million of this amount.
During 2000—05 the Government requires
the water companies to pay for a capital
investment programme costing an estimated
£15.6 billion,5 including £7.4 billion on
improving water quality and on meeting new
UK and EU environmental standards. It also
wants to ensure that customers do not have to
face unreasonably high bills.
The Director General of Water Services,
who heads Ofwat (Office of Water Services),
the industry’s regulatory body, has
determined that the companies’ efficiency
improvements will mostly fund the
investments specified. Household customers
are expected to see an average increase of
2.3% in their bills for water and sewerage
services for 2001—02, coming after an av erage
11.3% reduction in their bills for 1999-2000.
By the end of 2001-02 about 22% of
households and 90% of commercial and
industrial customers will be charged for water
on the basis of consumption measured by
meter. Most homes are still charged according
to the rateable value of their property. The
Government has given customers increased
choice over whether or not to have their bills
based on a water meter. As a result, all water
companies now supply free meters to
households on request. Average water and
sewerage bills for households without a meter,
at £227 in 1999-2000, are expected to be £18
lower in real terms by 2005.
Of some 2.8 million tests on drinking water
in England and Wales in 1999, 99.82% met
standards that are in some cases stricter than
those in the 1980 EC Drinking W ater
3 The programme includes dismantling what remains of Victorian
sewerage systems; providing new sewers, and tanks to prevent
sewage overflows; removal of lead from supply pipes; and

Directive. A new EC Directive, adopted in
1998, requires Member States to meet a
number of even more stringent standards, for
example an obligation to ensure maximum
concentrations of lead in water of 25
microgrammes per litre within five years and
10 pg/1 within 15 years.
The Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI)
checks that water companies meet the
drinking water quality regulations.
Enforcement action is taken when there are
infringements of standards. The DWI also
investigates incidents and consumer
complaints about quality, and initiates
prosecution if water unfit for human
consumption has been supplied.
Competition
The Government has proposed to extend the
opportunities for competition in the water
industry in England and Wales, but will take
steps to safeguard water quality, public health
and wider social policies. These proposals will
license new entrants in the market for
production and retail activities, while the
incumbent water companies will remain
vertically integrated statutory undertakers. A
consultation paper setting out the regulatory
and legislative framework will be published in
autumn 2001. By September 2000 eight ‘inset
appointments’ had been made, under which a
water company can seek to be appointed to
supply customers in the area of another
appointed water company. Five of these
appointments involve Anglian Water, and one
a new entrant. Since April 2000 every water
company has been subject to the Competition
Act 1998, which could result in others using
its pipe network to supply customers. In
August 2000 the Government lowered the
‘inset1 threshold, allow ing customers who use
betw een 100 million and 250 million litres a
year—such as hospitals and universities—to
seek alternative suppliers.
Water Leakage
In response to mandatory targets set by the
Director General of Water Services the
companies reduced water leakage by some
30% betw een 1996-97 and 1999-2000, from
507
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
4,528 Ml a day to 3,306 Ml a day. The
industry spent £816 million on leakage repair
and £1.7 billion on mains rehabilitation and
replacement over 1998-2000.
Scotland
Responsibility for the provision of water and
sewerage services rests with the North, West
and East of Scotland Water Authorities. The
Scottish Executive intends to replace these
authorities with an all-Scotland water and
sewerage authority, called Scottish Water. As
with the existing authorities, Scottish Water
will be a public sector body accountable to
Scottish ministers and the Parliament for the
provision of water and sewerage services. The
Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland
promotes customer interests and advises the
Executive about the level of water charges.
Modernisation of the water industry is in
progress, with the authorities investing some
£1.8 billion over 1999-2002, including
projects worth about £700 million in
partnership with the private sector. New water
treatment plants are being built and all major
towns are benefiting from new wastewater
treatment works. Prices for water services
depend on the type of consumer: domestic
consumers pay amounts based on their council
tax band (see p. 409) or, in very few cases,
metered charges; and non-domestic
consumers pay non-domestic water rates, or
metered charges and trade effluent charges.
The Executive also intends to introduce
legislation to regulate the provision of water and
sewerage services on the public networks, with a
licensing regime to ensure that only fit and
proper operators gain access to the networks.
Northern Ireland
The Northern Ireland Executive envisages
expenditure of up to £2.5 billion over 15-20
years to bring water and sewerage services up
to standard and to meet increasing demand.
(Some of the main sewers of Belfast date from
Victorian times and may be at risk of collapse.)
An extra 10% in water bills would be
necessary to pay for these improvements.

The service sector in the United Kingdom is continuing to grow and
contributed 70.2% of gross value added at current basic prices and 77% of
employment in 2000. Nearly 22.5 million people had jobs in the service sector at
the end of 2000, a rise of over 800,000 in two years.
Financial services make a major contribution to the UK economy, and
London is by far the largest international Financial centre in Europe. The UK’s
financial services sector accounts for around 5% of Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) and employs more than 1 million people. Net overseas earnings have
risen substantially, reaching a record £31.2 billion in 1999.
As a result of rising real incomes, consumer
spending on financial, personal and leisure
services has increased considerably. Travel,
hotel and restaurant services in the UK are
among those to have benefited from the long¬
term growth in tourism, and the UK is one of
the world’s leading tourist destinations.
Computer activities and research and
development are among the non-financial
sectors which experienced strong growth in
turnover in 2000 (see Table 29.1).
Financial Services
Historically, the heart of the financial services
industry has been in the ‘Square Mile’ in the
City of London, and this remains broadly the
case. Among the major financial institutions
and markets in the City are the Bank of
England, the London Stock Exchange and
Lloyd’s insurance market. The City is one of
the world’s three leading financial centres,
along with Tokyo and New York. An
important feature is the size of its international
activities. It is noted for having:
> more overseas banks than any other
financial centre;
> the biggest market in the world for
trading foreign equities, accounting for
48% of global turnover in 2000;
> by far the world’s biggest foreign
exchange market, actively trading the
largest range of currencies;

International Financial Services London
(IFSL) (www.ifsl.org.uk), formerly BI (British
Invisibles), promotes the international
activities of UK-based financial institutions
and related professional and business services.
It also seeks to raise awareness of the UK’s
leading role in international financial markets
and highlight the major contribution of
financial services to the UK economy.
REGULATION
Major reforms have been made to the
regulation of financial services, including the
London has a full range of ancillary and
support services, including legal,
accountancy and management services.
For example, of the world’s 50 largest legal
firms, ten are based in London, more than
in any other centre. A report by IFSL in
May 2001 confirmed London’s position as
a leading international centre for the
provision of accounting and management
consulting services. The UK management
consultancy market (see p. 534) is the
second largest in Europe, accounting for
about 10% of the international market.
Between 1996 and 1999 the UK’s net
overseas earnings of management
consultancy firms more than doubled,
from £358 million to £811 million, while
those of accounting firms rose from £50
million to £477 million.
creation of the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) (www.fsa.gov.uk). The Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 provides for
the formal establishment of the FSA, bringing
together the regulation of investment
business, banks, building societies and
insurance companies previously handled by
nine regulatory bodies. New compensation
arrangements and a single Financial
Ombudsman are being set up. The new
regulatory regime will be fully operational by
the end of November 2001.
FSA Objectives and Functions
The FSA’s statutory objectives are
maintaining confidence in the UK financial
system and promoting public understanding
of it, providing an appropriate degree of
consumer protection and reducing the
potential for financial crime. In delivering
these objectives, the FSA has to be efficient
and economic, facilitate innovation in financial
services, take account of the international
nature of financial services business and
minimise any adverse effects of regulation on
competition.
Until the end of November 2001 the FSA
will continue to supply regulatory and other
510
29: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
services under contract to several of the
regulatory bodies which it will replace when
the Act is fully implemented. It is also
supplying services to HM Treasury in its
prudential regulation of insurance business,
including regulatory oversight of the Lloyd’s
market (see p. 519). The FSA’s new risk-
based strategy for the regulation of financial
services is designed to help the Authority
achieve its statutory objectives. It aims to
identify and address the most important risks
to firms, markets and consumers, with less
routine monitoring for well-run firms. Each
year the FSA will identify key regulatory
themes for priority attention by managers and
regulators.
The FSA has acquired responsibility from
the London Stock Exchange for acting as the
competent authority for listing companies in
the UK, determining the rules for companies
that wish to be listed. The FSA has been
making preparations for the new regime under
the Act, focusing on how the Act will interact
with the listing rules; under the Act, the FSA,
as listing authority, will also acquire the power
to impose financial penalties. The FSA has
issued guidance for recognised investment
exchanges (RIEs)—there are eight UK RIEs
and 11 overseas investment exchanges
currently recognised in the UK—and the two
recognised clearing houses, and published its
sourcebook on regulating the Lloyd’s market.
1 he FSA will become responsible in
September 2002 for statutory regulation of
key aspects of mortgage lending (but not
mortgage advice), as part of the
Government’s plans to reform the selling of
mortgages (see p. 349). It will also
implement a new statutory system for
regulating credit unions (see p. 517), which
is due to come into operation in summer
2002.
The FSA is to publish comparative
information on the Internet for retail
consumers on long-term investment products,
including personal pensions, investment
bonds, unit trust Individual Savings Accounts,
savings endowments and mortgage
endowments. This information is intended to
make a contribution to the transparency of
retail products, so encouraging consumers to
shop around.
Banking Supervision
Banks are required to meet minimum
standards on the integrity and competence of
directors and management, the adequacy of
capital and cash flow, and the systems and
controls to deal with the risks they experience.
If a bank fails to meet the criteria, its activities
may be restricted, or it may be closed. These
arrangements are intended to strengthen, but
not guarantee, the protection of bank
depositors, thereby increasing confidence in
the banking system as a whole.
Changes are planned to the international
agreement governing the adequacy of capital
(the Basel Accord), which are designed to link
the level of capital required by banks more
closely to the degree of risk taken. The new
Accord, which is planned to be implemented
by the end of 2005, would be consistent with
current UK practice. In addition, the
European Commission issued proposals in
February 2001 for updating the EU capital
adequacy regime and these would apply to EU
banks, building societies and investment
firms.
Compensation
The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
provides for a single Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (FSCS). When the Act
is fully in force the FSCS will provide
compensation if a firm collapses owing money
to investors, depositors or policyholders. It
will replace a number of schemes, including
the Investors Compensation Scheme (ICS),
for private investors; the Deposit Protection
Scheme (DPS), for bank customers; and the
Building Societies Investor Protection
Scheme. Since February 2001 the FSCS has
had operational responsibility for managing
the ICS and DPS; since their creation they
have made compensation payments to
investors and depositors of ^238 million and
£118 million respectively.
Financial Ombudsman Service
A new Financial Ombudsman Service is being
set up as a one-stop service for dealing with
complaints about financial services, and will
511
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
have an annual budget of around £20 million.
It will replace eight schemes, including those
covering banks, building societies, insurers
and firms conducting investment business. All
firms authorised by the FSA will be subject to
the Ombudsman’s procedures, but consumers
will have to seek a resolution to a complaint
from the firm in the first instance. If the
matter is not resolved satisfactorily,
consumers can ask the Ombudsman to
intervene. Firms not authorised by the FSA
will be able to join the scheme on a voluntary
basis.
International Agreements
The UK plays a major role in international
efforts to maintain global prosperity and
prevent financial crises. The Group of Seven
(G7) leading industrialised countries agreed in
1998 on measures to reform the international
financial architecture, including enhanced
global supervision and strengthened
cooperation between regulatory authorities.
The Financial Stability Forum was set up in
1999, bringing together senior representatives
of G7 national governments, central banks and
statutory regulators, together with
international financial institutions and the key
global financial regulatory standard-setting
agencies.
HM Treasury represents the UK in
negotiating EC Directives on the financial
services sector, coordinating as necessary with
the FSA and other bodies.
BANK OF ENGLAND
The Bank of England (www.bankofengland.
co.uk) was established in 1694 by Act of
Parliament and Royal Charter as a corporate
body. Its capital stock was acquired by the
Government in 1946. Fundamental changes to
the Bank’s role took effect under the Bank of
England Act 1998, including the acquisition of
operational responsibility for setting interest
rates.
As the UK’s central bank, the Bank’s
overriding objective is to maintain a stable and
efficient monetary and financial framework for
the effective operation of the economy. In
pursuing this goal, it has three main purposes:
> maintaining the integrity and value of the
currency;
> maintaining the stability of the financial
system; and
> seeking to ensure the effectiveness of the
financial services sector.
Monetary Policy Framework
The Bank’s monetary policy objective is to
maintain price stability and, subject to that, to
support the Government’s economic policy,
including growth and employment objectives.
Price stability is defined in terms of the
Government’s inflation target (see p. 386).
The responsibility for meeting this target rests
with the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee,
which comprises the Governor, the two
Deputy Governors and six other members.
The Committee meets every month and
interest rate decisions are announced as soon
as is practicable after the meeting. The
Committee is accountable to the Bank’s Court
of Directors as regards its procedures, to
government and to Parliament.
Financial Stability
Under the Memorandum of Understanding
between the Bank, HM Treasury and the
FSA, the Bank is responsible for the overall
stability of the financial system, and its
Financial Stability Committee oversees the
Bank’s work in this area. In exceptional
circumstances, the Bank may provide financial
support as a last resort to prevent problems
affecting one financial institution from
spreading to other parts of the financial
system. It also oversees the effectiveness of the
financial sector in meeting the needs of
customers and in maintaining the sector’s
international competitiveness.
Other Main Functions
The Bank, through its daily operations in the
money market, supplies the funds which the
banking system as a whole needs to achieve
balance at the end of each day. By setting the
interest rate for these operations, the Bank
influences the general level of interest rates as
512
29: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
the interest rate at which the Bank deals is
quickly passed on through the financial
system, which in turn affects the whole
pattern of interest rates across the UK
economy.
The Bank provides banking services to its
customers, principally the Government, the
banking system and other central banks. It
plays a key role in payment and settlement
systems, and has sole right in England and
Wales to issue banknotes, which are backed by
government and other securities. The profit
from the note issue is paid directly to the
Government. Three Scottish and four
Northern Ireland banks may also issue notes,
but these have to be fully backed by Bank of
England notes.
Court of Directors
The Court of Directors is responsible for
managing the affairs of the Bank other than
the formulation of monetary policy. It
comprises the Governor, the two Deputy
Governors and 16 Directors. The Directors
form a subcommittee; functions include
reviewing the Bank’s performance in
relation to its objectives and strategy, and
the internal procedures of the Monetary
Policy Committee. The Court is required to
report annually to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer.
BANKING SERVICES
At the end of March 2001, there were 309
banks authorised to accept deposits in the UK
under the Banking Act 1987. In addition, 355
branches of European-authorised institutions
were entitled to accept deposits in the UK.
\\ ith around 20% of cross-border bank
lending, the UK is the world’s largest single
market for international banking. Banks from
around 80 countries have subsidiaries,
branches or representative offices in London.
‘Retail’ banking primarily caters for
personal customers and small businesses,
offering services including current accounts,
savings accounts, loan arrangements, credit
and debit cards, mortgages, insurance,
investment products, share-dealing services
and ‘wealth management’ services. Nearly all

banks engage in some ‘wholesale’ activities,
which involve taking larger deposits,
deploying funds in money-market
instruments, and making corporate loans and
investments, while some concentrate on
wholesale business. Many dealings are
conducted on the inter-bank market, among
banks themselves.
Around 92% cent of households have at
least one member with a bank or building
society current account (see Table 29.2).
Retail Banks and Banking Groups
The ‘big four’ bank groups are HSBC, Lloyds
TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays.

Scotland, merged in September 2001 to form
HBOS, while the Competition Commission

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
Abbey National. Other large-scale banks
include Alliance & Leicester, Bradford &
Bingley and Northern Rock, all of which used
to be building societies. Standard Chartered,
which mainly operates overseas, has a network
of around 615 offices in 56 countries, notably
in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. As well as
the move by several building societies into the
banking sector, other businesses, notably
insurance companies and supermarkets (see
p. 525), have also entered the sector, although
relatively few offer current accounts. Several
US banks have entered the market for issuing
credit cards.
Traditionally, the major banks have
operated through their branches, but the
number of branches is falling, as banks have
taken steps to cut costs, such as through
centralising ‘back office’ processing
operations. This is partly because more
customers are using telephone and Internet
banking. According to ABACS (see p. 515),
over 12 million people used telephone and/or
personal computer (PQ/Internet banking
services in 2000, of whom around 3.3 million
used PC/Internet banking. Most customers
use these services to view balances and
transactions or to transfer funds between
accounts, with only a small proportion using
them for making payments. Banking services
using the Internet are becoming much more
widely available. Most major banks have
introduced Internet banking, either as an
additional option for customers or as a
separate stand-alone facility. Several are
planning to introduce Internet banking with
access through mobile telephones and/or
digital television.
Review of UK Banking Services
A major independent review of banking
services, Competition in UK Banking: A Report
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, published in
March 2000, found that, although the UK had
a stable financial system and one of the most
open regulatory regimes in the world, a more
competitive policy framework was needed. In
its response to the report, published in August
2000, the Government announced a number
of measures designed to improve competition
in UK banking markets and to deliver benefits
to consumers, including:
> reviewing self-regulatory redress
mechanisms, with the aim of ensuring
that they deliver sufficient consumer
benefits—an independent report was
published in July 2001, and the
Government has asked the industry to
respond by the end of September 2001;
> encouraging the provision of comparative
information on banking products;
> agreeing to a review of the effect of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
on competition two years after the Act’s
commencement; and
> reforming the Treasury’s objectives on
promoting competition in financial
services.
Following the review’s recommendation, the
Competition Commission is conducting a
review of the supply of banking services to
small businesses.
In December 2000 the Government issued
a consultative document containing proposals
for a new regulatory framework governing UK
payment systems. Under these proposals,
banks and other organisations offering
payment services would, among other things,
have to set out clearly their charges, let new
competitors into the market on fair and
Universal Banking Services
In May 2001 the Government reached
agreement with the main UK banks on the
introduction of‘universal banking
services’, which will be available through
post offices from 2003. The services are
intended to tackle financial exclusion and
bring those people without bank accounts
into the financial mainstream. They will
also ensure that benefit recipients and
pensioners can continue to receive their
money in cash at their local post office
when such pay ments are automated in
January 2003. Facilities available through
post offices will include a new Post Office
card account, while the banks will make
their basic bank accounts accessible
through the Post Office and contribute
£180 million to the costs of running the
Post Office card account.
514

reasonable terms, and work together to
develop new and innovative payment
systems. Responsibility for enforcing the
rules would rest with the Office of Fair
Trading.
Investment Banks
London is a major international centre for
investment banking and many overseas
investment banks have a substantial
presence. Many investment banks in
London, including those from the United
States and continental Europe, have been
developing their international operations.
Investment banks offer a range of
professional financial services, including
corporate finance and asset management. A
major activity is the provision of advice and
financial services to companies, especially
in respect of mergers, takeovers and other
forms of corporate reorganisation.
Investment banks have considerable
expertise in advising governments on
privatisation.
Building Societies
Building societies are mutual institutions,
owned by their savers and borrowers. As well
as their retail deposit-taking services, they
specialise in housing finance, making long¬
term mortgage loans against the security of
property—usually private dwellings
purchased for owner-occupation. Some of
the larger societies provide a full range of
personal banking services. Building societies
have about 2,100 branches. According to the
Building Societies Association (BSA)
(wjpw.bsa.org.uk), about 15 million savers
have building society savings accounts
(around 18.5 million accounts), and building
societies hold some j(jl20 billion in savings
accounts. Over 2.5 million borrowers are
buying their homes through mortgage loans
from a building society. The chief
requirements for societies are that:
> their principal purpose is making
loans which are secured on residential
property and are funded substantially
by their members;
> at least 75% per cent of lending has to
be on the security of housing; and
> a minimum of 50% of funds must be
in the form of deposits made by
individual members.
There are 67 authorised building
societies, all of which are members of the
BSA, with total assets of over £165 billion.
The largest is the Nationwide, with assets
of £71 billion.
The number of societies has fallen
substantially as a result of mergers and the
decision by several large societies to give up
their mutual status and become banks.
Many of the remaining societies have taken
steps to defend their mutual status, for
example, by requiring new members to
assign to charity any ‘windfall’ payments
arising from a conversion.
Payment Systems
Apart from credit and debit card
arrangements, the main payment systems
are run by three separate companies
operating under an umbrella organisation,
the Association for Payment Clearing
Services (APACS) (www.apacs.org.uk). One
system, Cheque and Credit Clearing,
covers bulk paper clearings—cheques and
credit transfers. A second, CHAPS
(Clearing House Automated Payment
System), is a nationwide electronic transfer
service dealing with high-value clearings
for real-time gross settlement. A third,
Bankers’ Automated Clearing Services
(BAGS), covers bulk electronic clearing for
direct credits, standing orders and direct
debits. A total of 26 banks and building
societies are members of one or more
clearing companies, while several hundred
others obtain access to APACS clearing
through agency arrangements with one of
the members.

growth in the use of plastic cards (which first
appeared in 1966) and of automated teller
machines (ATMs). According to APACS,
there were around 3.8 billion plastic
transactions in the UK in 2000 when 127
million bank and building society plastic cards
were in circulation, with 90% of adults
holding one or more cards. Most non-regular
payments are still made by cash, but the trend
is away from cash and cheques towards greater
use of plastic cards (see Table 29.3).
Consumers now acquire more than half
their cash through withdrawals from ATMs.
The number of ATMs has risen by three-
quarters in the last ten years, to 34,300 at the
end of 2000. There were 2,027 million cash
withdrawals from ATMs in 2000. About
three-fifths of adults use ATMs regularly,
making on average 68 withdrawals a year.
Direct debit and standing order payments
account for over half of all regular bill
payments, and 73% of adults have set up at
least one direct debit or standing order. Direct
debit payments rose by 8% to reach 2.0 billion
in 2000.
Plastic Cards
The main types of plastic card are debit cards,
credit/charge cards, cash cards and cheque
guarantee cards, although individual cards
frequently cover more than one use. Charge
cards are similar to credit cards, but are
designed to be paid off in full each month and
are usually available only to those with
relatively high income or substantial assets.
Several major retailers issue store cards for use
within their own outlets. Electronic purse
cards are being tested: cards are ‘charged’ with
money from the card holder’s bank account,
and can be used to purchase goods or services
at retailers through electronic tills.
There are about 51 million credit cards
(including charge cards) in use in the UK, and
53% of adults have at least one credit card.
According to the Credit Card Research
Group, credit card expenditure in the UK is a
higher proportion of GDP than in the rest of
the European Union, reflecting the
competitive nature of the UK credit card
market, where consumers can choose between
over 1,300 different brands of card. Most
516
29: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
credit cards are affiliated to one of the two
major international organisations, Visa and
MasterCard. Many new providers have
entered the market and there has been
particularly rapid growth in the number of
‘affinity’ cards, where the card is linked to an
organisation such as a charity or trade union.
Debit cards, where payments are deducted
directly from the purchaser’s bank or building
society account, were first issued in 1987.
Purchases using debit cards are rising rapidly,
with the volume of debit card pay ments up by
13% in 2000. About 50 million cards have
been issued, and around four-fifths of adults
in the UK hold a debit card, often combined
with cheque guarantee and ATM facilities in
a single card.
To tackle the problem of fraud on plastic
cards, which rose by 55% to £293 million in
2000, banks are investing in ‘smart’ cards, in
which information is contained on a microchip
embedded in the card. These are very difficult
to counterfeit and can also store securely much
more information than was previously possible.
National Savings
National Savings (rMPW.natwnalsavings.co.uk),
an executive agency of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, is a source of finance for
government borrowing and offers personal
savers a range of investments. Its operational
services—including its three main sites in
Blackpool, Durham and Glasgow—are now
run under a Public-Private Partnership
agreement with Siemens Business Services.
National Savings retains responsibility for
policy and marketing. Sales of National
Savings products totalled £10.2 billion in
2000—01 and around £62 billion is invested in
National Savings. Premium Bonds are held by
23 million people and are entered in a monthly
draw, with tax-free prizes ranging from £50 to
a single top prize of £1 million. Other savings
products include Savings Certificates (both
Fixed Interest and Index-linked), Pensioners’
Bonds, Children’s Bonus Bonds, a cash mini
ISA (Individual Savings Account—see
p. 521) and Ordinary and Investment
Accounts (where deposits and withdrawals can
be made at post offices).
Friendly Societies
Friendly societies have traditionally been
unincorporated societies of individuals,
offering their members a limited range of
financial and insurance services, such as small-
scale savings products, life insurance and
provision against loss of income through
sickness or unemployment. The Friendly
Societies Act 1992 enabled societies to
incorporate, take on new powers and provide a
wider range of financial services through
subsidiaries. Under the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000, the Government will
remove the remaining restrictions on the
activities of friendly society subsidiaries.
There are around 245 friendly societies,
with total funds of £15 billion and an
estimated membership of over 5 million. The
largest society is the Liverpool Victoria, which
has over 1 million members and manages some
£5 billion of funds.
Credit Unions
Credit unions are mutually owned financial co¬
operatives. They are less widespread in the UK
than in some other countries, but grew rapidly
during the 1990s. There are 688 credit unions
registered in Great Britain, with a membership
of 296,000 and assets of £181 million.
As part of its policy for dealing with financial
exclusion, the Government is introducing a
number of measures designed to help credit
unions by improving the services that they can
offer savers and borrowers. For example, in
April 2001 new regulations took effect to allow
credit unions to make loans for longer periods.
Further measures to relax restrictions on credit
unions are planned. Under the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000, the FSA will
become responsible for regulation. From mid-
2002 a new and more comprehensive regulatory
regime for credit unions will come into effect.
Credit union members will also have some
protection under the new Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (see p. 511) from
around the same time.
Venture Capital
Venture capital companies offer medium- and
long-term equity financing for new and
517
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
developing businesses, management buy-outs
and buy-ins, and company rescues. The UK
sector is the largest and most developed in
Europe. The British Venture Capital
Association (BVCA) (wivw.bvca.co.uk) has 151
full members, which represent a large majority
of private equity and venture capital sources in
the UK. During 2000, according to a report
for the BVCA based on data provided by 96%
of its members, UK venture capital companies
invested a record £8.3 billion worldwide in 1,523
businesses, 5% more than in 1999. Investment
in the UK rose by 3% to £6.4 billion. The
Government is encouraging the further
development of venture capital, particularly for
smaller firms, including new Regional Venture
Capital Funds (see chapter 22).
Other Credit and Financial Services
Finance houses and leasing companies provide
consumer credit, business finance and leasing,
and motor finance. The 100 full members of
the Finance and Leasing Association carried
out new business worth £69 billion in 2000.
Factoring and invoice discounting
comprises a range of financial services,
including credit management and finance in
exchange for outstanding invoices. The
industry provides working capital to more
than 27,000 businesses a year. Member
companies of the Factors & Discounters
Association (www.factors.org.uk) handled
business worth £77 billion in 2000, 18%
higher than in 1999.
INSURANCE
The UK insurance industry is the third largest
in the world and the largest global centre for
international insurance and reinsurance. In
1999 it employed some 359,000 people in
insurance companies, Lloyd’s, insurance
brokers and other related activities,
representing in total over a third of all
employment in financial services. About
50,000 of these jobs are supported by the
London Market, a unique international
wholesale insurance market (see p. 519).
Main Types of Insurance
There are two broad categories of insurance:
long-term (such as life insurance), where
contracts may be for periods of many years;
and general, where contracts are for a year or
less. Most insurance companies reinsure their
risks; this performs an important function in
spreading losses and in helping insurance
companies to manage their businesses.
Long-term Insurance
At the end of 2000, 225 companies were
authorised to handle long-term insurance,
which includes life insurance and pensions,
permanent health insurance, endowment
policies and annuities. As well as providing life
cover, life insurance is a vehicle for saving and
investment as premiums are invested in
securities and other assets. About 58% of
households have life insurance cover. Several
companies are now offering the new stakeholder
pensions which became available from April
2001 (see p. 172). Total long-term insurance
assets under management by companies in 1999
were £1,043 billion on behalf of their worldwide
operations. Total long-term premium income
by companies in 1999 was £106 billion.
General Insurance
General insurance business is undertaken by
insurance companies and by underwriters at
Lloyd’s. It includes fire, accident, general
liability, motor, marine, aviation and other
transport risks. Competition has intensified in
areas like motor and household insurance,
particularly with the growth of insurers
offering telephone-based services. Total
worldwide premium income of members of
the Association of British Insurers (ABI)
(www.abi.org.uk) in 1999 was £33 billion, of
which £23 billion was earned in the UK.
Structure of the Industry
At the end of 2000, 822 companies were
authorised to carry on one or more classes of
insurance business in the UK. About 400
companies belong to the ABI.
The industry, which includes both public
limited companies and mutual institutions
(companies owned by their policyholders), has
seen considerable restructuring in recent
years. The largest insurance group in the UK
518
29: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
is CGNU, formed in 2000 from a merger of
CGU and Norwich Union. It controls over
£200 billion in funds under management and
has more than 25 million customers
worldwide. Standard Life is the largest mutual
insurer in Europe. However, the mutually
owned sector is gradually contracting—
Scottish Widows was acquired by the banking
group Lloyds TSB in 2000, Scottish
Provident was bought by Abbey National in
2001, Scottish Life is being acquired by
another mutual insurer Royal London, and
Friends Provident became a public limited
company in July 2001.
The London Market
1 he London Market is an international
wholesale insurance market-place accepting
risk from around the world. It is the main
centre for world reinsurance business and for
marine, aviation, satellite and other forms of
transport insurance. It consists of insurance
and reinsurance companies, Lloyd’s,
protection and indemnity clubs (originally
created to serve the marine industry) and
brokers. Gross premiums of the London
Market from reported returns were estimated
at £14.2 billion in 1999. Virtually all
companies participating in the company sector
of the London Market are members of the
International Underwriting Association of
London (IUA) (wvpw.iua.co.uk'), which in mid-
2001 had 112 members. Over three-quarters
of the companies operating in the London
Market are overseas-owned. Lloyd’s and the
IUA have set up a joint forum to help update
business procedures, with the aim of ensuring
that London retains its position as the leading
international centre. Working with the
broking community, the forum is taking steps
to streamline processes and increase the use of
e-commerce.
Lloyd’s
Lloyd’s (www.lloydsoflondon.com) is an
incorporated society of private insurers in
London. It is not a company but a market for
insurance administered by the Council of
Lloyd’s and Lloyd’s Regulatory and Market
Boards.
The net premium income of the market in
1998 was £6.03 billion. For 2001 the market
has a total projected allocated capacity of
£11.04 billion, of which some £9.09 billion
will be capacity provided by 894 limited
liability members, representing both
companies and individuals who have
converted to limited liability. The number of
individual ‘Names’—wealthy individuals who
accept insurance risks for their own profit or
loss, with unlimited liability—was 2,852 in
2001. Members underwrite through 108
syndicates. Each syndicate is managed by an
underwriting agent responsible for appointing
a professional underwriter to accept insurance
risks and manage claims on behalf of the
members.
In January 2001 the market was opened up
so that more UK and overseas brokers could
gain direct access, subject to meeting certain
technical and customer service standards.
Around one-sixth of Lloyd’s current work is
in its traditional marine market, and it has a
significant share of the UK motor insurance
market. Lloyd’s is a major insurer of aviation
and satellite risks, and underwrites in other
areas of insurance except long-term life
insurance. Reinsurance constitutes a large part
of Lloyd’s business.
Under the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000, the FSA will have regulatory
oversight of Lloyd’s. The FSA’s primary
concern will be protecting the interests of
Lloyd’s policyholders.
Insurance Brokers and Intermediaries
Medium to large insurance brokers almost
exclusively handle commercial matters, with
the biggest dealing in worldwide risks. Smaller
brokers deal mainly with personal lines, such
as motor, household and holiday insurance, or
specialise in a particular type of commercial
insurance. Some brokers specialise in
reinsurance business. There are also auxiliary
services, such as loss adjusters and actuaries,
and other support services. Under the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the
statutory regime of professional standards
governing insurance brokers was abolished in
April 2001. The sector is now regulated by the
General Insurance Standards Council. For
519
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
intermediaries arranging life insurance
constituting an investment (such as a personal
pension), regulation is by the FSA.
INVESTMENT
The UK has considerable expertise in fund
management, which involves managing funds
on behalf of investors, or advising them how
best to invest their funds. The main types of
investment fund include pension schemes, life
insurance, unit trusts, open-ended investment
companies and investment trusts.
The final report of the Myners review of
institutional investment, published in
March 2001, found that there were a
number of distortions affecting
institutional investment decision-making.
Its central proposal is for a set of clear
principles of investment decision-making,
which would apply to pension funds and,
in due course, other institutional investors.
For example, the principles envisage that
trustees should set out an overall
investment objective for the fund, while
decision-makers should consider a full
range of investment opportunities across
all major asset classes, including private
equity. Other recommendations in the
review include the replacement of the
minimum funding requirement (MFR) for
pension funds, and a legislative change to
raise the duty of care for fund trustees.
The Government is consulting on a
number of the recommendations, and
intends to legislate to replace the MFR
with a long-term scheme-specific funding
standard, with additional protective
measures to protect scheme members.
Pension Funds
Total net assets of UK pension funds were
estimated at about £755 billion at the end of
2000, according to the National Association of
Pension Funds. Pension funds are major
investors in securities markets, holding around
20% of securities listed on the London Stock
Exchange. Funds are managed mainly by the
investment management houses.
Unit Trusts/Open-ended Investment
Companies
Over 1,900 authorised unit trusts and open-
ended investment companies (oeics) pool
investors’ money in funds divided into units
or shares of equal size, enabling people with
relatively small amounts of money to benefit
from diversified and managed portfolios. In
April 2001 total funds under management
were £260 billion, of which £54 billion
represented funds in Personal Equity Plans
and £21 billion in Individual Savings
Accounts (ISAs). Most unit trusts are general
funds, investing in a wide variety of UK or
international securities, but there are also
many specialist funds.
There are over 150 unit trust and oeic
management groups, of which 62 had total
fund values exceeding £1 billion in April
2001. Investment fund management groups
are represented by the Association of Unit
Trusts and Investment Funds (AUTIF)
(wimp, investmentfunds. org.uk).
Oeics are similar to unit trusts, but
investors buy shares in the fund rather than
units. They were set up in 1997 to enable UK
companies to compete on an equal footing
with similar schemes operating elsewhere in
the EU. By April 2001, 549 oeics had been set
up by 51 management groups.
Investment Trusts
Investment trust companies are listed on the
London Stock Exchange and their shares can
be bought and sold in the same way as other
companies. Like unit trusts, they offer the
opportunity to diversify risk on a relatively
small lump-sum investment or through
regular savings. Investment trusts are exempt
from tax on gains realised within the funds
and invest principally in the shares and
securities of other companies. Assets are
purchased mainly out of shareholders’ funds,
although investment trusts are also allowed to
borrow money for investment.
There are about 380 investment trusts,
which form the largest listed sector of the
520
29: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
London Stock Exchange. Around 35% of
their shares by value are held by private
investors. Over 310 listed trust companies are
members of the Association of Investment
Trust Companies (wwjp.aitc.co.uk). At the end
of May 2001 the industry had £11 billion of
assets under management and a stock market
capitalisation of £62 billion.
Share Ownership
Financial institutions hold the bulk of
equities. At the end of 2000 UK financial
institutions held ordinary shares valued at
£855 billion (47% of the total market value of
£1,811 billion), with insurance companies
holding £381 billion and pension funds £321
billion. Holders from outside the UK had
£587 billion (32%). The value of holdings of
UK individual shareholders was £290 billion
(16%). About 26% of households have at least
one adult owning shares (see Table 29.2).
According to ProShare (an independent
organisation encouraging share ownership),
the number of investment clubs—groups of
individuals, usually about 15 to 20 people,
who regularly invest in shares—has risen to
around 10,000. The conversion of a number of
building societies to banks, privatisation,
employee share schemes and measures to
increase tax-free savings have led to increased
share ownership by individuals.
Tax-free Savings
The main method of tax-free saving is now the
Individual Savings Account (ISA). The
Government introduced ISAs in 1999 to help
encourage people to save more and to
distribute the tax relief on savings more fairly.
ISAs succeeded Personal Equity Plans (PEPs),
which allowed tax-free investment in shares,
unit trusts and certain corporate bonds, and
TESSAs (Tax Exempt Special Savings
Accounts).
ISAs are guaranteed to run until at least
April 2009. Until April 2006 each individual
can contribute up to £7,000 a year in total.
There are three main elements of an ISA:
> cash—up to £3,000 each year—such as
in a bank or building society ISA
account;
> stocks and shares—up to £7,000 a year;
and
> life insurance—up to £ 1,000 a year.
In addition, savers can roll over capital from a
matured TESSA into a cash ISA or a special
TESSA-only ISA.
There are two main types of ISA: a maxi
ISA, which can include all three elements in a
single ISA with one manager; and mini ISAs,
which allow savers to have different managers,
for cash, stocks and shares, and life insurance.
Savers can choose to put money into mini ISAs
or a maxi ISA, but not both, in each tax year.
In 2000-01 subscriptions were made to
about 11.3 million ISAs—7.9 million mini
ISAs and 3.4 million maxi ISAs—attracting
£29.8 billion (see Table 29.4 overleaf).
FINANCIAL MARKETS
London Stock Exchange
The London Stock Exchange (www.
londonstockexchange.com) is one of the world’s
leading exchanges. In 2000 turnover in
international equities was £3,520 billion and
in UK equities £1,900 billion, 40% and 35%
higher respectively than in 1999. In mid-2001,
1,882 UK and 482 international companies
were listed on the main market, with a market
capitalisation of £1,700 billion and £3,300
billion respectively. A further 567 companies,
with a total capitalisation of £13.8 billion,
were listed on AIM, the Alternative
Investment Market, primarily for small, young
and growing companies. The ‘techMARK’
market brings together 248 of the listed
companies engaged in technology or related
sectors. In July 2001 shares in the Exchange
became more widely available when it listed
on its own Exchange.
Several other products for raising capital
are handled, including Eurobonds (see p. 522),
warrants, depositary receipts and gilt-edged
stock (see p. 403). The London Stock
Exchange provides a secondary or trading
market where investors can buy or sell gilts.
Each day the CREST computerised
settlement system for shares and other
company securities settles around 230,000
transactions with a value of over £200 billion.

Other Equity Exchanges
Three other markets in the City of London for
trading equities are virt-x, OM London, and
Ofex (a trading facility run by J. P. Jenkins).
Virt-x is a new pan-electronic trading
exchange formed from a merger of the
Tradepoint exchange and the Swiss stock
exchange; it became fully operational in June
2001.
Euromarket
The Euromarket began with Eurodollars—US
dollars lent outside the United States—and
has developed into a major market in a variety
of currencies lent outside their domestic
markets. London is at the centre of the
Euromarket and houses most of the leading
international banks and securities firms. Its
share of trading in the two main types of
international bond—Eurobonds and foreign
bonds—is around 70%. Coredeal, which
started operations in 2000, acts as an exchange
for transactions involving such bonds.
Foreign Exchange Market
A survey by the Bank for International
Settlements in 1998 showed that daily foreign
exchange turnover in the UK was US$637
billion and that London was the world’s
biggest trading centre, with over 30% of
global net daily turnover. Dealing is
conducted through telephone and electronic
links between the banks, other financial
institutions and a number of firms of foreign
exchange brokers which act as intermediaries.
The institutions keep close contact with
financial centres abroad and quote buying and
selling rates throughout the day for both
immediate (‘spot’) and forward transactions in
many currencies. Following the introduction
of the euro in 1999 (see p. 82) and associated
with a number of other factors, including a
move to greater use of multilateral electronic
trading platforms for foreign exchange,
global turnover in a number of currencies fell,
but there are indications that turnover in
London, at least in some of the major firms,
has grown.
LIFFE
The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE)
{rpww.lijfe.com) handles financial derivatives
(including ‘futures’ and ‘options’), which offer
a means of protection against changes in
prices, exchange rates and interest rates. It
also handles trade in commodities, such as
coffee, cocoa and sugar. LIFFE transacts

The Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT)
Machynlleth, Powys. CAT is a working demonstration of
alternative technology. The centre generates its own electricity
and uses alternative sewage systems. Buildings on the site have
the latest developments in energy conservation, such as roof-
mounted solar energy collectors. In 2001 the Centre won the
National Eisteddfod of Wales’ Gold Medal for Architecture
for its new visitor information centre.
CAT is situated on a 40-acre site. Seven acres are open to the
public, who are encouraged to explore ways in which natural
resources can be used more sustainably. Volunteer work
placements, a consultancy service and various courses,
such as the Alternative Building Methods Course, help students
to learn more about environmentally conscious technology.

With a diameter of 15 m, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) is the largest astronomical
telescope in the world capable of operating throughout the millimetre and sub-millimetre
wavebands. The telescope is owned and operated by the UK, Canada and the Netherlands, on behalf
of astronomers worldwide, through the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council’s joint
Astronomy Centre in Hilo, Hawaii. It is situated close to the summit of Mauna Kea, at an altitude of
4,092 m and is named after the 19th century Scottish physicist.
The JCMT is used to study the Solar System, interstellar dust and gas, and distant galaxies. In 1996, the
Sub-millimetre Common-Use Bolometer Array (SCUBA) constructed by the Royal
Observatory, Edinburgh, in collaboration with Queen Mary and Westfield College, London, was
installed on the JCMT. The SCUBA is an extremely
powerful sub-millimetre wave camera (right). Since 1997
it has been taking observations of the Milky Way and
other galaxy and star formations for the astronomical
community. In 2000 the camera obtained the most advanced
map of the Milky Way to date (above). It is the first detailed
map to show all the interstellar gas in the Galactic Centre.
The SCUBA does this by using sub-millimetre wavelengths,
which are tuned to detect the clouds of interstellar gas
and dust where new stars are born.
A more powerful version, SCUBA 2, is currently being
developed in the UK. It is due to be delivered to JCMT
in Hawaii in 2005-06, and will enable increasingly magnified
images to be studied by astronomers.

business by creating a market to trade single
stock futures as soon as US regulations are in
place to permit this.
Other Exchanges
Other important City exchanges include:

Other Services
The distribution of goods, including food and
drink, to their point of sale is a major
economic activity. The large wholesalers and
retailers of food and drink operate extensive
distribution networks, either directly or
through contractors.
WHOLESALING
In 2001 there were over 110,000 enterprises
(see Table 29.5) engaged in wholesaling in the
UK; 25% were sole proprietors and 15%
partnerships. There were over 1.1 million
employee jobs in the UK in this sector in
December 2000 and turnover in 2000
amounted to £358 billion, 9.0% higher than
in 1999.
In the food and drink trade almost all large
retailers have their own buying and central
distribution operations. Many small
wholesalers and independent grocery retailers
belong to voluntary ‘symbol’ groups, which
provide access to central purchasing facilities
and coordinated promotions. This has helped
smaller retailers to remain relatively
competitive; many local and convenience
stores and village shops would not otherwise
be able to stay in business. London’s wholesale
markets play a significant part in the
distribution of fresh foodstuffs. New Covent
Garden at Nine Elms is the main market for
fruit and vegetables, London Central Markets
at Smithfield for meat and Billingsgate at
Canary Wharf for fish.
In April 2000 Co-operative Wholesale
Society (CWS) and Co-operative Retail
Services (CRS) merged; the merged society
was renamed the Co-operative Group (CWS)
in January 2001. As well as food retailing, the
Group’s operations cover funeral businesses,
travel retailing, motor trading, non-food
department stores and a chain of opticians.
The merger created the UK’s largest mutual
retail group, with sales of £3.1 billion in 2000,
over 1,000 stores and 47,000 employees.
The Co-operative Group has been the
principal supplier of goods and services to the
Co-operative Movement—comprising 44
independent retail societies and around 2,340
stores—and was a founder member of the
Co-operative Retail Trading Group (CRTG).
Formed in 1993, the CRTG acts as a central
marketing, buying and distribution
partnership for retail co-operative societies,
and now accounts for around 90% of Co-op
food trade. The Co-op is also one of the
largest co-operative retailers in Europe, with
stores located in most parts of the United
Kingdom. Retail co-operative societies are
voluntary organisations controlled by their

RETAILING
The retail sector accounts for 43% of all
consumer expenditure and employs one in ten
of the workforce. In 2001 there were over
198,000 retail enterprises in the UK (see
Table 29.5); 43% were sole proprietors and
34% partnerships. In December 2000 there
were 2.6 million employee jobs in the UK in
this sector. Total turnover in the retail trade
sector (including repair of personal and
household goods) in 1999 amounted to £208
billion, 4.2% higher than in 1998. Businesses
range from national supermarket and other
retail chains to independent corner grocery
shops, hardware stores, chemists, newsagents
and a host of other types of retailer. The large
multiple retailers have grown considerably,
tending to increase outlet size until relatively
recently and to diversify product ranges.
Some also operate overseas, through either
subsidiaries or franchise agreements. Small
independent retail businesses and co-operative
societies have been in decline for some time.
Sunday trading laws have been relaxed to
allow retailers to open for specified periods on
Sundays. To help their competitive position,
smaller retailers can open for longer hours
than the larger supermarkets and department
stores, which are restricted to six hours,
except in Scotland. Some major supermarket
branches now open for 24 hours, six days
a week.
The volume of retail sales rose by almost
21% between 1995 and 2000 (see Table 29.6).
Growth in non-food stores (28%) has been
higher than predominantly food stores (14%),
with the most significant increase in
household goods stores, 49% higher than
in 1995.
The four biggest supermarket chains (as at
July 2001) by sales value were Tesco (840
stores), J. Sainsbury (440), Asda (246) and
Safeway (nearly 500). They accounted for
65% of total grocery sales, worth £47.3 billion
in 2000. Asda was taken over by US discount
giant Wal-Mart in 1999. Other significant
food retailers are Somerfield, Co-ops,
Marks & Spencer and Morrisons, which,
together with independent food retailers,
account for 35% of grocery sales. Alcoholic

drinks are sold mainly in supermarkets and in
specialist ‘off licences’.
The leading mixed retail chains are found
in high streets nationwide. Competition with
lower-priced outlets and discount chains is
squeezing some of the more traditional
suppliers selling a range of items. Several
chains of DIY (Do-It-Yourself) stores and
superstores cater for people carrying out
repairs and improvements to their own homes
and gardens; they stock tools, decorating and
building materials, kitchen and bathroom
fittings, and garden products. Specialist
shops, such as those selling mobile telephones,
have shown substantial growth.
The large multiple groups have broadened
their range of goods and services. Large food
retailers are also placing greater emphasis on
selling own-label groceries (which in
Sainsbury’s case accounts for 40% of sales)
and environmentally friendly products
(including organic produce), together with
household wares and clothing. In-store
pharmacies, post offices, customer cafeterias
and dry-cleaners are now a feature of large
supermarkets, which also sell newspapers,
magazines, books, audio cassettes, pre¬
recorded videos, compact discs and electrical
goods. ‘Stores within stores’ are common; for
example, sportswear and sports goods retailers
are found in several of the big mixed
department stores. Major supermarket chains
have their own petrol stations at some of their
bigger outlets (see p. 526). Several large
retailers offer personal finance facilities in an
attempt to encourage sales, particularly of
high-value goods, while others have
diversified into financial services. Some
supermarkets now offer banking facilities.
‘Loyalty’ cards were introduced in the mid-
1990s by supermarket and other retail groups,
giving regular customers cash discounts
related to the size of their purchases and
providing the stores with detailed information
on shoppers’ buying habits.
The British Franchise x^ssociation (BFA)
Annual Survey 2001 estimated that there were
665 fully fledged business-format franchises,
with around 35,600 outlets, accounting for
316,000 direct jobs in the UK and with annual
turnover of £9.3 billion. Franchising is the
granting of a licence by one company (the
franchisor) to another (the franchisee), usually
by means of an initial payment with
continuing royalties. Franchised activities
operate in many areas, including cleaning
services, film processing, print shops, fitness
centres, courier delivery, car rental, engine
tuning and servicing, and fast-food retailing.
About 170 franchisors are members of
the BFA.
Vehicle, Vehicle Parts and Petrol Retailing
In December 2000 there were 548,000
employee jobs in the UK in retailing motor
vehicles and parts, and in petrol stations.
Turnover in the motor trades industry in 2000
amounted to £122.0 billion, 0.9% lower than
in 1999 (see Table 29.7).
Most businesses selling new vehicles are
franchised by the motor manufacturers.

Vehicle components are available for sale at
garages which undertake servicing and repair
work and also at retail chains and at
independent retailers. Drive-in fitting centres
sell tyres, exhaust systems, batteries, clutches
and other vehicle parts. There were over
13,000 retail outlets for petrol at the end of
2000, with the top three companies accounting
for about 34% of the total. The number of
petrol stations has declined by about a third
between 1989 and 2000, reflecting intense
competition in the sector, relatively low profit
margins and consolidation among operators.
This is particularly so in rural areas. Petrol
stations have increasingly offered other retail
services, such as shops, car washes and fast-
food outlets, with the aim of increasing
business. Over one-quarter of petrol sold in
the UK comes from supermarket forecourts,
of which there were around 1,040 operating at
the end of 2000.
Shopping Facilities
Government policy is to focus new retail
development in existing centres. This is to
ensure that everyone has easy access to a range
of shops and services, whether or not they
have a car; and to enable businesses of all
types and sizes to prosper. Many smaller
and middle-range retailers traditionally
concentrated in high streets have experienced
high costs, with a result that many have closed
down. The Government aims to revitalise
town centres by focusing new shopping,
leisure and other facilities in these centres.
One of the most significant trends in retailing
has been the spread of superstores, many of
which were built away from urban centres
until recently. Since 1996, social, economic
and environmental considerations have led the
Government and local planning authorities to
limit new retail developments outside town
centres, as these had undermined the vitality
and viability of existing town and district
centres, were not always readily accessible by
those without a car and encouraged greater
car use.
All new retail development requires
planning permission from the local planning
authority, which must consult central
government before granting permission for
most retail developments of 2,500 sq m
(27,000 sq ft) or more. Retailers’ attentions are
now being turned back to town centres,
redeveloping existing stores and building
smaller outlets. Almost 50 new small
(1,000 sq m) stores have been opened by two
of the major supermarket chains so far and up
to 50 smaller (300 sq m) stores are planned.
There are eight regional out-of-town
shopping centres, located at sites offering
good road access and ample parking facilities.
The latest, and likely to be the last such out-
of-town centre, is Bluewater near Dartford,
Kent, which opened in 1999. It is the largest
out-of-town retail development in Europe,
covering 160,000 sq m (1.7 million sq ft). With
320 shops and parking for 13,000 cars, it
attracted 25.3 million shoppers in 2000. The
other out-of-town regional shopping centres
are: the MetroCentre at Gateshead in Tyne
and Wear; Meadowhall near Sheffield;
Trafford Centre in Manchester; Merry Hill at
526
29: FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICE INDUSTRIES
Dudley in the West Midlands; Cribbs
Causeway at Bristol; Lakeside at Thurrock in
Essex; and Braehead, near Glasgow. About
half of total food sales are accounted for by
superstores away from town centres,
compared with a fifth at the beginning of
the 1980s.
Retailers of non-food goods, such as DIY
products, toys, furniture and electrical
appliances, sportswear, and office and
computer products, have also built outlets
away from urban centres. There was a trend
in the 1990s towards grouping retail
warehouses into retail warehouse parks, often
with food and other facilities, although
planning controls now limit approvals for
such developments.
Computers monitor stock levels and record
sales figures through electronic point-of-sale
(EPOS) systems by means of product bar
codes. Techniques such as ‘just-in-time’
ordering, in which products arrive at the store
at the last possible moment before sale, have
become widespread as a result. Electronic data
interchange (EDI) systems enable retailers’
and suppliers’ computers to communicate and
transmit orders and invoices electronically, so
reducing errors and saving time. ‘Superscan’
technology—where customers use an
electronic scanning device to calculate their
own bills—is operational in a number of
supermarkets.
Home Shopping
I raditionally, all kinds of goods and services
have been, and can still be, purchased through
mail-order catalogues. In 1999 sales by direct
and agency mail order totalled £8.15 billion.
The largest-selling items are clothing,
footwear, furniture, household textiles and
domestic electrical appliances. More recently
introduced have been electronic home
shopping, using a television and telephone,
and ‘online’ shopping, where personal
computers are linked to databases—this
‘e-commerce’ is growing rapidly (see
e-commerce essay on p. 536). Supermarkets
are looking closely at different forms of home
shopping (by telephone, fax and Internet)
and delivery.
CONSUMER PROTECTION
The Government aims to maintain and
develop a clear and fair regulatory framework
that gives confidence to consumers and
contributes to business competitiveness. It
works closely with outside bodies that have
expert knowledge of consumer issues to
develop policies and legislation. In 1999 a
White Paper, Modern Markets: Confident
Consumers, set out a range of initiatives to
improve consumer protection. The main
proposals included: a hallmark for consumers
identifying companies signed up to a code of
practice and a digital hallmark for Internet
traders abiding by codes guaranteeing security
of payment and privacy of information;
increased powers to deal with dishonest
traders; new advice networks, including a
consumer ‘gateway’ on the Internet; new
measures to ensure information is accurate,
comprehensive and easy to understand; a
review of consumer protection legislation; and
a review by the Director General of Fair
Trading of his consumer protection functions.
Consumer Legislation
> The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 prohibits
misdescriptions of goods and services,
and enables regulations to be made
requiring information or instructions
relating to goods to be marked on, or to
accompany, the goods or to be included
in advertisements.
> Under the Fair Trading Act 1973, the
Director General of Fair Trading can
recommend legislative or other changes
to stop practices adversely affecting
consumers’ economic interests; to
encourage trade associations to develop
codes of practice promoting consumers’
interests; and to disseminate consumer
information and guidance. The Director
General can also demand assurances as to
future conduct from traders who
persistently breach the law to the
detriment of consumers.
> The Consumer Credit Act 1974 is intended
to protect consumers in their dealings
with credit businesses. Most businesses
527
ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
connected with the consumer credit or
hire industry or which supply ancillary-
credit services—for example, credit
brokers, debt collectors, debt counsellors
and credit reference agencies—require a
consumer credit licence. The Director
General is responsible for administering
the licensing system, including refusing
or revoking licences of those unfit to hold
them. The Director General also has
powers to prohibit unfit people from
carrying out estate agency work; to take
court action to prevent the publication of
misleading advertisements; and to stop
traders using unfair terms in standard
contracts with consumers.
> The Sale of Goods Act 1979 (as amended
in 1994) ensures that consumers are
entitled to receive goods which fit their
description and are of satisfactory
quality.
> The Consumer Protection Act 1987 covers
misleading indications about prices of
goods. The Act also makes it a criminal
offence to supply unsafe products, and
provides product liability rights for
consumers. The regulatory framework to
control product safety is a mixture of
European and UK legislation, voluntary
safety standards and industry codes of
practice. The Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) runs a programme of
safety awareness initiatives. This aims to
reduce accidents by increasing consumer
awareness of potential hazards in the
home and by encouraging consumers to
change their behaviour.1
The marking and accuracy of quantities are
regulated by weights and measures legislation.
Other law provides for the control of medical
products, and certain other substances and
articles, through a system of licences and
certificates. New regulations have been
introduced to strengthen the protection of
consumers from unscrupulous doorstep sellers.
The EU’s consumer programme covers
activities such as health and safety, protection
of the consumer’s economic interests,
1 According to the DTI, there were 3,974 home accident deaths
and 2.8 million injuries in the UK in 1999.
promotion of consumer education and
strengthening the representation of
consumers. The interests of UK consumers on
EU matters are represented by a number of
organisations, including the Consumers’
Association and the National Consumer
Council (see below).
Consumer Advice and Information
Citizens Advice Bureaux in England, Wales
and Northern Ireland handled almost 5.9
million enquiries during 2000-01 (see Table
29.8). Their work is coordinated by a national
association (wwiv.nacab.org.uk) linked to the
bureaux by local and regional committees. In
addition, over 500,000 problems are handled
by Citizens Advice Scotland each year.
Similar assistance is provided by trading
standards and consumer protection
departments of local authorities in Great
Britain and, in some areas, by specialist
consumer advice centres.
The National Consumer Council (www.ncc.
org.uk), a non-departmental public body
which receives much of its funding from the
DTI, gives its view to government, industry
and others on consumer issues. Associate
Councils in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland deal with the particular concerns of
consumers in those countries.

Consumer bodies for privatised utilities
investigate questions of concern to the
consumer. Some trade associations have set up
codes of practice. In addition, several
organisations work to further consumer
interests by representing the consumer’s view
to government, industry and other bodies.
The largest is the Consumers' Association, with
676,000 members in June 2001, funded largely
by subscriptions to Which? and related
magazines.
HOTELS, RESTAURANTS AND
CATERING
The hotel and restaurant trades, which
include public houses (pubs), wine bars and
other licensed bars in addition to all kinds of
businesses offering accommodation and
prepared food, had 1.4 million employee jobs
in the UK in December 2000. Total turnover
in 2000 amounted to £52.6 billion, 2.8%
higher than in 1999. There are estimated to be
some 60,000 hotels and guest houses in the
UK, ranging from major hotel groups to small
guest houses, individually owned. Over 20,400
hotels in the UK were registered with a tourist
board in 2000—offering 884,000 bedspaces—
although this is a fall of 7.5% since 1998.
Holiday centres, including traditional holiday
camps with full board, such as Butlins and
Pontins, self-catering centres and caravan
parks, are run by several companies.
In 2000 there were 45,875 enterprises in the
UK in the licensed restaurant industry
(including fast-food and takeaway outlets), an
increase of 1.7% on 1999, with a total
turnover of £16.1 billion, 6.1% higher than
in 1999. Burger restaurants accounted for
11.2% of the total restaurant market in 2000,
public house restaurants 9.0%, pizza and
pasta restaurants 5.0%, roadside restaurants
4.0%, and chicken restaurants 2.9%.
Turnover at these types of outlet amounted to
£4.8 billion.
Restaurants offer cuisine from virtually
every country in the world, and several of the
highest-quality ones have international
reputations. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Italian,
French and Greek restaurants are among the
most popular. ‘Fast-food’ restaurants are
widespread, many of which are franchised.
They specialise in selling hamburgers,
chicken, pizza and a variety of other foods, to
be eaten on the premises or taken away.
Traditional fish and chip shops are another
main provider of cooked takeaway food.
Sandwich bars are common in towns and
cities, typically in areas with high
concentrations of office workers.
There were an estimated 49,500 pubs in the
UK in 2001, a decline of over 8% since 1990.
They account for 57% of all fully licensed
premises, compared with 65% in 1990.
Turnover was estimated at £14.7 billion in
2000, approaching an annual average of
£300,000 per pub. Pubs sell alcoholic drinks
(beer, wines and spirits) to adults for
consumption on the premises, with non¬
alcoholic (soft) drinks and hot and cold food a
growing part of their trade. Although brewers
still own many of the tightly controlled, and
often branded, pub chains, their share has
declined to less than 25% of UK pubs. Such
pubs either provide managers to run them or
offer tenancy agreements and tend to sell onlv
their own brands of beer, although some also
offer ‘guest’ beers. Multiple pub-owning ‘pub
companies’ and venture capital companies
account for over 40% of the ownership. The
remaining 36% of pubs, called ‘free houses’,
are independently owned and managed—these
frequently serve a variety of different branded
beers. Wine bars are normally smaller than
pubs and tend to specialise in wine and food.
‘Themed’ pubs, for example Irish bars, are
becoming increasingly popular.
TRAVEL AGENTS
Many British holidaymakers travelling
overseas buy ‘package holidays’ from travel
agencies, where the cost covers both transport
and accommodation. According to a MORI
survey in September 2000, the top destination
for British package holidaymakers in the
previous 12 months was Spain and the
Balearics/Canaries with 43% of the total
market, followed by Greece and the Greek
Islands. Long-haul holidays to places like
North America, the Caribbean, Australia and
New Zealand have gained in popularity in
recent years. Some people prefer more
independence, and many travel agents will
make just the travel arrangements.

In 2000 turnover in the travel agency and
tour operator businesses amounted to £16.8
billion, 5.3% higher than in 1999. Around
80% of high street travel agencies are
members of the Association of British 'Travel
Agents (ABTA) (wrprp.abta.com). Although
most are small businesses, a few large firms
have hundreds of branches. The Association’s
over 600 tour operators and 2,300 travel
agency companies have over 7,000 offices and
are responsible for the sale of more than 90%
of UK-sold package holidays. ABTA operates
financial protection schemes to safeguard its
members’ customers and maintains codes of
conduct drawn up with the Office of Fair
Trading. It also offers a free consumer affairs
service to help resolve complaints against
members, and a low-cost independent
arbitration scheme for members’ customers.
The British Incoming Tour Operators
Association (www.bitoa.co.uk) represents the
commercial and political interests of incoming
tour operators and suppliers to the British
inbound tourism industry.
TOURISM AND LEISURE
Tourism is one of the UK’s key long-term
growth sectors, with total spending in 1999
estimated at £64 billion (see Table 29.9). In
Great Britain there were an estimated 2.1
million jobs in tourism and related activities in
March 2001. Some 553,000 were in bars,
public houses and nightclubs; 539,000 in
restaurants and cafes; 383,000 in sport and
other recreational activities; 376,000 in hotels
and other tourist accommodation; 146,000 in
travel agencies and tour operators; and 88,000
in libraries, museums and other cultural
activities. Of the total, around 166,000 were
self-employment jobs. The bulk of tourism
services are provided by some 127,800 mainly
independent small businesses such as hotels
and guest houses, restaurants, holiday
homes, caravan and camping parks. In all
about 7% of small businesses are engaged
in tourism.
The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in
February 2001 (see chapter 26) had a severe
impact on the tourism industry in many parts
of the UK. With large areas of the countryside
in effect out of bounds to visitors, many
holiday bookings and leisure trips were
cancelled. Overseas visitor numbers have been
affected too—they were down an estimated
5.5% in the second quarter of 2001 compared
with a year earlier. It is too early to say what
the overall impact of the outbreak has been on
the economy, but the Government has
estimated that tourist revenue worth over
£5 billion has been lost as a result.
There were an estimated 25.2 million
overseas visits to the UK in 2000, generating
nearly £12.8 billion. The UK’s share of world
tourism earnings reached 4.6% in 2000 and
ranked fifth behind the United States, Italy,
France and Spain. The number of overseas
visitors to the UK fell slightly by 1% (see
Table 29.10) although spending was 2%
higher than in 1999. The number of visitors
from North America rose by 6% but those
from Western Europe fell by 4%. From all
other areas, visitor numbers increased by
5%. Table 29.11 shows that the United States
topped the league of overseas visitors to the
UK. Business travel accounts for about

^4.0 billion, 32% of all overseas tourism
revenue. London’s Heathrow and Gatwick
airports, the seaport of Dover and the Channel
Tunnel are the main points of entry.
Some 54% of overseas tourists spend at
least half of their visit in London, while others
venture further afield to see the many
attractions in the English regions as well as in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Domestic tourism generated £48 billion in
1999. For British residents opting to take their
main holiday in the UK, 23% choose a
traditional seaside destination, such as
Blackpool, Bournemouth, Eastbourne,
Llandudno and resorts in Devon and
Cornwall. Short holiday breaks (up to three
nights), valued at £3.5 billion in 1999, make
up a significant part of the market.
The UK’s historic towns and cities and its
scenic rural and coastal areas continue to have
great appeal for domestic and overseas tourists
alike. Their popularity reflects a growing
interest in British heritage, arts and culture.
There are an estimated 6,100 visitor

attractions in the UK.
These include
museums, art galleries
and historic buildings
and monuments
(together making up
just over half the
total), cathedrals,
gardens, wildlife sites,
country parks, farms,
steam railways, visitor
centres and
workplaces, as well as
leisure parks and other
recreational facilities. Domestic and foreign
tourists play an increasingly important role in
supporting the UK’s national heritage and
creative arts, in addition to the large financial
contribution they make to hotels, restaurants,
cafes and bars, and public transport.
Business travel includes attendance at
conferences, exhibitions, trade fairs and other
business sites. Activity holidays are often based
on walking, canoeing, mountain climbing, or
artistic activities. Youth Hostel Associations
operate a comprehensive network of hostels—
227 in England and Wales, 77 in Scotland and
eight in Northern Ireland—offering young
people and families a range of facilities,
including self-catering.
Theme parks attract over 35 million visitors
a year. Alton Towers (Staffordshire) was the
biggest in terms of visitor numbers in 1999,
and was the top UK attraction charging
admission (see Table 29.12). Attractions in
these parks include spectacular ‘white
knuckle’ rides and overhead cable cars and
railways, while some also feature domesticated
and wild animals. The largest tourist
attraction in 1999 with free admission was
Blackpool Pleasure Beach in Lancashire (see
Table 29.13). The Millennium Dome in
Greenwich, London, attracted just over 6.5
million visitors in the 12 months it was open
in 2000.

contract staff. In December 2000 there were
451,000 employee jobs in the UK in computer
and related activities. Turnover of companies in
this sector amounted to £41.0 billion in 2000,
12.5% higher than in 1999. British firms and
universities have established strong reputations
in software R&D. A number of international
IT conglomerates, such as Microsoft, have set
up R&D operations in the UK. Academic
expertise is especially evident in such areas as
artificial intelligence, neural networks, formal
programming for safety-critical systems, and
parallel programming systems.
Software firms have developed strengths in
sector-specific applications, including systems
for retailing, banking, finance and accounting,
the medical and dental industries, and the
travel and entertainment industries. Specialist
‘niche’ markets in which UK software
producers are active include artificial
intelligence, scientific and engineering
software (especially computer-aided design),
mathematical software, geographical
information systems, and data visualisation
packages. Some firms specialise in
devising multimedia software. Distance
learning, ‘virtual reality’ and computer
animation all benefit from a large pool of
creative talent.
One of the biggest users of software is the
telecommunications industry (see p. 284).

ECONOMIC AFFAIRS
The provision of almost all new
telecommunications services, including
switching and transmission, is dependent on
software.
A special survey by ONS in July 2001
estimated the size of the computer services
market in Great Britain in 2000 as £32.0
billion (including exports). Table 29.15 below
shows a breakdown of the activities. There
was a further £5.4 billion of sales activity in
non-computer (but related) services, the
largest of which were wholesaling or
retailing of goods (£3.1 billion), and
telecommunications services (£1.2 billion).

OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES
In December 2000 a total of 182,000 employee
jobs in Great Britain were in market research,
business and management consultancy
activities, and turnover in 2000 amounted
to £145.8 billion, 5.0% higher than in 1999
(see box on p. 510 for legal services and
accountancy).
Market Research
According to the British Market Research
Association (wwrp.bmra.org.uk), members’
turnover grew by 7.1% in 2000 to an
estimated £1.07 billion, following growth of
9.3% in 1999. UK-owned market research
companies—600 are operating now—include
the largest international customised market
research specialists. The top ten companies by
turnover are shown in Table 29.16 below.

Management Consultancy
The UK’s 40,000 management consultants
supply technical assistance and advice to
business and government clients. In 2000
revenues for the industry were estimated at
over £7 billion, with exports in excess of
£1 billion. The 40 members of the
Management Consultancies Association
(www.mca.org.uk), which accounts for over
half of UK revenues, earned a record income
of £3,721 million, 21% higher than in 1999
(see Table 29.17).
Advertising and Public Relations
The UK is a major centre for creative
advertising, and multinational corporations
often use advertising created in the UK for
marketing their products globally. British
agencies have strong foreign links through
overseas ownership and associate networks.
According to the Advertising Association
(www.adassoc.org.uk), advertising expenditure
in the UK increased by 10.4% to £17 billion
in 2000. The press accounted for 50.6% of the
total, television for 27.3%, direct mail for
12.1%, and posters, transport, commercial
radio, cinema and the Internet for the rest.

The largest advertising expenditure is on
food, household durables, cosmetics, office
equipment, motor vehicles and financial
services. The top ten spenders in 2000 are
shown in Table 29.18. British television
advertising receives many international
awards.
Campaigns are planned by around 1,600
advertising agencies. In addition to their
creative, production and media-buying roles,
some agencies offer integrated marketing
services, including consumer research and
public relations. Many agencies have
sponsorship departments, which arrange for
businesses to sponsor products and events,
including artistic, sporting and charitable
events.
Government advertising campaigns—on
crime prevention, health promotion, armed
services recruitment and so on—are often
organised by COI Communications (see
p. 543), an executive agency of the
Government.
The UK’s public relations industry has
developed rapidly, and there are now many
small specialist firms as well as some quite
large ones. The Public Relations Consultants
Association (tPww.prca.org.uk) represents 80%
of the UK sector, with over 160 member
firms, employing 6,500 people, and generates
over £350 million a year in net fee income.
Business Support Services
One of the major growth areas in the services
sector is in support services, reflecting the
trend among more and more firms to
‘outsource’ non-core operations. Initially,
operating areas that were outsourced or
contracted out were in cleaning, security and
catering. However, firms are now outsourcing
other activities, such as IT and personnel
support services.

E-commerce
Electronic commerce (‘e-commerce’) can
cover trading in any electronic form, but is
particularly used to cover sales and
transactions using the Internet. The impact of
the Internet and e-commerce has been
acknowledged to be considerable, particularly
for the long term, but until recently it has
been difficult to assess its impact accurately as
statistics have been relatively limited.
However, the Office for National Statistics is
now producing statistics on the use of, and
access to, the Internet (see below and p. 286)
and in May 2001 issued the first national
statistics on e-commerce by UK business. The
latter were compiled from a survey of 9,000
businesses with ten or more employees, and
covered a representative sample of most of the
UK economy.
The results of this first survey indicated that
in 2000 there were nearly £57 billion of sales
in the UK made over the Internet,
representing 2% of total sales by the sectors
surveyed. When all electronic networks
(including electronic data interchange and
other computer systems) were taken into
account, sales were almost £162 billion, 5.8%
of sales. The finance and insurance sector had
the largest value of e-commerce sales (an
estimated £43.7 billion),1 followed by the
wholesale, retail, catering and travel sector
(£7.6 billion). Most sales over the Internet
were ‘business to business’, with less than one-
fifth of e-commerce sales being to households.
The survey found that 92% of UK businesses
use personal computers, workstations or
terminals and 63% have access to the Internet,
ranging from 94% of the largest businesses
with over 1,000 employees to 59% of firms
with 10 to 49 employees. Of businesses with
1 As no sales data are held by ONS for much of the financial
sector, ‘turnover’ from administrative sources was used to
supplement the percentages supplied by business and produce
the estimates. Accordingly, the estimates for e-commerce in the
financial sector have to be treated with caution.
Internet access, 57% gain access through
ordinary ‘dial-up’ telephone connections, 39%
enter through high-speed digital (ISDN) lines
and 10% through broadband connections.2
The National Statistics Omnibus Survey,
conducted in July 2001, found that 51% of
adults in Great Britain have accessed the
Internet (see p. 286). Among the activities
undertaken by adults for personal use were
finding information about goods or services
(74% of users); buying or ordering tickets,
goods or services (35%); and personal
banking, financial or investment activities
(27%).
The Government is keen to ensure that the
UK benefits fully from the growth of the
Internet and e-commerce. Its e-commerce
strategy , being taken forward by the Office of
the e-Envoy (within the Cabinet Office), aims
to make the UK a leading e-commerce nation,
ensure universal access to the Internet within
the UK by 2005 and provide all government
services online by the same date; some 40%
were online in February 2001. As part of this
strategy, the Government’s website has been
expanded and was officially relaunched in
February 2001. The site, www.ukonhne.
gov.nk, is a portal for more than 1,000
government department and agency websites,
which together receive over 20 million ‘hits’
a week.
The Government is planning a new regulatory
framework for the electronic communications
sector (see chapter 17). It is also encouraging
broadband access for both individuals and
businesses, and in February 2001 announced a
new £30 million fund over the next three
years to support innovative schemes to meet
local broadband requirements.
2 As some businesses have more than one connection, these do
not total 100%.

The Official Yearbook of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
UK 2002, formerly known as the Britain Yearbook,
is the 53rd edition of an annual publication that
dates back to the 1940s. With its illuminating
mix of descriptive text, statistics, lists, maps,
tables, charts and photographs, this Official
Yearbook is one of the most highly respected
reference works available on the United Kingdom.
It also provides a comprehensive guide to policy
fzf
Edinburgh
in every area of government activity.
As well as covering the economy, social and
cultural affairs, the environment, transport, and foreign
affairs, UK 2002 gives an update on devolution and its
impact on the four constituent parts of the United
Kingdom. In addition, it contains summaries of the
major events, such as the 2001 General Election
and outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, and issues
- such as social exclusion and the direction of
scientific research and developing technologies -
that are shaping British society today.
New to this edition is a series of short essays on subjects that are either of
particular topical interest or straddle more than one sector of social, cultural
and economic life: the 2001 Census; sustainable development; design;
and e-commerce.
